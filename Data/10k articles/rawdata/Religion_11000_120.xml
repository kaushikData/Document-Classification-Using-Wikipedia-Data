The '''1566 celestial phenomenon over Basel''' was a series of mass sightings of [[Celestial event|celestial phenomena]] above [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. The Basel pamphlet of 1566 describes unusual sunrises and sunsets. Celestial phenomena were said to have "fought" together in the form of numerous red and black balls in the sky before the rising sun. The report is discussed among historians and meteorologists. The phenomenon has been interpreted by some ufologists to be a sky battle between unidentified flying objects.&lt;ref name="WJB"&gt;William J. Birnes: ''The Everything UFO Book''. S. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaflet written by historian Samuel Coccius reported it as a religious event.&lt;ref name="UMU"&gt;[http://www.ufo-information.de/images/PDF/Artikel/nuernberg_1561.pdf Ulrich Magin: ''Ein Ufo im Jahr 1561?'' - pdf-Dokument] (deutsch).&lt;/ref&gt; The Basel pamphlet of 1566 is not the only one of its kind. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many leaflets wrote of "miracles" and "sky spectacles".&lt;ref name="WSN"&gt;Wiebke Schwarte: ''Nordlichter''. S. 88-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The event is reported to have taken place in Basel, Switzerland in 1566. According to Samuel Coccius, on 27-28 July and 7 August, many local witnesses in Basel reported seeing three celestial phenomena. The first is described as an unusual sunrise, the second as a total eclipse of the moon with a red sun rising, and the third like a cloud of black spheres in front of the sun.

== The phenomenon described ==
The text of the broadsheet can be translated as giving the following description of the event:

{{quote|It happened in 1566 three times, on 27 and 28 of July, and on August 7, against the sunrise and sunset; we saw strange shapes in the sky above Basel.

During the year 1566, on the 27th of July, after the sun had shone warm on the clear, bright skies, and then around 9 pm, it suddenly took a different shape and color. First, the sun lost all its radiance and luster, and it was no bigger than the full moon, and finally it seemed to weep tears of blood and the air behind him went dark. And he was seen by all the people of the city and countryside.  In much the same way also the moon, which has already been almost full and has shone through the night, assuming an almost blood-red color in the sky. The next day, Sunday, the sun rose at about six o'clock and slept with the same appearance it had when it was lying before. He lit the houses, streets and around as if everything was blood-red and fiery. At the dawn of August 7, we saw large black spheres coming and going with great speed and precipitation before the sun and chattered as if they led a fight. Many of them were fiery red and, soon crumbled and then extinguished.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The '''''Abhidhammattha-sangaha''''' (The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma) is a Pali [[Buddhist]] instructional manual or compendium of the [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] (meta-teaching, higher doctrine) of the [[Theravada]] tradition.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Because of the complexity and volume of the Abhidhamma texts, there arose a need for concise summaries for teaching Abhidhamma to novices. The Sangaha is one such manual from the 11th or 12th century that is widely used as a novice's first Abhidhamma textbook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the ''Abhidhammattha-sangaha'' is one of the most important texts in the Theravada Abhidhamma tradition. Bhikkhu Bodhi writes:

:In nine short chapters occupying about fifty pages in print, the author provides a masterly summary of that abstruse body of Buddhist doctrine called the Abhidhamma. Such is his skill in capturing the essentials of that system, and in arranging them in a format suitable for easy comprehension, that his work has become the standard primer for Abhidhamma studies throughout the Theravada Buddhist countries of South and Southeast Asia. In these countries, particularly in Burma where the study of Abhidhamma is pursued most assiduously, the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is regarded as the indispensable key to unlock this great treasure-store of Buddhist wisdom.&lt;ref name=bhodhi1&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/abhiman.html ''A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
The ''Abhidhammattha-sangaha'' consists of the following chapters:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Chapter I - Compendium of consciousness (citta-sangaha-vibhāgo). Defines and classifies the 89 and 121 cittas or types of consciousness. 
* Chapter II - Compendium of mental factors ([[Mental factors (Buddhism)|cetasika]]) or concomitants of consciousness. This chapter enumerates fifty-two [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] (Pali: cetasikas) or concomitants of consciousness, divided into four classes: universals, occasionals, unwholesome factors, and beautiful factors.&lt;ref name="bhodhi1" /&gt; It also delves into 89 classes of consciousness, the qualities of matter, rebirth, meditative exercises and relationships between phenomena.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;
* Chapter III - Miscellaneous, classifies cittas and cetasikas with respect to six categories: root (hetu), feeling (vedana), function (kicca), door (dvara), object (arammana), and base (vatthu). 
* Chapter IV - Analysis of the [[Cognition|cognitive process]]
* Chapter V - Process-Freed
* Chapter VI - Compendium of Matter (rupa), enumerates and classifies material phenomena and explains their modes of origination.
* Chapter VII - Compendium of Categories. This arranges the dhammas outlined in the previous chapters into four broad headings: a compendium of defilements; a compendium of mixed categories; a compendium of the requisites for enlightenment; a compendium of the whole. 
* Chapter VIII - Compendium Of Relations or Conditionality. It analyzes the relationships between dhammas in terms of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]] as well as the 24 conditional relations outlined in the [[Patthana]].
* Chapter IX - Compendium of meditation subjects, drawing on the [[Visuddhimagga]], deals with the [[Kammaṭṭhāna|forty subjects of meditation]] and the [[Vipassanā-ñāṇa|stages of progress]]. 

==Commentaries==
Because of its short length, this text has been difficult to understand, and therefore various commentaries have been written on it:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi; A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Abhidhammattha-sangaha-Tika'', also known as the Porana-Tika, "the Old Commentary." A 12th century Sri Lankan commentary by an elder named Acariya Navavimalabuddhi.
*''Abhidhammattha-vibhavini-Tika'', written by Acariya Sumangalasami, 12th century. The most famous and widely used commentary.
*[[Ledi Sayadaw]]'s (1846-1923) Paramattha-dipani-tika, which criticizes the ''Vibhavini-tika'' on 325 points and aroused much debate.
*''Ankura-Tika'', by Vimala Sayadaw, defends the opinions of the Vibhavini against Ledi Sayadaw's criticisms.
*''Navanita-Tika,'' by the Indian scholar [[Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi|Dhammananda Kosambi]], 1933. Titled "The Butter Commentary," because it explains the Sangaha in a smooth and simple manner, avoiding philosophical controversy.
*''"A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma"'' by [[Narada Maha Thera|Narada Thera]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[Rewata Dhamma|U Rewata Dhamma]] includes an English language introduction and explanatory commentary as well as numerous tables by [[Silananda|U Silananda]]. It draws from both the ''Vibhavini-Tika'' and the ''Paramattha-dipani-tika,'' focusing on their convergences and complementary contributions instead of their conflicting points. It also draws from the ''[[Visuddhimagga]].''

==Translations==
The Abhidhammatthasangaha was first translated into English by Shwe Zan Aung (between 1895 and 1905), and this was revised and edited by Mrs. C.A.F Rhys Davids and first printed in 1910.

The Sangaha was also translated into English by [[Narada Maha Thera]], with explanatory notes. The American monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] released an updated version with the title "A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma", with explanations of each section by Ven. U [[Rewata Dhamma]] and numerous charts and tables provided by Ven. U Silananada. A supplement to this text is 'Process of Consciousness and Matter by Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma'.

Another translation of the Sangaha by [[Rupert Gethin]] and RP Wijeratne includes the ''Abhidhammattha-vibhavini'' commentary by Sumangala and was published in 2002 by the [[Pali Text Society]].

'''Abhishiktananda''' (30 August 1910, in [[Saint Briac]], [[Brittany]] &amp;ndash; 7 December 1973, in [[Indore]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]) ([[Sanskrit]]:अभिषिक्तानन्द), born '''Henri Le Saux''', was a French monk who, having moved to India in 1948 in search of a more radical form of spiritual life, adopted ''[[sannyasa]]'' in accordance with Indian tradition and became one of the pioneers of Hindu-Christian dialogue. Multiple contacts with prominent saints such as [[Sri Ramana Maharshi]], [[Sri Gnanananda Giri]] and [[Sri H.W.L. Poonja]], led him to profound advaitic experience as well as to final recognition of the truth of ''[[advaita]]'' during the last years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Abhishiktananda at Monastic Interreligious Dialogue http://monasticinterreligiousdialogue.com/index.php/bulletins&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years and Benedictine monastic life (1910–1948)===
Henri Le Saux was born on 30 August 1910 in St Briac, a small town on the north coast of Brittany. He was the first child of Alfred Le Saux and Louise Sonnerfaud, who gave him the names Henri Briac Marie. In 1921 his parents sent him to the minor seminary at Châteaugiron, from which in 1925 he went to the major seminary at Rennes. From his boyhood he had felt a monastic vocation: “''What has drawn me from the beginning and what still leads me on, is the hope of finding there the presence of God more immediately than anywhere else….''”&lt;ref&gt;Letter of December 4, 1982, in Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 19 he was admitted as a postulant to the Benedictine monastery at Sainte-Anne de Kergonan where he spent another nineteen years (with a short break between the years 1939 and 1941 when he was required to participate in the [[World War II]] as a sergeant of the French Army).

The call to India was heard by Le Saux at Kergonan as early as 1934, within five years of entering the monastery. It was closely related to his vocation to a more radical contemplative life that he lacked within the existing framework of western monasticism. He expressed this feeling in his characteristic phrase that became his motto: “''Beyond, always beyond.''”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1947 he wrote to the Bishop of [[Tiruchirappalli]], asking his help in “settling somewhere in the neighborhood of Tiruchi so that, living in some hermitage, he might there lead the contemplative life…in the closest possible conformity with the traditions of Indian sannyasa.”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was eventually replied by a French priest, Jules Monchanin, who had left for India in 1939 at the age of 44. The latter did his best to help Le Saux in arranging his arrival to India. In his correspondence of 7 August 1947, Monchanin advised his future partner: “Learn as much English as you can. You will have no objection to a purely vegetarian diet (essential for the life of a sannyasi). You will need unshakable courage…complete detachment from the things of the West, and a profound love for India….”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sannyasa life (1948–1968)===
Le Saux arrived to [[Colombo]] on 15 August 1948 and a few days later joined Jules Monchanin in [[Kulittalai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]). In January 1949 the two seekers visited the [[ashram]] of one of the greatest sages of modern India, [[Sri Ramana Maharshi]] (1879 – 1950), at the foot of [[Arunachala]] mountain in [[Tiruvannamalai]] (Tamil Nadu). Le Saux's meeting with the sage had a profound effect on his life as he recounted it in his diary: “I consider this stay at Tiruvannamalai as a real retreat and at the same time as an initiation into Hindu monastic life. I want to…enter into the great silence and peace which, as I have read and also been told, is to be found at the ashram….” &lt;ref&gt;Diary, 24 January 1949, in Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''darshana'' of Sri Ramana Maharshi became for him the first introduction into the wisdom of ''advaita'': “In the contemporary Sage of [[Arunachala]] it was the unique Sage of eternal India that appeared to me… it was a call which pierced through everything, rent it in pieces and opened a mighty abyss.” &lt;ref&gt;Abhishiktananda, Swami, ''The Secret of Arunachala'', Delhi (ISPCK), 1979, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Le Saux and Monchanin following their monastic vocation and emerging spiritual ideal, established the Saccidananda Ashram (Shantivanam) on the banks of the holy river [[Kaveri]] (Cauvery), with the aim of allowing monks of different traditions to live together in contemplation, sharing the “''silent communion in the quest of the Unique''”.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Joseph Lemarié (March 18, 1952) in Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Indian tradition they adopted new names for themselves: Le Saux became Abhishikteshvarananda (“Bliss of the Anointed Lord”), later shortened to Abhishiktananda, and Monchanin as Parama Arubi Ananda (“Bliss of the Supreme Formless One”). The daily routine in the ''ashram'' was based on the three ''[[sandhyavandanam]]-s'' (prayers at the meeting points of day and night and at midday), enriched with [[Sanskrit]] and Tamil texts and hymns. Much time was given to spiritual and indological study, although the two monks remained in silence for the greater part of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952 to 1955, Abhishiktananda made several visits to the sacred mountain of Arunachala, of which this account can be found in his book ''The Secret of Arunachala'' (published posthumously in 1975).&lt;ref&gt;See ref. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During these visits he experienced lengthy stays in the mountain’s caves, dedicating most of his time to contemplation. In 1953 he met a well known teacher of ''advaita'', [[Sri H.W.L. Poonja]] (also known later as "Papaji"), who had a deep impact on his spiritual quest. In 1955 in Tirukoilur, his first meeting with the contemporary sage Swami [[Sri Gnanananda Giri]] took place: “I could not resist making the great prostration of our Hindu tradition, and to whom I believe I might give myself over completely…. I now know what India means by the term [[guru]]….”.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Joseph Lemarié (December 24, 1955), in Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Further on Sri Gnanananda became Swamiji’s ''guru'' and his teachings are eloquently described in Swami Abhishiktananda’s publication ''Guru and Disciple'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Abhishiktananda, Swami, ''Gnânânanda. Un maître spirituel du pays tamoul'', Chambéry (Présence), 1970 (in French); Abhishiktananda, Swami, ''Guru and Disciple: an Encounter with Sri Gnanananda, a Contemporary Spiritual Master'', new and enlarged edit.by Swami Atmananda Udasin, pref. by Swami Nityananda Giri, Chennai (Samata Books), 2012 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Gnanananda’s message was focused on the practice of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' (meditation):

{{poemquote|
Return within,
to the place where there is nothing,
and take care that nothing comes in.
Penetrate to the depths of yourself,
to the place where thought no longer exists,
and take care that no thought arises there!

There where nothing exists,
Fullness!
There where nothing is seen,
the Vision of Being!
There where nothing appears any longer,
the sudden appearing of the Self!

''Dhyana'' is this!.&lt;ref&gt;Abhishiktananda Swami, ''Guru and Disciple: an Encounter with Sri Gnanananda, a Contemporary Spiritual Master'', p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abhishiktananda’s deep devotion to the ''guru'' is clearly seen in his letters of that period: “Here for a fortnight with my Guru. I have been totally “caught”…. If that man were to ask me tomorrow to set out on the roads naked and silent like [[Sadasiva Brahmendra]], I would be unable to refuse…. In him I have felt the truth of advaita….”&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Joseph Lemarié (March 14, 1956), in Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s, Abhishiktananda commenced regular pilgrimages to Northern India and in 1968 he left Shantivanam forever having passed it to [[Bede Griffiths]] OSB Cam (1906–1993) for the ongoing development of the ''ashram''.

===Final years and awakening (1968–1973)===

In October 1968, Abhishiktananda settled in a small ''kutiya'' at Gyansu (a kilometre away from Uttarkashi), where he would spend six to eight months in solitude during the years 1969 to 1971. His main purpose was to lead a contemplative life, of which he wrote to a close friend, Odette Baumer-Despeigne: “… To be living here as a rule is going to be a new experience. I can scarcely hope to be that acosmic being of whom I wrote in [[Gangotri]], but at least I might be able to be something of that sort….”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was also participating in a series of interreligious meetings, conferences and study sessions, including participation in the All-India Seminar in [[Bangalore]] (15 May–20 June 1969), etc.

However, one of the main events of his final years was the meeting with a young Frenchman who later became his one true and prominent disciple, Marc Chaduc. Their correspondence commenced in the late 1960s. In one of his first letters Abhishiktananda, replying to Marc’s questions regarding the possibility of a permanent stay in India, states: “…''The essential thing is to penetrate the interior mystery to which India bears witness so intensely…. Without a contemplative sense, to come to India is absolutely useless….''”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.219.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaduc arrived in India on 29 September 1971 at the age of twenty-seven and met Abhishiktananda a few weeks later in Delhi on 21 October. The first ten days spent together in Delhi led to an unparalleled ''guru''-disciple relationship between the two which brought about a revolutionary change in Abhishiktananda’s life: “I have found in him (Chaduc) a truly total disciple. With him and two young Hindus I experience from the other end what the guru is. It is really the chela (disciple) who makes the guru, and you have to have lived it, in order to grasp this relationship “beyond words….”&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Odette Baumer-Despeigne (January 7, 1972), Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; Abhishiktananda subsequently sent Chaduc on a pilgrimage, including to Sri Ramana’s Ashram and Arunachala, where Abhishiktananda had previously encountered a profound spiritual experience: “There is no question that Arunachala is a powerful magnet. How I should like to lead you round from cave to cave….”&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Marc Chaduc (January 14, 1972), Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.261.&lt;/ref&gt; During the last twenty months of his life Abhishiktananda’s ''advaitic'' experience deepened and he realizes the truth of the Upanishads with utter clarity: “The mantra Om Tat Sat sings all day long… That madhu (honey) which everything is to everything else, that constant take-off into the Beyond, the golden Purusha full of glory – you know it so well….”&lt;ref&gt;Letters to Marc Chaduc (January 1973), Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.283.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1973, Abhishiktananda, along with the then President of the [[Divine Life Society]], [[Swami Chidananda Saraswati]], arranged on the banks of the [[Ganga]] in [[Rishikesh]], a very simple rite of ''sannyasa-diksha'' (initiation into ''sannyasa'') for Chaduc, after which he became known as Swami Ajatananda Saraswati. Abhishiktananda was deeply moved by this experience which he considered to be the very culmination of his own life. He had a clearer vision of the fact that the truth is not conditioned by any concepts, myths or symbols and lies beyond them all: “We have to descend into the ultimate depths to recognize that there is no common denominator at the level of ''namarupa'' (name and form). So we should accept ''namarupa'' of the most varied kinds…. We should penetrate the depth of each other’s mystery…. Take off from each of them as from a springboard, towards the bottomless ocean….”&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James, ''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', p.284.&lt;/ref&gt;

His posthumous book, ''The Further Shore'', which he wrote several months before his ''mahasamadhi'', reflects his last experiences and his disciple Swami Ajatananda  draws attention in the book's foreword to the fact that “…nothing that Swamiji wrote had not been lived by him, realized in himself. This is the beauty of his written work, which was the fruit of his silence.” &lt;ref&gt;Abhishiktananda, Swami, ''The Further Shore'', Delhi (ISPCK), 1975, p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 1973, Abhishiktananda was struck by a heart attack that he himself described as a “spiritual awakening”. The remaining several months of his life were spent in a state of bliss and realization, expressed by himself in his writings: “O I have found the Grail…. The quest for the Grail is basically nothing else than the quest for the Self…. It is yourself that you are seeking through everything. And in this quest you are running about everywhere, whereas the Grail is here, close at hand, you only have to open your eyes…. There is only the Awakening.”&lt;ref&gt;Abhishiktananda, Swami, ''Ascent to the Depth of the Heart: The Spiritual Diary'' (1948-1973) of Swami Abhishiktananda, Delhi (ISPCK), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening of 7 December 1973 in [[Indore]], Abhishiktananda underwent another brief heart attack and at about 11 pm he died. His last words were “God’s will be done.”&lt;ref&gt;''Swami Abhishiktananda: His Life Told through his Letters'', Delhi (ISPCK), 2000, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In order to foster the message and the writings of Abhishiktananda through the publication of his books and unpublished manuscripts, [[Raimon Panikkar]], Patrick D'Souza, [[Jacques Dupuis (Jesuit)|Jacques Dupuis]], [[Sita Ram Goel]], [[Ram Swarup]], N. Shanta and James Stuart, founded the Abhishiktananda Society (Delhi) in 1978. The society was dissolved in 2008 after thirty years of contribution to Hindu-Christian dialogue &lt;ref&gt;Swami Atmananda Udasin, ''The Abhishiktananda Society Comes to a Successful Conclusion after Thirty Years of Contribution in Hindu-Christian Dialogue'' (1978-2008).  A Letter from the President, MID Bulletin 80, January 2008. http://abhishiktananda.org.in/html/The_Abhishiktananda_Society.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and the publishing rights for his books in English and various Indian languages, were transferred to the [[Delhi Brotherhood Society]] (DBS). As a result, a new section named the Abhishiktananda Centre for Interreligious Dialogue, was formed to carry on the task of promoting  Abhishiktananda's writings in India and abroad in English. This work is also being continued in the West by the Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (DIMMID), which holds the world rights in all languages with the exception of the English and Indian languages. This centre also stores the Abhishiktananda Archives, where handwritten or typed manuscripts written by Abhishiktananda date between approximately forty to sixty-three years of age. It is planned to digitally scan the archives and make them available under specific conditions for scholars and researchers in India and abroad.

'''Anthony Boucher''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|tʃ|ɚ}}; born '''William Anthony Parker White'''; August 21, 1911 – April 29, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthony Boucher|website=Sf-encyclopedia.com|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/boucher_anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author, critic, and [[Literary editor|editor]], who wrote several classic mystery novels, short stories, science fiction, and [[radio drama]]s. Between 1942 and 1947 he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. In addition to "Anthony Boucher", White also employed the pseudonym "[[H. H. Holmes]]", which was the pseudonym of a late-19th-century American serial killer; Boucher would also write light verse and sign it "Herman W. Mudgett" (another of the murderer's aliases).

In a 1981 poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel ''Nine Times Nine'' was voted as the ninth best [[locked room mystery]] of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysteryfile.com/Locked_Rooms/Library.html |title=A LOCKED ROOM LIBRARY, by John Pugmire |publisher=Mysteryfile.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
White was born in [[Oakland, California]], and went to college at the [[University of Southern California]]. He later received a master's degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

After a friend told him that "William White" was too common a name, he used "H. H. Holmes" to write and review mysteries and "Anthony Boucher" for science fiction.&lt;ref name="pohl196808"&gt;{{Cite magazine

== Fiction writing and editing ==
Boucher (as he was more commonly known) wrote mystery, science fiction, and horror writing. He was also an editor, including science fiction anthologies, and wrote mystery reviews for many years in ''[[The New York Times]]''. He was one of the first English translators of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], translating "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]" for ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''. He helped found the [[Mystery Writers of America]] in 1946 and, in the same year, was one of the first winners of the MWA's [[Edgar Award]] for his mystery reviews in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. He was a founding editor (with [[J. Francis McComas]]) of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' from 1949 to 1958, and attempted to make literary quality an important aspect of science fiction. He won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|Best Professional Magazine]] in 1957 and 1958. Boucher also edited the long-running ''Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction'' anthology series, from 1952 to 1959.&lt;ref name="glxsf58"&gt;{{cite news |first=Floyd C. |last=Gale |authorlink=Floyd C. Gale |title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf |work=[[Galaxy Science Fiction]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1958-09/Galaxy_1958_09#page/n101/mode/2up |date=September 1958 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Boucher's critical writing was also contributing annual summaries of the state of [[speculative fiction]] for [[Judith Merril]]'s ''[[The Year's Best SF]]'' series; as editor, he published the volumes in [[E. P. Dutton]]'s ''[[The Best Detective Stories of the Year]]'' annual volumes published in 1963-1968, succeeding [[Brett Halliday]] and followed, after his death, by [[Allen J. Hubin]] in that task.

Boucher wrote short stories for many  fiction magazines in America, including 
''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]'', ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding]]'', ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'',
''[[Ed McBain's Mystery Book]]'', ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine'', ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', ''[[The Master Detective]]'', ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]'' and ''[[Weird Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Jeffrey Alan |title=Anthony Boucher: A Biobibliography |pages=172–176 |publisher=McFarland |year=2008 |isbn=0-7864-3320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His short story "[[The Quest for Saint Aquin]]" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] as one of the best science fiction short stories of all time. As such, it was published in ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964]]''.

Boucher was the friend and mentor of science-fiction writer [[Philip K. Dick]] and others. His 1942 novel ''[[Rocket to the Morgue]]'', in addition to being a classic [[locked room mystery]], is also something of a ''[[roman à clef]]'' about the [[Southern California]] [[science fiction fandom|science fiction culture]] of the time, featuring thinly veiled versions of personalities such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[aerospace engineering|rocket scientist]]/[[occultist]]/fan [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]].

==Radio==
Boucher also scripted for radio and was involved in many other activities, as described by William F. Nolan in his essay "Who Was Anthony Boucher?":
{{bquote|The 1940s proved to be a very busy and productive decade for Boucher. In 1945 he launched into a spectacular three-year radio career, plotting more than 100 episodes for ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'', while also providing plots for the bulk of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas. By the summer of 1946 he had created his own mystery series for the airwaves, ''[[The Casebook of Gregory Hood]]''. ("I was turning out three scripts each week for as many shows," he stated. "It was a mix of hard work and great fun.")}}

With respect to his scripting of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas, [[Nigel Bruce]], who played Dr. Watson, said that Boucher "had a sound knowledge of Conan Doyle and a great affection for the two characters of Holmes and Watson."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== ''Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' years ==
Boucher left dramatic radio in 1948, "mainly because I was putting in a lot of hours working with [[J. Francis McComas]] in creating what soon became ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction''. We got it off the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved in a lot of other projects, I stayed with ''F&amp;SF'' into 1958."

Throughout his years with the magazine, Boucher was involved in many other projects. He wrote fiction for the SF and mystery markets (primarily short stories). He taught an informal writing class from his home in Berkeley. He continued his Sunday mystery columns for the ''New York Times Book Review'', while also writing crime-fiction reviews for ''[[The New York Herald Tribune]]'' as Holmes (he also reviewed SF and fantasy (as H. H. Holmes) for the ''Herald Tribune'') and functioning as chief critic for ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He edited ''True Crime Detective'', supervised the Mercury Mystery Line and (later) the Dell Great Mystery Library; hosted ''Golden Voices'', his series of historical opera recordings for [[Pacifica Radio]], and served (in 1951) as president of Mystery Writers of America.

As part of his reviews of mystery novels, he published a list of Best Crime Fiction of the Year from 1949 to 1967, listing from 12 to 15 titles each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Anthony+Boucher%27s+Best+Crime+Fiction+of+the+Year |title=Book awards: Anthony Boucher's Best Crime Fiction of the Year |publisher=Library Thing |accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his list as Anthony Boucher.

Boucher was a devoted [[poker]] player, a political activist, a rabid sport fan (football, basketball, track, gymnastics and rugby), an active Sherlockian in [[The Baker Street Irregulars]] and a spirited chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysterynet.com/books/testimony/boucher.shtml |last=Nolan |first=William F. |author-link=William F. Nolan |publisher=Mystery Net |title=Who Was Anthony Boucher? |year=2009 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133708/http://www.mysterynet.com/books/testimony/boucher.shtml |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In the years 1964-65 Boucher worked as a story consultant for the [[Kraft Suspense Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244346/ Anthony Boucher], imdb.com. Retrieved on 15 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Boucher died of lung cancer on April 29, 1968, at the [[Kaiser Foundation Hospital]] in Oakland.

[[Bouchercon]], the "Anthony Boucher Memorial World Mystery Convention," was named in his honor.  Descriptions of those conventions from the first, in 1970, until that in 2004, appear in Marvin Lachman's ''[[The Heirs of Anthony Boucher]]''.

'''Asuras''' ({{lang-sa|असुर}}) are a class of divine beings or power-seeking deities related to the more benevolent [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (also known as Suras) in [[Hindu mythology]]. 

Asuras are sometimes considered nature spirits. They battle constantly with the devas.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 2-6&lt;/ref&gt; Asuras are described in Indian texts as powerful superhuman demigods with good or bad qualities. The good Asuras are called ''[[Adityas]]'' and are led by [[Varuna]], while the malevolent ones are called ''[[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]]'' and are led by [[Vritra]].&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;                                      
In the earliest layer of Vedic texts [[Agni]], [[Indra]] and other gods are also called Asuras, in the sense of them being "lords" of their respective domains, knowledge and abilities. In later Vedic and post-Vedic texts, the benevolent gods are called ''Devas'', while malevolent Asuras compete against these Devas and are considered "enemy of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 5-11, 22, 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;

Asuras are part of Indian mythology along with Devas, [[Yaksha]]s (nature spirits) and [[Rakshasa]]s (ghosts, ogres). Asuras feature in one of many cosmological theories in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Handelman (2013), One God, Two Goddesses, Three Studies of South Indian Cosmology, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004256156}}, pages 23-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719018664}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
Monier-Williams traces the etymological roots of ''Asura'' (असुर) to ''Asu'' (असु), which means life of the spiritual world or departed spirits.&lt;ref name=monier&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary” Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest verses of the [[Samhita]] layer of Vedic texts, the ''Asuras'' are any spiritual, divine beings including those with good or bad intentions, and constructive or destructive inclinations or nature.&lt;ref name=monier/&gt; In later verses of the Samhita layer of Vedic texts, Monier Williams states the ''Asuras'' are "evil spirits, demons and opponents of the gods". Asuras connote the chaos-creating evil, in Hindu and Persian (collectively, [[Aryan]]) mythology about the battle between good and evil.&lt;ref name=monier/&gt;

Bhargava states the word, Asura, including its variants, asurya and asura, occurs "88 times in the Rigveda, 71 times in the singular number, four times in the dual, 10 times in the plural, and three times as the first member of a compound. In this, the feminine form, asuryaa, is included twice. The word, asurya, has been used 19 times as an abstract noun, while the abstract form asuratva occurs 24 times, 22 times in each of the 22 times of one hymn and twice in the other two hymns".&lt;ref&gt;PL Bhargava, ''Vedic Religion and Culture'', South Asia Books, {{ISBN|978-8124600061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asura is used as an adjective meaning "powerful" or "mighty". In the [[Rigveda]], two generous kings, as well as some priests, have been described as asuras. One hymn requests a son who is an asura. In nine hymns, [[Indra]] is described as asura. Five times, he is said to possess asurya, and once he is said to possess asuratva. [[Agni]] has total of 12 asura descriptions, [[Varuna]] has 10, [[Mitra]] has eight, and [[Rudra]] has six. Bhargava gives a count of the word usage for every Vedic deity.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Book 1 of Rig Veda describes [[Savitr]] (Vedic solar deity) as an Asura who is a "kind leader".&lt;ref name= griffith135/&gt;

In later texts, such as the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gier (2000), Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791445280}}, pages 59-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (''daivi sampad'') and the demonic qualities (''asuri sampad'') within each.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple/&gt; The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms "are facets of ordinary lives", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).&lt;ref name=fowlergita&gt;Jeaneane D Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages 253-262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple&gt;Christopher K Chapple (2010), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 610-629&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asko Parpola]] traces the etymological root of ''Asura'' to *asera- of [[Uralic languages]], where it means "lord, prince".&lt;ref name=asko&gt;Asko Parpola (2015), The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0190226923}}, pages 114-116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Scholars have disagreed on the nature and evolution of the ''Asura'' concept in ancient Indian literature. The most widely studied scholarly views on ''Asura'' concept are those of [[Franciscus Bernardus Jacobus Kuiper|FBJ Kuiper]], W Norman Brown, Haug, von Bradke, Otto, Benveniste, Konow, Rajwade, Dandekar, Darmesteter, Bhandarkar and Raja, Banerji-Sastri, Padmanabhayya, Skoeld, SC Roy, [[Ananda kumaraswamy|kumaraswamy]], [[R. Shamasastry|Shamasastry]], Przyluski, Schroeder, Burrows, Hillebrandt, Taraporewala, Lommel, Fausboll, Segerstedt, Thieme, Gerschevitch, Boyce, Macdonnell, [[Hermann Oldenberg]], Geldner, Venkatesvaran, and [[Jan Gonda]].&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 1-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuiper calls ''Asuras'' a special group of gods in one of major Vedic theories of creation of the universe.&lt;ref name=kuiper&gt;FBJ Kuiper (1975), The Basic Concept of Vedic Religion, History of Religion, volume 15, pages 108-112&lt;/ref&gt; Their role changes only during and after the earth, sky and living beings have been created. The sky world becomes that of ''Devas'', the underworld becomes that of ''Asuras''. Deity [[Indra]] is the protagonist of the good and the Devas, while dragon Vrtra who is also one of asuras is the protagonist of the evil.&lt;ref name=kuiper/&gt; During this battle between good and evil, creation and destruction, some powerful Asuras side with the good and are called Devas, other powerful Asuras side with the evil and thereafter called Asuras. This is the first major [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] to emerge in the nature of everything in the Universe.&lt;ref name=kuiper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Hale, in his review, states that Kuiper theory on Asura is plausible but weak because the Vedas never call Vrtra (the central character) an Asura as the texts describe many other powerful beings.&lt;ref name=hale3&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Rigveda never classifies Asura as "group of gods" states Hale, and this is a presumption of Kuiper.&lt;ref name=hale3/&gt;

Many scholars describe Asuras to be "lords" with different specialized knowledge, magical powers and special abilities, which only later choose to deploy these for good, constructive reasons or for evil, destructive reasons. The former become known as Asura in the sense of ''Devas'', the later as Asura in the sense of demons. Kuiper, Brown, Otto and others are in this school; however, none of them provide an explanation and how, when and why Asura came ultimately to mean demon.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 2-4, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Asuras are non-believers of god and believed in their own powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The book of Hindu festivals and ceremonies|last=Bahadur|first=Om Lata|isbn=81-86112-23-5|publisher=UBS Publishers Distributors ltd.|year=1996|location=New Delhi|edition=3rd|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ananda Coomaraswamy suggested that Devas and Asuras can be best understood as [[Twelve Olympians|Angels-Theoi-Gods]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, pages 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coomaraswamy, "the Titan [Asura] is potentially an Angel [Deva], the Angel still by nature a Titan" in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, page 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gier&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76, see also 73-96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Iranian context===
In the 19th century, Haug pioneered the idea that the term ''Asura'' is linguistically related to the [[Ahura]]s of Indo-Iranian people and pre-[[Zoroastrianism]] era. In both religions, Ahura of pre-Zoroastrianism (Asura of Hinduism), Vouruna (Varuna) and Daeva (Deva) are found, but their roles are on opposite sides.&lt;ref name=haleahura/&gt; That is, Ahura evolves to represent the good in pre-[[Zoroastrianism]], while Asura evolves to represent the bad in Vedic religion, while Daeva evolves to represent the bad in pre-[[Zoroastrianism]], while Deva evolves to represent the good in Vedic religion. This contrasting roles have led some scholars to deduce that there may have been wars in proto-Indo-European communities, and their gods and demons evolved to reflect their differences.&lt;ref name=haleahura&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 23-31&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was thoroughly researched and reviewed by Peter von Bradke in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;P von Bradke (1885), Dyaus Asuras, Ahura Mazda und die Asuras, Max Niemeyer, Reprinted as {{ISBN|978-1141632251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between ''ahura''s/''asura''s and ''daeva''s/''deva''s in Indo-Iranian times, was discussed at length by F.B.J. Kuiper.&lt;ref&gt;F.B. J.Kuiper, Ancient Indian Cosmogony, Bombay 1983, {{ISBN|0706913701}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory and other Avesta/Assyrian-driven hypotheses developed over the 20th century, are all now questioned particularly for lack of archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Herrenschmidt|first=Clarisse| last2=Kellens|first2=Jean|chapter=*Daiva| title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=6| year=1993|pages=599–602|publisher=Mazda|location=Costa Mesa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hale|first=Wash Edward|title=ÁSURA in Early Vedic Religion|year=1986|location=Delhi|publisher=Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass|ISBN=8120800613|pages=5–8, 12, 15, 18–19, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asko Parpola has re-opened this debate by presenting archaeological and linguistic evidence, but notes that the links may go earlier to [[Uralic languages]] roots.&lt;ref name=askoahuraasera&gt;Asko Parpola (2015), The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0190226923}}, pages 66-67, 82-109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Germanic deities===
{{main article| Æsir}}
Some scholars such as Asko Parpola suggest that the word ''Asura'' may be related to proto-Uralic and proto-Germanic history. The [[Aesir-Asura correspondence]] is the relation between Vedic Sanskrit ''Asura'' and Old Norse ''[[Æsir]]'' and Proto-Uralic *''asera'', all of which mean 'lord, powerful spirit, god'.&lt;ref name=askoahuraasera/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Adams (1997), King, in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1884964985}}, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; Parpola states that the correspondence extends beyond Asera-Asura, and extends to a host of parallels such as Inmar-Indra, Sampas-Stambha and many other elements of respective mythologies.&lt;ref name=askoahuraasera/&gt;

===Characteristics of Asuras===

A much studied hymn of the Rigveda states ''Devav asura'' (Asuras who have become Devas), and contrasts it with ''Asura adevah'' (Asuras who are not Devas).&lt;ref name=kuiper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 1-2; Note: Hale translates this to "Asuras without the Asura-Devas" in his book, see page 3 for example.;&lt;br&gt;For original Sanskrit, see Rigveda hymns 8.25.4 and 8.96.9 [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेदः_मण्डल_८ Rigveda - Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; Each Asura and Deva emerges from the same father (''Prajapati''), share the same residence (''Loka''), eat together the same food and drinks (''Soma''), and have innate potential, knowledge and special powers in Hindu mythology; the only thing that distinguishes "Asura who become Deva" from "Asura who remain Asura" is intent, action and choices they make in their mythic lives.&lt;ref name=Gier/&gt;&lt;ref name=yves&gt;Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger (1993), Asian Mythologies, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226064567}}, pages 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

"Asuras who remain Asura" share the character of powerful beings obsessed with their craving for ill-gotten ''Soma'' and wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence.&lt;ref name=gierasurach/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray/&gt; Further, when they lose, miss or don't get what they want because they were distracted by their cravings, the "Asuras who remain Asuras" question, challenge and attack the ""Asuras who become Devas" to loot and get a share from what Devas have and they don't, in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref name=gierasurach&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray&gt;Stella Kramrisch and Raymond Burnier (1986), The Hindu Temple, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802230}}, pages 75-78&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two is the source of extensive legends, tales and literature in Hinduism; however, many texts discuss their hostility in neutral terms and without explicit moral connotations or condemnation.&lt;ref name=yves/&gt; Some of these tales are the basis behind major Hindu Epics and annual festivals, such as the story of Asura Ravana and Deva Rama in the [[Ramayana]] and the legend of Asura [[Hiranyakashipu]] and Deva Vishnu as [[Narasimha]],&lt;ref name=yves/&gt; the latter celebrated with the Hindu spring festival of [[Holika]] and [[Holi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (2000), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|978-0877790440}}, page 455&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===

Edelmann and other scholars state that the dualistic concept of Asura and Deva in Hinduism is a form of symbolism found throughout its ancient and medieval literature.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 427-466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris Srinivasan (1997), Many Heads, Arms and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004107588}}, pages 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Upanishad]]s, for example, Devas and Asuras go to Prajāpati to understand what is Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Similar dichotomies are present in the [[Purana]]s literature of Hinduism, where god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as "narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves".&lt;ref name=edelmann14&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 439-441&lt;/ref&gt;

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being.&lt;ref name=edelmann13/&gt; In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as [[Mahabali]] and [[Prahlada]], conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.&lt;ref name=edelmann13&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 440-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asuri==

Asuri is the feminine of an adjective from asura and in later texts means ''belonging to or having to do with demons and spirits''.&lt;ref&gt;American Oriental Society (1852). Proceedings (American Oriental Society) 1874-1893, p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; Asuri parallels Asura in being "powerful beings", and in early Vedic texts includes all goddesses.&lt;ref name="hale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. (1988). Devī-Māhātmya, p.200. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. {{ISBN|8120805577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Asuri also means a [[Rakshasa|Rakshasi]] in Indian texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henk Bodewitz|Bodewitz, H. W.]] (1990).

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
First, before all, the strong-winged Bird was born, thou wast the gall thereof.
Conquered in fight, the '''Asuri''' took then the shape and form of plants.
The Asuri made, first of all, this medicine for leprosy, this banisher of leprosy.
She banished leprosy, and gave one general colour to the skin.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In Book 7, ''Asuri'' is a powerful female with the special knowledge of herbs, who uses that knowledge to seduce Deva [[Indra]] in Atharva Veda. A hymn invokes this special power in ''Asuri'', and this hymn is stipulated for a woman as a charm to win over the lover she wants.&lt;ref name=griffith738/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I dig this Healing Herb that makes my lover look on me and weep,
That bids the parting friend return and kindly greets him as he comes.
This Herb wherewith the '''Asuri''' drew Indra downward from the Gods,
With this same Herb I draw thee close that I may be most dear to thee.

Thou art the peer of Soma, yea, thou art the equal of the Sun,
The peer of all the Gods art thou: therefore we call thee hitherward.
I am the speaker here, not thou: speak thou where the assembly meets.
Thou shalt be mine and only mine, and never mention other dames.

If thou art far away beyond the rivers, far away from men,
This Herb shall seem to bind thee fast and bring thee back my prisoner.

==Hindu mythology==

===Vishnu Purana===
According to the Vishnu Purana, during the [[Samudra manthan]] or "churning of the ocean", the [[daitya]]s came to be known as ''asuras'' because they rejected [[Varuni]], the goddess of ''sura'' "wine", while the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s accepted her and came to be known as suras.&lt;ref name="dalal"&gt;Roshen Dalal (2011). Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide, p.46. Penguin Books India. {{ISBN|0143414216}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=kashyapa+asura+deva+purana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rta-UeueJOWAiQfCr4DwDw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kashyapa%20asura%20deva%20purana&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiva Purana===
Alain Daniélou states that Asuras were initially good, virtuous and powerful in Indian mythology. However, their nature gradually changed and they came to represent evil, vice and abuse of power. In Shiva Purana, they evolved into anti-gods and had to be destroyed because they threatened the gods.&lt;ref name="dalal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain"&gt;Alain Daniélou (1991). ''The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 141–142]. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0892813547}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The asuras (anti-gods) were depicted to have become proud, vain, to have stopped performing sacrifices, to violate sacred laws, not visit holy places, not cleanse themselves from sin, to be envious of devas, torturous of living beings, creating confusion in everything and challenging the devas.&lt;ref name="dalal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt;

Alain Daniélou states that the concept of ''asuras'' evolved with changing socio-political dynamics in ancient India. Asuras gradually assimilated the demons, spirits, and ghosts worshipped by the enemies of Vedic people, and this created the myths of the malevolent ''asuras'' and the ''[[rakshasa]]''. The allusions to the disastrous wars between the ''asuras'' and the ''suras'', found in the Puranas and the epics, may be the conflict faced by people and migrants into ancient India.&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Asura (Buddhism)}}
Asuras (Tib: ''lha ma yin'', Chi: ''Axiuluo'', Jap: ''Ashura'') are a type of supernatural being (anti-gods, demigods or non-god titans) in traditional [[Buddhist cosmology]] and a [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|realm of rebirth]] based on one's [[karma]] in current or past lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C. McClelland|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5675-8|pages=32–34, 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described in Buddhist texts as creatures who live in lower levels of mount Sumeru, obsessed with sensuous aspects of existence, living with jealousy and endlessly engaged in wars against the creatures who are ''Devas'' (gods).&lt;ref name=buswell76/&gt; As Buddhism spread into East Asia, the Asura concept of Indian Buddhism expanded and integrated local pre-existing deities as a part of regional Buddhist pantheon.&lt;ref name=buswell76&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr.|author2=Donald S.

There were said to be at least four ancient Aztec temples at which he was worshiped, the tallest supposedly being over 200 feet tall. The Aztecs prayed to him when there were deaths in water, such as when [[Hernando Cortez]] conquered [[Tenochtitlan]] (the Ancient Aztec capital on a lake, now Mexico City), and the lake was said to be "floating with heads and corpses".

== Development ==
The National Spiritual Assembly of Niger, splitting off from the North West African Assembly, was elected in 1975.&lt;ref name="sum"/&gt;

As part of a sweep across several [[Sub-Saharan]] countries, the Bahá'í Faith was banned in the 1970s in [[Burundi]] (1974), [[Mali]] (1976), [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda|Uganda]] (1977), [[People's Republic of the Congo|Congo]] (1978) and Niger in 1978, during the government established by the military coup of [[Seyni Kountché]].)

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab countries. Since these countries were also by this time providers of development aid, this overt attack on the Baha'is was supported by covert moves such as linking the aid money to a particular country to the action that it took against the Baha'is. This was partially successful and a number of countries did ban the Baha'is for a time. However, the Baha'is were able to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of [[Zionism]] nor [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these countries except Niger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Early period ==

The roots of the Bahá'í Faith in the region go back to the first days of the [[Bábí]] religion in 1844.&lt;ref name="brief" /&gt; Four Babis are known from India in this earliest period — it is not known from what sub-region most of them came from but at least some of them were known as [[Sufi]]s and some termed [[Sayyid]].&lt;ref name="sepher01"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manuchehri | first = Sepehr | editor-last = Walbridge | editor-first = John | title = Historical Accounts of two Indian Babis: Sa'in Hindi and Sayyid Basir Hindi | journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 05 | issue = 02 | pages = | publisher = | location = | date = April 2001 | url =http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol5/hunud.htm | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was Shaykh Sa'id Hindi — one of the [[Letters of the Living]] who was from [[Multan]] then in India.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sepher99"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manuchehri | first = Sepehr | editor-last = Walbridge | editor-first = John | title = The Practice of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) in the Babi and Bahai Religions| journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies| volume = 03| issue = 03| pages = | publisher = | location = | date = September 1999 | url =http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol3/taqiya.htm | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basir-i-Hindi was a member of the Jalalia sect who also converted in this early period from the region which later became Pakistan. After embracing the Babí religion, Hindi set out to Iran but learned that the Báb had been confined to the hills of [[Azerbaijan]] and made his way to Fort Tabarsi where he was one of four Indians listed among the 318 Bábís who fought at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi]].&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="momen99"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = Jamál Effendi and the early spread of the Bahá’í Faith in Asia | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 09 | issue = 1999/2000 | pages = | publisher = Association for Baha'i Studies (English-Speaking Europe) | location = | year = 2000 | url =http://bahai-library.com/bsr/bsr09/9B2_momen_jamal.htm | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that he went to Nur and met Bahá'u'lláh and later moved to [[Luristan]] where he worked in the court of the governor of Luristan, Yaldram Mirza. When the governor learned he was a Babí he was killed.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;

=== Early Bahá'í period ===

During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime, as founder of the Bahá'í Faith, he encouraged some of his followers to move to India.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; After first visiting Mumbai, India, Jamal Effendi visited [[Karachi]] in 1875 on one of his trips to parts of Southern Asia.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt; His trips included [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Jammu]], [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]].&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt; Following the passing of Bahá'u'lláh, the leadership of the religion fell to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and he in turn sent further representatives to the region — followers who travelled to the region included both Persians and Americans and included [[Sydney Sprague]] and Mirza Mahmood Zarghaní.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garlington"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garlington | first = William | editor-last = R.I.

On instructions from `Abdu'l-Bahá, Zarghaní stayed in Lahore for most of 1904 and subsequently travelled to nearby regions.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt; During his stay Zarghaní became acquainted with [[Muhammad Iqbal]]. There is information that an American Bahá'í was in Lahore about 1905; little is known except that he became sick with cholera but recovered under care from a Bahá'í, Mr. Kaikhosru, who came from (then named) Bombay to nurse him but himself died of the disease.&lt;ref name="Root30a"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Miss Martha Root in India | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1930 | issue = 45 | pages = 7–8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Bahá'í to settle in current-day Pakistan may have been Muhammad Raza Shirazi who became a Bahá'í in Bombay in 1908 and settled in Karachi.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt; As early as 1910 the national community in India/Burma was being urged to visibly distinguish itself from Islam by the Bahá'í institutions of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Letter from the House of Spirituality of Bahais, Chicago, Ill., U.

In 1921 the Bahá'ís of Karachi elected their first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;

=== Growth and challenges ===

In 1923, while what is now Pakistan was part of [[British India]], a regional [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was formed for India and Burma -  which then included the area now part of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="notes" /&gt; [[Martha Root]], an American Bahá'í, visited Karachi and Lahore in 1930&lt;ref name="Root30a" /&gt; and again in 1938 when she stayed for three months and supervised the publication of her book titled ''Tahirih — the Pure''.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt; She died about a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Cablegram from Shoghi Effendi | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1939 | issue = 131 | page = 2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'ís of Karachi obtained land for a cemetery in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Letter from the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Karachi | journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1931 | issue = 51 | page = 16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirza Tarazullah Samandari, later appointed as a [[Hand of the Cause]] — a distinguished rank in the religion —, visited the area several times; he first visited the region in 1930, and then again in 1963, 1964, 1966, and in 1993 travelling to many cities. From 1931 to 1933, Professor Pritam Singh, the first Bahá'í from a [[Sikh]] background, settled in Lahore and published an English language weekly called ''The Baha’i Weekly'' and other initiatives. A ''Bahá'í publishing committee'' was established in Karachi in 1935. This body evolved and is registered as the ''Baha’i Publishing Trust'' of Pakistan. In 1937, [[John Esslemont]]'s ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' was translated into [[Urdu]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] in Karachi.&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BNE"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | authorlink = Bahá'í International Community | title = "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" editions and printings held in Bahá'í World Centre Library Decade by decade 1920 -2000+ | work = General Collections | publisher = International Bahá'í Library | date = | url =http://library.bahai.org/gc/bne.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also published scores of Bahá'í books and leaflets in Urdu, English, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], Sindhi, [[Pashto language|Pushtu]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Gojri]], [[Balti language|Balti]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and memorials including those marking the centenaries of the declaration of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="MacEoin3"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis |author2=William Collins | title = Memorials (Listings)| work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/memorials.html | accessdate = 2009-04-06 |at = Entry #45, 56, 95, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Spiritual Assembly of [[Quetta]] was formed in 1943 by Bahá'ís from Mumbai and Iran while the Local Spiritual Assembly of [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] was also formed in 1943 by Bahá'ís from Karachi. A spiritual assembly was elected for the first time in [[Jammu]] in 1946. Bahá'ís from Karachi were among those to help elect the local spiritual assemblies in [[Sukkur]] and [[Rawalpindi]] in 1948. Further local assemblies were formed in [[Sialkot]] in 1949, [[Multan]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Dhaka]] in 1950, [[Faisalabad]] in 1952, [[Sargodha]] in 1955, and [[Abbottabad]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Jahanabad (Karachi)|Jahanabad]], [[Mirpurkhas]], [[Nawabshah]], and [[Sahiwal]] by 1956 thus raising the number of local spiritual assemblies to 20. [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]] spoke at a variety of events in India extending her stay twice to speak at schools – her last public talk was in [[Karachi]] in early 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Memorial Meeting for Dorothy Beecher Baker; Intercontinental Mission | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1954 | issue = 277 | page = 4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a Muslim émigré from near Lahore, Fazel (Frank) Khan, moved to Australia where he was asked to present the teachings of Islam at a Bahá'í school and was so affected by the class that he and his family converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1947.&lt;ref name="yerr"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Yerrinbool Baha'i School 1938 – 1988, An Account of the First Fifty Years | work = Published Articles | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date = | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_yerrinbool_1938-1988  | accessdate = 2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On two later occasions Fazel visited his home village and endeavoured to teach them his new religion.

Plans for an independent national assembly for Pakistan began as early as spring 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Sixteen New National Assemblies by Ridvan, 1957 | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1955 | issue = 291 | pages = 4–5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regional convention in Karachi in 1956 had 17 delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pakistan Regional Convention | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1956 | issue = 291 | page = 12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; With independence from India proceeding, the Bahá'ís of East and West Pakistan elected a separate Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly from India in 1957,&lt;ref name="pk-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bw18"&gt;{{Cite book | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 795–797 | year = 1986 | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/773-800.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1 | author = Universal House of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed by Hand of the Cause Shu'á'u'llah 'Alá'í.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = National Assembly formed in Karachi | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1957 | issue = 318 | pages = 9–10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'ís elected to this first national assembly included Isfandiar Bakhtiari, Chaudhri Abdur Rehman, Faridoon Yazameidi, A.C.

'''Ben Zion Abba Shaul''' ({{lang-he|בן-ציון אבא-שאול}}) (31 July 1924 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1998; on the [[Hebrew calendar]]: 29 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] 5684 &amp;ndash; 19 Tammuz 5758) (first name also spelled '''Ben Sion''') was one of the leading [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[rabbi]]s, [[Torah]] scholars and [[halakha|halakhic]] arbiters of his day, and the [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]] for the last 15 years of his life. He was responsible for a religious revival among Sephardic Jews with his founding of [[Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani]], a network of Torah schools for Sephardic children in Israel, and was widely known for his ability to give blessings that were fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5768/matos.html |title=R' Ben Zion Abba Shaul z"l |work=Hamaayan |date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in Jerusalem to Eliyahu and Benaya Abba Shaul, immigrants from [[Iran]].  A shoemaker by trade, Eliyahu was also a Torah scholar and [[kabbalah|kabbalist]]; he was Ben Zion's first teacher. Eliyahu served as ''gabbai'' (caretaker and fundraiser) for the Ohel Rachel [[synagogue]] in the [[Bukharim]] Quarter of Jerusalem for 50 years. In his old age, his son Ben Zion became the rabbi of the synagogue and another son, Yaakov, became the [[hazzan]].

Abba Shaul was the eldest boy in a family of sixteen children. Despite their poverty, his parents were committed to raising a family of Torah scholars, even as many other families from Oriental and Sephardi backgrounds were lured into sending their children to [[Zionism|Zionist]] schools.&lt;ref name="Torah Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torahcenter.com/bios/bension.htm |last=Friedman |first=D. |title=Chacham Ben Tziyon Abba Shaul zt"l |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704052058/http://www.torahcenter.com/bios/bension.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family kept many [[halakha|halakhic]] stringencies, including grinding and baking their own [[matzo]]t before [[Passover]] and avoiding all processed foods &amp;mdash; even sugar &amp;mdash; during the holiday itself. Abba Shaul continued to keep these stringencies even after he established his own family.&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, Rabbi David (2002). ''Hacham Ben Sion Abba Shaul''. Printed in ''Torah Leaders: A treasury of biographical sketches''. Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, pp. 178-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 11, Abba Shaul entered Porat Yosef, the pre-eminent Sephardic yeshiva in Jerusalem. His first teacher was Rabbi [[Yehuda Tzadka]] (who was only 21 at the time) and his classmates included the future [[Chief Rabbi]] of Israel, Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]]. Later, Abba Shaul advanced to the highest ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi [[Ezra Attiya]], with whom he developed a close bond. Abba Shaul abided by his rosh yeshiva's opinions on all matters and displayed the same approach to learning and to issuing halakhic directives as his mentor.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

==Torah scholar==
Abba Shaul displayed great dedication to Torah study. He learned and reviewed each subject dozens of times until he knew most of ''[[Talmud|Shas]]'' and ''poskim'' (halakhic commentaries) by heart.

When Abba Shaul was 20 years old, Attiya selected him to be tested by Rabbi [[Eliezer Silver]], a prominent American rabbi who was visiting Israel together with a prospective donor. Attiya had heard that in another yeshiva which this philanthropist had visited, only one boy was able to answer the rabbi's question, and only after 20 minutes. Silver asked Abba Shaul a difficult question in the obscure Talmudic order of [[Tohorot]] (laws of ritual purity). When Abba Shaul gave his answer, Silver remarked in astonishment that he had asked the same question of Rabbi [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] (author of ''Ohr Sameach'' and ''Meschech Chochma'') 40 years earlier, and that that sage had given the same answer. Abba Shaul later confided to Attiya that he had had a second answer to the question as well, but since the first answer secured the donation, he didn't want to show off.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

In 1948, Abba Shaul married Hadassah, the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Shaharbani, a Torah scholar and son of the kabbalist Rabbi Yehoshua Shaharbani, who was a student of the [[Ben Ish Chai]]. Abba Shaul studied one-on-one with his father-in-law, and his new wife attended his public lectures every Shabbat. She also tape-recorded his general lecture at the yeshiva; many of his written works come from those tapes.

The couple was childless for many years. After ten miscarriages, Abba Shaul visited the [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz|Chazon Ish]] and the [[Aharon Rokeach|Belzer Rebbe]], refusing to leave until each gave him a blessing for a child.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; Their only son, Eliyahu, was named after Abba Shaul's father.

After his marriage, Abba Shaul became a teacher at [[Talmud Torah]] Bnei Zion, which he had attended in his youth. He continued to study at Porat Yosef Yeshiva. In time, Attiya asked him to serve as rosh yeshiva, but he refused to accept that position as long as his first teacher, Tzadka, was still alive. He did agree to serve as a lecturer at the yeshiva.&lt;ref name="Torah Center"/&gt; After Tzadka's death in 1983, Abba Shaul acceded to the position of rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef.

==Rosh yeshiva==
In his capacity as rosh yeshiva, Abba Shaul maintained a heavy teaching schedule. For four hours each morning, he lectured to students in the yeshiva; in the afternoons, he taught the laws of [[Shulchan Aruch]] to ''dayanim'' (rabbinical judges). On Friday afternoons, he gave a ''[[halakha]]'' class and question-and-answer session to a packed audience in the Ohel Rachel synagogue, and on [[Shabbat]] day he delivered a three-hour discourse in the synagogue.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; His diligence in Torah study was legendary; it is said that when he finished delivering a ''shiur'', he was soaked with perspiration.

Abba Shaul was also well-versed in [[kabbalah]]. At first he learned privately on Friday nights. In the 1960s, however, seeing that the knowledge of kabbalah study was waning, he gathered a group of kabbalists and founded the Emet VeShalom Yeshiva for learning kabbalah at night. Once a year, on the [[Bereavement in Judaism|yahrtzeit]] of the [[Shalom Sharabi|Rashash]], he joined the group and showed his fluency in this esoteric wisdom.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

He also penned thousands of [[halakha|halakhic]] [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]] in response to queries from the public at large, covering a broad range of topics. Some of his responsa are printed in his ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]'', ''She'eilot U'Teshuvot Ohr LeZion'', and he is quoted in the responsa of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, who remained his good friend.

==Communal activities==
Abba Shaul cared about his students as a father for his sons. He tried to make sure that all his students married; his rebbetzin would suggest shidduchim from the many girls who helped her in her house.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; Seeing that married students were unable to manage on a [[kollel]] stipend, he established a special Friday kollel and traveled to the United States to raise money for it.

Abba Shaul helped to launch a religious revival among Sephardi Jews in Israel as the founder of Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani, a network of Sephardi schools which is the equivalent of [[Chinuch Atzmai]]. He promised to fund the first year of operation for any Talmud Torah that was opened in a city that did not already have one. He also worked to strengthen Sephardi communities in other countries. He traveled to England, France, Italy, Iran, Mexico, Panama, Colombia and the United States to establish [[beth din|rabbinical courts]] and to arrange for ''[[Shechita|shochtim]]'' (ritual slaughterers), ''[[mohel]]im'' (ritual circumcisers), and rabbis.

Abba Shaul joined other Torah leaders in Israel to fight against edicts that threatened the Torah way of life. These included the battle to preserve the sanctity of Shabbat, the fight to close mixed-sex swimming pools, and the battle against [[autopsy|autopsies]] for religious individuals.

In 1972, he assumed a prominent stand in opposition to the government's proposal of mandatory army service for girls. Together with Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, he drafted a halakhic ruling which stated that mandatory army service for girls was in the category of ''yehareg ve'al yaavor'' ("be killed and do not transgress"). The text of his ruling was signed by 400 Torah leaders throughout Israel.

==Giver of blessings==
He was also known for giving blessings that were fulfilled. Once a woman who had had three [[Caesarean section]]s was told that her next child would be born by Caesarean as well. She went to Abba Shaul and demanded, "I won't leave until the Rav guarantees me that I'll have a natural birth." He agreed. After the woman left, Abba Shaul's brother asked him, "How can you guarantee that?"

"I can't guarantee anything," he replied, "but what should I do? She wouldn't leave!"

Sure enough, the woman had a natural birth. When her husband came to the synagogue to announce the "miracle," Abba Shaul complained, "They are making me into an [[Admor]]!"&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

When his ''shamash'' (assistant) asked him why his blessings were always effective, he replied, "If you love everyone in Klal Yisrael, you can do it, too." To someone else, he explained, "God told Abraham, 'I will bless those who bless you.' When people come to me, they kiss my hand. They are blessing me. If someone blesses a Jew, they are blessed in return."

==Illness and death==
In 1983, while delivering a eulogy at the funeral of Rabbi [[Yaakov Mutzafi]], he suddenly felt ill and suffered a stroke a short while later. Half his body was paralyzed and his speech was slurred. Over the next 15 years, he suffered a series of mini-strokes that eventually made him a wheelchair user. Nevertheless, he continued to teach Torah and to involve himself in community affairs.

His vast knowledge from years of learning became evident in his later years. As his eyesight dimmed, he asked students to come and to read the Talmud to him. One boy recalled being corrected on a [[Rashi]] in the tractate of [[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]]; another on a [[Tosafot]] in [[Nashim#Gittin ("Bills of Divorce")|Gittin]]. His son said that Abba Shaul corrected him while he read the words of the [[Maimonides|Rambam]] to him.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

He died in Jerusalem on 13 July 1998 (19 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] 5758). An estimated 200,000 people of all denominations &amp;mdash; Sephardic, [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], [[Ashkenazic Judaism|Ashkenazic]] &amp;mdash; attended his funeral.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; He and his wife are buried in the [[Sanhedria Cemetery]] in Jerusalem.

He is survived by his only son, Eliyahu, who is rosh yeshiva of Ohr LeZion Yeshiva in Jerusalem.

'''Bhagat Puran Singh''' (4 June 1904 – 5 August 1992) was born in Rajewal ([[Rohno]]) [[Ludhiana]] district, [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. Born into a [[Hindu]] family, he was given the name  Ramji Das as a child. Later, while still a child, he chose to become a [[Sikh]]. Though he never finished his basic schooling, he became a writer, a (self) publisher, an environmentalist, and a [[philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He is perhaps best remembered for the home he founded in [[Amritsar]], [[India]], named [[Pingalwara]], a home which long after his death, is still tending to the castaways of society: the sick, disabled and abandoned forlorn people.

As a young man he decided to dedicate his life to the 'selfless service of [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]]'. He founded Pingalwara in 1947 with only a few patients, the neglected and rejected of the streets of Amritsar. An early advocate of what we today refer to as the 'Green Revolution', Bhagat Puran Singh was spreading [[awareness]] about environmental pollution, and increasing [[soil erosion]] long before such ideas became popular. Pamphlets with his writings on various subjects, such as environmental awareness, were printed on re-used paper and freely distributed.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;ਪਿੰਗਲਵਾੜੇ ਦੀ ਵਿਥਿਆ, All India Pingalwara Charitable Society(regd.), Amritsar&lt;/ref&gt;

He was honoured in 1981 by the [[Government of India]] with the [[Padma Shri]] award, given for exceptional and distinguished service in any field. (See [[List of Padma Shri award recipients (1980–89)]])  He was among the citizens of India who returned their awards and medals after the [[Operation Blue Star|Indian army's attack]] on the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in 1984. He died on 5 August 1992 in [[Amritsar]].

==Early days==
After the death of his father, his mother encouraged him to finish the matric level of education, which would allow him to fill a Government job. His mother worked as a domestic help in the house of a doctor at Montgomery ([[Sahiwal]]), in part to earn the money for her son's education. Later, she moved to [[Lahore]] where she cleaned utensils in households. Puran Singh was sent to a hostel where he was sent ten rupees every month by his mother.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

Unfortunately, he failed his class tenth examination. Later, he was called back to [[Lahore]] and admitted in a local school, but he was not interested in studying his course books, which he felt were filled with hypothetical and theoretical knowledge with absolutely no connection or applications to everyday life. He, however, would spend hours browsing books in the Dyal Singh Library, trying to gain as much knowledge as he could.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Service to humanity==
While in [[Lahore]], he would often visit the [[Gurdwara]] Dehra Sahib, where he would provide water for the visitors to the gurdwara to do the necessary cleaning before entry, and help in managing the cattle that provided milk for the Gurudwara's [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]], the common kitchen, in which he helped by cleaning the utensils, making roti or distributing food to the sangat (people coming to the Gurdwara). He even cleaned the floor of the Gurudwara in the evening.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

One day, someone fell from the roof of the Gurdwara and was badly injured. Bhagat Puran Singh immediately rushed him to the local 'Mu Hospital'. Experiencing inner joy after helping the patient, he took a man with badly bleeding leg, full of vermin, to a hospital where he expressed his thanks to Ramjidas telling him, "Son! Now I can die a peaceful death." With this incident, the service of humanity became the mission of his life. Now he would wander here and there finding the injured, physically handicapped persons, taking them to the hospital. He also took care of them as his pocket and capability allowed. Once, he even washed the clothes of an old, poor beggar who was suffering from diarrhoea.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

On a moonless night in 1934, someone left a four-year-old child, a boy stricken with leprosy at the door of Gurdwara Dehra Sahib. After performing prayers for the child's wellbeing, the then Head Granthi of the Gurudwara, Jathedar Acchar Singh, handed him over to Ramjidas, who named the boy Piara Singh.  Rather than handing the child over to a centre for lepers, if any existed, Bhagat Puran Singh decided to care for and raise him himself. This incident was to completely transform the face of his life.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

After the partition of India in 1947, Bhagat Puran Singh reached a refugee camp in [[Amritsar]] which housed over 25 000 refugees with just 5 annas(0.3 rupees) in his pocket. A large number of refugees were critically wounded and incapable of nursing themselves. The government didn't make any arrangements to take care of these refugees. Bhagat Puran Singh took the initiative, he took some chloroform and turpentine oil and started treating the wounds of these refugees. He would often go in the nearby colonies to get food for the hungry and medicine for the ill.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

Bhagat Puran Singh was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1991, for his selfless work, feeding, clothing, and tending sick and dying people.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Later days==
From 1947 till 1958, Bhagat Puran Singh did not get a permanent dwelling. He could be seen outside the chief Khalsa Diwan, post offices, railway stations or under the tree outside the office of the Civil Surgeon. He would wander in the streets, asking for donations to help the needy. Some people offered to help him, but most of the others kept themselves from donating towards the noble needy. But at that time only one person stand with him to serve humanity whose name was des Raj bindra. 

At last, he and des Raj bindra founded 'The All India Pingalwara Charitable Society' whose annual budget at that time was 12.5&amp;nbsp;million rupees and got it registered.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; Even today, this institution, headquartered at Tehsilpura, [[Grand Trunk road]], [[Amritsar]], works for helping the poor, the diseased and the physically and mentally handicapped. He died in 1992.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Religion==
Born to a Hindu father and Hindu mother who named him ''Ram ji dass'', he embraced [[Sikhism]] and took up the name Puran Singh. He was greatly inspired by the teachings of [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] and the [[Sikh Gurus]].{{fact|date=January 2017}}

Bhagat Puran Singh, was born a [[Hindu]], though he realised [[Sikhism]] via a simple observation. Whilst he was a child his family used to travel, from village to village. They took up residence in Mandirs (Hindu temples) and [[Gurdwara]]s ([[Sikh]] temples) in each village. In the Mandir, the high-caste priest (Brahman) ordered him to clean the temple, whilst the priest ate food in front of him without offering any. Whilst in the [[Gurdwara]], the priest (Giani) gave the boy (Puran Singh) food without asking for anything in return. It is these subtle observations that changed his life.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Other contributions==
He was a mature environmentalist and [[visionary]]. He initiated tree plantation drives, organised talks and lectures on various issues concerning the environment and social life, and also wrote a large number of books regarding the same. Some of his famous works include "Education of man","Righteousness alone exalts a nation","Plant or Perish", "The Way," "The Increasing Population", and many others. Along with Davinderpal Sandhu, he founded [[Spring Dale Senior School]] in 1980.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

He distributed free pamphlets and books to make the people aware of the impending dangers to the environment and society through the Pingalwara Society.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

{{Black Hebrews}}
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}
'''Black Hebrew Israelites''' (also called '''Black Hebrews''', '''African Hebrew Israelites''', and '''Hebrew Israelites''') are groups of [[Black Americans]] who [[Groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|believe that they are descendants]] of the ancient [[Israelites]]. Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of both [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].  With the exception of a small number of individuals who have formally [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], they are not [[Who is a Jew?|recognized as Jew]]s by the greater Jewish community. Many choose to identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than [[Jews]] in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Jochannan, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/blackjews.html |title=The Black Jewish or Hebrew Israelite Community |accessdate=December 15, 2007 |last=Ben Levy |first=Sholomo |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Johannes P.

At the end of the 19th century, Frank Cherry and [[William Saunders Crowdy]] both claimed that African Americans are descendants of the [[Hebrews]] in the [[Bible]]; Cherry established the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations in 1886 and Crowdy founded the [[Church of God and Saints of Christ]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Dawn|title=Antiquity and Social Reform: Religious Experience in the Unification Church, Feminist Wicca and Nation of Yahweh|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443823081|page=139|quote=The first was the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations founded by F.S.

== Overview ==
Traditionally, [[Black Christians]] in the United States have identified themselves spiritually with the [[Israelites]]. In the late 19th century, some of them also began to claim that they were the biological descendants of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Chireau, pp. 18, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial discrimination]]. For African-Americans, appropriating [[Jewish history]] was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.&lt;ref&gt;Bruder, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are found in Frank Cherry and [[William Saunders Crowdy]], who both claimed that they had revelations in which they believed that God told them that African Americans are descendants of the [[Hebrews]] in the [[Christian Bible]]; Cherry established the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations in 1886 and Crowdy founded the [[Church of God and Saints of Christ]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernheimer2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IVSigler2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSP1975"/&gt; The Church of God and Saints of Christ, originating in Kansas, retained elements of a messianic connection to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Chireau21&gt;Chireau, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, and some of them had no connection to [[Christianity]]. After [[World War I]], for example, [[Wentworth Arthur Matthew]], an immigrant from [[Saint Kitts]], founded another Black Hebrew congregation in [[Harlem]], claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the [[Commandment Keepers]] of the Living God.&lt;ref name="NYT090402"&gt;{{cite news |first=Zev |last=Chafets |authorlink=Ze'ev Chafets |title=Obama's Rabbi |date=April 5, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05rabbi-t.html |work =[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure similar to that of the [[Black church]].&lt;ref name=Chireau21/&gt; He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to [[Brooklyn]], where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.

The beliefs and practices of Black Hebrew groups vary considerably. The differences are so great that historian [[James Tinney]] has suggested the classification of the organizations into three groups:&lt;ref name=Tinney/&gt;
* Black Jews, who maintain a Christological perspective and adopt Jewish rituals.
* Black Hebrews, who are more traditional in their practice of Judaism.
* Black Israelites, who are most [[Black nationalism|nationalistic]] and furthest from traditional Judaism.&lt;ref name=Tinney&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tinney |first=James |authorlink=James Tinney |date=December 7, 1973 |title=Black Jews: A House Divided |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=52–54 }}, cited at Chireau, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Hebrew organizations have certain common characteristics. [[Anthropologist]] James E. Landing, author of ''Black Judaism'', distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement, which he refers to as Black Judaism, from normative Judaism practiced by people who are Black ("black Judaism"). Significantly, it does not depend on a documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor does it require recognized [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] conversions:

{{quote|Black Judaism is ... a form of institutionalized (congregational) religious expression in which black persons identify themselves as Jews, Israelites, or Hebrews ... in a manner that seems unacceptable to the "whites" of the world's Jewish community, primarily because Jews take issue with the various justifications set forth by Black Jews in establishing this identity. Thus "Black Judaism," as defined here, stands distinctly apart from "black Judaism," or that Judaic expression found among black persons that would be acceptable to the world's Jewish community, such as conversion or birth from a recognized Jewish mother. "Black Judaism" has been a social movement; "black Judaism" has been an isolated social phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Landing10&gt;Landing, p. 10, quoted in Isaac, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Landing's definition, and its underlying assumptions about [[Race (human classification)|race]] and normative Judaism, have been criticized.&lt;ref name=Isaac&gt;Isaac, pp. 512–542.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups ==
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established.&lt;ref name=Chireau21/&gt; In Harlem alone, at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931.&lt;ref name=Parfitt96&gt;Parfitt, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group&lt;ref name=Singer57/&gt; and the [[Church of God and Saints of Christ]] is one of the largest Black Hebrew organizations.&lt;ref name="Africana"/&gt; The [[Commandment Keepers]], founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism.&lt;ref name=Moses537/&gt; The [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] are widely known for having moved from the United States, primarily [[Chicago]], to [[Israel]] in the late-20th century.&lt;ref name=Shipler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haas/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt;

=== Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations ===
The oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations.&lt;ref name=Singer57&gt;Singer, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chireau3031&gt;Chireau, pp. 30–31. "The founding dates of the earliest black-Jewish congregations are in dispute. Shapiro notes that F.S. Cherry's Church of God was organized in Tennessee in 1886, but other sources do not confirm this date. Another group, the Moorish Zion Temple, founded in 1899 by a Rabbi Richlieu of Brooklyn, New York, was one of the earliest black Jewish congregations that did not combine Jewish and Christian beliefs, as did the Church of God and the Saints of Christ."&lt;/ref&gt; The group was founded by F. S. Cherry in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], in 1886, and it later moved to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Singer57-58"&gt;Singer, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the [[Bible]] — including the [[New Testament]] — and the [[Talmud]] as essential scriptures.&lt;ref name=Fauset34&gt;Fauset, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rituals of Cherry's flock incorporated many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions.&lt;ref name="Fauset36-40"&gt;Fauset, pp. 36–40.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during prayer the men wore [[Kippah|skullcaps]] and congregants [[Mizrah|faced east]]. In addition, members of the Church were not permitted to eat [[pork]].&lt;ref name="Fauset36-40"/&gt; Prayers were accompanied by musical instruments and [[Gospel music|gospel singing]].&lt;ref name="Fauset36-37"&gt;Fauset, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; After Cherry's death, members of the church believed that he had left temporarily and would soon reappear in spirit in order to lead the church through his son.&lt;ref name="Africana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hudson |first=Peter |editor=[[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] |editor2=[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience]] |title=Black Jews |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |pages=1050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]], in 1896 by African-American [[William Saunders Crowdy]].&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brown.edu/Students/INDY/archives/2005-09-29/articles/arts-fox_israelite.php |title=Sons of Abraham |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |last=Fox |first=Andrew |date=September 29, 2005 |work=[[The College Hill Independent]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310213246/http://www.brown.edu/Students/INDY/archives/2005-09-29/articles/arts-fox_israelite.php |archivedate=March 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1903. After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in [[Belleville, Virginia|Belleville]], [[Virginia]], in 1921.&lt;ref name="Wynia31-34"&gt;Wynia, pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the Church of God and Saints of Christ had more than 200 "tabernacles" (congregations) and 37,000 members.&lt;ref name="Africana"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wynia&gt;Wynia, n.p. &lt;!--introduction--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Z.

They also consider William Saunders Crowdy, their founder in Kansas, to be a prophet.&lt;ref name="gallagher"&gt;Gallagher, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals from both Judaism and Christianity. They have adopted rites drawn from both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. Its Old Testament observances include the use of the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]], the celebration of [[Passover]], the [[Brit milah|circumcision]] of infant males, the commemoration of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] on [[Saturday]], and the wearing of [[Kippah|yarmulkes]]. Its New Testament rites include [[baptism]] (immersion) and [[footwashing]], both of which have Old Testament origins.&lt;ref name=Kidd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer59/&gt;

=== Commandment Keepers ===
{{Main|Commandment Keepers}}
[[File:RabbiMatthewHoldingTorah.jpg|thumb|The founder of the Commandment Keepers, [[Wentworth Arthur Matthew]] holding a [[Sefer Torah]].]]
[[Wentworth Arthur Matthew]] founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; Matthew was influenced by the non-black Jews he met as well as by [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]]. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for [[black people]] in [[North America]]. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, [[Ethiopia]] in particular. When Matthew later learned about the [[Beta Israel]]—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.&lt;ref name=Chireau25&gt;Chireau, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Commandment Keepers follow traditional Jewish practices and observe [[Jewish holidays]].&lt;ref name=Moses537&gt;Moses, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Members observe [[kashrut]], circumcise newborn boys and celebrate [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s, and their [[synagogue]] has a [[mechitza]] to separate men and women during worship.&lt;ref name="Jewish Week"&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Herschthal |title=Decline Of A Black Synagogue |url=http://joi.org/bloglinks/black%20synagogue%20Jewish%20Week.htm |work=[[The Jewish Week]] |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112220712/http://joi.org/bloglinks/black%20synagogue%20Jewish%20Week.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commandment Keepers believe that they are descendants of [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]].&lt;ref name=Parfitt95&gt;Parfitt, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew taught that "the Black man is a Jew" and "all genuine Jews are Black men",&lt;ref name=Sundquist116&gt;Sundquist, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; but he valued non-black Jews as those who had preserved Judaism over the centuries.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; Matthew maintained cordial ties with non-black Jewish leaders in New York and frequently invited them to worship at his synagogue.&lt;ref name=Wolfson48&gt;Wolfson, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew established the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College (later renamed the Israelite Rabbinical Academy) in Brooklyn. He ordained more than 20 [[rabbi]]s, who went on to lead congregations throughout the United States and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=Sundquist116/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfson48/&gt; He remained the leader of the Commandment Keepers in Harlem, and in 1962 the congregation moved to a landmark building on 123rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/HAR/HAR025.htm |title=Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation |accessdate=February 1, 2008 |publisher=New York Architecture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew died in 1973, sparking an internal conflict over who would succeed him as head of the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members locked out of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.&lt;ref name="Jewish Week"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackjews.org/Essays/DestructionofCommandmentKeepers.html |title=The Destruction of Commandment Keepers, Inc. 1919-2007 |accessdate=February 10, 2008 |last=Ben Levy |first=Sholomo |work=BlackJews.org |publisher=International Israelite Board of Rabbis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Harlem group, there are eight or ten Commandment Keeper congregations in the New York area, and others exist throughout North America as well as in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, seven rabbis have graduated from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy founded by Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackjews.org/IsraeliteAcademy.html |title=Israelite Academy |accessdate=February 10, 2008 |work=BlackJews.org |publisher=International Israelite Board of Rabbis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group accused the Israeli government of [[racism|racist discrimination]].&lt;ref name=Michaeli74&gt;Michaeli, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by [[Bayard Rustin]] investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation.&lt;ref name=Shipler&gt;{{cite news |last=Shipler |first=David K. |title=Israelis Urged To Act Over Black Hebrew Cult |url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F4071FFA395F0C738FDDA80894D9484D81 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 1981 |accessdate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were [[Deportation|deported]] for working illegally.&lt;ref name=Michaeli74/&gt;

The SPLC also said that "most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and do not advocate violence".&lt;ref name=Ready&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant |title=Racist Black Hebrew Israelites Becoming More Militant |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |date=Fall 2008 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Hebrew groups characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the [[Nation of Yahweh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2001/winter/popularity-and-populism |title=Popularity and Populism |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |first=Martin A. |last=Lee |date=Winter 2001 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt; Also, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] has written that the "12 Tribes of Israel" website, maintained by a Black Hebrew group, promotes black supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.adl.org/poisoning_web/black_bigots.html |title=Poisoning the Web: Hatred Online — African-American Anti-Semitism |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102103308/http://archive.adl.org/poisoning_web/black_bigots.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] terrorism risk assessment report stated that "violent radical fringe members" of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement hold "beliefs [that] bear a striking resemblance to the [[Christian Identity]] theology practiced by many white supremacists."&lt;ref name=Megidddo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov:80/library/megiddo/publicmegiddo.pdf |title=Project Megiddo |date=1999 |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815061728/http://www.fbi.gov:80/library/megiddo/publicmegiddo.pdf |pages=23–25 |archivedate=August 15, 2000 |accessdate=May 13, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nacos2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nacos |first=Brigitte L. |title=Terrorism and Counterterrorism |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |loation= |isbn=9781317343646 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that "the overwhelming majority of [Black Hebrew Israelites] are unlikely to engage in violence."&lt;ref name=Megidddo/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">The '''Daughters of Philip''' were 4 women briefly mentioned in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://margmowczko.com/philips-prophesying-daughters/   Philip’s Prophesying Daughters].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biblical account==
They were [[daughter]]s of [[Philip the Evangelist]], one of the seven Greek-speaking Jewish men, including [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] who were appointed [[Deacon]]s to the Greek-speaking Jewish [[widow]]s in the Jerusalem church. &lt;ref&gt;Acts 6:1-6; 21:8).&lt;/ref&gt; He became an evangelist travelling throughout [[Ancient Israel|the Holy Land]]. By the end of account in Acts he was living in [[Caesarea Philippi]] where he had four daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Bible tells us only that &lt;blockquote&gt;The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acts of the Apostles]] 21.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Extra-biblical references==
Further details of these women are given in various early histories including Eusebius and Papius. It is possible that they were informants for both [[Saint Luke|Luke]] in their youth and the [[early Christian]] historian [[Papius]] in their latter years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zianet.com/maxey/reflx653.htm Philip's Prophetess Daughters].&lt;/ref&gt;
Eusebius quoting Papias tells us that two daughters remained with Philip in his old age, when he had moved to the [[Phrygia]]n [[polis|city]] of [[Hierapolis]] and even relates a tale where one was miraculously rose from the dead.”&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.39.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' source for these tales was Papias, who he extensively quoted, and who was a young [[Bishop of Hierapolis]].&lt;ref&gt; Church History (Book 3:36:2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plausible that Papias knew these women.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 22 Sep. 2008) p18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eusebius held the women as examples of the right living &lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 5.17.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to them as “great lights” or “mighty luminaries” &lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.31.3.&lt;/ref&gt; People would travel long distances to consult them.&lt;ref&gt; F.F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1951), p387.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Eusebius regarded Philip’s daughters and their ministry as the benchmark for prophetic ministry in the early church.

Hermione and her sister Eutychis travelled to [[Ephesus]]. An early ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Hermione also survives, and recounts much of her life.

==Burial place==
Tradition tells that two daughters were  buried in Hierapolis.&lt;ref&gt;Monte A. Shanks, Papias and the New Testament (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2013) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=YCxTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=what+does+eusebius+record+about+the+ministry+of+philip's+daughters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C7fWSCs1Oy&amp;sig=p6ilsXVH-sq0xv18eUaTJNkuyw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxiYbiwdfZAhUFVrwKHXToAQcQ6AEIYDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20does%20eusebius%20record%20about%20the%20ministry%20of%20philip's%20daughters&amp;f=false  p295].&lt;/ref&gt; and their names were Irais and Chariline. 

Eusebius writes “After him there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the tomb of their father.”&lt;ref&gt;Eucibius, Church History (Book 3:31:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources however, say all four were buried in Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt; William Cave, Lives of the Most Eminent Fathers of the Church that Flourished in the First Four Centuries, Volume 1 (London, 1840), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Berger''' (born 8 March 1968 in [[Würzburg]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[theologian]], [[author]] and former gay activist.

== Biography ==

From 1991 to 1998 Berger studied [[philosophy]], [[Roman Catholic theology]] and German language and literature in Würzburg, [[Cologne]] and [[Dortmund]]. Berger is a German [[Thomism|neo-Thomist]] and a former professor of the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/0,1518,730287,00.html Spiegel:Theologe David Berger: Großteil katholischer Kleriker homosexuell]&lt;/ref&gt; though the Catholic Church has since revoked his ability to teach religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksta.de/region/kardinal-meisner-schwuler-theologe-darf-nicht-lehren,15189102,12530242.html Kölner Stadt-Anzeigers. November 3, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Before that time, he worked as a religious education teacher at a high school in [[Erftstadt]], Germany. Until February 2015 he was the editor-in-chief of the gay periodical MÄNNER (Berlin). A supporter of the right-wing anti-migration party [[Alternative for Germany|AFD]], Berger has distanced himself from the German [[LGBT]] movement.

In 2010, Berger wrote in his book ''Der heilige Schein: Als schwuler Theologe in der katholischen Kirche'' (“The holy sham: A gay theologian in the Catholic church”), that 20 to 40 percent of the Catholic clergy are [[homosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/0,1518,730287,00.html Spiegel:Theologe David Berger: Großteil katholischer Kleriker homosexuell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/vermischtes/article11362546/Der-heilige-Schein.html Die Welt: "Der heilige Schein"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Democratic Jewish Union''' ({{lang-lt|Žydų demoktratinish susivienijimas}}, ZDS) was a political coalition in inter-war [[Lithuania]].

==History==
The ZDS contested the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1920|Constituent Assembly elections]] in Lithuania in 1920, receiving 6.6% of the vote and winning six seats.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1218 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six elected members were [[Simon Yakovlevich Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum]] (Zionist), Soloveitzik (Zionist), Dr. N. Rachmilewitz (Achdut-[[Agudat Israel]]), R. Abraham Popelas (Achdut-Agudat Israel), [[Naphtali Friedman|Nachman Fridman]] ([[Folkspartei]]) and Ozer Finkelstein (Folkspartei). After Fridman's death he was replaced in the assembly by Samuel Landau.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masha Greenbaum|title=The Jews of Lithuania: a history of a remarkable community, 1316-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2_ag8xGWMQC&amp;pg=PA216|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd|isbn=978-965-229-132-5|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party did not contest the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1922|1922]] or [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1923|1923 elections]], but returned in [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1926|1926]], when it won three seats. However, a military coup saw the [[Seimas]] dissolved in December 1926 and no further multi-party elections were held again until the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23070">[[File:Samarkand Shah-i Zinda Tuman Aqa complex cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Girih pattern with inlaid floral decoration from [[:en:Shah-i-Zinda|Shah-i-Zinda]] in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot") is a decorative [[Islamic geometric patterns|Islamic geometric artform]] used in [[architecture]] and handicraft objects, consisting of angled lines that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]] pattern. 

Girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns from the 2nd century AD. The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of [[girih tiles]] with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as [[stencil|templates]], and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.

The 15th century [[Topkapı Scroll]] explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic [[Penrose tiling]]s, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; plasterwork, as at [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s such as Hunat Hatun, [[Kayseri]]; metal, as at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo]]; and in wood, as at the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]].

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

===Origins===
[[File:Bosra mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|2nd century Roman mosaic in [[Bosra]] with curvilinear knot patterns]]

The girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century AD [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=2013-01-01| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; These had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three-fold rotational symmetry. The [[Umayyad Mosque]] (709–715) in Damascus, Syria has window screens made of interlacing undulating strapwork in the form of six-pointed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] made of straight strap lines can be seen in the architecture of the surviving gateway of the [[Rabati Malik|Ribat-i Malik]] caravanserai, Uzbekistan, built in 1078.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic forms===

The earliest form of girih on a book is seen in the frontispiece of a [[Koran]] manuscript from the year 1000, found in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Materials and Mediums | work=Pattern in Islamic Art  | accessdate=2012-02-08 |  url=http://www.patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/materials-and-mediums/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illuminated with interlacing octagons and [[thuluth]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The transformation of Islamic art during the Sunni revival | author=Tabbaa, Yasser | year=2002 | publisher=I. B. Tauris | page=84| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ph7EdrzSpGoC&amp;pg=PA84 | isbn=978-1-85043-392-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In woodwork, one of the earliest surviving examples of Islamic geometric art is the 13th-century [[minbar]] (pulpit) of the [[Ibn Tulun Mosque]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jami' Ibn Tulun |url=http://archnet.org/sites/1522/media_contents/6256 |accessdate=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways. In one, a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created; the holes can be left as they are, or filled with some material. In the other, called ''gereh-chini''&lt;ref name="iranSociety"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pattern, Cognition and contemplation: Exploring the Geometric Art of Iran | author=Henry, Richard | year=2007 | publisher=Iran Society | url=http://www.iransociety.org/docs/journal_2007.pdf | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually, and combined to create an elaborate design.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

The term "girih" was used in Turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bir Belgeye Göre Amasya II. Bayezid Külliyesi | author=Dündar, A. | journal= Ankara Üniverstesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | volume= 44 | issue=2 | pages= 131–172 | year=2003 | url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/727/9212.pdf | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, artisans compiled girih pattern books such as the [[Topkapı Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | author=Katz, V. J. | page=620 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ullzl036UEC&amp;pg=PA620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in the 10th century, fully developed girih patterns were not seen before the 11th century in Iran. It became a dominant design element in the 11th and 12th centuries, as in the carved [[stucco]] panels with interlaced girih of the [[Kharraqan towers]] (1067) near [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin, Iran]].&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture – iv. Central Asian | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/architecture-iv | accessdate=2012-02-08| date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylized plant decorations were sometimes co-ordinated with girih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Urban development and architecture | author=Pugachenkova, G. A.; Dani, A. H. Dani; Yinsheng, Liu | work=History of Civilizations of Central Asia Volume IV: The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century – Part Two: The Achievements | isbn=978-92-3-103654-5 | url=http://unesco.culture.free.fr/asia-new/html_eng/chapitre4218/chapitre1.htm| publisher=UNESCO | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Safavid]] period, the use of girih continued in the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ilkhanid]] periods. In the 14th century, girih became a minor element in the decorative arts; it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era, but continued to be important in decorative arts in Central Asian monuments after that time.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

===Compass and straight edge===
{{further|Compass and straightedge constructions}}

Girih consists of geometric designs, often of stars and polygons, which can be constructed in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Allen, Terry |year=2004| title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih star and polygon patterns with 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as the 13th century. Such figures can be drawn by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. The first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a [[Lattice graph|regular grid]]; the pattern was drawn with [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to make it brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge.{{efn|Eric Broug's ''Islamic Geometric Patterns'' illustrates many such patterns, and (in the Appendix) gives detailed instructions for their construction using only compass and straightedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=194–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="iranSociety"/&gt; Girih patterns made this way are based on [[tessellation]]s, tiling the plane with a unit cell and leaving no gaps. Because the tiling makes use of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] operations, the unit cells need to have 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold [[rotational symmetry]].&lt;ref name="cromwell"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cromwell, P.R. | journal=Mathematical Intelligencer| volume=31 | issue=1| pages=36–56  | year=2009 | title=The Search for Quasi-Periodicity in Islamic 5-fold Ornament | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/760261153n347478/?p=405b9dbf45ea4f4793a097b6e12dcb08pi=7 | doi=10.1007/s00283-008-9018-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee, A.

===Polygons in contact===
One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book |last=Hankin |first=Ernest Hanbury |authorlink=Ernest Hanbury Hankin |title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15 |date=1925 |publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch |url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons&amp;nbsp;... almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

===Girih tiles===

{{main|Girih tiles}}

By the 15th century, some girih patterns were no longer periodic, and may have been constructed using [[girih tiles]]. This method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge, but it was probably at the start of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter J. Lu and Paul J.

===Two-level design===
{{triple image|right|Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|125|Spandrel-large scale pattern.svg|125|Darbeimam subdivision rule.svg|125|Girih pattern on a [[spandrel]] from the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine, Isfahan, Iran|Reconstruction of the larger-scale thick line pattern with larger tiles, and a spandrel in yellow|Subdivision rule for the spandrel's pattern|||}}

The girih patterns on the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine built in 1453 at [[Isfahan]] had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen. The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear [[aperiodic]]; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

Although there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]] to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;{{-}}

====Aperiodicity====
A periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a "unit cell", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These [[quasi-crystalline tiling]]s contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

One way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a [[Penrose tiling]]. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called "dart" and "kite", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt; Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,&lt;ref name=Makovicky&gt;{{cite web| author=Emil Makovicky| title=Comment on "Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture" |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1383.1.full | accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.&lt;ref name=Makovicky/&gt;}}

====The Topkapı Scroll====
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Panel50.PNG|width1=100|caption1=A [[Topkapı Scroll]] panel; featuring a girih pattern in black with red tiles|image2=Panel29.JPG |width2=150 |caption2=Topkapı scroll panel with patterns at two scales and tiles used|image3=Panel28a.PNG|width3=150|caption3=Reconstruction of the small scale pattern (thick black lines) in left panel, using small tiles|image4=Panel28b.PNG|width4=150|caption4=Reconstruction of the large scale pattern (thick red lines) in left panel, using large tiles}}

The [[Topkapı Scroll]], from the late 15th century, documents the use of girih tiles to create girih patterns. The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

===Templates===
Once a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper [[stencil|template]]. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p47--&gt; The ''Anonymous Compendium'' contains square repeat units for many girih patterns.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p42--&gt; Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's ''Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts'' contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p44--&gt;

== Girih on various surfaces ==

=== Girih on windows ===
[[File:Colorful window, Dowlat Abad Garden - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Colourful window of Dowlad Abad Garden]]
Girih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]], as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koliji|first=Hooman|date=2015|title=Built on Light: The 'Crafty' Art of Geometric Patterned Windows|url=https://doi.org/10.1386/ijia.4.1.75_1|journal=International Journal of Islamic Architecture|volume=4|pages=75-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Girih on domes ===
[[File:Nasr ol Molk mosque vault ceiling.jpg|thumb|Nasr ol Molk mosque vault ceiling]]
In addition to plain platforms like the windows, girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shapes of the domes, they need special techniques. One of the most important techniques is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to that the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are highly dependent on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shapes of the girih pattern are heavily relying on the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohammad|first=Kasraei|date=2016|title=Girih for Domes: Analysis of Three Iranian Domes|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00004-015-0282-4|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same method can be applied to other surfaces, even irregular surface.

=== Girih on walls  ===
[[File:Dome Jame Mosque Yazd.jpg|thumb|Dome of Jams Mosque Yazd]]Girih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls of some [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectures]]. The decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across the entire tiling with edges combine together. In addition, girih patterns vary a lot on the surface, with different geometric shapes including decagons, hexagons, bowties and rhombuses. Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: "self-similar transformation". The mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate the edge difference of these patterns and reduce the edge mismatches to the lowest degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Peter|date=February 2017|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architectur|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1135491|journal=Science|volume=315|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Boswells-Ovid.jpg|thumb|Front matter of Boswell's copy of the 1732 edition of the ''Heroides'', edited by Peter Burmann.&lt;br /&gt;Note the title ''Heroides '''sive''' Epistolae'',&lt;br /&gt;''The Heroides '''or''' the Letters''.]]

The '''''Heroides''''' (''The Heroines''),&lt;ref&gt;Usually abbreviated ''Her.'' or ''H.'' in citations of Ovid's works.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Epistulae Heroidum''''' (''Letters of Heroines''), is a collection of fifteen [[wiktionary:epistolary|epistolary]] poems composed by [[Ovid]] in [[Latin]] [[elegiac couplet]]s and presented as though written by a selection of aggrieved [[hero]]ines of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] in address to their heroic lovers who have in some way mistreated, neglected, or abandoned them.
A further set of six poems, widely known as the ''[[Double Heroides]]'' and numbered 16 to 21 in modern scholarly editions, follows these individual letters and presents three separate exchanges of paired epistles: one each from a heroic lover to his absent beloved and from the heroine in return.

Arguably some of Ovid's most influential works ([[#Translations and influence|see below]]), one point that has greatly contributed to the mystique of the ''Heroides''&amp;mdash;and to the reverberations they have produced within the writings of later generations&amp;mdash;is directly attributable to Ovid himself. In the third book of his ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', Ovid argues that in writing these fictional epistolary poems in the [[wiktionary:persona|personae]] of famous heroines, rather than from a [[First-person narrative|first-person perspective]], he created an entirely new [[literary genre]]. Recommending parts of his poetic output as suitable reading material to his [[Audience theory|assumed audience]] of Roman women, Ovid wrote of his ''Heroides'': "vel tibi composita cantetur Epistola voce: | ignotum hoc aliis ille novavit opus" (''Ars Amatoria'' [[s:la:Ars Amatoria/Liber III|3.345–6]]: "Or let an Epistle be sung out by you in practiced voice: unknown to others, he [''[[Scilicet|sc.]]'' Ovid] originated this sort of composition"). The full extent of Ovid's originality in this matter has been a point of scholarly contention: E. J. Kenney, for instance, notes that "''novavit'' is ambiguous: either 'invented' or 'renewed', cunningly obscuring without explicitly disclaiming O[vid]'s debt to [[Sextus Propertius|Propertius]]' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/prop4.html#3 ''Arethusa'' (4.3)] for the original idea."&lt;ref&gt;Kenney (1996) 1, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of various interpretations of Propertius 4.3, consensus nevertheless concedes to Ovid the lion's share of the credit in the thorough exploration of what was then a highly innovative poetic form.

==Dating and authenticity==
The exact dating of the ''Heroides'', as with the [[Ovid#Works|overall chronology of the Ovidian corpus]], remains a matter of debate. As Peter E. Knox notes, "[t]here is no consensus about the relative chronology of this [''sc.'' early] phase of O[vid]'s career," a position which has not advanced significantly since that comment was made.&lt;ref&gt;Knox (1995) 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Exact dating is hindered not only by a lack of evidence, but by the fact that much of what is known at all comes from Ovid's own poetry. One passage in the second book of Ovid's ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' (''Am.'') has been adduced especially often in this context:
{{Verse translation|lang=la|
quod licet, aut artes teneri profitemur Amoris
:(ei mihi, praeceptis urgeor ipse meis!)
aut quod Penelopes verbis reddatur Ulixi,
:scribimus et lacrimas, Phylli relicta, tuas,
quod Paris et Macareus et quod male gratus Iason
:Hippolytique parens Hippolytusque legant,
quodque tenens strictum Dido miserabilis ensem
:dicat et †Aoniae Lesbis amata lyrae.†
|attr1=[[s:la:Amores/2.18|''Am.'' 2.18.19–26]]|
I do what I may—either profess the arts of tender love
:(Alas! I'm beset by my own teachings!)
Or write what's rendered in the words of Penelope to her Ulysses,
:And your tearful tale too, forsaken Phyllis—
That which Paris and Macareus, and that also which oh-so-ungrateful Jason,
:And Hippolytus's sire, and Hippolytus himself may read—
And what pitiable Dido, holding now the blade unsheathed,
:Might say, and so too †that woman of Lesbos, beloved of the Aonian lyre.†&lt;!-- -- trans. [[User:shug2304|shug2304]] [[WP:SIG]]--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The reader is to understand that the letters ''read'' by Paris, Macareus, Jason, Hippolytus's father, and Hippolytus himself were ''written'' by (respectively) [[Oenone]], [[Canace]], [[Hypsipyle]] (and possibly also [[Medea]]), [[Ariadne]], and [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]. The "woman beloved of the Aonian lyre" refers to [[Sappho]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Knox notes that "[t]his passage&amp;nbsp;... provides the only external evidence for the date of composition of the ''Heroides'' listed here. The only collection of ''Heroides'' attested by O[vid] therefore antedates at least the second edition of the ''Amores'' (c. 2 BC), and probably the first (c. 16 BC)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Knox (1995) 6. He also provides (p. 6, n. 9) a cautionary note, with references, on the use of modern terminology such as ''publication'' to refer to "the circumstances of ancient book production and circulation."&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the most probable date of ''composition'' for at least the majority of the collection of single ''Heroides'' ranges between c. 25 and 16 BC, if indeed their eventual ''publication'' predated that of the assumed first edition of the ''Amores'' in that latter year.&lt;ref&gt;Like many other aspects of Ovidian studies, what is known about the publication of multiple editions of the ''Amores'' is derived almost solely from Ovid himself, who opens those early poems with the [[epigram]]matic preface:
&lt;poem&gt;{{lang|la|Qui modo Nasonis fueramus quinque libelli,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tres sumus; hoc illi praetulit auctor opus.
ut iam nulla tibi nos sit legisse uoluptas,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at levior demptis poena duobus erit}}&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;We who were (not so long ago) the five little books of Naso
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are now three; their author preferred his work this way over that.
Though even now you may take little pleasure in reading us,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With two books swept away your pain will be lighter&lt;/poem&gt;
With Ovid's word as the only viable evidence on the matter, the existence of a second edition of the ''Amores'' is widely regarded as potentially questionable (cf. the arguments of, e.g. Holzberg [1997]).&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of absolute dating, the evidence nonetheless suggests that the single ''Heroides'' represent some of Ovid's earliest poetic efforts.

Questions of authenticity, however, have often inhibited the literary appreciation of these poems.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller overview of the authenticity debate than can be offered here, see, among others, Lachmann (1876), Palmer (1898), Courtney (1965) and (1998), Anderson (1973), Reeve (1973), Jacobson (1974), Tarrant (1981), Knox (1986), (1995, esp. the introduction), and (2002), Kennedy (2002), and Lingenberg (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Farrell identifies three distinct issues of importance to the collection in this regard: (1) individual interpolations within single poems, (2) the authorship of entire poems by a possible Ovidian impersonator, and (3) the relation of the ''Double Heroides'' to the singles, coupled with the authenticity of that secondary collection.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of these issues has been a focus, even if tangentially, of many treatments of the ''Heroides'' in recent memory.

As an example following these lines, for some time scholars debated over whether this passage from the ''Amores''&amp;mdash;corroborating, as it does, only the existence of ''Her.'' 1–2, 4–7, 10–11, and very possibly of 12, 13,&lt;ref&gt;''Am.'' 2.18.38 reads ''et comes extincto Laodamia viro'' ("and Laodamia, companion to her deceased husband"), which could refer solely to a subject of the poetry of [[Aemilius Macer|Macer]], who is addressed in ''Am.'' 2.18, or could as easily be relating Macer's works to Ovid's own compositions, serving as evidence, therefore, for the authenticity of ''Her.'' 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and 15&amp;mdash;could be cited fairly as evidence for the ''in''authenticity of at least the letters of Briseis (3), Hermione (8), Deianira (9), and Hypermnestra (14), if not also those of Medea (12), Laodamia (13), and Sappho (15).&lt;ref&gt;Some critics have argued that the passage in ''cruces'' in line 26&amp;mdash;together with its partner at line 34 (''det votam Phoebo Lesbis amata lyram'' – "the woman of Lesbos, loved in return, might offer Phoebus the promised lyre")&amp;mdash;is in fact an interpolation.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hinds argues, however, that this list constitutes only a ''poetic'' catalogue, in which there was no need for Ovid to have enumerated every individual epistle.&lt;ref&gt;Hinds (1993) 30 f., a suggestion cited by scholars since almost as a matter of reflex. Cf. also, on ''Her.'' 12, Knox (1986) and Heinze (1991–93). For a more recent discussion of the broad implications of this passage from the ''Amores'', see Knox (2002) 118–21.&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion has been widely persuasive, and the tendency amongst scholarly readings of the later 1990s and following has been towards careful and insightful literary explication of individual letters, either proceeding under the assumption of, or with an eye towards proving, Ovidian authorship. Other studies, eschewing direct engagement with this issue in favour of highlighting the more ingenious elements&amp;mdash;and thereby demonstrating the high value&amp;mdash;of individual poems in the collection, have essentially subsumed the authenticity debate, implicating it through a tacit equation of high literary quality with Ovidian authorship. This trend is visible especially in the most recent monographs on the ''Heroides''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. in particular the recent dissertations-turned-published-monographs of Lindheim (2003), Spentzou (2003), and Fulkerson (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some scholars have taken a completely different route, ascribing the whole collection to one&lt;ref&gt;Zwierlein (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or two&lt;ref&gt;Lingenberg (2003) regards the single letters as a coherently structured work by one author, published some years after Ovid's death at latest and believed to be authentic Ovid already by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]; the double letters are by a different author, but probably roughly contemporary.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovidian imitators (the catalogue in ''Am.'' 2.18, as well as ''Ars am.'' 3.345–6 and ''Epistulae ex Ponto'' 4.16.13–14, would then be interpolations introduced to establish the imitations as authentic Ovid).

==The collection==
The paired letters of the ''Double Heroides'' are not outlined here: see the [[Double Heroides#The Collection|relevant section of that article]] for the double epistles (16–21). The single ''Heroides'' are written from the viewpoints of the following heroines (and heroes). The quotations highlighted are the opening couplets of each poem, by which each would have been identified in medieval manuscripts of the collection:
*I. [[Penelope]] writes to her famed husband, [[Odysseus]], a hero of the [[Trojan War]], towards the end of his long absence (the subject of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref&gt;See esp. Kennedy (1984) and Hinds (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and influence==
The ''Heroides'' were popularized by the Loire valley poet [[Baudri of Bourgueil]] in the late eleventh century, and [[Héloïse]] used them as models in her famous letters to [[Peter Abelard]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dronke, "Heloise," in ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;   A translation, ''Les Vingt et Une Epistres d'Ovide'', was made of this work at the end of the 15th century by the French poet [[Octavien de Saint-Gelais]], who later became [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Angoulême|Bishop of Angoulême]]. While Saint-Gelais' translation does not do full justice to the original, it introduced many non-Latin readers to Ovid's fictional letters and inspired many of them to compose their own Heroidean-style epistles. Perhaps the most successful of these were the ''Quatre Epistres d'Ovide'' (c. 1500) by [[André de La Vigne]], a friend and colleague of Saint-Gelais. Later translations and creative responses to the ''Heroides'' include [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]]'s ''Premiere Epître de l'Amant vert'' (1505), [[Publio Fausto Andrelini|Fausto Andrelini]]'s verse epistles (1509–1511; written in the name of [[Anne of Brittany|Anne de Bretagne]]), [[:fr:Michel d'Amboise|Michel d'Amboise]]'s ''Contrepistres d'Ovide'' (1546), and [[Juan Rodríguez de la Cámara]]'s ''Bursario'', a partial translation of the ''Heroides''.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne LeBlanc, "Queen Anne in the Lonely, Tear-Soaked Bed of Penelope: Rewriting the ''Heroides'' in Sixteenth-Century France," in ''The Late Medieval Epistle'', ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz (Evanston, IL: [[Northwestern University Press]], 1996), pp. 71–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics scholar [[W. M. Spackman]] argues the ''Heroides'' influenced the development of the European novel: of Helen's reply to Paris, Spackman writes, "its mere 268 lines contain in embryo everything that has, since, developed into the novel of dissected motivations that is one of our glories, from ''La Princess de Clèves, Manon Lescaut'', and ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'', to Stendhal and Proust."&lt;ref&gt;''On the Decay of Humanism'' (Rutgers University Press, 1967), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Loeb Classical Library]] presents the ''Heroides'' with ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' in Ovid I. [[Penguin Books]] first published Harold Isbell's translation in 1990. Isbell's translation uses unrhymed [[couplet]]s that generally alternate between eleven and nine [[syllable]]s. A translation in [[Couplet|rhymed couplets]] by [[Daryl Hine]] appeared in 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1732">'''James Anderton''' (1557 – 1613) was an English [[Roman Catholic]] lawyer, official and controversialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=510|title=Anderton, James|first=Michael|last=Mullett}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter of the seventeenth century, he published several learned works under the name of ‘John Brereley, Priest.’

==Works==
His publications include ''The Protestants Apologie for the Roman Church. Deuided into three seuerall Tractes''. It passed through three editions. He also published ''That communion of the Eucharist to the Laity under one kind is lawful. The ceremonies also of the Masse now used in the Catholicke Church, are all of them derived from the Primitive Church'', Cologne, 1620, of 469 pages, and ''St. Austin's Religion collected from his own Writings'',’ 1620, which was replied to by [[William Crompton (clergyman)|William Crompton]] in a work entitled ''Saint Austin's Religion: wherein is manifestly proued out of the Workes of that learned Father that he dissented from Poperie''. London, 1624 and 1625. The second edition of this reply was revised by Archbishop [[William Laud]] at the direction of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], as appears from a passage in the archbishop's diary. Anderton's ''The Reformed Protestant'' is mentioned by [[John Gee (clergyman)|John Gee]] in his catalogue of [[popish]] books.

"'''Jewpacabra'''" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|p|ə|ˈ|k|æ|b|ɹ|ə}} is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[South Park]]'', and the 227th episode of the series overall. It premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 4, 2012. In this episode, South Park's big Easter egg hunt is in jeopardy when there are rumors of a dangerous beast lurking in the woods nearby. Cartman tries to warn everyone that their lives are at risk if they participate in the egg hunt. No one believes him until he produces video evidence of the mysterious being.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/411409/episode-1604-jewpacabra-press-release "Episode 1604 'Jewpacabra' Press Release"].

==Plot==
When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] finds his mother educating [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] on [[Passover]], because of a claimed interest in Jewish culture on Cartman's part, Kyle is suspicious. Cartman tells Kyle and his other schoolmates of a blood-sucking creature called "[[chupacabra|Jewpacabra]]" that preys on children, and mentions reports of incidents that he implies are the result of the creature. Kyle denounces this idea, and accuses Cartman of spreading lies, as there is no such creature. Cartman does not relent in his efforts, taking [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] with him to hunt the Jewpacabra, and showing video tape of their efforts to the executives of Sooper Foods, in an attempt to convince them to cancel their Easter egg hunt. 

The executives show the video to a team of experts at the [[Cryptozoology|Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization]] (BFRO), who confirm that it is evidence of an actual Jewpacabra, and tell Cartman that the creature will come after him because he exposed its existence. This frightens Cartman into hiding in a church with [[Token Black|Token]], [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and Butters, whom Cartman pays $20 to protect him. Cartman is nonetheless abducted by the Sooper Foods executives, who dress him in an Easter bunny costume and chain him to a cement block in a field in order to sacrifice him to the Jewpacabra, which will make the Easter egg hunt possible. When Kyle appears before Cartman, Cartman pleads with him to help him escape, but when Kyle says he will only do so if Cartman admits he lied about the Jewpacabra, Cartman's inability to be honest about what caused his predicament causes Kyle to abandon him. BFRO then see Cartman and think he is a real life "Bunny-Man", so they shoot him with a [[Ketamine|tranquilizer]] and hope to make an [[Animal Planet]] program documenting their capture, but instead of taking Cartman as their evidence, they take the gun with which they shot him.

Cartman then experiences a tranquilizer-induced [[dream]].  He awakes in [[Ancient Egypt]] amidst a [[Plagues of Egypt#8. Locusts (אַרְבֶּה): Ex. 10:1–20|swarm of locusts]] and [[Plagues of Egypt#2. Frogs (צְּפַרְדֵּעַ): Ex. 7:25–8:11|downpour of frogs]].  He asks "his Hebrew friend" Kyle about it, who tells him the [[Plagues of Egypt]] are the result of a cruel and capricious [[God]].  He asks his father, the [[Pharaoh]], (portrayed as a troubled but fair ruler) for advice, but their conversation (including a musical number) is interrupted by the Jews beginning to graphically slaughter lambs, so as to avoid the [[Plagues of Egypt#10. Death of the firstborn (מַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת): Ex. 11:1–12:36|tenth plague]]. In abject religious terror, Cartman swears to God that if he is spared, he will become Jewish.

Meanwhile, Kyle has a change of heart and frees the delirious Cartman from his captivity, takes him home, and puts him to bed. When Cartman awakens with no knowledge of how he got home, he classifies the experience as a religious epiphany, and announces to everyone at the Easter egg hunt that he has converted to Judaism. When he tells everyone that they should convert too by recognizing Jehovah as their true God and [[Judaism's view of Jesus|denying Christ]], the assembled Christians label Cartman as a heathen and return to their hunt. Cartman apologizes to Kyle, saying he now knows what he feels like to be mocked by others for being Jewish, and the two wish each other a Happy [[Passover]]. The camera then pans up to a [[Star of David]] shining at the center of the Sun.

==Critical reaction==
Jacob Kleinman of the ''[[International Business Times]]'' thought the episode was generally "solid", though not as funny as [[Faith Hilling|the previous week's episode]]. Kleinman singled out the ancient Egypt sequence as his favorite, and also thought that the manner in which Cartman's Jewpacabra stories backfired on him were "hilarious, historic and extremely shocking".&lt;ref name="ibt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/324593/20120405/south-park-jewpacabra-new-episode-cartman-video.htm|title=New South Park Episode 'Jewpacabra' Takes On Easter, Passover, Chupacabra|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=April 5, 2012|author=Kleinman, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Parvathi ([[Roja (actress)|Roja]]), a young woman, is a goddess believer while her father (V. Gopalakrishnan) is the priest of a temple. After a quarrel between two castes during a Hindu festival, the temple was closed off. Five years later, the temple reopens.

Muthu (Rahul) and Thenmozhi (Nandhini) are in love but they are not of the same caste. Velusamy (Karikalan), Thenmozhi's uncle, finds out their love and forces her to marry him.

K. Shanmugam ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), a corrupt [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], kills a girl and blames Thamizharasan ([[C. Arunpandian|Arun Pandian]]). Thamizharasan fights against injustice and is a revolutionary. Angry, Thamizharasan tries to kill him but fails and eventually steals his money. In the process, Thamizharasan is injured and the prostitute Shenbagam (Rupasri) takes care of him.

Rajapandi (Velu Prabhakaran), an atheist, propagates the non-existence of God. One day, he saves Parvathi from her uncle K. Shanmugam and gets married to her accidentally. Soon, Rajapandi gets beaten by the devotees. In anger, Rajapandi challenges God to become a human and understand the humans, and God ([[Manivannan]]) appears as a human.

'''Khety I''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[nomarch]] of the 13th ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomos]]'' of [[Upper Egypt]] (''"the Upper [[Ficus sycomorus|Sycamore]]"'') during the [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|10th dynasty]] (c. 21st century BCE, during the [[First Intermediate Period]]). Like many other local governors, he also was a priest of the native deity [[Wepwawet]].

It is generally assumed that Khety I was the earliest of a trio of related nomarchs datable to the [[Heracleopolis Magna|Herakleopolite]] period; he was likely followed by his son Tefibi and then by his grandson [[Khety II (nomarch)|Khety II]].&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Donald B. Spanel, in [[Donald B. Redford]] (ed), ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;154-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was member of a long line of nomarchs in [[Asyut]] with strong bonds of loyalty and friendship towards the [[10th Dynasty|Herakleopolite dynasty]]: as a child he was raised along with the herakleopolite [[royal prince]]s and their father – the [[pharaoh]] – appointed Khety as nomarch and also joined the [[mourning]] for the death of Khety's grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Hayes]], in ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History]]'', vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-077915}}, p.&amp;nbsp;469.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khety ruled his ''nomos'' during a peaceful period, and is known that he ordered the realization of many new [[irrigation canal]]s and imposed the maintenance of the existing ones, thus expanding the cultivable land. During a period of [[famine]] caused by a particularly small [[Nile flood]], he bestowed grain to the people of his district, although he denied the grain to the inhabitants of the neighboring ''nomoi'', also affected by famine, by closing the borders of his district. Although he ruled during peaceful times, Khety boasted his ability as a warrior and ordered the organization of a provincial defence militia.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;468-469.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death Khety was buried in Asyut (tomb V)&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; and his titles passed to his son [[Tefibi]], who is likely to have lived during the reign of [[Wahkare Khety I|Wahkare Khety]] and [[Merykare]].

'''Luigi Magni''' (21 March 1928 &amp;ndash; 27 October 2013) was an Italian screenwriter and film director.

== Life and career ==
Born in Rome, Magni started his career as a screenwriter, in 1956, with ''[[Tempo di villeggiatura]]''.&lt;ref name=shs&gt;{{cite news|title=È morto Luigi Magni, raccontò magistralmente la Roma papalina sul grande schermo|url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/cinema/2013/10/27/news/morto_luigi_magni_raccont_magistralmente_roma_sul_grande_schermo-69567831/|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he collaborated with [[Mario Monicelli]] to a real "event" of the Italian cinema as the transformation of [[Monica Vitti]] in a comedic actress with ''[[The Girl with the Pistol]]'', and the critical and commercial success of the film pushed him into directing.&lt;ref name=shs/&gt; After the directorial debut with ''[[Faustina (1968 film)|Faustina]]'' (which was also the debut film of [[Vonetta McGee]]), in 1969 Magni achieved an extraordinary success with ''[[Nell'anno del Signore]]'', which was the highest-grossing Italian film of the year, so as to require for the first time in Italy nighttime screenings to meet the demands of the audience.&lt;ref name=shs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giacovelli&gt;{{cite book|last=Enrico Giacovelli|title=La commedia all'italiana|publisher=Gremese Editore, 1990|isbn=8876054995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film marked the encounter with [[Nino Manfredi]], with whom Magni had a long-standing association on the set (including the screenplay of Manfredi's award winning film ''[[Per Grazia Ricevuta]]'') and a close friendship off the set. The film also defined Magni's style, namely a [[commedia all'italiana]] mainly centred on Rome and its history, particularly the epoch between the [[Papal States]] and the [[Risorgimento]].&lt;ref name="Giacovelli"/&gt;

In 1977 Magni achieved critical recognition with ''[[In nome del Papa Re]]'', which also gave him his first [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]].&lt;ref name=shs/&gt;&lt;ref name=premi&gt;{{cite book|last=Enrico Lancia|title=I premi del cinema|publisher=Gremese Editore, 1998|isbn=8877422211}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a second David di Donatello in 1995, for the screenplay of ''[[Nemici d'infanzia]]'', and a special David di Donatello Lifetime Career Award in 2008.&lt;ref name=shs/&gt;&lt;ref name="premi"/&gt;

In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the [[17th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1991"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |title=17th Moscow International Film Festival (1991) |accessdate=2 March 2013 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102003/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2003 TV movie ''La notte di Pasquino'', a sort of sequel of ''[[Nell'anno del Signore]]'' still with Nino Manfredi as the main actor, and with the death of Manfredi in 2004, Magni retired from cinema.&lt;ref name=shs/&gt; He died in Rome, on 27 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema-tv.corriere.it/cinema/13_ottobre_27/cinema-morto-luigi-magni-fff7aca8-3f07-11e3-849f-64e2eb8e7cda.shtml |title=Cinema, è morto Luigi Magni |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date= |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World trees''' are a prevalent motif occurring in the mythical cosmologies, [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]], and [[iconography|iconographies]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]. In the Mesoamerican context, [[world tree]]s embodied the four [[cardinal direction]]s, which also serve to represent the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' which connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a [[ceiba]] tree, and is known variously as a ''wacah chan''{{Pronunciation-needed}} or ''yax imix che''{{Pronunciation-needed}}, depending on the [[Mayan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Finlay (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[Izapa Stela 5]] is considered a possible representation of a World Tree.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster", symbolic of the underworld).

The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, ''et al.'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miguel de Olivares''' (1675–1768) was a [[Chile]]an priest and [[historian]].

Miguel de Olivares was born at [[Chillán, Chile|Chillán]]. He joined the [[Society of Jesus]], became a missionary, and as such began about 1701 to travel through the territories of Quillota, Polpaico, Tiltil, Limache, and others. From 1712 until 1720 he directed the missions of Nahuelhuapi and Calbuco, and in 1730 he was in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] during the [[1730 Valparaíso earthquake|earthquake of July]], which destroyed that city.
 
His frequent voyages gave him an opportunity to study the archives of the Company of Jesus, and about 1736, in Santiago, he began to compile his history. From 1740 till 1758 he served in the missions of Araucania, where he learned the language of the Indians. He intended to write a complete history of Chile, when a decree of Charles III exiled the Jesuits, and, notwithstanding his advanced age, Olivares had to leave the country.
 
In [[Lima]], by order of the viceroy, [[Manuel de Amat y Juniet|Manuel de Amat]], he was robbed of his manuscripts, and the viceroy's secretary, Jose Perfecto Salas, obtained the second part of the "Historia militar, civil y sagrada de lo acaecido en la conquista y pacificación del Reino de Chile." From Imola he tried to recover his manuscripts, and the king himself ordered the president of Chile to send them to Spain, which was done by [[Ambrose O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno|Ambrosio O'Higgins]], but Olivares died at Imola before their arrival in Madrid.
 
A complete edition of the work and a "Historia de la Compañía de Jesus en Chile 1593–1736," with notes by the Chilean historian [[Diego Barros Arana]], appeared in Santiago in 1870.

[[File:Goranchacha El hijo del Sol.jpg|thumb|right|205px|'''Goranchacha''', one of the mythical creatures in the mythology of the Muisca]]
[[File:Muisca raft BOG 04 2012 Museo de Oro 1251.jpg|thumb|right|205px|The [[Muisca raft]], discovered in the 1920s, almost 400 years after the Spanish conquistadores were looking for the basis of the '''''El Dorado''''' legend]]
This article describes the '''Muisca mythology'''; the [[mythology]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. Mythology is different from religion in the sense that myths are usually the combination of real events and/or people with a legendary twist, while religion is purely transcedental. The [[religion]] of the Muisca is described in [[Muisca religion]]; their deities, rituals and sacred sites. 

Main contributors to the knowledge of the mythology of the Muisca have been [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholars]] [[Javier Ocampo López]], [[Pedro Simón]], [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]], [[Juan de Castellanos]] and [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] who was the European making first contact with the Muisca in the 1530s.

== Muisca mythology ==
The times before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] of the [[Muisca Confederation]] are filled with mythology. The first confirmed human [[Muisca rulers|rulers]] of the two capitals [[Tunja|Hunza]] and [[Bogotá|Bacatá]] are said to have descended from mythical creatures. Apart from that other Muisca myths exist, such as the legendary ''[[El Dorado]]'' and the [[Monster of Lake Tota]].

=== Mythological creatures ===
Several mythological creatures have been described by the [[chronicler]]s:
* [[Thomagata]], said to have been one of the most religious of the ''zaques'', after Idacansás&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.14, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Idacansás]], allegedly a mythical priest from [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]] who was able to change the order of things&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.12, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goranchacha]], a mythical ''cacique'' who moved the capital of the northern Muisca from [[Ramiriquí]] to the later capital Hunza&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.13, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pacanchique]], according to Muisca myths recovered his fiancé Azay from ruler [[Quemuenchatocha]] by first turning her into a dead person and then bringing her back to life using different plants. He also showed the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] conquistadores the way to Nemequene's palace&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.19, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;Other Muisca people where human and mythological character converge are:

* [[Hunzahúa]], first ''[[zaque]]'' of Hunza, allegedly committing [[incest]] with his sister and said to have fled&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.11, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meicuchuca]], first ''[[zipa]]'' of Bacatá, one of his wives mythologically turned into a snake&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/serpiente.html Meicuchuca, the lover of the snake] - Pueblos Originarios - accessed 05-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Muisca myths ===
* ''[[El Dorado]]'', the man or city made of gold, that was not so mythical but a main motive for the Spanish to conquer Colombia. The ritual is represented in the [[Muisca raft]], a piece of gold working found in [[Pasca, Cundinamarca|Pasca]] almost 400 years after the arrival of the Spanish
* [[Monster of Lake Tota]], allegedly a monstrous snake or fish living in [[Lake Tota]]&lt;ref name="Triana, 1880"&gt;{{es}} [https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-Kqfvt5uQFIMEszNG9ScG5IVFU ''Mitos y Leyendas de Colombia'', Eugenia Villa Posse; Ed. IADAP, 1993; S. 204] - accessed 05-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hunzahúa Well]], a well that according to the mythology of the Muisca originated from spilled [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]] when the mother of [[Hunzahúa]] caught him and his sister Noncetá while they were committing [[incest]]&lt;ref name=PueblosPozo&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/pozo.html Hunzahúa Well] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muslim population growth''' refers to the topic of [[population growth]] of [[Muslim]]s worldwide. In 2006, countries with a Muslim majority had an average population growth rate of 1.8% per year (when weighted by percentage Muslim and population size).&lt;ref&gt;Averaging of individual country figures from [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications//factbook CIA factbook] see also [[Demographics of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; This compares with a [[world population growth]] rate of 1.1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html#xx|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, it was predicted that the world's Muslim population will grow twice as fast as non-Muslims over the next 20 years. By 2030, Muslims will make up more than a quarter of the global population.&lt;ref name=pewforum2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/|title=The Future of the Global Muslim Population|date=27 January 2011|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, Muslims have the highest [[fertility rate]], an average of 2.9 children per woman—well above replacement level (2.1) and also a younger age profile (median age of 24) compared to other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/05/the-changing-global-religious-landscape/#age-and-fertility-are-major-factors-behind-growth-of-religious-groups=|title=|at=Age and fertility are major factors behind growth of religious groups|date=April 5, 2017|publisher=PEW Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu fertility (2.4) is similar to the global average (2.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf|title=The Future of World Religions p. 97|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, Jewish fertility (2.3 [[google:jews+population&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab|children]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=jews+population&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab|title=jews population - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; per woman) also is above replacement level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf|title=The Future of World Religions p. 138|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the religious groups have fertility levels too low to sustain their populations and would require converts to grow or maintain their size: indigenous and tribal religions (1.8 children per woman), other religions (1.7), the unaffiliated (1.7) and Buddhists (1.6).&lt;ref name=PewEurope2011 /&gt;

This significant projected growth is largely due to the young age, high fertility rate of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf |title=The Future of World Religions |page=70|quote=This significant projected growth is largely due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims.|publisher=The PEW Research Cewnter|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/12/25/460797744/a-religious-forecast-for-2050-atheism-is-down-islam-is-rising|title=A Religious Forecast For 2050: Atheism Is Down, Islam Is Rising|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pew Research, [[religious conversion]] has no net impact on the Muslim population as the number of people who [[Convert to Islam|convert to Islam]] is roughly similar to those who leave Islam.&lt;ref name=pewforum2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAzizViY30EC|title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography|first1=Todd M.|last1=Johnson|first2=Brian J.|last2=Grim|date=25 March 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page numbers}} &lt;ref name="fact-tank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Muslims are the world’s fastest-growing religious group|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/|publisher=www.pewresearch.org|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often reported from most recent various sources in 2010, including the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|German domestic intelligence service]], that [[Salafism]] is the fastest-growing Islamic movement in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Barby Grant|title=Center wins NEH grant to study Salafism|url=http://csrc.asu.edu/news/center-wins-neh-grant-study-salafism|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=9 June 2014|quote=It also reveals that Salafism was cited in 2010 as the fastest growing Islamic movement on the planet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Simon Shuster|title=Comment: Underground Islam in Russia|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/08/03/comment-underground-islam-russia|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=Slate|date=3 Aug 2013|quote=It is the fastest-growing movement within the fastest-growing religion in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christian Caryl|title=The Salafi Moment|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/12/the_salafi_moment|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=FP|date=September 12, 2012|quote=Though solid numbers are hard to come by, they're routinely described as the fastest-growing movement in modern-day Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uproar in Germany Over Salafi Drive to Hand Out Millions of Qurans|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20120416150547.htm|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=AFP|date=2012-04-16|quote=The service [German domestic intelligence service] said in its most recent annual report dating from 2010 that Salafism was the fastest growing Islamic movement in the world...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though according to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'', published in 2001, the fastest-growing branch of Islam is [[Ahmadiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=February 15, 2001 |editor1=David B.

* According to the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], the World Christian Database as of 2007 estimated the six fastest-growing religions of the world to be [[Islam]] (1.8%), the [[Bahá'í Faith]] (1.7%), [[Sikhism]] (1.6%), [[Jainism]] (1.6%), [[Hinduism]] (1.5%), and [[Christianity]] (1.3%).

*On April 2, 2015, the [[Pew Research Center]] published a demographic study about "The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050" with projections of the growth of Islam and reasons why "Islam will grow faster than any other major religion."&lt;ref name=pewforum2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/|title=The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050|date=2 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that the global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf The Future of World Religions p. 70] This significant projected growth is largely due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/12/25/460797744/a-religious-forecast-for-2050-atheism-is-down-islam-is-rising|title=A Religious Forecast For 2050: Atheism Is Down, Islam Is Rising|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Projected growth of Islam by 2050'''
::Some of the projections are as follows:&lt;ref name=pewforum2015 /&gt;
:# "If current trends continue, by 2050 the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world."
:# "In Europe, Muslims will make up 10% of the overall population."
:# In India, a [[Hindu]] majority will be retained, but India will also "have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world, surpassing [[Indonesia]]" which in 2015 has the largest Muslim population.
:# "In the United States, "Muslims will be more numerous in the U.S. than people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion," so "[[Judaism]] will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion."


:'''Reasons given for the projected growth'''
::Some of the reasons the study gave are as follows:&lt;ref name=pewforum2015 /&gt;
:# The change in the world's religious is "driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world's major religions, as well as by people switching faiths."
:# ''Fertility rates''. The world's total population "is expected to rise to 9.3 billion, a 35% increase" between 2010 and 2050, However, "over that same period, Muslims, who have a comparatively youthful population with high fertility rates, are projected to increase by 73%." Muslim growth benefits from the fertility factor because "globally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 3.1 children per woman." This is above a replacement level of 2.1 which is "the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population."
:# ''Size of youth population''. "In 2010, more than a quarter of the world's total population (27%) was under the age of 15. But a "higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15."
:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, "11% of the world's population was at least 60 years old," but only 7% of Muslims were over 60.
:# ''Switching''. Between 2010 and 2050 a gain of 3,220,000 Muslim adherents is projected to come through switching, mostly found in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] (2.9 million). Also, the Muslim population are projected to add 1.3 million and lose 880,000 via switching, for a net gain of 420,000 between 2015 and 2020.
:# ''Migration''. Migration  is the third reason for the Muslim population growth. For example, 1.8% of the projected growth in Europe is attributed to Muslims migrating in.

===Asia===
[[Islam]] is currently the largest religion in Asia. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], nearly three-in-ten people living in the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 (27.3%) will be Muslim, up from about a quarter in 2010 (24.8%) and roughly a fifth in 1990 (21.6%).&lt;ref name=PewAsia2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/#asia-pacific |title=The Future of the Global Muslim Population (Asia)|date=27 January 2011|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, regarding attitudes "toward [[birth control]]," younger (ages 10–19) Muslim women are less likely to favor it than are older (ages 20–30). Regarding "knowledge of  birth control," younger (ages 10–19) Muslim women know less than do older (ages 20–30).  "Muslim marriages take place earlier" than other religions, and younger (ages 10–19) Muslim women are more likely to want to have "many children" than are older (ages 20–30).&lt;ref&gt;Shakeel Ahmad, ''Muslim Attitude Towards Family Planning'' (Sarup &amp; Sons, 2003), 26, 33. 47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Kurtz]], Muslims in India are much more resistant to modern contraceptive measures compared to other Indians and, as a consequence, the fertility rate among non-Muslim women is much lower compared to that of Muslim women.&lt;ref name="Christ"&gt;{{cite book| last =  Guilmoto| first =  Christophe| title = Fertility transition in south India| publisher = SAGE, 2005| isbn = 9780761932925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Paul Kurtz| title = Multi-Secularism: A New Agenda | publisher = Transaction Publishers, 2010| isbn = 9781412814195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the projection of a 2006 committee appointed by the Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]], if the current trend continued, by the end of the 21st century India's Muslim population would reach about 340 million people (19% or 20% of India's total projected population), despite the fact that Hindus would still remain the predominant religious community of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cursor/muslim-population-myths/?cp=2 |title=Muslim population myths |publisher=''Times of India'' |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the second-largest [[religion in India]], making up 14.2% of the country's population with about 172 million adherents ([[2011 Census of India|2011 census]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-by-2030-muslims-will-make-up-16-pc-of-indias-population/20110128.htm|title=By 2030, Muslims will make up 16 pc of India's population|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, India had the third largest population of Muslims, after Indonesia and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-muslim/ | title=The Global Religious Landscape – Muslims | work=Pew Research Center | accessdate=29 July 2015 | date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/pakistans-population-surges-to-2078-million/article9831330.ece/ | title=Population growth of Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
In China, Muslim population growth was 2.7% during 1964–1982, compared to 2.1% for the population as the next two decades from 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Pew Research Center projects a slowing down of Muslim population growth in China than in previous years, with Muslim women in China having a 1.7 fertility rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia/|title=Region: Asia-Pacific|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] voluntarily limit themselves to one child in China since their Imams preach to them about the benefits of population control. The number of children, in different areas, people are allowed to have varies between one and three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ilookchina.net/2010/11/05/exemptions-in-chinas-one-child-policy/|title=Exemptions in China's ‘one-child policy’|date=5 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese family planning policy allows minorities, including Muslims, to have up to two children in urban areas, and three to four children in rural areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Data for the rates of growth of [[Islam in Europe]] reveal that the growing number of Muslims is due primarily to immigration and higher [[birth rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Kaufman of [[University of London]] argue that the main reason why Islam is expanding, is not because of conversion to Islam, but primarily to the nature of the religion as he call it “pro-natal”, where Muslims tend to have more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2267/battle-of-the-babies|title=Battle of the Babies - New Humanist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim women today have an average of 2.2 children compared to an estimated average of 1.5 children for non-Muslim women in Europe.&lt;ref name=PewEurope2011 /&gt; While the birth rate for Muslims in Europe is expected to decline over the next two decades, it will remain slightly higher than in the non-Muslim population,&lt;ref name=PewEurope2011 /&gt; except for [[Turks in the Netherlands|Dutch-Turks]], who have a lower birthrate (1.7) than the native Dutch population (1.8).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbkenniscentrum.nl/public/Publicatie/48/download1/2011-03-18%20Turken%20in%20Nederland%20factsheet.pdf Factsheet Turks in the Netherlands, p. 2] Abckenniscentrum, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/bevolkingstrends/archief/2012/2012-bt-svi-vruchtbaarheid.htm Sterke regionale verschillen in vruchtbaarheid naar herkomstgroepering] CBS, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the current decline rate of Islam in Europe, in 2030, Muslims are projected to make up more than 10% of the total population in 10 European countries: [[Kosovo]] (93.5%), [[Albania]] (83.2%), [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (51%), [[Republic of Macedonia]] (40.3%), [[Montenegro]] (21.5%), [[Bulgaria]] (15.7%), Russia (14.4%), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (11.5%), France (10,3%) and [[Belgium]] (10.2%).&lt;ref name=PewEurope2011 /&gt;

== Conversion ==
In a 2015 article, the [[Pew Research Center]] said that the "bulging youth populations are among the reasons that Muslims are projected to grow faster than the world's overall population"&lt;ref name=pewforum2015 /&gt; Only 0.3% (3,220,000 people) of the expected Muslim population growth (1,161,780,000) in the period of 2010–2050 would be due to conversions; 99.7% would be due to a high birth rate among Muslims.&lt;ref name=PewEurope2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel.

In Britain, around 6,000 people convert to Islam per year and according to a June 2000 article in the British Muslims Monthly Survey the bulk of new Muslim converts in Britain were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsweb.bham.ac.uk/bmms/2000/06June00.asp#Women|title=BMMS June 2000|website=artsweb.bham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', "observers estimate that as many as 20,000 Americans convert to Islam annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/24/post-911-islam-converts_n_935572.html|title=Conversion To Islam One Result Of Post-9/11 Curiosity|date=24 August 2011|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pew Research]], the number of Americans who convert to Islam is roughly equal to the number of American Muslims who leave the religion. &lt;ref name=conversion&gt;{{cite web|title=The share of Americans who leave Islam is offset by those who become Muslim|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/26/the-share-of-americans-who-leave-islam-is-offset-by-those-who-become-muslim/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77% of new converts to Islam are from Christianity, whereas 19% were from [[irreligion|non-religion]]. Whereas, 55% of Muslims who left Islam went to non-religion, and 22% converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=conversion/&gt;

Darren E. Sherkat questioned in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-06-22/losing-their-religion|title=Losing Their Religion|date=17 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.foreignaffairs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Nascio''' ([[Latin]]: "birth") was one of many [[goddess]]es of [[childbirth|birth]], and a protector of [[infants]]. She assisted [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] in her functions, and was analogous to the Greek [[Eileithyia]]. She had a sanctuary in the neighborhood of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum|On the Nature of Gods]]'', 3. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythindex.com/roman-mythology/N/Nascio.html|title=Nascio|publisher=Roman Myth Index|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">'''Natmasses''' (singular ''natmas'') were spirits worshipped in the ancient culture of the island of [[Anatom|Aneityum]], [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], ''A Dictionary of the Aneityumese Language'', London &amp; Edinburgh: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1882, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
: "''Natmas'', the name given to every deity, signifies literally a dead man, and they all dwelt in ''Uma-atmas'', the Land of the Dead. Theirs was the Worship of their Ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], D.D. ''In the New Hebrides: Reminiscences of Missionary Life and Work, Especially on the island of [[Anatom|Aneityum]], from 1850 till 1877'', London: T. Nelson and Sons, 1887, Ch. IV, p. 29. The text can be viewed in archive.com website: https://archive.org/stream/innewhebridesrem00ingl#page/n7/mode/2up ''Retrieved 2012-04-03''.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Natmasses'' were represented mainly in the form of stones:
: "Stones were the chief [[fetishes]], or representatives of the ''natmasses'', these were all sizes from that of a pebble to blocks of some tons weight. About a mile inland from our station are two blocks, each as large as the roof of a small cottage; both of them were recognized as natmasses. The one, the large one, was called the sun, and the other the moon. The sides of the larger rock are marked with some rude, sculptured figures of fishes and birds, and as one of the best fishing grounds could be seen from these rocks, certain incantations performed on these were believed to affect the success or non-success of the fishing. Every family had a basket containing a collection of natmasses of their own, a sort of [[penates]] or [[Household deity|household gods]], which they worshipped as a family."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], D.D. ''In the New Hebrides''. Ch. IV, p. 30. Also quoted by Felix Speiser in ''Ethnology of Vanuatu''. London: C Hurst, 1998, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; "On Aneityum the idols were all . . . of uncarved, unhewn stones. The only exception to this which we ever found was in the case of Tuatau, a ''natmas'' which I found at Anauunse and took home with me. Tuatau was of wood, a piece of a breadfruit tree."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], D.D. ''In the New Hebrides''. Ch. IV, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "I may here give a brief account of one of our ''natmasses'', which may be accepted as a typical case. His name was Rangitafu; he belonged to Nohmunjap, a district to the west of our Mission station. Rangitafu was a block of whinstone, about five feet long, a foot and a half broad, and a foot thick. He was a sea-god, and presided over shipwrecks." &lt;ref&gt;[[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], D.D. ''In the New Hebrides''. Ch. IV, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was therefore used to refer to gods, spirits of their forebears, or their forefathers themselves:
: "On [[Anatom|Aneityum]], there is a large system of [[irrigation]], but of ancient date; . . . If you ask the natives who made these old canals for [[irrigation]], they tell you they do not know; they suppose that they were made by the ''natmasses'', that is, the gods, or, in other words, the spirits of their forebears, which, of course, means their forefathers themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Inglis (missionary)|Rev. John Inglis]], ''A Dictionary of the Aneityumese Language'', Introduction, p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Covadonga''' is a title of the Blessed [[Virgin Mary]], and a Marian shrine devoted to her at Covadonga in the province of [[Asturias]] in north west Spain.  The Spanish shrine rose to prominence following the [[Battle of Covadonga]] c.720, at which the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] of Spain was first resisted. 
A statue of the Virgin Mary, secretly hidden in one of the caves, was believed to have miraculously aided the Christian victory. 

Our Lady of Covadonga is the patron of Asturias, and a basilica was built to house the current statue. Pope [[John Paul II]] visited the shrine at Covadonga to honour the Virgin Mary. The feast of our Lady under this title is 7 September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traditioninaction.org/SOD/j225sd_OLCovadonga_9-07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Covadonga is a mountainous region in the province of Asturias in the extreme north west of Spain. Following the Islamic [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab invasion of Spain]] in 711, [[Roderic]], the Christian [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] King of Spain was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. The battle was decisive and led to the swift conquest of most of Visigothic Spain.

The remnant of the Visigoth nobility retreated to the remote mountains of northern Spain. According to texts written in northern Iberia during the ninth century, they elected in 718 a man named [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]], or Pelagius, as their leader. Pelayo's father had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King [[Egica]]. Pelayo gathered a band of warriors to resist Islamic encroachment. When in 722 the Arab commander of Spain sent an army to eliminate this resistance, the Christian army made its stand at a place of many caves known as Covadonga.

According to tradition{{cn|date=August 2018}} Pelayo retreated to a cave where a hermit had secreted a statue of the Virgin Mary, saved from the Muslim conquest. He prayed to the virgin for victory. In the subsequent battle the Christians made use of the natural defences. The moorish commander fell in the battle, and his soldiers fled. This victory, considered the first of the Christian [[reconquista]] of Spain, established the independence of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in north west Spain.

=== The Shrine ===
{{stack|[[File:La Santa Cueva de Covadonga.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Holy Cave of Covadonga|Holy Cave]], place where Our Lady of Covadonga appeared to Pelayo]]}}
Pelayo credited the intercession of the Virgin Mary for his victory. And in recognition of this miraculous intercession, [[Alfonso I of Asturias|King Alfonso I, the Catholic]] (739-757) commanded that a monastery and chapel be built on the site in honor of Our Lady of Covadonga.
 
The sanctuary came to be run by [[Augustinian]] canons but was destroyed by fire on 17 October 1777. The shrine was rebuilt piecemeal, until replaced by a great [[Basílica de Santa María la Real de Covadonga|Basilica]] that was consecrated in 1901. The basilica houses{{cn|date=August 2018}} the current statue of Our Lady of Covadonga, dating to the 16th century. 
[[Pope John Paul II]] visited the shrine during his papacy.

'''Pythagoreanism''' originated in the 6th century BC, based on the teachings and beliefs held by [[Pythagoras]] and his followers, the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in [[Crotone|Croton]], [[Italy]]. Early-Pythagorean communities lived throughout [[Magna Graecia]]. They espoused a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Following Pythagoras’ death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism. The practitioners of ''akousmatikoi'' were superseded in the 4th century BC as significant [[mendicant]] school of philosophy by the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]]. The Pythagorean ''mathēmatikoi'' philosophers were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the [[Platonic Academy|Platonic school]]. 

Following the political instability in the Magna Graecia, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in [[Rhegium]]. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on [[Plato]] and through him, on all of [[Western philosophy]]. Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with [[Aristotle]] and the philosophers of the [[Peripatetic school]].

As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to [[Neopythagoreanism]]. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a [[religious community]] Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the [[Bacchic|Bacchic cults]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].

[[Image:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|210px|thumb|Bust of [[Pythagoras]], [[Musei Capitolini]], [[Rome]].]]

[[Pythagoras]] was already in ancient times well known for the mathematical achievement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Babylonians]] had used this formula for centuries, Pythagoras had discovered that "in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides". In ancient times Pythagoras was also noted for his discovery that music had mathematical foundations. Antique sources that credit Pythagoras as the philosopher who first discovered [[Interval (music)|music intervals]] also credit him as the inventor of the [[monochord]], a straight rod on which a string and a movable bridge could be used to demonstrate the relationship of musical intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with [[Aristotle]] and the philosophers of the [[Peripatetic school]], which founded histographical academic traditions such as [[biography]], [[doxography]] and the [[history of science]]. The surviving 5th century BC sources on Pythagoras and early Pythagoreanism are void of supernatural elements. While surviving 4th century BC sources on Pythagoreas' teachings introduced legend and fable. Philosophers who discussed Pythagoreanism, such as [[Anaximander]], [[Andron of Ephesus]], [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] and [[Neanthes of Cyzicus|Neanthes]] had access to historical written sources as well as the oral tradition about Pythagoreanism, which by the 4th century BC was in decline. [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] philosophers, who authored many of the surviving sources on Pythagoreanism, continued the tradition of legend and fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving ancient source on Pythagoras and his followers is a [[satire]] by [[Xenophanes]], on the Pythagorean believes on the transmigration of souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes wrote of Pythagoras that:

{{quote|Once they say that he was passing by when a puppy was being whipped,
And he took pity and said:

"Stop! Do not beat it! For it is the soul of a friend

That I recognized when I heard it giving tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a surviving fragment from [[Heraclitus]] Pythagoras and his followers are described as follows:

{{quote|Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, practised inquiry beyond all other men and selecting of these writings made for himself a wisdom or made a wisdom of his own: a polymathy, an imposture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two other surviving fragments of ancient sources on Pythagoras are by [[Ion of Chios]] and [[Empedocles]]. Both were born in the 490s, after Pythagoras' death. By that time he was known as a sage and his fame had spread throughout Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ion, Pythagoras was:

{{quote|... distinguished for his many virtue and modesty, even in death has a life which is pleasing to his soul, if Pythagoras the wise truly achieved knowledge and understanding beyon that of all men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Empedocles described Pythagoras as "a man of surpassing knowledge, master especially of all kinds of wise works, who had acquired the upmost wealth of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC the [[Sophist]] [[Alcidamas]] wrote that Pythagoras was widely honored by Italians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=
Leonid Zhmud |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199289318|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today scholars typically distinguish two periods of Pythagoreanism: early-Pythagoreanism, from the 6th till the 5th century BC, and late-Pythagoreanism, from the 4th till the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Rhetorics and Rhetoricians: Critical Studies and Sources|authors=Michelle Ballif &amp; Michael G. Moran|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=9780313321788|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spartan]] colony of [[Taranto]] in Italy became the home for many practitioners of Pythagoreanism and later for Neopythagorean philosophers. Pythagoras had also lived in [[Crotone]] and [[Metaponto]], both were [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pomeroy|first1=Sarah B.|title=Pythagorean Women|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9781421409573|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early-Pythagorean sects lived in Croton and throughout [[Magna Graecia]]. They espoused to a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Their burial rites were tied to their believe in the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 

Early-Pythagorean sects were closed societies and new Pythagoreans were chosen based on merit and discipline. Ancient sources record that early-Pythagoreans underwent a five year initiation period of listening to the teachings (''akousmata'') in silence. Initiates could through a test become members of the inner circle. However, Pythagoreans could also leave the community if they wished.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Rhetorics and Rhetoricians: Critical Studies and Sources|authors=Michelle Ballif &amp; Michael G. Moran|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=9780313321788|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iamblichus]] listed 235 Pythagoreans by name, among them 17 women who he described as the "most famous" women practitioners of Pythagoreanism. It was customary that family members became Pythagoreans, as Pythagoreanism developed into a philosophic traditions that entailed rules for everyday life and Pythagoreans were bound by secrets. The home of a Pythagorean was known as the site of mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pomeroy|first1=Sarah B.|title=Pythagorean Women|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9781421409573|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras had been born on the island of [[Samos]] at around 570 BC and left his homeland at around 530 BC in opposition to the policies of [[Polycrates]]. Before settling in Croton, Pythagoras had traveled throughout [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. In Croton, Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community, described as a secret society, and attained political influence. In the early 5th century BC Croton acquired great military and economic importance. Pythagoras emphasized moderation, piety, respect for elders and of the state, and advocated a [[monogamous]] family structure. The Croton Council appointed him to official positions. Among others Pythagoras was in charge of education in the city. His influence as political reformer reputably extended to other Greek colonies in southern Italy and in Sicily. Pythagoras died shortly after an arson attack on the Pythagorean meeting place in Croton.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D. McKirahan|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781603846127|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The anti-Pythagorean attacks in c. 500 BC were headed by [[Cylon of Croton]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; After these initial attacks and the death of Pythagoras, Pythagorean communities in Croton and elsewhere continued to flourish. At around 450 BC attacks on Pythagorean communities were carried out across [[Magna Graecia]]. In Croton, a house were Pythagoreans gathered was set on fire and all but two of the Pythagorean philosophers burned alive. Pythagorean meeting places in other cities were also attacked and philosophic leaders killed. These attacks occurred in the context of widespread violence and destruction in Magna Graecia. Following the political instability in the region, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in [[Rhegium]]. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. [[Archytas]] remained in Italy and ancient sources record that he was visited there by young [[Plato]] in the early 4th century BC. The Pythagorean schools and societies died out from the 4th century BC. Pythagorean philosophers continued to practice, albeit no organized communities were established.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

According to surviving sources by the [[Neopythagorean]] philosopher [[Nicomachus]], [[Philolaus]] was the successor of Pythagoras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=I2MPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Pythagoras+Lehren+nebst+den+Bruchstücken+seines+Werkes |page=14|year=1819|title=Philolaos des Pythagoreers Lehren nebst den Bruchstücken seines Werkes|author=August Böckh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cicero]] ([[De Oratore|de Orat.]] III 34.139), Philolaus was teacher of [[Archytas]].&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/|title=Philolaus|author=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Iamblichus]], [[Archytas]] in turn became the head of the Pythagorean school about a century after the Pythagoras' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=_sT_psl3uYkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=archippus+pythagoras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=11tpVe_jKIb0Up3RgJAM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=archippus%20pythagoras&amp;f=false|title=A Short Account of the History of Mathematics|author=Walter William Rouse Ball|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philolaus and [[Eurytus (Pythagorean)|Eurytus]] are identified by [[Aristoxenus]] as teachers of the last generation of Pythagoreans.&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus /&gt;

== Philosophic traditions ==
Following Pythagoras’ death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism in Italy: ''akousmatikoi'' and ''mathēmatikoi''. The practitioners of ''mathēmatikoi'' recognized practitioners of ''akousmatikoi'' as fellow Pythagoreans, but because the ''mathēmatikoi'' allegedly followed the teachings of [[Hippasus]], the ''akousmatikoi'' philosophers did not recognise them. Despite this, both groups were regarded by their contemporaries as practitioners of Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D. McKirahan|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781603846127|pages=88-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''akousmatikoi'' were superseded in the 4th century BC as significant [[mendicant]] school of philosophy by the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]]. Philosophers of the ''mathēmatikoi'' were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the [[Platonic Academy|Platonic school]] of [[Speusippus]], [[Xenocrates]] and [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemon]]. As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to [[Neopythagoreanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans |author=Charles H. Kahn |publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2001 |isbn=9781603846820|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy in the two intervening centuries. As a [[religious community]] Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the [[Bacchic|Bacchic cults]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|author=Charles H. Kahn|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2001|isbn=9781603846820|pages=73-74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''akousmatikoi'' ===
[[Image:Bronnikov gimnpifagoreizev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Pythagoreans celebrate sunrise'', 1869 painting by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]. ]]
The practitioners of ''akousmatikoi'' believed that humans had to act in appropriate ways. ''Akousmata'' (translated as "oral saying") preserved all sayings of Pythagoras as divine dogma. The ''akousmatikoi'' tradition resisted any reinterpretation or philosophic evolution of Pythagoras' teachings. Individuals who by their actions attained the most ''akousmata'' were regarded as wise. The ''akousmatikoi'' philosophers refused to recognize that the continuous development of mathematical and scientific research conducted by the ''mathēmatikoi'' practitioners was in line with Pythagoras's intention. Until the demise of Pythagoreanism in the 4th century BC, the ''akousmatikoi'' continued to engage in a pious life by practicing silence, dressing simply and avoiding meat, for the purpose of attaining a privileged [[afterlife]]. The ''akousmatikoi'' engaged deeply in questions of Pythagoras' moral teachings, concerning matters such as [[harmony]], [[justice]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D.

=== The ''mathēmatikoi'' ===
[[File:Archytas curve.png|thumb|250px|The Archytas curve]]
The practitioners of ''{{transl|grc|mathēmatikoi}}'' acknowledged the religious underpinning of Pythagoreanism and engaged in ''mathēma'' (translated as "learning" or "studying") as part of their practice. While their scientific pursuits were largely mathematical, they also promoted other fields of scientific study in which Pythagoras had engaged during his lifetime. A sectarianism developed between the dogmatic ''akousmatikoi'' and the ''mathēmatikoi'', who in their intellectual activism became regarded as increasingly progressive. This tension persisted until the 4th century BC, when the philosopher [[Archytas]] engaged in advanced mathematics as part of his devotion to Pythagoras' teachings.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; 

Today, Pythagoras is mostly remembered for his mathematical ideas, and by association with the work early Pythagoreans did in advancing mathematical concepts and theories on harmonic [[musical intervals]], the definition of [[numbers]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] and mathematical methods such as [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. The ''mathēmatikoi'' philosophers claimed that numbers were at the heart of everything and constructed a new view of the [[cosmos]]. In the ''mathēmatikoi'' tradition of Pythagoreanism the [[Earth]] was removed from the center of the [[universe]]. The ''mathēmatikoi'' believed that the Earth, along with other celestial bodies, orbited around a central fire. This, they believed, resembled a celestial harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D. McKirahan|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781603846127|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
Pythagoreanism was a philosophic tradition as well as an religious practice. As a religious community they relied on oral teachings and worshiped the [[Pythian Apollo]], the  [[oracular]] god of [[Delphic Oracle]]. Pythagoreans preached an austere life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|author=Charles H. Kahn|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2001|isbn=9781603846820|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that the soul was buried in the body, which acted as a tomb for the soul in this life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|author=Charles H. Kahn|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2001|isbn=9781603846820|pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest reward a human could attain was for the soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escaped the cycle of [[reincarnation]] in another human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|author=Charles H.

==Philosophy==
Early Pythagoreanism was based on research and the accumulation of knowledge from the books written by other philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans|author=

===Arithmetic and numbers===
[[File:First six triangular numbers.svg|thumb|The first six [[triangular numbers]]]]
Pythagoras in his teachings cultivated mathematics and numbers, engaging in a combination of philosophic theorizing and deductive provable methodology. ''Numbers'' were in the Greek world of Pythagoras' days ''natural numbers'' - that is positive [[integers]]. But unlike their Greek contemporaries, the Pythagorean philosophers represented numbers graphically, not symbolically through letters. Pythagoreans used dots, also known as ''psiphi'' (pebbles), to represent numbers in triangles, squares, rectangles and pentagons. This enabled a visual comprehension of mathematics and allowed for a geometrical exploration of numerical relationships. Pythagorean philosophers investigated the relationship of numbers exhaustively. They defined ''perfect numbers'' as those that were equal the sum of all their divisors. For example: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of odd and even numbers was central to Pythagorean [[arithmetic]]. This distinction was for the Pythagorean philosophers direct and visual, as they arranged triangular dots so that the even and odd numbers successively alternate: 2, 4, 6, ... 3, 5, 7, ...&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early-Pythagorean philosophers such as [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]] held the conviction that mathematics could help in addressing important philosophical problems.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521446679|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pythagoreanism numbers became related to intangible concepts. The ''one'' was related to the intellect and being, the ''two'' to thought, the number ''four'' was related to justice because 2 * 2 = 4 and equally even. A dominant symbolism was awarded to the number ''three'', Pythagoreans believed that the whole world and all things in it are summed up in this number, because end, middle and beginning give the number of the whole. The [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|triad]] had for Pythagoreans an ethical dimension, as the goodness of each person was believed to be threefold - prudence, drive and good fortune.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
The Pythagoreans engaged with [[geometry]] as a liberal philosophy which served to establish principles and allowed theorems to be explored abstractly and mentally. Pythagorean philosophers believed that there was a close relationship between numbers and geometrical forms. Early-Pythagorean philosophers proved simple geometrical theorems, including "the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles". Pythagoreans also came up with three of the five regular [[polyhedra]]: the [[tetrahedron]], the [[cube]] and the [[dodecahedron]]. The sides of a regular dodecahedron are regular [[pentagon]]s, which for Pythagoreans symbolized health. They also revered the [[pentagram]], as each diagonal divides the two others at the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; When linear geometrical figures replaced the dots, the combination of [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian algebra]] and Pythagorean arithmetic provided the basis for Greek [[geometric algebra]]. By attempting to establish a system of concrete and permanent rules, Pythagoreans helped to establish strict [[axiomatic]] procedures of solving mathematical problems.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Image:Pythagoras and Philolaus.png|right|thumb|Medieval woodcut by [[Franchino Gaffurio]], depicting [[Pythagoras]] and [[Philolaus]] conducting musical investigations.]]
Pythagoras pioneered the mathematical and experimental study of music. He objectively measured physical quantities, such as the length of a [[String (music)|string]] and discovered quantitative mathematical relationships of music through arithmetic ratios. Pythagoras attempted to explain subjective psychological and aesthetic feelings, such as the enjoyment of musical harmony. Pythagoras and his students experimented systematically with strings of varying length and tension, with [[wind instruments]] with brass discs of the same diameter but different thicknesses, and with identical vases filled with different levels of water. Early Pythagoreans established quantitative ratios between the length of a string or pipe and the pitch of notes and the frequency of string vibration.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

Pythagoras is credited with discovering that the most harmonious musical intervals are created by the simple numerical ratio of the first four integer numbers which derive respectively from the relations of string length: the eighth (1/2), the fifth (2/3) and the fourth (3/4).&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; The sum of those numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 was for Pythagoreans the perfect number, because it contained in itself "the whole essential nature of numbers". [[Werner Heisenberg]] has called this formulation of musical arithmetical as "among the most powerful advances of human science" because it enables the measurement of sound in space.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is a system of [[musical tuning]] in which the [[frequency ratio]]s of all [[interval (music)|intervals]] are based on the ratio [[Perfect fifth|3:2]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', seventh edition, 2 vols. (Boston: McGraw-Hill). Vol. I: p. 56. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio, also known as the "[[Five-limit tuning#The justest ratios|pure]]" perfect fifth, is chosen because it is one of the most [[consonance and dissonance|consonant]] and easiest to tune by ear and because of importance attributed to the integer 3. As [[Novalis]] put it, "The musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, David R. Fideler (1987). ''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library: An Anthology of Ancient Writings which Relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean Philosophy'', p.24. Red Wheel/Weiser. {{ISBN|9780933999510}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that mathematics could explain the human sentimental world had a profound impact on the Pythagorean philosophy. Pythagoreanism became the quest for establishing the fundamental essences of reality. Pythagorean philosophers advanced the unshakable belief that the essence of all thing are numbers and that the universe was sustained by harmony.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; According to ancient sources music was central to the lives of those practicing Pythagoreanism. They used medicines for the purification (''[[Catharsis|katharsis]]'') of the body and, according to [[Aristoxenus]], music for the purification of the soul. Pythagoreans used different types of music to arouse or calm their souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmony===
For Pythagoreans harmony signified the "unification of a multifarious composition and the agreement of unlike spirits". In Pythagoreanism numeric harmony was applied in mathematical, medical, psychological, aesthetic, metaphysical and cosmological problems. For Pythagorean philosophers the basic property of numbers was expressed in the harmonious interplay of opposite pairs. Harmony assured the balance of opposite forces.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras had in his teachings named numbers and the symmetries of them as the first principle, and called these numeric symmetries harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This numeric harmony could be discovered in rules throughout nature. Numbers governed the properties and conditions of all beings and were regarded the causes of being in everything else. Pythagorean philosophers believed that numbers were the elements of all beings and the universe as a whole was composed of harmony and numbers.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

===Cosmology===
[[Image:Antichthon.svg|thumb|250px|right|According to a collection of ancient philosophical texts by [[Stobaeus]] in the 5th century AD, [[Philolaus]] believed there was a "Counter-Earth" (''Antichthon'') orbiting a "central fire" but not visible from [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dante and the Early Astronomers'' by M. A. Orr, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Pythagorean astronomical system}}
The philosopher [[Philolaus]], one of the most prominent figures in Pythagoreanism,&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/ Philolaus], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; was the precursor of [[Copernicus]] in moving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; According to Aristotle's student [[Eudemus of Cyprus]], the first philosopher to determine quantitatively the size of the known planets and the distance between them was [[Anaximander]], a teacher to Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC. Historic sources credit the Pythagorean philosophers with being the first to attempt a clarification of the planet sequence.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early-Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus]] believed that limited and unlimited things were the components of the cosmos and these had existed ever since. The center of the universe, according to Philolaus, was the number one (''hēn''), which equated to the unity of [[Monism]]. Philolaus called the number [[one]] an "even-odd" because it was able to generate both even and odd numbers. When one was added to an [[odd number]] it produced an even number, and when added to an [[even number]] it produced an odd number. Philolaus further reasoned that the fitting together of the earth and the universe corresponded to the construction of the number one out of the even and the odd. Pythagorean philosophers believed that the even was unlimited and the odd was limited.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aristotle recorded in the 1st century BC on the Pythagorean astronomical system: 
:It remains to speak of the earth, of its position, of the question whether it is at rest or in motion, and of its shape. As to its position, there is some difference of opinion. Most people–all, in fact, who regard the whole heaven as finite–say it lies at the center. But the Italian philosophers known as Pythagoreans take the contrary view. At the centre, they say, is fire, and the earth is one of the stars, creating night and day by its circular motion about the center. They further construct another earth in opposition to ours to which they give the name counterearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=On the Heavens|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html|accessdate=Apr 17, 2016|volume=II|origyear=350 B.C.E|chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether Philolaus believed Earth to be round or flat,&lt;ref&gt;Burch 1954: 272–273, quoted in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/ Philolaus], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not believe the earth rotated, so that the Counter-Earth and the Central Fire were both not visible from Earth's surface, or at least not from the hemisphere where Greece was located.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; But the conclusion of Pythagorean philosophers that the universe is not [[geocentric]] was not based on [[empirical observation]]. Instead, as Aristotle noted, the Pythagorean view of the astronomical system was grounded in a fundamental reflection on the value of individual things and the hierarchical order of the universe.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt;

Pythagoreans believed in a [[musica universalis]]. They reasoned that [[stars]] must produce a sound because they were large swiftly moving bodies. Pythagoreans also determined that stars revolved at distances and speeds that were proportional to each other. They reasoned that because of this numerical proportion the revolution of the stars produced a harmonic sound.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus argued that the structure of the cosmos was determined by the musical numerical proportions of the diatonic [[octave]], which contained the fifth and fourth harmonic intervals.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

===Justice===
Pythagoreans equated [[justice]] with geometrical proportion, because proportion ensured that each part receives what it is due.&lt;ref name="auto13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library|author=David R. Fideler|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|year=1987|isbn=9781609253943|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early-Pythagoreans believed that after the death of the body, the soul would be punished or rewarded. Humans could accomplish, through their conduct, that their soul was admitted to another world. The reincarnation in this world equated to a punishment. In Pythagoreanism life in this world is social&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Justice?: Justice, Law, and Politics in the Mirror of Science : Collected Essays|author=Hans Kelsen|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|year=2000|isbn=9781584771012|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the realm of society justice existed when each part of society received its due. The Pythagorean tradition of [[universal justice]] was later referenced by [[Plato]]. For Pythagorean philosophers the soul was the source of justice and through the harmony of the soul, divinity could be achieved. Injustice inverted the natural order. According to the 4th century BC philosopher [[Heraclides Ponticus]], Pythagoras taught that "happiness consists in knowledge of the perfection of the numbers of the soul.&lt;ref name="auto13"/&gt; A surviving fragment from the 3rd century BC by the late-Pythagorean philosopher [[Aesara]] reasoned that:

{{quote|I think human nature provides a common standard of law and justice for both the family and the city. Whoever follows the paths within and searches will discover; for within is law and justice, which is the proper arrangement of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Ian Michael Plant|publisher=Equinox Publishing|year=2004|isbn=9781904768029|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Body and soul===
{{See also|Pythagoras#Metempsychosis}}
Pythagoreans believed that body and soul functioned together, and a healthy body required a healthy psyche.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 539"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Lifen|author=Gordon Lindsay Campbell|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780191035159|pages=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Pythagoreans conceived of the soul as the seat of sensation and emotion. They regarded the soul as distinct from the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TThe Concept of Woman: The Early Humanist Reformation, 1250-1500, Part 1|author=Prudence Allen|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9780802833464|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only fragments of the early Pythagorean texts have survived and it is not certain whether they believed the soul was immortal. The surviving texts of the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus]] indicate that while early Pythagoreans did not believe that the soul contained all psychological faculties, the soul was life and a harmony of physical elements. As such the soul passed away when certain arrangements of these elements ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concept of Woman: The Early Humanist Reformation, 1250-1500, Part 1|author=Prudence Allen|publisher=Wm.

===Vegetarianism===
[[File:Do Not Eat Beans.jpg|thumb|200px|Pythagoras and [[Vicia faba|faba beans]], French, 1512/1514.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Pythagoreans refused to eat beans. Already in antique times there was much speculation about the reason for this custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D. McKirahan|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781603846127|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some Medieval authors refer to a "Pythagorean diet", entailing the abstention from eating meat, beans or fish.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the popular treatise by Antonio Cocchi, ''Del vitto pitagorico per uso della medicina'', Firenze 1743, which initiated a debate on the "Pythagorean diet".&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoreans believed that a vegetarian diet fostered a healthy body and enhanced the search for [[Arete]]. The purpose of vegetarianism in Pythagoreanism was not self-denial, instead it was regarded as conductive to the best in a human being. Pythagoreans advanced a grounded theory on the treatment of animals. They believed that any being that experienced pain or suffer, should not have pain inflicted on it unnecessarily. Because it was not necessary to inflict pain on animals for humans to enjoy a healthy diet, they believed that animals should not be killed for the purpose of eating them. The Pythagoreans advanced the argument that unless an animal posed a threat to a human, it was not justifiable to kill an animal and that doing so would diminish the moral status of a human. By failing to show justice to the animal, humans diminish themselves.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 539"/&gt;

Pythagoreans believed that human beings were animals, but with an advanced intellect and therefore humans had to purify themselves through training. Through purification humans could join the psychic force that pervaded the cosmos. Pythagoreans reasoned that the logic of this argument could not be avoided by killing an animal painlessly. The Pythagoreans also thought that animals were sentient and minimally rational.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 540"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Lifen|author=Gordon Lindsay Campbell|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780191035159|pages=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments advanced by Pythagoreans convinced numerous of their philosopher contemporaries to adopt a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 539"/&gt; The Pythagorean sense of kinship with non-humans positioned them as a counterculture in the dominant meat-eating culture.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 540"/&gt; The philosopher [[Empedocles]] is said to have refused the customary [[blood sacrifice]] by offering a substitute sacrifice after his victory in a horse race in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; 

Late-Pythagorean philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school of philosophy and in the 4th century AD the head of the [[Platonic Academy]] [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemon]] included vegetarianism in his concept of living according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|author=Charles H. Kahn|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2001|isbn=9781603846820|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD [[Ovid]] identified Pythagoras as the first opponent to meat-eating.&lt;ref name="Gordon Lindsay Campbell 2014 540"/&gt; But the fuller argument Pythagoreans advanced against the maltreatment of animals did not sustain. Pythagorean had argued that certain types of food arouse the passions and hindered spiritual ascent. Thus [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] would rely on Pythagorean's teachings when arguing that abstinence from eating meat for the purpose of spiritual purification should be practiced only by philosophers, whose aim was to reach a divine state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Lifen|author=Gordon Lindsay Campbell|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780191035159|pages=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women philosophers==
The biographical tradition on Pythagoras holds that his mother, wife and daughters were part of his inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pomeroy|first1=Sarah B.|title=Pythagorean Women|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9781421409573|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were given equal opportunity to study as Pythagoreans and learned practical domestic skills in addition to philosophy.&lt;ref name=glenn&gt;Glenn, Cheryl, ''Rhetoric Retold: Regendering the Tradition from Antiquity Through the Renaissance''.

Many of the surviving texts of women Pythagorean philosophers are part of a collection, known as ''pseudoepigrapha Pythagorica'', which was compiled by Neopythagoreans in the 1st or 2nd century. Some surviving fragments of this collection are by early-Pythagorean women philosophers, while the bulk of surviving writings are from late-Pythagorean women philosophers who wrote in the 4th and 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Female Pythagoreans are some of the first female philosophers from which texts have survived. 

[[Theano of Croton]], the wife of Pythagoras, is considered a major figure in early-Pythagoreanism. She was noted as distinguished philosopher and in the lore that surrounds her, is said to have taken over the leadership of the school after his death. Text fragments have also survived from women philosophers of the late-Pythagorean period. These include [[Perictione I]], [[Perictione II]], [[Aesara of Lucania]] and [[Phintys of Sparta]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Scholars believe that [[Perictione I]] was an Athenian and contemporary of [[Plato]], because in ''On the Harmony of Woman'' she wrote in [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and used the same terms of [[virtues]] as Plato had done in his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' - ''andreia'', ''sophrosyne'', ''dikaiosyne'' and ''sophia''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In ''On the Harmony of Woman'' Perictione I outlines the condition that enable women to nurture wisdom and self-control. These virtues will, according to Perictione I, bring "worthwhile things" for a woman, her husband, her children, the household and even the city "if, at any rate, such a woman should govern cities and tribes". Her assertion that a wife should remain devoted to her husband, regardless of his behavior, has been interpreted by scholars as pracmatic response to the legal rights of [[Women in Classical Athens|women in Athens]].&lt;ref name="auto14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Rhetorics and Rhetoricians: Critical Studies and Sources|authors=Michelle Ballif &amp; Michael G.

==Influence on Plato &amp; Aristotle ==
[[Image:Meta-moerbeke jpeg031-part.jpg|thumb|Book 7 of Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] - the word 'being' is meant in many ways. Aristotle wrote a treatise on the Pythagoreans of which only fragments survive. In these he treats Pythagoras as a wonder-working religious teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Thought: A Guide to Classical Knowledge|author=Pierre Pellegrin|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000|isbn= 9780674002616|pages=918}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Pythagoras' teachings and Pythagoreanism influenced [[Plato]]’s writings on physical cosmology, psychology, ethics and political philosophy in the 5th century BC. However, Plato adhered to the dominant Greek philosophy, and the Platonic philosophy suppressed the combination of experimental method and mathematics which was an inherent part of Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref name="auto15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J. Vamvacas|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9781402097911|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Pythagoreanism extended throughout and beyond antiquity because the Pythagorean doctrine of reincarnation was recounted in Plato's ''[[Gorgias]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic]]'', while the Pythagorean cosmology was discussed in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. The possible influence of Pythagoreanism on Plato's concept of harmony and the [[Platonic solids]] has been discussed extensively. Plato's dialogues have become an important surviving source of Pythagorean philosophic arguments.&lt;ref name="auto16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D. McKirahan|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781603846127|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato referenced [[Philolaus]] in ''Phaedo'' and wrote an Platonic adaptation of Philolaus' metaphysical system of limiters and unlimiteds. Plato also quoted from one of the surviving [[Archytas]] fragments in the ''Republic''. However, Plato's views that the primary role of mathematics was to turn the soul towards the world of forms, as expressed in ''Timaeus'', is regarded as Platonic philosophy, rather than Pythagorean.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC rejected mathematics as a tool for investigation and understanding of the world. He believed that numbers constituted simply a quantitative determinant and had no [[ontological]] value.&lt;ref name="auto15"/&gt; Aristotle's discussion of Pythagorean philosophy is difficult to interpret, because he had little patience for Pythagorean philosophic arguments and Pythagoreanism does not fit with his philosophic doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy Before Socrates (Second Edition): An Introduction with Texts and Commentary: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary|author=Richard D.

==Neopythagoreanism==
{{Main|Neopythagoreanism}}
The Neopythagoreans were a school and a religious community. The revival of Pythagoreanism has been attributed to [[Publius Nigidius Figulus]], [[Eudorus]] and [[Arius Didymus]]. In the 1st century AD [[Moderatus of Gades]] and [[Nicomachus of Gerasa]] emerged as leading teachers of Neopythagoreanism.&lt;ref name="Everett Ferguson 2013 804"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, Second Edition|author=Everett Ferguson|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781136611582|pages=804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, and Influence|author=Christoph Riedweg|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801474521|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant Neopythagorean teacher was [[Apollonius of Tyana]] in the 1st century AD, who was regarded as a sage and lived as [[Asceticism|ascet]]. The last Neopythagorean philosopher was [[Numenius of Apamea]] in the 2nd century. Neopythagoreanism remained an elite movement which in the 3rd century merged into [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref name="Everett Ferguson 2013 804"/&gt;

Neopythagoreans combined Pythagorean teachings with [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]], [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophic traditions. Two tendencies within Neopythagorean philosophy emerged, one that owed much to Stoic [[monism]] and another that relied on Platonic [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Neopythagoreans refined the idea of God and located him beyond the finite so that God could not come into contact with anything corporeal. Neopythagoreans insisted on a spiritual worship of God and that life had to be purified through [[abstinence]].&lt;ref name="Everett Ferguson 2013 804"/&gt;

Neopythagoreans manifested a strong interest in numerology and the superstitious aspects of Pythagoreanism. They combined this with the teachings of Plato's philosophic successors. Neopythagorean philosophers engaged in the common ancient practice of ascribing their doctrines to the designated ''founder'' of their philosophy and by crediting their doctrines to Pythagoras himself, they hoped to gain authority for their views.&lt;ref name="auto16"/&gt;

==Later influence==
===On early Christianity===
[[File:Sacrobosco sphaera1.jpg|thumb|Heavily annotated copy of ''[[De sphaera mundi|De Sphaera]]'' of [[Sacrobosco]].]]

[[Christianity in the 1st century]] was influenced by a Christianized form of [[Platonism]], which had been set out in the four books of the ''Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum'' - ''The Celestrial Hierarchy'', ''The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'', ''On Divine Names'' and ''The Mystical Theology''. Having been attributed to [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the books explained the relationship among celestrial beings, humans, God and the universe. At the heart of the explanation were [[numbers]]. According to ''The Celestrial Hierarchy'' the universe consisted of a threefold division - [[heaven]], earth and [[hell]]. Sunlight lit up the universe and was proof of God’s presence.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 118"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages this numerological division of the universe was credited to the Pythagoreans, while in the 1st century it was regarded as an authoritative source of Christian doctrine by [[Photius]] and [[John of Sacrobosco]]. The ''Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum'' was to be referenced in the late Middle Ages by [[Dante]] and in the [[Renaissance]] a new translation of it was produced by [[Marsilio Ficino]].&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 119"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christian theologians, such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], adopted the [[ascetic]] doctrines of the neopythagoreans.&lt;ref name="Everett Ferguson 2013 804"/&gt; The moral and ethical teachings of Pythagorean influenced early [[Christianity]] and assimilated into early Christian texts. The ''Sextou gnomai'' (''[[Sentences of Sextus]]''), a  [[Hellenistic]] Pythagorean text modified to reflect a Christian viewpoint, existed from at least the 2nd century and remained popular among Christians well into the [[Middle Ages]]. The ''Sentences of Sextus'' consisted of 451 sayings or principles, such as injunctions to love the truth, to avoid the pollution of the body with pleasure, to shun flatterers and to let one’s tongue be harnessed by one’s mind. The contents of the ''Sentences of Sextus'' was attributed by [[Iamblichus]], the 1st century biographer of Pythagoras, to ''Sextus Pythagoricus''. The assertion was repeated subsequently by [[Saint Jerome]]. In the 2nd century many of the ''Sentences of Sextus'' were cited by [[Plutarch]] as Pythagorean aphorisms. The ''Sentences of Sextus'' were translated into [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]] and [[Arabic]], then the written language of both Muslims and Jews, but only in the Latin world did they become a guide to daily life that was widely circulated.&lt;ref name="Christiane L.

===On Numerology===
[[File:Tetractys.svg|thumb|Pythagoras is credited with having devised the [[tetractys]],{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}} an important [[Religious symbol|sacred symbol]] in later Pythagoreanism.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}]]

In the 1st century treatises of [[Philo]] and [[Nicomachus]] popularised the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to [[number]]s. This interest in Pythagorean views on the importance of numbers was sustained by mathematicians such as [[Theon of Smyrna]], [[Anatolius]] and [[Iamblichus]]. These mathematicians relied on [[Plato]]’s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' as source for Pythagorean philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] studies and adaptations of ''Timaeus'' solidified the view that there was a numerical explanation for [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] and [[harmony]] among learned men. Pythagoreanism, as mediated in Plato’s ''Timaeus'', spurned increasingly detailed studies of [[symmetry]] and harmony. Intellectuals pondered how knowledge of the [[geometry]] in which God had arranged the [[universe]] could be applied to life. By the 12th century Pythagorean numerological concepts had become a universal language in Medieval Europe and were no longer recognized as Pythagorean.&lt;ref name="auto18"/&gt; Writers such as [[Thierry of Chartres]], [[William of Conches]] and [[Alexander Neckham]] referenced classical writers that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], leading them to believe that mathematics was the key to understanding [[astronomy]] and [[nature]]. Another important text on Pythagorean numerology was [[Boethius]]’s ''De arithmetica'', which was widely reproduced in the West. Boethius had relied on [[Nicomachus]]’s writings as a source of Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 120"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Byzantine world the influential professor of philosophy [[Michael Psellus]] in the 11th century popularised Pythagorean numerology in his treatise on theology, arguing that Plato was the inheritor of the Pythagorean secret. Psellus also attributed arithmetical inventions by [[Diophantus]] to Pythagoras. Psellus thought to reconstruct [[Iamblichus]]’ 10 book encyclopedia on Pythagoreanism from surviving fragments, leading to the popularisation of Iamblichus' description of Pythagorean physics, ethics and theology at the Byzantine court. Psellus was reputably in the possession of the [[Hermetica]], a set of texts thought to be genuinely antique and which would be prolifically reproduced in the late Middle Ages. [[Manuel Bryennius]] introduced Pythagorean numerology to Byzantine music with his treatise ''Harmonics''. He argued that the [[octave]] was essential in attaining perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jewish communities the development of the [[Kabbalah]] as esoteric doctrine was periated with numerology. It was only in the 1st century that [[Philo of Alexandria]], developed a Jewish Pythagoreanism. In the 3rd century [[Hermippus]] popularised the belief that Pythagoras had been the basis for establishing key dates in Judaism. In the 4th century this assertion was further developed by [[Aristobulus of Alexandria|Aristobulus]]. The Jewish Pythagorean numerology developed by Philo held that God as the unique One was the creator of all numbers, of which seven was the most divine and ten the most perfect. The medieval edition of the Kabbalah focused largely on a cosmological scheme of creation, in reference to early Pythagorean philosophers [[Philolaus]] and [[Empedocles]], and helped to disseminate Jewish Pythagorean numerology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L.

===On Mathematics===
[[Image:Liber abbaci magliab f124r.jpg|thumb|A page of [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' from the [[National Central Library (Florence)|Biblioteca Nazionale di Firenze]] showing (in box on right) the [[Fibonacci sequence]] with the position in the sequence labeled in Roman numerals and the value in [[Eastern Arabic numerals]].]]

[[Nicomachus]]' treatises were well known in Greek, Latin and the Arabic worlds. In the 1st century an Arabic translation of Nicomachus’ ''Introduction to Arithmetic'' was published. The Arabic translations of Nicomachus' treatises were in turn translated into Latin by [[Gerard of Cremona]], making them part of the Latin tradition of numerology. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] was referenced in Arabic manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 120"/&gt; Scholars in the Arabic world displayed a strong interest in Pythagorean concepts. In the 1st century [[Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani]] discussed [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] in a treatise on arithmetic for business administrators in reference to Nicomachus. However, the primary interest of Islamic arithmeticians was in solving practical problems, such as [[taxation]], [[measurement]], the estimation of agricultural values and business applications for the buying and selling of goods. There was little interest for the Pythagorean numerology that developed in the Latin world. The primary arithmetical system used by Islamic mathematicians was based on [[Indian mathematics|Hindu arithmetic]], which rejected the notion that the relations between numbers and geometrical forms were symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the enthusiasm that developed in the Latin and Byzantine worlds in the Middle Ages for Pythagorean numerology, the Pythagorean tradition of perfect numbers inspired profound scholarship in [[mathematics]]. In the 13th century [[Leonardo of Pisa]], better known as Fibonacci, published the ''Libre quadratorum'' (''[[The Book of Squares]]''). Fibonacci had studied scripts from Egypt, Syria, Greece and Sicily, and was learned in Hindu, Arabic and Greek methodologies. Using the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] instead of the [[Roman numerals]], he explored numerology as it had been set forth by Nicomachus. Fibonacci observed that [[square numbers]] always arise through the addition of consecutive odd numbers starting with unity. Fibonacci put forward a method of generating sets of three square numbers that satisfied the relationship first attributed to Pythagoras by [[Vitruvius]], that  {{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This equation is now known as the [[Pythagorean triple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], from the 5th till the 15th century, Pythagorean texts remained popular. Late antique writers had produced adaptions of the ''[[Sentences of Sextus]]'' as ''[[The golden verses of Pythagoras]]''. The ''Golden Verses'' gained popularity and Christian adaptations of it appeared. These Christian adaptations were adopted by [[monastic orders]], such as [[Saint Benedict]], as authoritative Christian doctrine. In the Latin medieval western world, the ''Golden Verses'' became a widely reproduced text.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 117"/&gt;

Although the concept of the [[quadrivium]] originated with [[Archytas]] in the 4th century BC and was a familiar concept among academics in the antiquity, it was attributed as Pythagorean in the 5th century by [[Proclus]]. According to Proclus, Pythagoreanism divided all mathematical sciences into four categories - [[arithmetic]], [[music]], [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]]. [[Boethius]] developed this theory further, arguing that a fourfold path led to the attainment of knowledge. Arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy went on to become the essential parts of [[curriculum]]s in medieval [[school]]s and [[universities]]. In the 12th century Pythagoras was credited by [[Hugh of Saint Victor]] with having written a book on quadrivium. The role of harmony had its roots in the triadic thinking of Plato and Aristotle and included the trivium of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectic]]. From the 9th century onwards, both the quadrivium and the trivium were commonly taught in schools and the newly emerging universities. They came to be known as the [[Seven liberal arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|author=Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780801474095|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 6th century the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] popularized Pythagorean and Platonic conceptions of the universe and expounded the supreme importance of [[ratio|numerical ratios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|authors=David C. Lindberg, Roy Porter, Katharine Park, Lorraine Daston, Mary Jo Nye, Theodore M. Porter, Dorothy Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521572446|page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th century Bishop [[Isidore of Seville]] expressed his preference for the Pythagorean vision of a universe governed by the mystical properties of certain numbers, over the newly emerging [[Euclid|Euclidean]] notion that knowledge could be built through deductive proofs. Isidore relied on the [[arithmetic]] of [[Nicomachus]], who had fashioned himself as heir of Pythagoras, and took things further by studying the [[etymology]] of the name of each number.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 119"/&gt; The 12th century theologian [[Hugh of Saint Victor]] found Pythagorean numerology so alluring that he set out to explain the human body entirely in numbers. In the 13th century the fashion for numerology dwindled. The Christian scholar [[Albertus Magnus]] rebuked the preoccupation with Pythagorean numerology, arguing that nature could not only be explained in terms of numbers.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 120"/&gt; [[Plato]]’s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' became a popular source on the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to [[numbers]]. The preoccupation for finding a numerical explanation for [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] and [[harmony]] culminated in the [[French cathedrals]] of the 11th, 12th and 13th century.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 118"/&gt; 

Arabic translations of the ''Golden Verses'' were produced in the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 117"/&gt; In the Medieval Islamic world a Pythagorean tradition took hold, whereby spheres or stars produced music. This doctrine was further developed by [[Ikhwan al-Safa]] and [[al-Kindi]], who pointed to the similarity between the harmony of music and the harmony of the soul. But Islamic philosophers such as [[al-Farabi]] and [[Ibn Sina]] vehemently rejected this Pythagorean doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jawanmardi|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780748688159|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir]]'' Al-Farabi rejected the notion of celestial harmony on the grounds that it was "plainly wrong" and that it was not possible for the heavens, orbs and stars to emit sounds through their motions.&lt;ref name="auto17"/&gt;

The four books of the ''Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum'' - ''The Celestrial Hierarchy'', ''The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'', ''On Divine Names'' and ''The Mystical Theology'', by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], became enormously popular during the Middle Ages in the [[Byzantine]] world, were they had first been published in the 1st century, but also the Latin world when they were translated in the 9th century. The division of the universe into [[heaven]], earth and [[hell]], and the 12 orders of heaven were credited as Pythagoras’ teachings by an anonymous biographer, who was quoted in the treatise of the 9th century Byzantine patriarch [[Photius]]. The 13th century astronomer and mathematician [[John of Sacrobosco]] in turn credited Pseudo-Dionysius when discussing the twelve [[signs of the zodiac]].&lt;ref name="Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier 2007 118"/&gt;

In the Middle Ages various classical texts that discussed Pythagorean ideas were reproduced and translated. Plato’s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' was translated and republished with commentary in the Arab and Jewish worlds. In the 12th century the study of Plato gave rise to a vast body of literature explicating the glory of God as it reflected in the orderliness of the universe. Writers such as [[Thierry of Chartres]], [[William of Conches]] and [[Alexander Neckham]] referenced not only Plato but also other classical authors that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. William of Conches argued that Plato was an important Pythagorean. In this medieval Pythagorean understanding of Plato, God was a craftsman when he designed the universe.&lt;ref name="Christiane L.

In the 16th century [[Vincenzo Galilei]] challenged the prevailing Pythagorean wisdom about the relationship between pitches and weights attached to strings. Vincenzo Galilei, the father of [[Galileo Galilei]], engaged in an extended public exchange with his former teacher [[Zarlino]]. Zarlino supported the theory that if two weights in the ratio of 2 to 1 were attached to two strings, the pitches generated by the two strings would produce the [[octave]]. Vincenzo Galilei proclaimed that he had been a committed Pythagorean, until he "ascertained the truth by means of experiment, the teacher of all things." He devised an experiment which showed that the weights attached to the two strings needed to increase as the square of the string length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|authors=David C.

At the height of the [[Scientific Revolution]], as [[Aristotelianism]] declined in Europe, the ideas of early-Pythagoreanism were revived. Mathematics regained importance and influenced philosophy as well as science. Mathematics was used by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, [[Huygens]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to advance physical laws that reflected the inherent order of the universe. Twenty-one centuries after Pythagoreas had taught his disciples in Italy, Galileo announced to the world that "the great book of nature" could only be read by those who understood the language of mathematics. He set out to measure whatever is measurable, and to render everything measurable that is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics|author=Constantine J.

It served as the basis for [[Kepler]]'s ''[[Harmonices Mundi|harmonices mundi]]'' and [[Leibniz]]'s ''[[pre-established harmony]]''.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; [[Einstein]] believed that through this ''pre-established harmony'', the productive unison between the spiritual and material world was possible.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;

This mathematization of the physical reality climaxed in the 20th century. The pioneer of [[physics]] [[Werner Heisenberg]] argued that "this mode of observing nature, which led in part to a true dominion over natural forces and thus contributes decisively to the development of humanity, in an unforeseen manner vindicated the Pythagorean faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Founders of Western Thought – The Presocratics |author=Constantine J.

{{Taoism}}
{{Chinese|title=Quanzhen|t=全眞|s=全真|p=Quán Zhēn|l=All True}}
The '''Quanzhen School''' is a branch of [[Taoism]] that originated in [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115–1234).&lt;ref name=qtbta&gt;{{cite web|title=Quanzhen Tradition|url=http://www.taoists.co.uk/main_files/quanzhen.htm|publisher=British Taoist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its founders was the Taoist [[Wang Chongyang]], who lived in the early Jin. When the [[Mongols]] invaded the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) in 1254, the Quanzhen Taoists exerted great effort in keeping the peace, thus saving thousands of lives, particularly among those of [[Han Chinese]] descent.

==Foundation principles==
The meaning of Quanzhen can be translated literally to "''All True''" and for this reason, it is often called the "''All Truth Religion''" or the "''Way of Completeness and Truth.''" In some texts, it is also referred to as the "''Way of Complete Perfection.''"
Kunyu mountain in Shandong province [[Weihai]] city is the birthplace of Quan Zhen Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Kunyu mountain-birthplace of Quan Zhen Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 
With strong Taoist roots, the Quanzhen School specializes in the process of "[[alchemy]] within the body" or ''[[Neidan]]'' ([[internal alchemy]]), as opposed to ''[[Waidan]]'' (external alchemy which experiments with the ingestion of [[herb]]s and minerals, etc.). The Waidan tradition has been largely replaced by Neidan, as Waidan was a sometimes dangerous and lethal pursuit. Quanzhen focuses on internal cultivation of the person which is consistent with the pervading Taoist desire for attaining [[Wu wei|Wu Wei]], which is essentially unconscious action.

Like most Taoists, Quanzhen priests were particularly concerned with [[longevity]] and [[immortality]] through alchemy, harmonising oneself with the [[Tao]], studying the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]], and ideas on balance consistent with [[yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] theory. The school is also known for using Buddhist and Confucian ideas.

==History==
According to traditional legend, [[Wang Chongyang]] met two Taoist immortals in the summer of 1159 CE. The immortals, [[Zhongli Quan]] and [[Lü Dongbin]] taught him Taoist beliefs and trained him in secret rituals. The meeting proved deeply influential, and roughly a year later, in 1160, Wang met one of these men again. In this second encounter, he was provided with a set of five written instructions which led to his decision of living by himself in a grave he created for himself in Zhongnan Mountain for three years.

After seven years of living in the Mountain (three inside the grave and another four in a hut he later called "Complete Perfection Hut"), Wang met two of his seven future disciples, Tan Chuduan and [[Qiu Chuji]]. In 1167, Wang traveled to [[Shandong|Shandong Province]] and met Ma Yu and Ma's wife [[Sun Bu'er]] who became his students. These and others would become part of the seven Quanzhen disciples, who were later known as the Seven Masters of Quanzhen.

After Wang's departure, it was left to his disciples to continue expounding the Quanzhen beliefs. Ma Yu succeeded Wang as head of the school, while Sun Bu'er went on to establish the Purity and Tranquility School, one of the foremost branches of Quanzhen.

Another notable disciple of Wang was Qiu Chuji who founded the famous [[White Cloud Monastery]] in [[Beijing]]. Qiu Chuji was the founder of the school called [[Dragon Gate Taoism]]. Qiu was on good terms with the [[Mongols|Mongol]] monarch [[Genghis Khan]] who put him in charge of religious affairs in [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol-controlled China]]. As a result, the Quanzhen School of Taoism continued to flourish long after Wang's death, right through to the present.

==Branches and sects==
The seven disciples of [[Wang Chongyang]] continue expounding the Quanzhen beliefs. The seven Masters of Quanzhen established the following seven branches.

*Ma Yu (馬鈺): Yuxian lineage (Meeting the Immortals, 遇仙派)
*Tan Chuduan (譚處端): Nanwu lineage (Southern Void, 南无派)
*Liu Chuxuan (劉處玄): Suishan lineage (Mount Sui, 随山派)
*[[Qiu Chuji]] (丘處機): Longmen lineage ([[Dragon Gate Taoism]], 龙门派)
*[[Wang Chuyi]] (王處一): Yushan lineage (Mount Yu, 崳山派)
*Hao Datong (郝大通): Huashan lineage (Mount Hua, 华山派)
*[[Sun Bu'er]] (孫不二): Qingjing lineage (Purity and Tranquility Sect, 清静派)

The '''Rehabilitation Project Force''', or '''RPF''', is the [[Church of Scientology]]'s program for members of its [[Sea Org]]anization who have allegedly violated expectations or policies. This may include members who are deemed to have hidden evil intentions towards Scientology, members who are unproductive in their work or who produce poor-quality work.

The program includes manual labor tasks and the study of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s works. The rehabilitation program may take more than a year to complete, and the Church has been accused of overworking and mistreating its participants.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Janet Reitman | title=Inside Scientology | journal=Rolling Stone | year=2006 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-scientology-20110208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xenu.net/archive/go/legal/rvy.htm | title = Declaration in the case Church of Scientology International v.

==Development==

The Rehabilitation Project Force developed out of a predecessor group, the Mud Box Brigade, which was formed aboard [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s private fleet in the late 1960s. The mud box is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the [[bilge]] of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump. The Mud Box Brigade was assigned to clean out the mud box as well as fuel lines, water hues, bilges and other parts of the fleet's ships.&lt;ref name="lrh_oods"&gt;Hubbard, OODs of 4 January 1968, cited in ''Modern Management Technology Defined'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard defined the role as being essentially a punishment duty for unsatisfactory workers: "More candidates will be appointed regularly and promptly every time I find a freeloader who is loafing on post and drifting with the wind."&lt;ref name="lrh_oods" /&gt; Hubbard later clarified that "(T)his group is the most downstat [unproductive] and one gets assigned to it by being a freeloader, invisible on post, loafing and really goofing up on one's job."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Mud Box Brigade", Flag Order 1701 of 5 January 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], however, suggested that "Hubbard understood it in terms of making retribution to the people who had been harmed by the nonperformance or incorrect performance of one's assigned tasks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/melton.htm RPF - A Sociological Study], by [[J. Gordon Melton]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Hubbard replaced the Mud Box Brigade with the Rehabilitation Unit, again intended for those removed or disciplined "as ineffective or trouble." Following an evaluation, the individual was to receive a set of "specific recommendations which if followed will rehabilitate the individual as a highly effective and worthwhile Sea Org member." Hubbard instructed that "(T)he unit is [to be] worked hard during the day on a rigorous schedule on jobs assigned by the Review Chief handling corrective areas and jobs needing remedy and repair. The Unit itself is thus made into an effective ship's review team. It works on a one job, one time, one place formula completing each job before moving into the next. Each individual thus earns the right to the remedial services he or she will receive."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Rehabilitation Unit", Flag Order 1848 of 3 March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Rehabilitation Unit was replaced in January 1974 with the Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF. According to Hubbard, "the RPF has been created by the Commodore [Hubbard] so that redemption can occur. That is basically its only purpose." He identified four categories of people who were to be assigned to the RPF: "rockslammers" (people deemed to have hidden evil intentions, as detected by the [[E-meter]]); people who were unproductive and scored poorly on the [[Oxford Capacity Analysis]] personality test;  "repeated stat crashers", people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations' productivity; and "overt product makers", people who produced poor-quality work. As before, the unit was to work on "one job, one place, one time." A five-hour study period was to be implemented each day to improve the individuals' knowledge of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Rehabilitation Project Force", Flag Order 3434 of 7 January 1974&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David G. Bromley]] and [[Douglas E. Cowan]], the RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.&lt;ref name="GA181" /&gt;

The RPF was originally intended to last no more than a couple of months, where the assignee would learn [[Auditing (Scientology)|Scientology auditing]], if he or she was not already an auditor, by the "read it, drill it, do it" method. RPF members would then co-audit each other to better themselves and make each other more ethical and productive.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;

As punishment, RPF members are often made to wear black [[boiler suits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{care web|first=Tony|last=Ortega|url=http://tonyortega.org/2013/05/01/scientology-denied-ca-appeals-court-rules-for-documents-release-in-forced-abortion-lawsuit/dateaccessed=26 January 2015|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Critics of Scientology, including former Scientologists, have compared the RPF with the [[gulag]] system of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dr. Stephen A. Kent |title=Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Force (RPF) |date=1997-11-07 |url=http://www.hamburg.de/servlet/contentblob/109286/brainwashing-pdf/data.pdf |accessdate=2008-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030134428/http://www.hamburg.de/servlet/contentblob/109286/brainwashing-pdf/data.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2008 |df= }}  &lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the [[Sea Org]], even from the RPF, results in what Scientology calls "freeloader debt" or a "freeloader's bill":  retroactive billing for any auditing received or any Scientology training received while in the Sea Org, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. While this "freeloader debt" is not legally binding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stephen A. |last=Kent |authorlink=Stephen A.

In his book ''[[The Complex: An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology]]'', ex-Scientologist John Duignan describes RPF members living in a rat-infested basement, engaging in degrading jobs for years at a stretch, while denied visits with [[spouse]]s or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Duignan | first =John |author2=Nicola Tallant | title =The Complex: An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology  | publisher =Merlin Publishing  | date =October 7, 2008  | location =Dublin, Ireland  | pages = | isbn = 978-1-903582-84-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ritual of the Bacabs''''' is the name given to a manuscript from the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] containing shamanistic incantations written in the [[Yucatec Maya language]]. The manuscript was given its name by [[Mayanist]] [[William E. Gates]] due to the frequent mentioning of the Maya deities known as the [[Bacabs]]. A printed [[indulgence]] on the last pages dates it to 1779.

==Background==
The manuscript has been dated at the end of the 18th Century, though this is not certain. The style of writing in the manuscript suggests that much of the information included was copied from older works. The work references many figures in Maya mythology who are for the most part unknown from other works. 

The manuscript was discovered in the winter of 1914&amp;ndash;1915 by Frederic J. Smith through unknown circumstances. William Gates acquired it soon after, and gave it the name by which it is known by today. Athlete [[Robert Garrett]] purchased it from Gates in 1930. In 1942, Garrett gave it to Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. It would later join Garrett's other contributions to the Princeton University Library in 1949, where it remains today.

The text was first described by [[Alfred M. Tozzer]] in a publication from 1921. The first, and so far only, translation of the work was completed by Ralph L. Roys in 1965. Roys made his translation using photocopies provided by an employee of the Newberry Library of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1965: vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Ritual of the Bacabs'' includes some forty-two main incantations, with fragmentary supplements throughout. Most of the manuscript is written in the same hand. In his translation, Roys referred to this main writer as the "Bacabs hand."&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1965: 175&lt;/ref&gt;

There are intrusive passages written in a different hand on pages 20, 21, 62, and 63. Page 70 includes a medical prescription in a different hand. Of the last twenty-four pages, eighteen discuss medicine and plant lore (pp.&amp;nbsp;215–227, 229–230, and 236–237), three include fragmentary incantation (pp.&amp;nbsp;231, 233, and 235), and three are blank (pp.&amp;nbsp;228, 232, and 234). These final parts of the text and the first three pages have never been translated. It is unknown if these last twenty-four pages are written in the same hand as the bulk of the manuscript or in another. In translating the work, Roys wrote "I do not feel competent to comment on the handwriting."&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1965: 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The incantations make several references to Can Ahau, which is either the day 4 Ahau or an alternate spelling of Caan Ahau ("Sky Lord"). Other "proper names" may really be titles. The name Hun-pic-ti-ku ("Eight-Thousand Gods"), which appears in the eighth incantation, may be derived from the Tahdziu deity Hunpic Dziu ("Eight Thousand Cowbirds") or the Izamal deity Hunpic Tok ("Eight Thousand Flints"), or it may be a collective term for all Maya gods.

Diseases and the diseased are also personified in the incantations. In the seventeenth incantation, dealing with the "snake-pulsation-of-the abodomen," the affliction is described as the son of Ix Hun Tipplah Can ("Lady Unique Pulsating Sky").

There are a few references to Christianity in the text. Almost every incantation ends with "Amen," and the thirty-ninth uses "Jesus Mary" (''Jesuz Maria'') as an exclamation.

''Ritual of the Bacabs'' is filled with symbolism that has long since lost its significance and meaning. In his ''Maya History and Religion'', J. Eric S. Thompson wrote: "The only parallel which comes to mind of the [[Book of Revelation]]. Many plants, birds, and insects, all clothed in symbolism and allusions to lost mythology, are important features...even in translation the incantations are very hard to comprehend."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scientology Justice''' system is the [[Church of Scientology]]'s internal means of assessing and dealing with violations of [[Ethics (Scientology)|their code of ethics]]. These violations include those outside the Church as well as within it.

''[[The Scientology Handbook]]'', a compilation of texts by founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], says "When the individual fails to put in his own [[Ethics (Scientology)|ethics]], the group takes action against him and this is called justice" and also notes that "Man cannot be trusted with justice. The truth is, man cannot really be trusted with 'punishment'." &lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology, ''The Scientology Handbook'', 1994 hardcover edition, pg.361–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee of Evidence==
A ''Committee of Evidence'', abbreviated as "Comm Ev", is a [[tribunal]] that deals with serious offenses.  According to Scientology policy, the Committee of Evidence is only convened at a church member's request or when there is evidence of serious wrongdoing by a church member.

===Administrative procedure===
Administratively, the Committee of Evidence is initiated by a convening authority, usually the LRH Communicator of the organization.  This person does so at the request, usually, of another church executive who makes formal accusations of violations of church [[Ethics (Scientology)|ethics]] codes. A [[chairman]], a [[secretary]], and two to five other members are chosen by the convening authority who must be "senior" to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 24 February 1972, "Injustice" pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Their task is to read and hear evidence for and against the accused church member. They have two weeks to complete the Committee of Evidence. Committee of Evidence policy explicitly bars any legal representation for the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 17 July 1966 Issue II, "Evidence, Admissibility of in Hearings, Boards or Committees"&lt;/ref&gt;

After reviewing evidence, the secretary and members vote on whether they think the accused church member is [[Guilty (law)|guilty]] or not guilty of each of the presented charges. Conviction on a charge is by majority vote.  The Committee of Evidence then recommends punishment, which in principle, must be done in accordance with L. Ron Hubbard's policies. The outcome of a Committee of Evidence is issued in a document called the "Findings and Recommendations". All Committee of Evidence members must sign this document whether they agree with it or not.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office HCOPL 7 September 1963, "Committees of Evidence, Scientology Jurisprudence, Administration of" p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The only means of recourse are: A review Committee of Evidence, where the committee is supposed to just listen to the recordings and review the documents of the original Committee of Evidence, then issue new Findings and Recommendations, a petition by the accused church member to have the Committee of Evidence cancelled, which is directed to an executive highly placed in the church hierarchy or a Board of Review in which the charges are reviewed by newly appointed Committee of Evidence members. Both the Board of Review and the Review Committee of Evidence have the option of making new recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 24 February 1972 Issue I, "Injustice", Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 7 September 1963, "Committees of Evidence, Scientology Jurisprudence, Administration of".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 22 September 1963, "Concerning Committees of Evidence".&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Committee of Evidence in practice==
In a lecture given on 2 August 1970, Hubbard admitted that Committees of Evidence were very unpopular with Scientologists: "..This, of course, requires something that is very unpopular, which is a Committee of Evidence."&lt;ref&gt;700802–1 A Short Briefing to Guardians Office Technical Personnel, 23 minutes into the lecture&lt;/ref&gt;
Committee of Evidence members face being investigated and prosecuted by a Committee of Evidence themselves if the convening authority believes they were not aggressive enough in pursuit of the Committee of Evidence findings.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 24 February 1965, "Addendum to HCO Policy Letter of 7 Sept. 63 Committees of Evidence, Scientology Jurisprudence, Administration of"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of Ethics==
A court of ethics is convened by an ethics officer or church executive senior to the church staff member being charged. The offenses being accused are of non-serious nature and the sentences are at the discretion of the person who convened the court of ethics.  The court is not supposed to engage in investigation, but rather operate only on known evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 26 May 1965, "Courts of Ethics"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:gangaShankarMath.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Ganges river at Shankar Math, a Siddhayoga retreat'']]
The Tirtha lineage of '''Siddhayoga''' is a mystical sect of [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[Hinduism]] that relies on direct experience of life-force or [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini Shakti]] and understanding of Tantric scriptures ([[shastras]]). It holds the guru-disciple relationship to be of primary importance. Shakti is said to be automatically infused into the disciple (shisya) by the [[Guru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tirtha | first = Swami Shankar Purushottam | authorlink = Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha | title = Yoga Vani: Instructions for the Attainment of Siddhayoga | publisher = Sat Yuga Press | date = 1992 | location = New York | pages = 2–4 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}''"The easy way of attaining it (salvation) is said to be Siddhayoga...Siddhayoga or Siddhimarga is that means by which yoga (union) can be attained without difficulty...Siddhayoga is attained by the infusion of spiritual force through the good grace of a saintly preceptor...Siddhayoga or Siddhimarga is nothing but the knowledge of the unity of Self and Brahma..."''&lt;/ref&gt; in a process called [[Shaktipat]]. (''see also'' [[Satguru]])

There are many Siddhayoga lineages and many other groups not using the name that speak in terms of the infusion of kundalini shakti. Some lineages originated from the same source, others are completely unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/kundalini/siddha-mahayoga.html Siddha Mahayoga FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Siddhayoga is similar to sahajayoga, mahayoga or siddhamahayoga. Similar teachings may be traced back at least to the [[Tantra|Tantric]] masters such as the scholar [[Abhinavagupta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/kundalini/siddha-mahayoga.html#14 Siddha Mahayoga FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakti]] is held to be the energy of a universal soul, of which direct experience is available regardless of religion; thus siddhayoga is sometimes considered a universal rather than a strictly Hindu practice.

==Scriptural sources==
[[Image:Narayandev.png|left|thumb|''Siddha yoga guru Narayan Dev Tirtha'']]

Siddhayoga aims to uncover an eternal source of abundance for all to share&amp;nbsp;– peace, creativity, spiritual energy and eternal soul. The guru makes this happen for the disciple.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sadashiva Tirtha. Founder, Swami Narayan Tirtha Math; Author, ''Bhagavad Gita for Modern Time&amp; ''Ayurveda Encyclopedia''. Personal conversation, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Its most important text is the ''Yoga Vani''.

The siddhayoga guru prepares the kundalini shakti which automatically gets infused in the disciple at the [[muladhara]] [[chakra]], awakening and raising spiritual energy up the [[Nadi (yoga)|Sushumna]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Yoga Vani, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Various ancient texts discuss this effect of nearness to the guru. The ''Kularnava Tantra''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in ''Yoga Vani,'' 28&lt;/ref&gt; has; ''"An intelligent person should regard this teacher as their preceptor by whose contact inexpressible bliss is produced in the disciple."'' and the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]''&lt;ref&gt; quoted in ''Yoga Vani'' 27&lt;/ref&gt; confirms; ''"A real preceptor is one who can produce blissful sensation in the body of the disciple by their sight, touch, or instructions."''

Siddhayoga is said to be an internal transformation, allowing a person to grow more into their nature regardless of their outer path, rites and rituals; what they do and how they do it in the outer world is unique to their own individual path ([[dharma]]). One who yearns to connect with their soul or God, who strives for mental peace and harmony with all people, animals, and nature, who tries to live in balance with nature's rhythms and who aims to live purposefully will find these higher desires fulfilled in experiencing of soul and developing of inner divine love.

==Siddhayoga lineage==
[[Image:SSPT.gif|thumb|right|''Sri Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji Maharaj'']]
'''[[Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha]]''' descended from two monastic lines. He was first initiated into Siddhayoga by Swami Narayana Dev Tirtha [born circa 1879], whose own spiritual lineage was through Swami Gangadhara Tirtha. [[Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha]] then took [[sannyas]] under [[Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha|Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha]] in Puri. During [[Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha|Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha]]ji's visit to America, [[Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha]] was asked to maintain the holy seat of [[Shankaracharya]] of Puri Govardhan Mutt. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji was not keen to be bound by the obligations pertaining to the office of Shankaracharya, including administrative responsibilities. His greater objective was to spread the thought of God among all people. As a result, brushing aside the honour of and fascination for the position of Shankaracharya, he set out, proceeding to the north in the direction of the Himalayas, always an attraction to yogis, seers, and sages as the ideal place for sadhana. The King of Tehri Garhwal, appreciative of the blessings he received from Swamiji, expressed his desire to donate a vast stretch of land by the Ganga, but Swamiji accepted only a modest plot after repeated entreaties of the king. Thus, the ashrama named "Shankar Math" Uttarkashi was established in 1933. Later, another Math  in Varanasi's Chhoti Gaibi, named "Siddhayogashram" was founded in 1934. [[Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha]] wrote several books such as '''Yogavani''', '''Japa Sadhana''', and '''Guruvani''' which were originally written in Bengali, later translated into Hindi. He also wrote a short treatise in English, entitled '''Who Am I'''?&lt;ref&gt;Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha's ''Yoga Vani: Instructions for the Attainment of Siddhayoga'' and ''Guru Bani: 100 Ways to Attain Inner Peace'' have been published in Bengali, Hindi, and English.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha]] [1888-1958] was the guru of Swami Narayana Tirtha [ -2001]. [[Swami Vishnu Tirtha]] was another disciple of Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. He was initiated in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Swami Vishnu Tirth Ji Maharaj | publisher= | url =http://www.shivomworld.com/lineage/swamivishnutirthji.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Shivom Tirtha]], a disciple of Swami Vishnu Tirtha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Swami Shivom Tirth Ji Maharaj | publisher= | url =http://www.shivomworld.com/lineage/swamishivom.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a website dedicated to him that explains the Tirtha Siddhayoga lineage tree in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title= Gurus of Tirth Lineage | publisher= | url =http://www.shivomworld.com/lineage/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tirtha lineage of [[Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha|Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha]] [1884-1960] traces itself back to Sri [[Adi Shankara]]charya. In legend the lineage ([[parampara]]) began when Lord Narayana passed the eternal Vedic wisdom to Brahma, Brahma to Vasishtha, onto Shakti, to Parashara, to Veda Vyasa, and to Shuka.  Thus far the lineage was from father to son. From Shuka it was passed on from guru to shishya, to Patanjali, then to Gaudapada, Govinda, Chandra Sharma and so to Adi Shankara. This began the tradition of wandering monks. Vyasa told Govinda of the advent of the incarnation of [[Shiva]] as [[Adi Shankara]], to meet and give him [[sanyas]] [[diksha]], Shankara's purpose in incarnating was to comment on the [[Brahma Sutras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kuppuswami | first = A | authorlink = | title = Sri Bhagavatpada Shankaracharya | publisher = Chokhamba Sanskrit Series | date = 1972 | location = Varanasi | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankaracharya set up four religious seats in the north, south, east and west of India to act as a lighthouse to guide religious seekers towards the truth for the millennia to come and also set up the ten monastic orders. 1) Tirtha, 2) Ashrama, 3) Vana, 4) Aranya, 5) Giri, 6) Parvata, 7) Sagara, 8) Saraswati, 9) Bharati, 10) Puri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saraswati | first = His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Chandrasekharendra; Sri Shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Pitha | authorlink = | title = Adi Shankara, His Life and Times | publisher = Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan | date = 1988 | location = Mumbai | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faith in the guru== 

::''"Keep firm in faith unfathomable. Faith is [[samādhi]] - nothing more."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tirtha | first = Swami Narayan Tirtha | authorlink = Swami Narayan Tirtha | language = Bengali | title = Guru Ka Khamrit | publisher = Siddhayogashram | date = 2000 | location = Siddhayogashram, D60/23 Choti Gaibi, Varanasi 221010, India | pages = 323 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with much [[Hindu]] or [[Vedic]] [[mysticism]], Siddhayoga's goal of life is to realize one is eternal soul and not this body.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Suffering is said to be caused by identifying with body, emotions, or thoughts, rather than with true nature.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Vani, 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of a discipline may become unnatural because they are artificially imposed: even when doing one's best to remain balanced and free one often finds oneself once again bound. Siddhayoga says that through the grace of a Siddhayoga [[guru]] all the work is done for you.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; You do not force anything; you are not charged anything or asked for anything by the guru&amp;nbsp;– so there is no conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Vani, 30&lt;/ref&gt; One gains peace through direct experience of peace, not from intellectual knowledge of peace. Once peace is felt, the intellect confirms it.

This does not suggest people get a 'free ride' by following a Siddhayoga guru. Siddhayoga is said to be for those people who take responsibility for their lives, who are self-reliant, whose focus in life is to help others, the creatures, and Mother Nature, who aim for inner and outer balance in life, eat sensibly&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Vani, 80-88.&lt;/ref&gt; and healthfully, live a life of moderation and seek to be purposeful in life.

::''birds cannot fly in the air with the help of a single wing, but they can do so with the help of both. So the devotee cannot move in the spiritual atmosphere leading to Salvation with the help of knowledge of yoga alone. The devotee can attain salvation with the help of both knowledge and yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Vani, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Current Siddhayoga gurus and ashrams==
===India===
[[Image:triosiddhayoga.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Baba &amp; his successors'']]

On 2 March 2001, Swami Narayana Tirtha died at Siddhayogashram in Varanasi.

Swami Atmananda Tirtha, who is a disciple and successor of Swami Narayana Tirtha, is the current Mathadhyaksha of all the ashrams in India&amp;nbsp;– including the Siddhayoga Ashram in Varanasi and the Shankar Math in Uttar-Kashi. He speaks and writes fluently in Bengali, Hindi, and English.

''Shankar Math'' is located in [[Uttarkashi]], in the Himalayas (State: Uttaranchal). It was donated to Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha by the [[raja]] (king) of the region, who received blessings from Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. ''Siddhayogashram'' is located in Chhoti Gaibi, Varanasi, and was built by Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha's disciples who wished him to live closer to them, since, in those days, a visit to Shankar Math in Uttarkashi required one to walk for 2 weeks from Rishikesh.

===America===

Swami Narayana Tirtha's successor in America is Swami Sadashiva Tirtha. He speaks English, Hindi and Bengali and  has  studied [[Ayurveda]], [[Jyotish]], and [[Vastu]] shastras. He is the author of ''Bhagavad Gita for Modern Times'', and the ''Ayurveda Encyclopedia''. Swami Narayan Tirtha Math was founded by Swami Sadashiva Tirtha in New York, USA.

'''Sphola Stupa''' is a [[Buddhist]] monument located in the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan. The monument located about 25 kilometers from [[Jamrūd]] is on a high rocky ledge and consists of a stone mound supported by a tiered base. Large sections of the stone have fallen away, particularly to the right of the mound. A man is standing on the top of the mound, and another man is standing on a pile of rubble to the right. There is a valley beyond with steep mountains rising behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Burke (1843-1900) - Buddhist monument Sphola Stupa in the Khyber Pass|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/2501352/buddhist-monument-sphola-stupa-in-the-khyber-pass|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ruined stupa built of stones features a dome resting upon a three-tiered base. Sphola sits in a ravine located  in Zarai village midway between [[Ali Masjid]] and [[Landi Kotal]] in the [[Khyber Pass]]. The 2nd century stupa may have been constructed towards the end of the Kushan Empire or according to some sources soon after third to fifth centuries. It is the most complete Buddhist monument in the Khyber Pass. It is a reminder of the great [[Kushana Empire]] and Buddhism nexus which is often depicted in [[Gandhara]] artefacts. Gandhara sculptures were excavated at this very stupa and are now housed in the museum in [[Peshawar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Tope at Sphola|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11479/|website=wld.org|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=1 January 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sphola Stupa is possibly the only such monument left in the Khyber Pass area. But instead of being treated as a conservation site, it has been turned into a [[Frontier Constabulary]] check post – the height provides a useful vantage point to the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What little remains: History fades as second century Sphola Stupa continues to crumble - The Express Tribune|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/709369/what-little-remains-history-fades-as-second-century-sphola-stupa-continues-to-crumble/|accessdate=19 August 2016|publisher=tribune|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes''' ({{lang-el|Ύπατο Συμβούλιο των Ελλήνων Εθνικών}}, {{lang|el-Latn|Ýpato Symvoúlio to̱n Ellí̱no̱n Ethnikó̱n}}), commonly referred to by its acronym YSEE, is a non-profit organisation established in [[Greece]] in 1997. Its primary goal is the protection and restoration of the [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenic ethnic religion]] in contemporary Greek society. Since its founding, YSEE has distributed over 300 letters of protest and press releases aimed at increasing religious freedom for followers of the Hellenic ethnic religion. It has also hosted over 800 rituals and educational events.

One of YSEE's main goals is to obtain legal recognition for the Hellenic ethnic religion.

YSEE is a founding member of the [[European Congress of Ethnic Religions]] (ECER) and hosted its seventh Congress in June 2004. YSEE has also been member of the [[European Union]]'s action program to combat discrimination.

==Outside of Greece==
In 2007 members of YSEE in the [[United States]] founded the [[Hellenic Council YSEE of America]] which is now a recognized non-for profit organization based in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], a [[New York City]] neighborhood with a large Greek-American community.

'''Thomas Baddeley''' (1786 or 1787-1823), was an English [[Roman Catholic]] priest in [[Manchester]].

Baddeley was the author of the ''Sure Way to find out the True Religion'', a colloquial defence of Roman Catholic principles, largely mingled with invective against [[Protestantism]]. The author was stated to be dead in 1825. The tract reached a seventh edition in 1847, and provoked several replies.

Acharya Vijay '''Vallabhsuri''' was a [[Jain]] monk. He was a disciple of [[Vijayanandsuri]]. He worked for the religious as well as improving the social life of people. He worked in [[Punjab]] so he was given honorific ''Punjab Kesari''.&lt;ref name="N1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hnf&gt;{{cite web|title=Acharya Vijay Vallabh Suri|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=62442&amp;tt_address_pi1%5Buid%5D=1348&amp;cHash=f0d13e136d|work=herenow4u.com|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born on 26 October 1870 (Second day of bright half of Kartik month, [[Vikram Samvat]] 1927) at [[Vadodara]], [[Gujarat]]. He was named Chhagan.&lt;ref name=hnf/&gt; His parents Deepchand and Ichhabai died in his early years.&lt;ref name="Jhabak1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kasturchand M. Jhabak|title=The Life &amp; Work of Acharya Vijaya Vallabh Suriji|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV0vAAAAYAAJ|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/327387|title=Acharya Shri Vijay Vallabh Suri Smrak Granth|last=Muni|first=Punjyavijayji|publisher=Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya Prakashan|year=1956|isbn=|location=Bombay|pages=40-75|trans-title=Acharya Vijay Vallabhsuri Commemoration Volume|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He met [[Vijayanandsuri]] at Janiseri Jain Upashray, [[Vadodara]]. At the age of 17 years, he was initiated as a Jain monk '''Muni Vallabhvijay''' on 5 May 1887 (Jayesth Vad 9, Vikram Samvat 1944) by [[Vijayanandsuri]] and became disciple of Muni Harshvijay at [[Radhanpur]]. In Vikram Samvat 1981, he was conferred the title of Acharya on Magshirsh Sudi 5 by Sumtivijay at [[Lahore]]. He also had the title of ''Pattadhar'' conferred on him by [[Sangha (Jainism)|Jain sangha]].&lt;ref name="Jhabak1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GelFlügel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Fl Gel|author2=Peter Flügel|title=Studies in Jaina History and Culture: Disputes and Dialogues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA372|date=1 February 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-23552-0|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vallabhsuri was in [[Gujranwala]] for [[Chaturmas]] in 1947. Due to the [[partition of India]], Gujaranwala fell in [[Pakistan]]. There was widespread communal violence across both nations. He refused travel by plane which was arranged by the Government of India as Jain monks do not use vehicles. He travelled by foot along with other Jains of Gujaranwala and entered India via the [[Wagah Border]] unharmed and reached [[Amritsar]] in September 1947.&lt;ref name="Jhabak1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout his life, Vallabhsuri placed emphasis on education and inspired Jains to build more educational institutions. He is well known as the founder of Shree Parshwanath Jain Vidyalaya in 1927 at Varkana Village in Pali district of Rajasthan. The seed which he sowed has taken shape of a dense tree in Godwad area of Rajasthan. He founded Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya (at [[Mumbai]], [[Vadodara]], [[Pune]]), Parshwanath Umed Mahavidyalaya (at [[Falna]]), Atmanand Jain College (at [[Ambala]], [[Malerkotla]]), Atmanand Jain High School ([[Ludhiana]], [[Ambala]], [[Malerkotla]], [[Bagwada]], [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Jandiala Guru]]) and other educational institutes.&lt;ref name=hnf/&gt; He wrote some books and religious texts in Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi Languages. He also established Atmanand Jain Sabha. He was also instrumental in establishing Jain unity and accessibility of Jain literature. He supported [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Indian independence movement|non-violent movement for independence of India]].&lt;ref name="Jhabak1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpp&gt;{{Cite book|last=Titze|first=Kurt|title=Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn=9788120815346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loQkEIf8z5wC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=vallabhsuri&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QUbcUJjcEMj-rAfPzYDICQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vallabhsuri&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 December 2012|page=136|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cort2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cort|title=Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDBpq23-0QoC&amp;pg=PA9|date=21 January 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973957-8|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="N1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Natubhai|title=Jainism: The World of Conquerors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLNQKGcDIhsC|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|isbn=978-81-208-1938-2|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Vijay Vallabh Smarak, a memorial in [[Delhi]] was erected to honour him. It is managed by Shri Atma Vallabh Jain Smarak Shikshan Nidhi.&lt;ref name=jpp/&gt; [[India Post]] issued a postage stamp of Vallabhsuri on 21 February 2009 which depicted his image along with Vijay Vallabh Smarak as a background image.

'''Votive sites''' are sites where [[animal sacrifice]], in the form of bones deposited in a split in a block of stone or beneath a [[cairn]], are made. 

The sites strongly resemble [[Grave (burial)|grave]]s or [[tomb]]s; however, no human bones are found. Such finds are made in [[Hallstatt culture]] sites, and presumably represent graves. Votive sites, or (North &amp; East Saami) "seite" or (South Saami) "storiockare" (storjunkare) are representative, especially among [[Sami people|Saami]] groups and hence are most common in [[Sápmi (area)|Lappland]]. It was believed that stones ruled over the food resources and as such were protected from [[Giant (mythology)|Giants]] by the help of [[Thor]].  However, findings are also made down to [[Skåne|Scania]], [[Sweden]] where an earlier interpretation, in 1589, was a rendezvous point of [[Huns]] and [[Goths]]. Findings in [[Central Europe]] are usually devoted to the [[Hallstatt culture]]. A similar [[worship]] in stones is known in [[Crete]].

{{Wikiquote}}

"'''Ænema'''" is a song by [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], released as the third single from their third major-label release ''[[Ænima]]''. [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] made a video for the song using [[stop motion|stop-motion animation]] that appears on ''[[Salival]]''. The song reached number twenty-five on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart in August 1997.

The song makes extensive use of [[hemiola]], a musical technique in which the emphasis in a triple meter is changed to give the illusion that both a duple and a triple meter occur in the song.

The song is cast in terminally climactic form,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://mts.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/23.abstract|title = Subverting the Verse–Chorus Paradigm: Terminally Climactic Forms in Recent Rock Music|last = Osborn|first = Brad|date = 2013|journal = Music Theory Spectrum|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 35| issue =  1|page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which two verse/chorus pairs give way to a climactic ending on new material.

==Lyrical references==
Keenan incorporates into the lyrics part of comedian [[Bill Hicks]]' sketch "Goodbye You Lizard Scum" from his album ''[[Arizona Bay]]'' by stating the line "learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay." Hicks appears in the liner notes/sleeve as a doctor, and a [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] image below the case tray illustrates a large portion of [[California]] disappearing leaving only the [[Pacific Ocean]], as is mentioned in the song. California falling into the sea is a prediction made by [[Edgar Cayce]], also known as "The Sleeping Prophet," about the [[End time|end of days]] in which California and New York are to sink into the ocean among a plethora of other devastating weather changes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time, any fucking day
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general the song is a diatribe against celebrity culture, particularly around Los Angeles. This includes everything from the [[Church of Scientology]] (with the line "Fuck [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and fuck all his clones"), to possibly rappers ("gun-toting hip gangster wannabes"), to drug addicts, Hollywood executives and actresses whom Maynard views as scum and wishes would all be flushed down the proverbial toilet.

The title of the song is an amalgam of the words "Anima" and "Enema".  "Anima", Carl Jung's concept of the female persona found in males, is evoked by Keenan in the lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Mom's gonna fix it all soon.
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Learn to swim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to being a humorous aside, this line can be seen as a metaphoric command to abandon the materialism Keenan sees in Angeleno culture and learn to navigate the 'feminine' unconscious.  The ocean is a traditional symbol for the 'feminine' (mother ocean, etc.) and also for the vast latent psychological energies postulated in the models of Freud and Jung:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Cause I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way.
I wanna watch it all go down.
Mom, please flush it all away.
I wanna see it go right in and down.
I wanna watch it go right in.
Watch you flush it all away.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this sense the 'ground' can be seen as the 'Ego' in Freud's terminology.  Here the 'Ego' has become hopelessly corrupted and needs to be subsumed, drowned and absorbed by the unconscious so it can be resurrected in a new form on the shores of 'Arizona Bay'.

The occult use of the word "Enema" in the title again poetically communicates what Keenan believes to be the 'fecal' nature of the culture of Los Angeles that can only be cured by destructive and ultimately transformative 'feminine' energy.

Just at the point where no lyrical interpretation is possible but that of a prayer for an old-testament-scale destruction of a modern-day Sodom by a great Goddess, Keenan gives the listener a hint to the metaphorical nature of the language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Don't just call me pessimist.
Try and read between the lines.
I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
   
During the period the song was written, Keenan abandoned Los Angeles for Arizona – ironically a landscape with even less literal water/rain/tidal forces than Los Angeles – which is perhaps another hint that Keenan's apocalyptic deluge is symbolic: the ending of one consciousness/value system/Weltanschauung and the emergence of a new one.  One possible interpretation is that the lyrics are nothing more than a description of a purely internal drama during a transitional time in the author's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2002 33 Things You Should Know About Tool Article on Blender :: The Ultimate Guide to Music and More&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509020851/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2002 |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
[[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] directed the video for "Ænema" which features [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animation with art design by [[Cam de Leon]].  The video revolves around a humanoid figure with alien-like features. Throughout the video the character ventures through an aquatic world. A hose-like organ (resembling an umbilical cord) which squirts out water protrudes from its abdomen and fills the room in which the figure stands. Towards the end of the video a human character wearing business attire tosses the figure in a water-filled box.
