[[File:US oil field production vs imports and exports.png|375px|right|US oil field production vs imports and exports]]

The '''1979''' (or '''second''') '''oil crisis''' or '''oil shock''' occurred in the world due to decreased [[oil output]] in the wake of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Despite the fact that [[global oil supply]] decreased by only ~4%, widespread panic resulted, driving the price far higher. The [[price of crude oil]] more than doubled to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months, and long lines once again appeared at [[gas stations]], as they had in the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacs50.com/decades/70s/ |title=1970s: Education |publisher=National Association of Convenience Stores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, following the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], oil production in Iran nearly stopped, and [[Iraq's oil production]] was severely cut as well. Economic recessions were triggered in the United States and other countries. Oil prices did not subside to pre-crisis levels until the mid-1980s.

After 1980, oil prices began a [[1980s oil glut|20-year decline]], except for a brief rebound during the [[Gulf War]], eventually reaching a 60 percent fall-off during the 1990s. As with the 1973 crisis, global politics and power balance were impacted. Oil exporters such as Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela expanded production; the Soviet Union became the top world producer; North Sea and Alaskan oil flooded the market. It seemed that [[the United States of America]] and [[Norway]] had much more oil reserves than forecasted in the 1970s. OPEC lost influence.

Amid massive protests, the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], fled his country in early 1979 and the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] soon became the new leader of [[Iran]]. Protests severely disrupted the Iranian oil sector, with production being greatly curtailed and exports suspended. In November 1978,  a strike by 37,000 workers at Iran's nationalized oil refineries initially reduced production from {{convert|6|Moilbbl|m3}} per day to about {{convert|1.5|Moilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign worker]]s (including skilled oil workers) fled the country. On January 16, 1979, the Shah and his wife left Iran at the behest of Prime Minister [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] (a longtime opposition leader himself), who sought to calm the situation.&lt;ref name = exile-bbc&gt;{{cite web

==Effects==

===Other OPEC members===
[[Image:Opecrev.gif|thumb|right|Fluctuations of OPEC net oil export revenues since 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/OPEC_Revenues/OPEC.html |title=OPEC Revenues Fact Sheet |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=January 10, 2006 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107014809/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/OPEC_Revenues/OPEC.html |archivedate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.cfm?RegionTopicID=OPEC |title=OPEC Revenues Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=June 14, 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The rise in oil price benefited other OPEC members, which made record profits. When oil exports were later resumed under the new Iranian government, they were inconsistent and at a lower volume, pushing prices up. [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[OPEC]] nations, under the presidency of [[Mana Al Otaiba]], increased production to offset most of the decline, and in early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was about 4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |journal=Time |date=1979-02-05 |accessdate=27 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946222%2C00.html |archivedate=7 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OPEC failed to hold on to its preeminent position, especially after Iran and Iraq went to war in 1980 and caused a further 10% drop in worldwide production – and by 1981, OPEC production was surpassed by other exporters. Additionally, its own member nations were divided among themselves. Saudi Arabia, a "[[swing producer]]" trying to gain back market share after 1985, increased production and caused downward pressure on prices, making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable or even unprofitable.

===United States===
[[Image:Line at a gas station, June 15, 1979.jpg|thumb|left|Line at a gas station in [[Maryland]], [[United States]], June 15, 1979.]]

The oil crisis had mixed effects in the United States, due to some parts of the country being oil-producing regions and other parts being oil-consuming regions.
[[Richard Nixon]] had imposed [[price controls]] on domestic oil. Gasoline controls were repealed, but controls on domestic US oil remained.

The [[Jimmy Carter]] administration began a phased [[deregulation]] of oil prices on April 5, 1979, when the average [[price of crude oil]] was [[US$]]15.85 per barrel ({{convert|42|USgal|L}}). Starting with the Iranian revolution, the price of crude oil rose to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months (its all-time highest [[real price]] until March 3, 2008.)&lt;ref name=Mouawad&gt;{{cite news | title=Oil Prices Pass Record Set in ’80s, but Then Recede | date=2008-03-03 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/worldbusiness/03cnd-oil.html | newspaper = New York Times | first=Jad | last=Mouawad | accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed U.S. oil output to rise sharply from the large [[Prudhoe Bay]] fields, while oil imports fell sharply.

And although not directly related, [[Three Mile Island accident|the near-disaster at Three Mile Island]] on March 28, 1979, also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennlive.com/specialprojects/index.ssf/2009/03/timeline_of_the_accident_at_th.html Timeline of the accident at Three Mile Island], The Patriot-News [Central Pennsylvania], March 22, 2009.  This is only indirectly related, but is an additional source of anxiety about energy policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to memories of oil shortage in 1973, motorists soon began panic buying, and long lines appeared at gas stations, as they had six years earlier during the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exponentialimprovement.com/cms/oilshock.shtml |title=The Oil Shocks of the 70s |first=Robert E. |last=Powell |date=May 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters (about 0.5–0.8 gallons) of [[gasoline]] (petrol) an hour while idling, it was estimated that Americans wasted up to {{convert|150000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at [[gas station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Jeremy Leggett |first=Jeremy |last=Leggett |year=2005 |title=[[Half Gone: Oil, Gas, Hot Air and the Global Energy Crisis]] |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Gascoupon.png|thumb|200px|Gas coupon printed but not issued during the 1979 energy crisis]]
During the period, many people believed the oil companies artificially created oil shortages to drive up prices, rather than factors beyond human control or the US's own price controls.  The amount of oil sold in the United States in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the year previously.&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;

Many politicians proposed gas [[rationing]]; one such proponent was [[Harry Hughes]], [[Governor of Maryland]], who proposed [[odd-even rationing]] (only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day), as was used during the [[1973 Oil Crisis]]. Several states actually implemented odd-even gas rationing, including [[California]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], and [[Texas]]. Coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rationing Coupons Shredded | date=1984-06-02 |

On July 15, 1979, President Carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his "Crisis of Confidence" speech (sometimes known as the "[[malaise]]" speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Carter|first=Jimmy|title=Crisis of Confidence|publisher=The Carter Center|date=1979-07-15|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/editorials_speeches/crisis_of_confidence.html| accessdate= 27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said that during the speech, Carter wore a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] (he actually wore a blue suit) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Crisis of Confidence" Speech (July 15, 1979) |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs |url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3402 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRp7rbz0?url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3402 |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy. He had already installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the [[White House]] and a [[wood fuel|wood-burning stove]] in the living quarters.  However, the panels were removed in 1986, reportedly for roof maintenance, during the administration of his successor, [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wihbey|first=John|title=Jimmy Carter's Solar Panels: A Lost History that Haunts Today|publisher=The Yale Forum on Climate Change &amp; the Media|date=2008-11-11|url=http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/2008/11/jimmy-carters-solar-panels/| accessdate= 1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's speech argued the oil crisis was "the moral equivalent of war". Critics, then and now, argued that his varied proposals would make the situation worse, not better.&lt;ref&gt;Reisman, George. "Restoring Confidence in America's Future: A Free Market Solution to the Energy Crisis." (The Intellectual Activist, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries seized the American Embassy, and Carter imposed an embargo against Iranian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/speeches/carter-imposes-oil-embargo-during-hostage-crisis |title=Carter Imposes Oil Embargo During Hostage Crisis |publisher=The History Channel |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980, he issued the [[Carter Doctrine]], declaring: "An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the [[Persian Gulf]] region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Carter|first=Jimmy|title=Third State of the Union Address|publisher=Jimmy Carter Presidential Library|date=1980-01-23|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml| accessdate= 27 July 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807012015/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml| archivedate= 7 August 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as part of his administration's efforts at deregulation, Carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] before the 1973 crisis. Carter agreed to remove price controls in phases; they were finally dismantled in 1981 under Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Executive Order 12287 –  Decontrol of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Products | date=1981-01-28| url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1981/12881a.htm| accessdate= 27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies.&lt;ref name="tax history"&gt;

In 1980, the U.S. Government established the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels.

When the price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980, the oil-producing areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html |title=FDIC: U.S. Home Prices: Does Bust Always Follow Boom? |access-date=2007-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430055452/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html |archive-date=2010-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile fuel economy===
{{main|Fuel economy in automobiles}}
{{See also|Malaise era}}
{{off topic|date=December 2015}}
At the time, Detroit's "Big Three" automakers ([[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], [[General Motors|GM]]) were marketing downsized full-sized automobiles like the [[GM B platform|Chevrolet Caprice]], the [[Ford Panther platform|Ford LTD Crown Victoria]] and the [[Chrysler R platform|Dodge St. Regis]] which met the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] fuel economy mandates passed in 1978. Detroit's response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the [[Toyota Corolla]] and the [[Volkswagen Rabbit]] were the [[GM X platform (FWD)|Chevrolet Citation]], and the [[Ford Fox platform|Ford Fairmont]]; Ford replaced the [[Ford Pinto]] with the [[Ford CE14 platform|Ford Escort]] and Chrysler, on the verge of [[History of Chrysler#1980s|bankruptcy]], introduced the [[Chrysler K platform|Dodge Aries K]]. GM was having unfavorable market reactions to the Citation, and introduced the [[GM L platform|Chevrolet Corsica and Chevrolet Beretta]] in 1987 which did sell better. GM also replaced the [[GM H platform (RWD)|Chevrolet Monza]], introducing the 1982 [[GM J platform|Chevrolet Cavalier]] which was better received. Ford experienced a similar market rejection of the Fairmont, and introduced the front wheel drive [[Ford Tempo]] in 1984. 

[[Checker Motors]], known for its iconic [[Checker Marathon|Marathon]] sedans used for the taxicab livery, ceased its automotive production in 1982 transitioning to stamping sheetmetal for GM. [[American Motors]], the final independent manufacturer outside of Detroit's Big Three, entered into a joint venture with [[Renault]] where its mass market automobiles were sold alongside the remaining AMC product lineup which have declined in sales while AMC's Jeep division was profiting, especially with the introduction of its downsized XJ sport utilities which led to the company's demise (its homegrown compacts dating back to 1970 – they were phased out in 1983 (with the exception of the Eagle 4WD wagon making it the final AMC designed product) and financial woes with the Renault partnership ended the reign of the final independent. Renault ended up owning 100% of AMC in 1982 (resulting in the divestment of [[AM General]]) until late 1986 where they sold AMC's shares to Chrysler Corporation. They later absorbed AMC in late 1987 where the Jeep division is now part of Chrysler (now FCA automobiles).

Detroit was not well prepared for the sudden rise in fuel prices, and imported brands (primarily the Asian marques which were mass marketed and had a lower manufacturing cost as opposed to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[West German]] brands - the rising value of the Deutsche Mark and English Pound resulted in the transition to the rise of Japanese manufacturers where exporting their product from Japan at a lower cost would yield profitable gains despite accusations of [[price dumping]]) were now more widely available in North America and had developed a loyal [[brand loyalty|customer base]] - the Japanese Big Three launched their respective advertisement campaigns (Honda with its 'We Make It Simple' tagline, Datsun (Nissan after 1984) with the tagline 'We Are Driven', and Toyota with 'Oh What A Feeling' (they ran a previous ad campaign prior to 1979 where the company mocked the [[Plymouth Volare]] with the tagline 'You Asked For It – You Got It') – luring away traditional Big Three consumers (Subaru in the late 1970s ran an ad campaign where former owners of a Big Three automobile drove their products – one TV ad started with the tagline 'Ford drives Subaru'). 

A year after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Japanese manufacturers surpassed Detroit's production totals becoming first in the world. Japanese exports would later displace the automotive market once dominated by lowered tier European manufacturers ([[Alfa Romeo]], [[Fiat automobiles|Fiat]], [[Opel]], [[Peugeot]], [[MG Cars|MG]], [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]], [[Citroen]]). Some would declare bankruptcy (e.g. Triumph, [[Simca]]) or withdraw from the U.S. market, especially in the wake of [[grey market]] automobiles or the inability of the vehicle to meet DOT requirements (from emission requirements to automotive lighting). Many imported brands utilized fuel saving technologies such as [[fuel injection]] and [[Multi-valve|multi-valve engines]] over the common use of [[carburetors]]. Also, the imported brands used their innovative business ethic e.g. a [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] inventory system but the U.S. Government imposed [[Voluntary Export Restraint|import quotas]] where the Japanese brands (later extended to South Korean and European marques) began outsourcing their operations by opening assembly plants in the United States (especially the Southern U.S. where import automakers were not on friendly terms with labor unions from the Rust Belt states), Canada, and Mexico to produce their mass market automobiles and light trucks. The Japanese (and later South Korean) brands which assembled its automobiles on U.S. soil had exterior dimensions which were sized to its domestic counterparts and engine displacement over 2.0 liters for the USA market (Japanese regulations on vehicle sizing and engine displacement determines the road tax paid on an annual basis which is not practiced in the US and Canada). 

Import brands also complied with [[Import substitution industrialization|local content laws]] where an import automobile must have a percentage of automotive components (in the United States automobiles with 70 percent local content manufacture is considered a domestic build regardless of manufacturer) sourced from the United States, Canada, or Mexico (prior to the establishment of [[NAFTA]]) and the American Automobile Labeling Act of 1994 which mandated the percentage of automotive parts content printed on the Monroney sticker of an automobile sold through a dealership. The import quota resulted in the Japanese automakers importing a limited amount of automobiles but to comply with the U.S. Government imposition of the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints, the automakers established their respective luxury marques (Acura, Lexus, Infiniti) but run respectively by their parent manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan). GM's [[Cadillac]] division experimented with their [[Cadillac V8 engine#368 and V8-6-4|V8-6-4]] power plant (the ancestor of the modern-day Active Fuel Management and/or variable displacement), which was a market failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Truett | first=Richard | title=Smooth Transition | year=2006 | url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061005/FREE/61004003/1024/LATESTNEWS | publisher = AutoWeek | accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, overall fuel economy increased, which was one factor leading to the subsequent [[1980s oil glut]].

The '''1987–1989 Tibetan unrest''' were a series of pro-independence protests that took place between September 1987 and March 1989 in the [[Tibet]]an areas in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]: [[Sichuan]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[Qinghai]], and the Tibetan prefectures in [[Yunnan]] and [[Gansu]]. The largest demonstrations began on March 5, 1989 in the Tibetan capital of [[Lhasa]], when a group of monks, nuns, and laypeople took to the streets as the 30th anniversary of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]] approached. Police and security officers attempted to put down the protests, but as tensions escalated an even greater crowd of protesters amassed. After three days of violence, martial law was declared on March 8, 1989, and foreign journalists and tourists were expelled from Tibet on March 10.&lt;ref&gt;Hobart Mercury, "Tibet braces for crackdown," 10 March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of deaths and military force being used against protesters were prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Jasper.

===1987===
* '''September 27''' — A demonstration in [[Lhasa]] was broken up on the first day by Chinese authorities. This night was reported as the "black night".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Tibetan Youth Congress]]|date=September 27, 2004|url=http://www.tibetanyouthcongress.org/tycnews/27thseptrtyc1.htm|accessdate=December 5, 2009|title=Tibetans protest seeking release of political prisoners|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006083545/http://www.tibetanyouthcongress.org/tycnews/27thseptrtyc1.htm|archive-date=October 6, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=7778&amp;t=1|title=Tibetans protest seeking release of political prisoners|website=Phayul.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October 1''' — Riots took place in Lhasa. Six people died, including a monk from the [[Sera Monastery]], and two other Tibetans were injured. According to the official New China News Agency, rioters tried to snatch guns from policemen and 19 policemen were hurt during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]]|url=http://www.tchrd.org/publications/topical_reports/prisoners_of_tibet/1_background.html|accessdate=December 5, 2009|title=Prisoners of Tibet (1987-1998)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029183322/http://www.tchrd.org/publications/topical_reports/prisoners_of_tibet/1_background.html|archivedate=October 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in citation|date=March 2018}} The demonstrators stoned the police and set a police station afire near Jokhang Temple, and police fired into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/03/world/tibetan-protest-for-independence-becomes-violent.html|title=Tibetan Protest for Independence Becomes Violent|last=Gargan|first=Edward a|date=1987-10-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-09|last2=Times|first2=Special to the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988===
* '''March 5''' — A revolt took place at the celebration of the Great Prayer ([[Monlam Prayer Festival]]). The riots cost the lives of three persons according to Chinese sources; thirty according to the Tibetan opposition.
* '''June''' — The [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]], altered his demands to the Chinese government. In his speech at the [http://www.dalailama.com/messages/tibet/strasbourg-proposal-1988 European Parliament on June 15, 1988], the Dalai Lama proposed a solution for Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China."
* '''December 10''' — Further riots in Lhasa. According to official sources one person died; unofficial sources spoke of twelve.

===1989===
* '''January 19''' — Sentences were pronounced in consequence of the arrests made during the riots of 1988 with deterrent harshness. The sentences ranged from three years imprisonment to the [[death penalty]] (with delay of execution).
* '''January 28''' — The death of the [[Panchen Lama]] of Tibet, the second authority after the Dalai Lama. The Chinese government took initiative to search for his successor ([[tulku|reincarnation]]). Tibetans attributed the death to murder by Chinese authorities and were concerned about the unprecedented interference in a centuries-old tradition of succession.
* '''February 6''' — Riots around ''Monlam'' and the Tibetan new year (''[[Losar]]''). Chinese authorities cancelled the celebration of ''Monlam Chenmo'', which precedes ''Losar'' each year. ''Losar'' took place in 1989 on February 7.
* '''March 5''' — A religious event ended in a massacre. Official sources speak of eleven deaths and one hundred wounded. The occasion for the massacre, according to Chinese sources, was the [[stoning]] of a Chinese police officer; Tibetan sources claim that the event was attacked by the Chinese police.
* '''March 6''' — Riots spread to the center of Lhasa. Chinese stores were wrecked and as a result a [[state of emergency]] was called. This enlarged the power of Chinese authorities.
* '''March 7''' — All foreigners including [[journalist]]s were evacuated. This signified an end to the provision of information to the rest of the world on the riots. Five people died in two days according to official sources. However, Tang Daxian, a former Chinese journalist present in Lhasa during that period, claims 387 civilians plus 82 religious people have been killed, and 721 people have been injured, according to a report he saw from Public Security Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/14/world/chinese-said-to-kill-450-tibetans-in-1989.html | title=Chinese Said to Kill 450 Tibetans in 1989 | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=August 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''April 15''' — China's former Secretary-General (until 1987), [[Hu Yaobang]] died. Hu was a supporter of the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Tibet and his death led to a student protest in [[Beijing]]. The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] a few months later on June 4, 1989, was crushed.

'''Agnes Inglis''' (1870&amp;ndash;1952) was a [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]-born [[anarchist]] who became the primary architect of the [[Labadie Collection]] at the [[University of Michigan]].

==Early life==
Agnes Inglis was born on December 3, 1870, in Detroit, Michigan, to Agnes (née Lambie) and Richard Inglis. Both of her parents were from Scotland. Her father was a doctor. She was the youngest child in a conservative, religious family, and educated at a [[Massachusetts]] girls' academy. Her father died in 1874, her sister died of cancer some time later, and her mother died in 1899 before Inglis was thirty years old.

After her mother's death, Inglis studied history and literature at the [[University of Michigan]], receiving an allowance from her extended family. She left the university before graduating, and spent several years as a social worker at Chicago's [[Hull House]], the [[Franklin Street Settlement House]] in [[Detroit]], and the [[YWCA]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. While working in these settings, she became sympathetic to the condition of [[immigrant]] laborers in the United States, ultimately developing strong political convictions from the experiences.

In 1915 Inglis met and befriended [[Emma Goldman]], and shortly thereafter, Goldman's lover and comrade [[Alexander Berkman]]. She increased her radical activities with the onset of [[World War I]], and used much of her time and family's money for legal support, particularly during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919&amp;ndash;1920.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Herrada, J., &amp; Hyry, T. (1999). Agnes Inglis: Anarchist librarian. Progressive Librarian (special supplement to # 16), 16, 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Labadie Collection==
She befriended [[Joseph Labadie]] and in 1924 discovered the materials on radical movements he donated to [[University of Michigan]] in 1911 had hardly been cared for. The collection remained unprocessed, kept in a locked cage.&lt;ref&gt;Herrada, J. (2007). Collecting anarchy: Continuing the Legacy of the Joseph A. Labadie Collection. RBM: A Journal of Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Cultural Heritage, 8(2), 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt; She began volunteering full-time, carefully organizing and cataloguing what would be known as the [[Labadie Collection]]. Her contributions to the collection were unique. She used unorthodox methods of arranging the collection. On the catalog cards, personal opinions were sometimes added to the bibliographic information about the items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Inglis: the woman behind the Labadie Collection|url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/news/agnes-inglis-woman-behind-labadie-collection|website=University of Michigan Library|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, Inglis and Labadie sent letters to 400 radicals soliciting contributions on their personal experiences and organizing efforts. While the initial response was weak, over the next 28 years anarchists would donate an enormous volume of publications, writings, and documentary material to her collection. These include the papers of [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and [[Ralph Chaplin]]. She also helped many in their research and publications, such as Henry David with [[Haymarket tragedy|The Haymarket Tragedy]] and [[James J. Martin]] with Man Against the State. Inglis' work was known around the U.S., and after many anarchists died decades later, their families would donate their collections to the Labadie Collection.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is estimated that her efforts increased the size of the original collection by approximately twentyfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?cc=sclead;c=sclead;idno=umich-scl-inglisa;didno=umich-scl-inglisa;view=text|title=Agnes Inglis Papers 1909-1952|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Michigan Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Inglis died on January 30, 1952, in Michigan, leaving an expansive and comprehensive library on radical social movements. With her death, however, some of the nuances of the collection's organization were lost.

'''Atabeg''', '''Atabek''',&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Seljūks |volume=24 |page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Atabey''' is a hereditary title of [[nobility]] of a [[Turkic language|Turkic]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;René Grousset. ''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', Rutgers University Press, 1970, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; indicating a governor of a nation or province who was subordinate to a [[monarch]] and charged with raising the [[crown prince]]. The first instance of the title's use was with early [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] who bestowed it on the Persian vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Atabak, Encyclopedia Iranica. Accessed February 1, 2007. http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atabak-turkish-atabeg-lit&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], first within the [[Armenia|Armeno]]-Georgian family of [[Mkhargrdzeli]] as a military title and then within the house of [[Jaqeli]] as [[Principality of Samtskhe|princes of Samtskhe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbedrosian.com/d3a.htm The Turco-Mongol Invasions, Reactions of the Armenian Lords, Mongol Control Techniques&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204101/http://rbedrosian.com/d3a.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title origins and meanings==
The word ''atabeg'' is a compound of two [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] words:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atabeg|title=atabeg.|access-date=25 March 2008|work=Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ata'', "ancestor", or "father"&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and ''beg'' or ''bey'', "lord, leader, prince".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/17/B0221700.html|title=bey.|access-date=25 March 2008|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080308071707/http://www.bartleby.com/61/17/B0221700.html| archivedate= 8 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beg'' is stated in some sources as Iranian origin (as in the compound [[Baghdad]] from ''bag/beg'' and ''dad'', "lord" given). However, according to [[Gerhard Doerfer]], the word ''beg'' may have possibly been of Turkic origin – the origin of the word still remains disputed to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/beg-pers "BEG"] ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Atabeg'' was common during the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] rule of the [[Near East]] starting in the 12th century. It was also common in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]). When a [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] prince died, leaving minor heirs, a guardian would be appointed to protect and guide the young princes. These guardians would often marry their wards' widowed mothers, thus assuming a sort of surrogate fatherhood. Amongst the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes, as in Persia, the rank was senior to a [[Khan (title)|khan]].

The title ''Atabeg'' was also in use for officers in [[Mamluk Egypt]]; some of them were proclaimed sultan before the incorporation into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the end of Seljuk rule, the title was used only intermittently.

When describing the [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan]], the [[Ildeniz]] (Ildegoz) dynasty, the title ''Atabeg-e-Azam'' (Great Atabeg) was used, to denote their superior standing, power and influence on the Seljuk sultans.

In [[Persian language|Persian]], the style ''Atabek-e-Azam'' was occasionally used as an alternative title for the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah]]'s [[Vizier|Vazir-e-Azam]] (''Grand Vizier''), notably in 1834–35 for Mirza Abolghasem Farahani, Gha'em Magham, in 1848–51 for Mirza Mohammed Taghi Khan, Amir-e Kabir, in 1906-07 for Mirza Ali Asghar Khan, Amin-ol Soltan, and finally in 1916 for a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, Major-General Shahzadeh Sultan 'Abdu'l Majid Mirza, Eyn-ol Douleh.

==List of Atabeg dynasties and other dynasties who used the title==
*[[Ahmadilis]] (Atabegs of [[Maragha]]) (of Turkic origin)
*[[Eldiguzids]] (Atabegs of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]) (of Kypchaq Turkic origin)
*[[Salghurids]] (Atabegs of [[Fars Province|Fars]]) (of  Turkmen origin)&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties of Islam'', (Columbia University Press, 1996), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hazaraspids]] (Atabegs of [[Luristan]]) (of Iranian origin)
*[[Atabegs of Yazd]]   (of Iranian origin)
*[[Zengids]] (Atabegs of [[Mosul]]) (of Turkmen origin)

Beginning in the twelfth century the atabegs formed a number of [[dynasty|dynasties]], and displaced the descendants of the [[Seljukid]] [[emir]]s in their various principalities. These dynasties were founded by emancipated [[Mamluk]]s, who had held high office at court and in camp under powerful emirs. When the emirs died, they first became stadtholders for the emirs' descendants, and then usurped the throne of their masters. There was an atabeg dynasty in [[Damascus]] founded by [[Toghtekin]] (1103–1128).

Other atabeg "kingdoms" sprang up to the north east, founded by Sokman (Sökmen), who established himself at Kaifa in [[Diyarbakır]] about 1101, and by his brother [[Ilghazi]]. The city of [[Mosul]] was under [[Mawdud ibn Altuntash]], and was later ruled by atabegs such as Aksunkur and [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. Zengi  became Atabeg of [[Mosul]] in 1128 and soon established himself as an independent ruler of much of northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Syria]] (including [[Aleppo]]).

The northern part of [[Lorestān Province|Luristan]], formerly known as [[Lurikuchik]] ('Little Luristan'), was governed by independent princes of the Khurshidi dynasty, styled atabegs, from  the beginning of the 17th century when the last atabeg, Shah Verdi Khan, was removed by Persian Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] and the government of the province given to Husain Khan, the chief of a rival tribe. Husain, however, was given the gubernatorial title of [[Wali|vali]] instead of atabeg. The descendants of Husain Khan retained the title.

Great Luristan, in the southern part of Luristan, was an independent state under the Fazlevieh atabegs from 1160 until 1424 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Its capital was Idaj, now only represented by mounds and ruins at [[Malamir, Iran|Malamir]], 100&amp;nbsp;km south east of [[Shushtar]].

===In the Caucasus===
{{see also|Atabegs of Azerbaijan}}

In the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], atabeg ({{lang-ka|ათაბაგი}}, ''atabagi'') was one of the highest court titles created by Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]] in 1212 for her powerful subjects of the [[Mkhargrdzeli]] family. The atabeg of Georgia was a [[vizier]] and a Lord High Tutor to Heir Apparent. Not infrequently, the office of atabeg was combined with that of [[amirspasalar]] (commander-in-chief). In 1334, the title became hereditary in the [[Jaqeli]] family who ruled the [[Principality of Samtskhe]]. Therefore, this entity came to be denominated as [[Samtskhe-Saatabago]], the latter element meaning "of the atabags".&lt;ref name="Toumanoff "&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1967).

The '''Bantu Investment Corporation Act, Act No 34 of 1959''', formed part of the [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation in [[South Africa]]. In combination with the Bantu Homelands Development Act of 1965, it allowed the South African government to capitalize on entrepreneurs operating in the [[Bantustan]]s. It created a Development Corporation in each of the Bantustans.&lt;ref name= "sahist"&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Boerstaat Party''' ({{lang-en|Boer State Party}}) is a [[right wing]] [[South Africa]]n [[political party]] founded on 30 September 1986 by Robert van Tonder. It was never officially registered as a political party because it was unable to rally 500 persons under one roof, a requirement under South African electoral law for official political party status. It was never represented in the South African Parliament, neither in the apartheid era nor after democratisation. In 1989, it joined the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB) in declaring support for Jaap Marais, the leader of the [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has worked with the HNP on occasion since. The party was a charter member of the [[Afrikaner Volksfront]] coalition group. It has also operated with the paramilitary group, the ''Boere Weerstandsbeweging'' (Boer Resistance Movement) led by Andrew Ford.

The BSP were the third group in South Africa to openly advocate the restoration of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] and call for the secession of these territories from the Union of South Africa. Other groups advocated this notion in the past, with the [[Maritz Rebellion]] of 1914 and the [[Ossewa Brandwag]] of the 1940s being the most notable . This policy was later taken on board by the AWB and other rightist movements. The BSP further argued that the [[Boer]] citizens of these nineteenth century republics should be considered as a distinct nation from the [[Afrikaners]], known as a [[Boerestaat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap3.html Article on South African Far Right] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313092610/http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap3.html |date=13 March 2007 }} M. Schönenteich &amp; H. Boshoff, ''Volk Faith and Fatherland: The Security Threat Posed by the White Right''&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSP has been noted for adopting controversial views on [[AIDS]] and came out in support of the views on the subject expressed by [[Thabo Mbeki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6781/full/404911a0.html Letter fuels South Africa's AIDS furore]&lt;/ref&gt; The party has also taken an active role in ensuring that the [[Voortrekker Monument]] is cared for, with current leader Coen Vermaak a leading advocate in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2003/05/09/news/n21_09052003.htm Afrikaner Symbol Moves Into New Sa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coen Vermaak has become noted for his controversial statements, arguing that it is official policy to drive [[white people]] to [[extinction]] through the widespread availability of [[contraceptives]]  whilst he has further argued that 'I am convinced the abortion law is aimed at getting rid of white babies'. Vermaak has also claimed that AIDS was a hoax designed to promote the use of condoms among whites, claiming that 'no Boer [Afrikaner] ever had Aids. It doesn't exist. It's the biggest scam that can take place'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2049013,00.html 'White Far-Right Wants its Say']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115034425/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0%2C%2C2-7-12_2049013%2C00.html |date=15 January 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the party does not actively call for voting rights to be restricted to whites only, it firmly rejects the post-apartheid doctrine of [[universal suffrage]]. For Vermaak, it is ridiculous that a doctor and a vagrant should have an equal say in how the country is governed. He has argued that 'any logical person should understand [that] some people's votes should count more than others'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=294585&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ Far Right Looks to Political Mainstream]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201159/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=294585&amp;area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__national%2F |date=30 September 2007  }} from the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ghetto Night ==
One of the more memorable events each summer was "Ghetto Night". Ghetto Night took place on the third Sunday of August.&lt;ref name="jewishcurrents.org"/&gt; Ghetto Night was a solemn, all-day commemoration of the [[Jewish partisans]] and victims of the [[Nazis]] that culminated in a gripping English and [[Yiddish]] retelling of the [[Holocaust]] through poetry and song. At the end of the performance, as the piano softly played the haunting melody of ''[[Ani Ma'amin]]'' (reportedly sung by Jews during [[the Holocaust]] as they entered the [[gas chambers]]), the camp walked out single file, and followed a torch-lit path to the "''Ghetto Denkmol''".&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;
One of the Ghetto Night programs, titled "''Varshever Oyfshtand un Geto Akademie''" ("[[Warsaw Uprising]] and Ghetto Program"), was as close the camp came to a religious service in the adamantly [[secular]] Camp Hemshekh. It began with a bellowed command: "''Z’khor! Gedenk vos es hot geton mit dayn folk der daytshisher nazi amalek''" — "Remember! Remember what the German Nazi Amalek did to your people." It closed with a pledge that they chanted in unison: "To remember and remember and remember for all time." This was followed by a call and response: "Let there be no forgetfulness! No forgetfulness! Let there be no dimming of memory! No dimming of memory! Let the memory be clear as glass, cold as ice and bright as a diamond."
This Ghetto Night Program included the heartrending, untitled poem that concluded: "The hands of the killers/Broke the locked hold/Of our mother's mad embrace/It was all in vain/The frantic cries/The murderer-hands clawed our flesh/Hurled us against the wall/To instant death." It included the gruesome, like Yuri Suhl's "The Permanent Delegate": "I am the spasm of a body convulsed in flames, the crumbling of a skeleton, the boiling of blood," and the macabre, such as [[Aaron Zeitlin]]'s "''Kinder fun Majdanek''" ("Children of Majdanek"): "Kopele, where is your head? Where is the light of your eyes?"
At its heart, however, the program was a tribute to [[Jewish]] Resistance. Much of the text was taken from ''Never to Forget: the Battle of the Warsaw Ghetto'', written by [[Howard Fast]] and [[William Gropper]], published in 1946 by the Jewish People's Fraternal Order, [[International Workers Order]] There were also up-tempo, bold songs like Shmerke Kaczergin-ski's ''Yid Du Partizaner'' — "''Fun di getos tfise vent/in di velder fraye/anshtot keytn oyf di hent/kh’alt a biks a naye!''" ("From the ghetto's prison walls/into the free forests/Instead of chains on my hands/I carry a new rifle!")&lt;ref name="jewishcurrents.org"/&gt; [http://web.me.com/bruxx/Hemshekh/Downloads_files/1975GhettoNightScript.PDF The Camp Hemshekh Warsaw Ghetto Memorial Program (1975) script (PDF)] [http://web.me.com/bruxx/Hemshekh/Downloads_files/1976GhettoNightScript.PDF The Camp Hemshekh Warsaw Ghetto Memorial Program (1976) script (PDF)]

==Music==
Singing was an integral part of the camp. At breakfast, in the dimly lit dining room, campers belted out popular Yiddish and English camp tunes to the accompaniment of an aging piano; during rest hour, selected campers would rehearse the Yiddish musical numbers for the "Visiting Day" plays, the midsummer Holocaust commemoration or some other cultural event; and a favorite pastime for campers and counselors alike was sitting with friends under the ''Milkh Boym'' (Milk Tree), strumming the guitar, and trying to remember all the lyrics to [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Phil Ochs]] hits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/4051]&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Ghetto ''Denkmol''" ==
There were two version of the "Ghetto ''Denkmol''". The first "Ghetto ''Denkmol''" was a small, white wooden booth and had a mosiac of a Ghetto fighter built in 1962 by the now world-famous architect, [[Daniel Libeskind]]. The second version was a simple memorial that consisted of a replica of the barbed-wire, glass-encrusted ghetto wall, and six black signposts of  representing the 6 million Jews murdered, each one inscribed, in Yiddish, with the name of a [[death camp]]. In the center stood a striking [[mosaic]] of the same ghetto fighter built by Daniel Libeskind. His mosaic [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] was a young man dressed in military-style garb, triumphantly stepping out of flames, one arm thrusting a rifle, the other with fist clenched. The face was an oval devoid of features.

On "Ghetto Day", a boy and girl from the group of oldest campers stood ''vakh'' (Yiddish for watch or vigil) at the ''Denkmol'' throughout the day. Dressed in work-shirts and red bandanas, they were silent and solemn, changing shifts every hour so that the wall was never unguarded, and so all the oldest campers had the chance to perform this honor.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishcurrents.org"/&gt;

== Memory as an element in the Camp ==
Memory was embedded everywhere, beginning with the camp's name: Hemshekh means "continuation" in Yiddish. A banner above the stage in the hall where we performed plays and had socials implored, "''Lomir Trogn Dem Gayst Vos Men Hot Undz Fartroyt''" — "Let us carry the spirit that has been entrusted to us." A small rock garden where we held campfires and meetings was named in honor of [[Froim Lozer]], a [[Bundist]] who had fought for a small park to be built in the crowded, dirty industrial city of [[Łódź]] for workers to enjoy a bit of air after long hours in the textile factories. Even nature was pressed into the service of memory: Small wooden plaques nailed to trees bore the names [[Henryk Ehrlich]] and [[Viktor Alter]], Bundist activists and resistance organizers murdered by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s police, and [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], the 23-year-old commander of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;

== Reunions ==

=== 1987 reunion ===
On Sunday, November 15, 1987, a Camp Hemshekh reunion was held on the [[Windows on the World]] restaurant, at the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. About 200 campers, from all over the world came.

=== 1999 reunion ===
There was a reunion on October 10, 1999 which was held at the Terrace On The Park party venue located in Flushing Meadows Park.  Almost 400 former campers, counselors and others affiliated with the Camp were contacted/invited. (The existence of the "new" internet proved a great help in tracking people down.) Approximately 200 former "Hemshekhists" attended while an additional 40+ spouses and children joined in the festivities.  

At the reunion all attendees receive a booklet that was a combination Songbook and Address List.  The songbook included 104 songs --  three-quarters of which were in Yiddish (always provided in Yiddish orthography as well as in transliteration) -- which were well known throughout the 20-year existence of the Camp.  

From a certain point of view, it was unfortunate that the address list was comprised entirely as snail-mail addresses.  Unfortunate, because between 1998 (when planning for this reunion began) and roughly 2001, snail-mail was essentially replaced by email for personal contact. 

On the other hand, because of those snail-mail address we know that the people who attended this particular reunion came from 18 different U.S. states, three Canadian provinces, and a pair of foreign countries (UK and Israel).

&lt;For all of this, I should mention that I was THE coordinator/manager of this reunion.  Of course, many others helped, but I'm probably the only person with computer files documenting the information I've provided.  Only once in my life (previously) have a made an edit on Wikipedia.  I no longer remember what it was - only that it was a factual error that was pretty small.  So, I don't know what kind of documentation you would like.  For example, my source for attendees is a spreadsheet that I have in my possession and does not exist anywhere on the internet.  Do you want me to upload it someplace.  As for the Songbook/AddressList -- would you like a copy?  (Just kidding, but I have about 30 leftovers in a drawer in my apartment.  I'm afraid no pdf was ever created.  I sent spreadsheets and word docs to a printed who compiled it.  I mean it was 1999 after all.&gt;

=== 50th Anniversary (2009) reunion ===
On October 10 through October 12, 2009 (Columbus Day Weekend), Camp Hemshekh had its 50th Anniversary Reunion in [[New York City]]. The main event took place on Sunday, October 11, 2009, at the [[Workmen's Circle]] Building. It began at noon, and continued through the night.

Saturday's activities consisted of informal house pot-luck gatherings at the homes of ''Hemshekhistn'' from the different generations of camp, who live in or near [[New York City]]. No less than nine campers visited the old campsites at the [[Hunter (village), New York|Hunter]] and [[Mountaindale, New York|Mountaindale]] campsites. Photos of the remnants of the campsites were posted on the walls at the main event, along with photos of the camp, and campers from the different years. At least five hundred photos were taken during the various parts reunion. Extensive, yet rough video footage was taken at the main event. Using that footage, previous films and the many photographs of Camp Hemshekh, a basic film is planned to be created. The majority of uploaded photos and videos of this reunion, previous ones, and of Hemshekh in general, can be found on the [http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=8135227238&amp;view=all Camp Hemshekh Facebook group], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121106175632/http://picasaweb.google.com/camphemshekhreunion/VintageCampHemshekh?authkey=Gv1sRgCJKntfTWz8TGpgE&amp;feat=email here], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121106175632/http://picasaweb.google.com/camphemshekhreunion/VintageCampHemshekh?authkey=Gv1sRgCJKntfTWz8TGpgE&amp;feat=email and here].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hemshekh2009.org/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hemshekh2009.org/activities.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hemshekh2009.org/tours.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=200724980132&lt;/ref&gt; This reunion was mainly organized by the ''Reunion Komitet'' (Reunion Committee), including [[George Rothe]], [[Sabina Brukner]], [[Michael Rosenberg|Michael "Toes" Rosenberg]] and [[Lisa Geduldig]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=8135227238&amp;topic=10893&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 campers came to the main event.

The '''Caucasus Emirate''' ({{lang-ce|Имарат Кавказ Imarat Kavkaz}} ('''IK'''); {{lang-ru|Кавказский Эмират Kavkazskiy Emirat}}), also known as the '''Caucasian Emirate''', was a militant [[Jihadist]] organisation active in the southwestern region of the [[Russian Federation]]. Its intention was to expel the Russian presence from the [[North Caucasus]] and to establish an independent [[Islamic emirate]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile: Caucasus Emirates|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/international-extremism-terrorism/c/profile-caucasus-emirates.html|publisher=ADL|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caucasus Emirate also refers to the state that the group seeks to establish.&lt;ref name=ctc26Mar14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=5189 Karachaevo-Cherkessia Faces Renewed Militant Activity], Mairbek Vatchagaev, The Jamestown Foundation, September 26, 2008 09:56 AM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000024-000004-000004&amp;lang=1 The Caucasus Emirate on the road from Yemen to Algeria (Part 1)], Sergei Davydov, "Prague Watchdog", June 6th 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Partially a successor to the secessionist [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], it was officially announced on 7 October 2007, by former [[President of Ichkeria]] [[Dokka Umarov]], who became its first [[emir]].&lt;ref name=declaration&gt;[http://southdistr.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/11635 "Two years of Imarat Kavkaz: jihad spreads over Russia's south"], ''Caucasian Knot'', 7 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of Chechnya}}

===Background===
Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[Chechen people|Chechen]] nationalists, led by [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], declared the secession of [[Chechnya]] from Russia as an independent [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] (ChRI). Following two devastating wars with the Russian Federation in the nineties, the ChRI fought an [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War|insurgency]] against the Russian forces and their Chechen allies from 2000, initially under the leadership of [[Aslan Maskhadov]]. Although the ChRI was largely founded by [[Sufism|Sufi]] Muslims motivated by nationalism, over time the literalist [[Salafist]] form of Islam became increasingly popular with some Chechens, leading to a schism between nationalists and Salafists. As many of the original nationalist figures were killed by Russian forces, the insurgency took on an increasingly Salafist tone embodied by commanders like [[Shamil Basayev]] and the Arab fighter [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]]. Many of the surviving nationalists gave up the fight, and by the time Dokka Umarov was declared President of Ichkeria in June 2006, Islamists held increasing influence in the movement.&lt;ref name=ctc26Mar14/&gt;

===Declaration===
On 7 October 2007, [[President of Ichkeria]] [[Dokka Umarov]] abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and proclaimed an [[Emirate]] in the [[Caucasus]], declaring himself its [[Emir]].&lt;ref name="declaration"/&gt; The declaration of the Caucasus Emirate was quickly condemned by [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Umarov's own minister of foreign affairs; Zakayev, who lives in exile in London, called upon all Chechen separatist fighters and politicians to pledge allegiance directly to his [[government in exile]] in an attempt to isolate Umarov from power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chechenpress.co.uk/english/news/2007/10/31/05.shtml Chechenpress; Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804141054/http://www.chechenpress.co.uk/english/news/2007/10/31/05.shtml |date=August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zakayev also expressed regret that Umarov had caved in to pressure from "[[Agent provocateur|provocateur]]s" and committed a "crime" that undermines the legitimacy of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/cb5cbb01-fd76-4e85-af8a-3bec1baf4ec2.html|title=Chechnya: In Video, Separatist Leader Declares 'Jihad' On West|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umarov said that he did not need any sanction from the Majlis-ul-[[Shura]] (the [[Committee|council]] of rebel field commanders) or anybody else to declare the [[Emirate]], as it is "his duty as a [[Muslim]]" to establish an [[Islamic state]] "as required by [[Sharia]]."

===Leadership crisis===
On 1 August 2010 [[Kavkaz Center]], the official web site of the Emirate, distributed a video where Dokka Umarov indicated that he had stepped down from his position as Emir and appointed [[Aslambek Vadalov]] to become his successor.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chechen rebel leader 'steps down'|work=[[Aljazeera.net]]|date=August 2, 2010|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/08/201081225749844675.html|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 3 August 2010,.&lt;ref name="LWJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov retracts resignation|author=Bill Roggio|date=August 4, 2010|work=[[The Long War Journal]]|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/08/caucasus_emirate_lea.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Umarov said he had no intention of stepping down and called the video announcing his resignation a fabrication.&lt;ref name="LWJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chechen rebel chief denies quitting|work=[[Aljazeera.net]]|date=August 4, 2010|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/08/201084123832188820.html|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Palace Coup" Reveals Split between Umarov and Rebel Commander Aslanbek Vadalov|journal=[[Eurasia Daily Monitor]]|volume=7|issue=152|date=August 6, 2010|author=Mairbek Vatchagaev|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36725&amp;cHash=8eed570ae3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcements drove the emirate into a state of turmoil, with several key rebel leaders resigning their loyalty to Umarov.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Struggle Among Russia's Militants|date=August 19, 2010|work=Al Jazeera|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/08/201081225749844675.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This combined with the death of [[Muhannad (Mujahid Emir)|Muhannad]] is believed to have paved the way for [[Hussein Gakayev]], [[Aslambek Vadalov]] and [[Tarkhan Gaziyev]] to re-affirm their allegiance to Umarov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/07/caucasus_emirate_cla_1.php#ixzz1TKEnDQLI|title=Internal divisions resolved, claims Caucasus Emirate|work=The Long War Journal|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umarov would die in September 2013 from food poisoning. [[Aliaskhab Kebekov]] was announced 6 months later as his successor.&lt;ref name=umarovdeath/&gt;

===Decline===
In the period from 2010 to 2014, the number of casualties in the North Caucasus insurgency declined each year, with the overall death toll falling by more than half.&lt;ref name=decline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/insurgency-north-caucasus-terrorism-isis/26840778.html|work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|title=Why Is The Death Toll Tumbling In The North Caucasus?|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons suggested for the decline include the deaths of high-ranking insurgency commanders, the increased targeting by security forces of the support infrastructure relied on by the insurgents, and an exodus of insurgents to other conflict zones.&lt;ref name=decline/&gt;

Starting in November 2014, mid-level commanders of the Caucasus Emirate began publicly switching their allegiance from Emirate leader [[Aliaskhab Kebekov]] to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], following al-Baghdadi and his group's declaration of a [[caliphate]] earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=refrl13Feb15&gt;{{cite web|title=Caucasus Emirate and Islamic State Split Slows Militant Activities in North Caucasus|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=43542&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=817653426dd1c50e08a874b89567939a#.VOKW5vmUe4Y|date=13 February 2014|accessdate=17 February 2015|publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2015, many commanders of the Emirate's Vilayat Nokhchicho and Vilayat Dagestan had defected.&lt;ref name=refrl13Feb15/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl02Jan15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.mobi/a/islamic-state-north-caucasus-insurgency-commanders-allegiance/26773615.html|title=Six North Caucasus Insurgency Commanders Transfer Allegiance To Islamic State|author=Liz Fuller|date=2015-01-02|work=|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists within the Emirate released statements denouncing them, and accused the most senior defector, [[Rustam Asildarov]], of betrayal.&lt;ref name="lwj31dec14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/12/jihadists_in_dagesta.php|title=Dagestani jihadist swears allegiance to Islamic State, invoking backlash|author=|date=2014-12-31|work=|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lwj16feb15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/02/jihadist_leader_in_d.php|title=New jihadist leader in Dagestan denounces Islamic State defectors|author=|date=2015-02-16|work=|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vilayat Nokhchicho leader [[Aslan Byutukayev]] pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi in June 2015,&lt;ref name=demise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=44051&amp;cHash=973198e3db1a533a0115a648cad28b2a#.VYNxKfmqqko|title=What Caused the Demise of the Caucasus Emirate?|date=18 June 2015|publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an audio statement was released in the same month purportedly pledging allegiance on behalf of militants in Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=44086&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=a29e6568ca638e2c94b89a2be9cd6d18#.VZCIX_mqqkp|title=Two North Caucasus Rebel Leaders Face Off in Islamic State–Caucasus Emirate Dispute

==Organizational structure==

===Overview===
[[File:Caucasus Emirate.svg|thumb|Proposed divisions of the Caucasus Emirate]]
The Caucasus Emirate is claimed to be composed of the following ''[[wilayah|Vilayats]]'' (provinces):
*[[Vilayat Nokhchicho]] ([[Chechnya]])
*[[Vilayat Galgaycho]] ([[Ingushetia]] and [[North Ossetia]])
*[[Vilayat Cherkessia]] ([[Adygea]] and southern part of [[Krasnodar Krai]])
*[[Vilayat Dagestan]] ([[Dagestan]])
* Vilayat Iriston ([[North Ossetia]]) was abolished in 2009 in a decree issued by Umarov that subsumed it into Vilayat Galgaycho&lt;ref name="omra2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldanalysis.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=637|title=New decrees of Dokka Umarov on formation of a Council of the Caucasus Emirate and abolition of the Province of Iriston - Caucasus - News : WorldAnalysis.net|author=Casey Britton|work=worldanalysis.net|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220192353/http://worldanalysis.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=637|archivedate=20 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 [[Movladi Udugov]], an ideologue and a spokesman for the Caucasus Emirate, said that "as Dokka Umarov very accurately observed, this Islamic state does not yet have any borders. It’s not correct to say that we want to build some sort of enclave on the territory of these North Caucasus republics. No, today many Muslims living in [[Tatarstan]], [[Bashkortostan]], [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]], Russians from the most widely differing regions of Russia who have accepted Islam, swear an oath of allegiance to Dokka Umarov as the legitimate leader of the Muslims. And wherever he is – in Moscow, [[Blagoveshchensk]], [[Tyumen]] – when a Muslim swears that oath, he becomes a fighting unit. Just because these people are not visible in their cities just now and are not active, that doesn’t mean that they won’t become active in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000015-000006-000042&amp;lang=1|title=We have taken up arms to establish laws (interview with Movladi Udugov)|work=Prague Watchdog|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2011 interview posted on the pro Caucasus Emirate [[Kavkaz Center]] website, Umarov stated "Now we know that we should not secede, but must unite with our brothers in faith. We must recapture [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], [[Kazan Khanate|Idel-Ural]], [[Khanate of Sibir|Siberia]] and indigenous Muslim lands."&lt;ref name=james2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37956|title=Pro-Rebel Website Posts Transcript of Interview with Doku Umarov|date=20 May 2011|publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Professor Gordon M. Hahn of the [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies]], described the Caucasus Emirate to be a decentralized organisation, but structured hierarchically with Emir Dokku Umarov appointing the Emirs of each Vilayat or Province, who in turn swear him a bay'at or oath of allegiance. Each vilayat contains multiple Fronts or Sectors, which in turn contain multiple Jamaats or units. The vilayats, sectors and local jamaats independently raise funds, recruit members and carry out operations, while following the overall strategy as set by the Emirate's leadership.&lt;ref name=CSIS&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/110930_Hahn_GettingCaucasusEmirateRt_Web.pdf Getting the Caucasus Emirate Right], [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies]], 1 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Umarov established a ruling consultative body, or [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis al Shura]], for the Caucasus Emirate consisting of his top commanders. At the time of the announcement, the positions and the individuals holding them were:&lt;ref name="omra2"/&gt;
*[[Supyan Abdullayev]] - Naib (Deputy) Emir – deceased 28 March 2011
*[[Akhmed Yevloyev]] - Military Emir and Emir of Vilayat Galgaycho – arrested 9 June 2010
*[[Anzor Astemirov]] - [[Qadi]] and Emir of the United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay – deceased 24 March 2010
*[[Umalat Magomedov]] - Emir of Vilayat Dagestan – deceased 31 December 2009
*[[Aslambek Vadalov]] - Emir of the Eastern Sector of Vilayat Nokhchicho - arrested 5 November 2016
*[[Tarkhan Gaziyev]] - Emir of the South-Western sector of Vilayat Nokhchicho - arrested 5 November 2016
*[[Muhannad (mujahid emir)|Muhannad]] - Emir of the [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya|Ansar]] – deceased 21 April 2011

The Caucasus Emirate maintains a Supreme Sharia Court, which is headed by a [[Qadi]]. This position has been held by [[Anzor Astemirov]] (killed in March 2010), [[Magomed Vagabov]] (killed August 2010), and [[Aliaskhab Kebekov]] (killed in April 2015).&lt;ref name=qadi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kavkaz-jihad.blogspot.com/2010/10/omra-24-appointement-of-ali-abu.html|title=Omra №24 : Appointement of Ali Abu-Muhammad al-Dagestani (ha) as the new Supreme Qadi of the CE|work=kavkaz-jihad.blogspot.com|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, Dokka Umarov announced the revival of the [[shahid]] [[suicide attack]]ers unit [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs]],&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Surge_In_North_Caucasus_Violence_Reflects_Diversification_Of_Resistance_Tactics/1802629.html Surge In North Caucasus Violence Reflects Diversification Of Resistance Tactics], [[Radio Liberty]], August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which has been led by [[Said Buryatsky]] (killed March 2010) and [[Aslan Byutukayev]].

Umarov died due to food poisoning on 7 September 2013.&lt;ref name=umarovdeath&gt;{{cite web|title=Insurgency Commanders Divulge Details Of Umarov’s Death|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/insurgency-commanders-divulge-of-umarovs-death/25467747.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/03/islamic_caucasus_emi_1.php|title=Islamic Caucasus Emirate confirms death of emir Doku Umarov|work=The Long War Journal|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Aliaskhab Kebekov (killed April 2015)&lt;ref name="KebekovDead"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/03/ali_abu_muhammad_al_dagestani.php Ali Abu Muhammad al Dagestani, the new emir of the Islamic Caucasus Emirate | The Long War Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Magomed Suleymanov]] (killed August 2015).&lt;ref name=killed/&gt;

===Funding===
Caucasus Emirate receives significant funds from overseas Islamic terrorist organizations, but the primary source of funding for the Caucasus Emirate is a wide range of criminal activity. Militants extort money from local businessmen and residents in their areas of operation under the premise of a religious tax. Russian media reports in early 2011 claimed that militants extorted a 20 per cent "jihad" tax from prominent figures considered to be pro-government. In addition to extortion, Russian officials have alleged that Caucasus Emirate militants also derive funds from involvement in [[drug trafficking]] and [[robbery]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ihs.com/pdf/IHS-Janes-World-Insurg-Terror_Imarat-Kavkaz_146073110913052132.pdf Imarat Kavkaz / Caucasus Emirate], IHS.com, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==External relations==

===Western countries===
In the same October 2007 statement in which Umarov proclaimed the Caucasian Emirate, he also described the United States, Great Britain and [[Israel]] as common enemies of Muslims worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadunspun.com/intheatre_internal.php?article=109196&amp;list=/home.php Dokka Umarov Declares The Islamic Emirate Of The Caucasus, Expands Jihad]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106150400/http://www.jihadunspun.com/intheatre_internal.php?article=109196&amp;list=%2Fhome.php |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on November 20, 2007, [[Anzor Astemirov]], then head of the [[Vilayet KBK]], said that "Even if we wanted to threaten America and Europe every day, it is clear for anybody who understands politics that we do not have any real clashes of interests [with the West]. The people in the [[White House]] know very well that we have nothing to do with America at the moment." In his statement, Astemirov not only described the Caucasian rebels' threats against the West as empty, but also even asked the United States for assistance in their fight against "Russian aggression."&lt;ref&gt;["http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nc/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=4596&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=189&amp;no_cache=1" Is the Caucasian Emirate a Threat to the Western World?]&lt;/ref&gt; Following its criticism, many rebel websites removed the phrase that regarded Western countries as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2373971|title=North Caucasus Weekly|work=Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War===
{{Main|Russo-Georgian War}}

On August 9, 2008 in response to the conflict between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Russia, Movladi Udugov stated that "for the time being neither [[Tbilisi]] nor [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] has appealed to us with any requests or offers" to fight alongside Georgian forces against the Russian forces. Udugov also noted: "But I clearly can say that the command of the Caucasus Emirate is following with great interest the development of the situation."

===Syrian Civil War===
A number of Chechen and other North Caucasian volunteers travelled to fight in the [[Syrian Civil War]] against the government of [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Dokku Umarov released a video in November 2012 expressing support for all those trying to install Sharia law in Syria, but rebuked those who had weakened the Jihad in the North Caucasus by leaving to fight there.&lt;ref name=jamestown28Jun&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=41091&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=7&amp;cHash=e52244ad41ac68df14f5f09a58799d97#.Utxt0qwzE5t Caucasus Emirate Reverses Position on Syrian Jihad], Mairbek Vatchagaev, The Jamestown Foundation, 28 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the war went on and North Caucasians took an increasingly prominent role in the fighting owing to their combat experience, those who went to fight in Syria were viewed increasingly positively by the Emirate's websites and supporters.

In 2013, a Chechen known as Emir Salauddin was appointed as the official representative of the Caucasus Emirate in Syria.&lt;ref name=jamestown28Jun/&gt; In December 2013, the Chechen-led Syrian jihadist group [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]] (JMA) split away from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and appointed Salauddin as their new commander, emphasising that they wished to continue respecting the [[Bay'at|Oath of Allegiance]] they had made to the Caucasus Emirate's Dokku Umarov.&lt;ref name=BBC3NOV13&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria crisis: Omar Shishani, Chechen jihadist leader|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25151104|work=BBC|date=3 December 2013|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his appointment as the Emirates new leader, [[Aliaskhab Kebekov]] advised the North Caucasians in Syria to remain independent rather than align with other groups. He also voiced support for Al-Qaeda affiliated [[Al-Nusra Front]] and criticised [[Abu Omar al-Shishani]], the Chechen commander who formerly led JMA before joining ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42587&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=af78595cf7cb3732319d514c41520fb6#.U7X4O4358QY|title=Statement by New Leader of Caucasus Emirate Creates Rift Among Chechen Groups Operating in Syria|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|date=3 July 2014|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2015, JMA suffered a leadership split, and Salauddin and those fighters loyal to him formed a smaller offshoot that reiterated their loyalty to the Caucasus Emirate.&lt;ref name="split"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chechen commander in Syria pledges to Islamic Caucasus Emirate|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/07/chechen-commander-in-syria-pledges-to-islamic-caucasus-emirates.php|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Long War Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claimed and alleged attacks==
* The Caucasus Emirate claimed responsibility for the [[2009 Nevsky Express bombing]] in an online statement describing it as an "act of sabotage", and part of a series of operations targeting strategic sites in Russia.&lt;ref name=BBCClaim&gt;{{Cite news|title=North Caucasus group in Russia train bomb web claim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8390258.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203051738/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8390258.stm|archivedate=3 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In December 2010, Austrian police arrested a Chechen refugee on suspicion of planning an attack on NATO targets. "Belgian authorities suspect a group of Chechen extremists, who were seeking to set up a religious state in northern Chechnya, planned to attack NATO facilities in Belgium," Interior Ministry spokesman Rudolf Gollia said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/austria-arrests-chechen-in-belgian-nato-plot/425658.html|title=Austria Arrests Chechen in Belgian NATO Plot|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

46 states initially adopted the [[Common Core State Standards]], although implementation has not been uniform. At least 12 states have introduced legislation to repeal the standards outright,&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomberg'': [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-10/common-core-isn-t-a-government-conspiracy.html Common Core Isn’t a Government Conspiracy.] February 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and Indiana has since withdrawn from the standards.

Among the territories of the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the American Samoa Islands have adopted the standards while Puerto Rico has not adopted the standards.  Arizona had also successfully repealed Common Core as of 2015; infographic to be updated later.

==Alabama==
Alabama initially adopted the Standards, but the state rescinded adoption in November 2013. Governor [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]] cited federal interventions as a reason for his opposition, saying he was opposed because of "federal control of our education system. And I'm opposed to the Common Core because of the potential for federal intrusion."&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;AL.com: [http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/11/unlike_alabama_these_five_stat.html Unlike Alabama, these five states didn't adopt the Common Core].

==Alaska==
Alaska opted out of adopting the Standards. While debate persists in Alaska, the state has adopted its own new standards called the Alaska Content and Performance Standards that Education Commissioner Mike Hanley has described as "substantially similar" to the Common Core standards, and many local districts have chosen to adopt the standards even though the state has not.&lt;ref&gt;''Alaska Dispatch'': [http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140108/skeptics-keep-pressure-against-alaska-common-core-education-standards Skeptics keep up pressure against Alaska Common Core education standards].

==Arizona==
Arizona formally adopted the Standards. In 2014, Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed an executive order that removes references to "Common Core" from the state's math and reading standards, although they are still aligned with the national standards.&lt;ref name="FoxNameGame"&gt;Fox News: [http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/18/name-game-amid-opposition-states-change-title-common-core/ Name game: Amid opposition, states change title of Common Core]. February 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the standards have been changed to "Arizona's College and Career Ready Standards."&lt;ref name="USNewsRepeal" /&gt; In the legislature, the Senate Education Committee passed a bill that would withdraw Arizona from Common Core.&lt;ref&gt;''East Valley Tribune'': [http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/politics/article_6ee155b4-9a7b-11e3-a6f2-0019bb2963f4.html Senate Education Committee approves law to halt Common Core implementation.] February 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 26, 2015, the Arizona State Board of Education elected to repeal the Common Core standards in a 6-2 vote.

==Arkansas==
Arkansas formally adopted the Standards in 2010. Multiple proposals during the 2014 fiscal year in the state legislature to delay implementation were not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press: [http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/90eb775ac4ca47b2ab788c6bf0c13622/AR--XGR-Arkansas-Legislature-Common-Core Arkansas lawmakers vote against delaying Common Core education benchmarks] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140317123408/http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/90eb775ac4ca47b2ab788c6bf0c13622/AR--XGR-Arkansas-Legislature-Common-Core |date=2014-03-17 }}.

==California==
California formally adopted the Standards. Governor [[Jerry Brown]] allocated $1.25 billion in the state budget to assist with implementation, but also assured educators that Core-aligned tests will not be used as part of teacher evaluations through the 2015-2016 school year. The grant remains controversial with California teacher's unions because of concerns of the use and size of the grant.&lt;ref name="EdWeekCC"&gt;''Education Week'': [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/19/21commoncore.h33.html?tkn=QVYFQcC934kasAAD2IP5%2F%2FrinA7dkahqF0kX&amp;cmp=clp-edweek Common-Core Tensions Cause Union Heartburn] February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colorado==
Colorado formally adopted the Standards in 2010. Citizen concerns about Common Core, however, have resulted in a bill drafted by a parent group to delay implementation and appoint an independent panel to look at the standards, with State Senator Vicki Marble agreeing to carry it in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Denver Post'': [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25004965/backlash-against-common-core-education-standards-surfaces-colorado Backlash against Common Core education standards surfaces in Colorado].

==Connecticut==
Connecticut formally adopted the Standards, but Governor Dannel Malloy has called for a delay in teacher evaluations based on Common Core testing, citing the stress of changing systems and saying "it's important that we relieve the significant demands on teachers and administrators and systems."&lt;ref name="USNewsRepeal"&gt;''U.S. News &amp; World Report'': [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/31/more-states-seek-to-repeal-common-core More States Seek to Repeal Common Core]. January 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a public forum in [[Old Lyme]], State Representative Marilyn Giuliano called on the state to "hit the pause button" on implementation,&lt;ref&gt;''The Day'': [http://www.theday.com/article/20140130/NWS01/301309491/1017 Caution urged as state weighs Common Core standards].

Delaware formally adopted the Standards as the ELA and math components of the Delaware Prioritized Standards.

==Florida==
Florida initially adopted the Standards, but Gov. [[Rick Scott]] has directed the state education board to withdraw from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers.&lt;ref&gt;''Florida Times-Union'': [http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-10-17/story/common-core-still-moving-ahead-florida#ixzz2mL66PT5a Common Core still moving ahead in Florida.] October 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also changed the name of the standards in Florida to Next Generation Sunshine State Standards, saying "These are Florida standards...This is our state. We’re not going to have the federal government telling us how to do our education system."&lt;ref name="FoxNameGame" /&gt;

In February 2014, the Department of Education approved 98 different changes to the Florida standards, scheduled to be implemented in the 2014-2015 school year.&lt;ref&gt;News 13: [http://www.mynews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2014/2/18/state_board_of_educa.html Florida Common Core changes approved despite protest at Orlando meeting].

{{about|the 19th-century diplomatic term| the jazz album| European Concert}}
The '''Concert of Europe''', also known as the '''Congress System''' or the '''Vienna System''' after the [[Congress of Vienna]], was a system of [[dispute resolution]] adopted by the [[Great power|major powers]] of Europe to avoid future conflicts escalating into war, and to solidify and maintain their power in their respective controlled regions.

The more conservative members of the Concert of Europe, who were also members of the [[#Holy Alliance|Holy Alliance]], used this system to oppose revolutionary movements, weaken the forces of nationalism, and uphold the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]. Historians date its operation from the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1815) to the early 1820s, although some see it playing a role until the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/div-classtitlethe-concert-of-europe-a-fresh-look-at-an-international-systemdiv/6E95577CB092748E820521BC01F1564A|title=The Concert of Europe: A Fresh Look at an International System|first=Richard B.|last=Elrod|publisher=|journal=World Politics|volume=28|issue=2|pages=159–174|accessdate=16 June 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.2307/2009888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Concert of Europe was founded by the powers of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which were the members of the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]] that defeated [[Napoleon]] and his [[First French Empire]]. In time, [[France]] was established as a fifth member of the Concert, following the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy]].

At first, the leading personalities of the system were British foreign secretary [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]], Austrian Chancellor [[Klemens von Metternich]] and Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] of Russia. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] of France was largely responsible for quickly returning that country to its place alongside the other major powers in international diplomacy.

[[File:Metternich (c. 1835-40).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], Austrian Chancellor and an influential leader in the Concert of Europe.]]
The age of the Concert is sometimes known as the '''Age of Metternich''', due to the influence of the Austrian chancellor's [[conservatism]] and the dominance of Austria within the [[German Confederation]], or as the '''European Restoration''', because of the [[reactionary]] efforts of the Congress of Vienna to restore Europe to its state before the [[French Revolution]]. It is known in [[German language|German]] as the '''''Pentarchie''''' (pentarchy) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] as the '''Vienna System''' (Венская система, ''Venskaya sistema'').

The Concert of Europe had no written rules or permanent institutions, but at times of crisis any of the member countries could propose a conference.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=David|title=1914 – 1918: The History of the First World War|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026817-1|pages=4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the [[Great Powers]] during this period included [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (1818), [[Carlsbad Decrees|Carlsbad]] (1819), [[Congress of Troppau|Troppau]] (1820), [[Congress of Laibach|Laibach]] (1821), and [[Congress of Verona|Verona]] (1822).&lt;!-- see the section [[#Collapse by 1823]] and do not add conferences between the great powers that took place after 1823 unless there is a sources that says it was part of the "Concert of Europe"--&gt;

The Concert's effectiveness came to an end because of many factors such as the British distrust of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Arnold|title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&amp;pg=PA65|year=2002|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The idea of a European federation had been already raised by figures such as [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loemker |first=Leroy |year=1969 |origyear=1956 |title=Leibniz: Philosophical Papers and Letters |publisher=Reidel |page=58, fn 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John M. |last=Sherwig |title=Lord Grenville's Plan for a Concert of Europe, 1797–99. |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=34 |number=3 |date=September 1962 |pages=284–293 |doi=10.1086/239117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concert of Europe, as developed by Metternich, drew upon their ideas and the notion of a [[balance of power in international relations]], so that the ambitions of each [[Great Power]] would be restrained by the others:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Concert of Europe, as it began to be called at the time, had ... a reality in international law, which derived from the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|final Act of the Vienna Congress]], which stipulated that the boundaries established in 1815 could not be altered without the consent of its eight signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Georges-Henri |last=Soutou |title=Was There a European Order in the Twentieth Century? From the Concert of Europe to the End of the Cold War |journal=Contemporary European History |volume=9 |number=3 |series=Theme Issue: Reflections on the Twentieth Century |date=November 2000 |pages=330 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== French Revolution ===
From the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1792 to the exile of [[Napoleon]] to [[Saint Helena]] in 1815, Europe had been almost constantly at war. During this time, the military conquests of [[France]] had resulted in the spread of [[liberalism]] throughout much of the continent, resulting in many states adopting the [[Napoleonic code]]. Largely as a reaction to the radicalism of the [[French Revolution]],{{sfn|Soutou|2000|p=329}} most victorious powers of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resolved to suppress liberalism and [[nationalism]], and revert largely to the ''[[status quo]]'' of Europe prior to 1789.{{sfn|Soutou|2000|p=330}}

=== Holy Alliance ===
The [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires, formed the [[Holy Alliance]] (26 September 1815) with the expressed intent of preserving [[Christian]] social values and traditional [[monarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07398a.htm |title=Spahn, M. (1910). Holy Alliance |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the anti-Napoleonic coalition promptly joined the Alliance, except for the United Kingdom, a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a more [[liberalism|liberal]] political philosophy. The great powers were now in a system of meeting wherever a problem arose. Britain and France did not send their representatives because they opposed the idea of intervention.&lt;!--[acc to d.thompson]--&gt;

=== Quadruple Alliance ===
Britain did however ratify the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]], signed on the same day as the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Peace Treaty of Paris]] (20 November 1815), which became the [[Quintuple Alliance]] when France joined in 1818. It was also signed by the same three powers that had signed the Holy Alliance on 26 September 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Tim |year=2006 |title=The Congress of Vienna 1814–1815 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134680504 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn0G5na-1j0C&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 60] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences between the Holy Alliance and the Quadruple Alliance ===
There has been much debate between historians as to which treaty was more influential in the development of international relations in Europe in the two decades following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In the opinion of historian Tim Chapman the differences are somewhat academic, as the powers were not bound by the terms of the treaties and many of them intentionally broke the terms if it suited them.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=60}}

The Holy Alliance was the brainchild of Tsar Alexander I. It gained a lot of support because most European monarchs did not wish to offend the Tsar by refusing to sign it, and as it bound monarchs personally rather than their governments, it was easy to ignore once signed. Only three notable princes did not sign: [[Pope Pius VII]] (it was not Catholic enough), [[Mahmud II|Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|the British Prince Regent]] because his government did not wish to pledge itself to the policing of continental Europe. In the opinion of Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary at the time of its inception, the Holy Alliance was "a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense".{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=60}} Although it did not fit comfortably within the complex, sophisticated and cynical web of power politics that epitomised diplomacy of the post-Napoleonic era, its influence was more long lasting than its contemporary critics expected and was revived in the 1820s as a tool of repression when the terms of the Quintuple Alliance were not seen to fit the purposes of some of the Great Powers of Europe.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=61}}

The Quadruple Alliance, by contrast, was a standard treaty, and the four Great Powers did not invite any of their allies to sign it. The primary objective was to bind the signatories to support the terms of the Second Treaty of Paris for 20 years. It included a provision for the High Contracting Parties to "renew their meeting at fixed periods...for the purpose of consulting on their common interests" which were the "prosperity of the Nations, and the maintenance of peace in Europe".{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=62}} A problem with the wording of [[s:Quadruple Alliance#ART.VI|Article VI]] of the treaty is that it did not specify what these "fixed periods" were to be and there were no provisions in the treaty for a permanent commission to arrange and organise the conferences. This meant that the first conference in 1818 dealt with remaining issues of the French wars, but after that instead of meeting at "fixed periods" the meetings were arranged on an ad hoc basis, to address specific threats, such as those posed by [[revolution]]s, for which the treaty was not drafted.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|pp=61–62}}

== Congresses ==

*The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]] resolved the issues of Allied occupation of France and restored that country to equal status with Britain, Prussia, Austria and Russia.

*The [[Congress of Troppau|Congress of Troppau (1820)]] decreed that in the event of revolution a country could be expelled from the European Alliance, and armed intervention could be used to "bring back the guilty state into the bosom of the Great Alliance".

*The [[Congress of Laibach|Congress of Laibach (1821)]]

*In 1822, the [[Congress of Verona]] met to decide whether France could intervene on the side of the Spanish royalists in the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]''. After receiving permission, [[Louis XVIII]] dispatched five army corps to restore [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].

== Collapse by 1823 ==
The territorial boundaries laid down at the Congress of Vienna were maintained; even more important, there was an acceptance of the theme of balance with no major aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Craig, "The System of Alliances and the Balance of Power." in J.P.T. Bury, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 10: The Zenith of European Power, 1830–70'' (1960) p 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the Congress system, says historian Roy Bridge, "failed" by 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Bridge, "Allied Diplomacy in Peacetime: The Failure of the Congress 'System,' 1815–23" in Alan Sked, ed., ''Europe's Balance of Power, 1815–1848'' (1979), pp 34–53&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, the British decided [[Splendid Isolation|not to become involved in continental issues that did not directly affect them]]. They rejected the plan of Alexander I to suppress future revolutions. The Concert system fell apart as the common goals of the Great Powers were replaced by growing political and economic rivalries.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Crawley, "International Relations, 1815–1830" in C.W. Crawley, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 9, War and Peace in an Age of Upheaval, 1793–1830. Vol. 9'' (1965) pp 669–71, 676–77, 683–86. &lt;/ref&gt; Artz says the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822 "marked the end."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction &amp; Revolution: 1814–1832'' (1934) p 170.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no Congress called to restore the old system during the great [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary upheavals of 1848]] with their demands for revision of the Congress of Vienna's frontiers along national lines.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics: 1763–1848'' (1996) p 800.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Paul Hayes says of British foreign minister [[George Canning]]:

{{quote|His most important achievement was the destruction of the system of the neo-Holy Alliance which, if unchallenged, must have dominated Europe. Canning realized it was not enough for Britain to boycott conferences and congresses; it was essential to persuade the Powers that their interests could not be advanced by a system of intervention based upon principles of legitimacy, anti-nationalism and hostility to revolution.&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The 19th Century 1814–80'' (A&amp;C Black, 1975) p 89&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27846">[[Image:CondonReportJacket.jpg|thumb|right|Mass-market paperback edition of the Condon Report, published by New York Times/Bantam Books (January, 1969), 965 pages.]]

The '''Condon Committee''' was the informal name of the '''University of Colorado UFO Project''', a group funded by the [[United States Air Force]] from 1966 to 1968 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] to study [[unidentified flying object]]s under the direction of physicist [[Edward Condon]]. The result of its work, formally titled '''Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects''', and known as the '''Condon Report''', appeared in 1968.

After examining hundreds of UFO files from the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]] and from the civilian UFO groups [[National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP) and [[Aerial Phenomena Research Organization]] (APRO), and investigating sightings reported during the life of the Project, the Committee produced a ''Final Report'' that said the study of UFOs was unlikely to yield major scientific discoveries.

The Report's conclusions were generally welcomed by the scientific community and have been cited as a decisive factor in the generally low level of interest in UFO activity among academics since that time. According to a principal critic of the Report, it is "the most influential public document concerning the scientific status of this UFO problem. Hence, all current scientific work on the UFO problem must make reference to the Condon Report".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ufoskeptic.org/sturrock/1.html|title=An Analysis of the Condon Report on the Colorado UFO Project|first=Peter A|last=Sturrock|authorlink=Peter A.

== Background ==
Beginning in 1947 with [[Project Sign]], which then became [[Project Grudge]] and finally [[Project Blue Book]], the U.S. Air Force conducted formal studies of UFOs, a subject of considerable public and some governmental interest. Blue Book had come under increasing criticism in the 1960s. Growing numbers of critics—including U.S. politicians, newspaper writers, UFO researchers, scientists and some of the general public—were suggesting that Blue Book was conducting shoddy, unsupported research or perpetrating a [[cover up]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Clark, Jerome, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', Visible Ink, 1998, pp. 593-604, {{ISBN|1-57859-029-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force did not want to continue its studies but did not want a cessation of studies to provoke additional charges of a cover-up. UFOs had become such a controversial issue that no other government agency was willing to take on further UFO studies.

Following a wave of UFO reports in 1965, astronomer and Blue Book consultant [[J. Allen Hynek]] wrote a letter to the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) suggesting that a panel convene to re-examine Blue Book. The AFSAB agreed and the committee it formed, chaired by [[Brian O'Brien]], convened for one day in February, 1966, and suggested UFO studies could be undertaken "in more detail and depth than had been possible to date" and that the U.S. Air Force should work "with a few selected universities to provide scientific teams" to study UFOs.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The Committee suggested that about 100 well-documented UFO sightings should be studied annually, with about 10 man-days devoted to each case.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Harkins, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Congressional UFO hearing on April 5, 1966, Air Force Secretary [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] defended the Air Force's UFO studies and repeated the O'Brien Committee's call for more studies.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; Hynek repeated his call for "a civilian panel of physical and social scientists" to "examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists."&lt;ref name="Hynek"&gt;Hynek, J. Allen,''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry'', Henry Regnery Company, 1972, 192-244&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the hearing, the Air Force announced it was seeking one or more [[university|universities]] to undertake a study of UFOs. The Air Force wanted to have several groups, but it took some time to find even a single school willing to accept the Air Force's offer. Both Hynek and [[James E. McDonald]] suggested their own campuses, [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Arizona]], and others suggested astronomer [[Donald Menzel]]. All were judged too closely allied with one position or another.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, ''Biological'', 292. Hynek had a long association with the Air Force, McDonald was pro-UFO and Menzel anti-UFO. Several universities declined to participate, including [[Harvard University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Orr Roberts]], director of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], and Menzel suggested physicist [[Edward Condon]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=dick292&gt;Dick, ''Biological'', 292&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1966, Condon agreed to consider the Air Force's offer. He was among the best known and most distinguished scientists of his time. Condon's tenacious encounters with the [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]] and other government Loyalty Boards in the 1940s and 1950s made him "almost legendary" among fellow scientists.&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Harkins, 33&lt;/ref&gt; On Condon's behalf, Robert J. Low, an assistant dean of the university's graduate program, explored faculty reaction to the proposed project and found it mixed and wary. He tried to reassure those who found the enterprise unworthy of scientific investigation. Low told the ''[[Denver Post]]'' that the project had met the University's acceptance threshold by the narrowest of margins and was accepted largely because it was difficult to say no to the Air Force.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Some have suggested that finances were factor in Colorado's decision to accept the Air Force's offer of $313,000 for the project. Condon dismissed this suggestion, noting that $313,000 was a rather modest budget for an undertaking scheduled to last more than a year with a staff of over a dozen.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Harkins, 29. Total funding later rose above $500,000. Dick, ''Biological'', 293&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 1966, the University of Colorado agreed to undertake the UFO study, with Condon as director, Low as coordinator, and Saunders and astronomer [[Franklin E. Roach]] as co-principal investigators. The Air Force announced its selection of Condon and the University of Colorado in October 1966.&lt;ref name=dick292 /&gt; Other Committee members included astronomer [[William K. Hartmann]]; psychologists [[Michael Wertheimer]], Dan Culbertson and James Wadsworth, a graduate student; chemist Roy Craig; electrical engineer Norman Levine and physicist Frederick Ayer. Several other scientists or experts served in part-time and temporary roles or as consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix X: Authors and Editors, Staff of the Colorado Project, ''Final Report'', 1433-8&lt;/ref&gt; Public response to the Committee's announcement was generally positive&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 225, "optimism on all sides". Hynek characterized Condon's perspective towards UFOs as "basically negative", but he also assumed the Condon's opinions would change once he familiarized himself with evidence in some of the more puzzling UFO cases. [[NICAP]]'s [[Donald Keyhoe]] was publicly supportive, but privately expressed fears that the Air Force would be controlling things from behind the scenes. That a scientist of Condon's standing would involve himself with UFO research heartened some academics who had long expressed interest in the subject, such as atmospheric physicist [[James E. McDonald]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Project was announced, ''The Nation'', commented: "If Dr. Condon and his associates come up with anything less than the little green men from Mars, they will be crucified."&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 250&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee work ==
In November 1966, retired USMC Major [[Donald Keyhoe]] and [[Richard H. Hall]], both of [[NICAP]], briefed the panel. They agreed to share NICAP's research files and to  improve the collection of UFO reports.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The Committee also secured help from [[APRO]], another civilian UFO research group. The Committee moved slowly, hampered by disagreements about the use of funds&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Harkins, 77&lt;/ref&gt; and methodology.&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt; By hiring people with no prior position on UFOs, the Committee staff lacked expertise and subject matter expertise.&lt;ref&gt;One Committee member suggested filming UFOs using stereo cameras mounted with [[diffraction grating]]s in order to study the [[spectrometer|spectrum]] of light emitted by UFOs. This had been attempted some fifteen years earlier following a specific suggestion regarding UFOs made by Joseph Kaplan in 1954, but was quickly judged impractical after a number of such cameras were distributed to Air Force bases. Hynek, pp. ??&lt;/ref&gt; As they began their analyses, Committee members usually worked without coordination with one another. Individuals embraced diverse approaches, especially with respect to the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] (ETH).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 228-30&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 1967, Condon said in a lecture that he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject was 'nonsense', adding, "but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year."&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; One NICAP member resigned from NICAP in protest and Saunders confronted Condon to express his concern that NICAP's withdrawal would eliminate a valuable source of case files and produce damaging publicity.

=== Low memo controversy ===
In July 1967, [[James E. McDonald]], a confirmed believer in the validity of UFO sightings, learned from a Committee member about a memo Low had written on August 9, 1966, in which he reassured two University of Colorado administrators that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality.&lt;ref&gt;"Our study would be conducted almost entirely by non-believers who, though they couldn't possibly prove a negative result, could and probably would add an impressive body of thick evidence that there is no reality to the observations. The ''trick'' would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific community, would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer." Craig, 194-5&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald, after locating a copy of the memo in the project's open files, wrote to Condon, quoting a few lines from it.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

In response to the memo, on April 30, 1968, NICAP severed its ties with the Committee and Keyhoe circulated copies of Low's memo. Press coverage included an article in the May 1968 issue of ''Look'', "Flying Saucer Fiasco", that presented interviews with Saunders and Levine, detailed the controversy, and described the project as a "$500,000 trick."&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Fuller]], "Flying Saucer Fiasco," ''Look'', May 14, 1968, [http://www.project1947.com/shg/articles/fiasco.html available online], accessed May 25, 2011. Fuller was a journalist identified with those who found UFO sightings credible, the author of a 1966 work on a sighting. Craig, 204-6. John G. Fuller, ''Incident at Exeter: The Story of Unidentified Flying Objects Over America Now'' (NY: Putnam, 1966). On Fullr and ''Look'' as interested parties, see Craig, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Condon responded that the article contained "falsehoods and misrepresentations."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 231&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific and technical journals reported the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Research'' reprinted Low's memo, while ''Scientific Research'' interviewed Saunders and Levine, who reported that they were considering a libel suit against Condon for terminating them for alleged "incompetence." They said that Condon had used an "unscientific approach" in directing the Committee. Jacobs, 231. Condon said that calling his methods "unscientific" was itself libelous, and in turn threatened to sue Saunders and Levine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} When the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] covered the Committee controversy in an issue of its official journal ''Science'', Condon first promised to grant an interview, but then declined. He resigned from the AAAS in protest when the article was published without his input. Jacobs, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[J. Edward Roush]] said the ''Look'' article raised "grave doubts as to the scientific profundity and objectivity of the project."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 233. He asked the [[General Accounting Office]] to investigate the study, which the GAO declined to do. Philip M. Boffey, "UFO Project: Trouble on the Ground," in ''Science'', New Series, vol. 161, no. 3839, July 26, 1968, 341&lt;/ref&gt; He held a hearing dominated by critics of the Project.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 241-4. Roush later joined the board of NICAP.&lt;/ref&gt; Low resigned from the Project in May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later critics of the Committee's work saw little reason to make much of the memo. Committee member David Saunders wrote that "to present Low as a plotter or conspirator is unfair and hardly accurate."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Harkins, 128-9. Hynek wrote that Low "wanted his university to get the contract...and to convince the university administration that they should take it." Hynek, pp.?&lt;/ref&gt; Project investigator Roy Craig's later wrote that the memo did not trouble him because Condon had not known of the Low memo for eighteen months and it did not reflect his views.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 200, 202, 227&lt;/ref&gt; Condon wrote in the Project's ''Final Report'' that the memo's description of the Project as emphasizing the "psychology and sociology" of those who report UFO sightings showed how completely Low misunderstood the Project when he wrote the memo.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final months ===
Despite the withdrawal of NICAP from the Project, members of its Early Warning Network continued to report sightings to the investigators, as did journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists who anticipated the Committee would recommend against continued government UFO research rushed their own refutation into print in advance of the Committee's ''Final Report''. Called ''UFO's? Yes!'' and written by Saunders, it questioned whether the CIA wanted to divert public attention from UFOs. It used three cases to make the case for extraterrestrial activity. Project investigator Roy Craig later described each of the cases as "utter nonsense," "highly suspect," and unexplained but very weak.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 228-33. David R. Saunders and R. Roger Harkins, ''UFO's? Yes! Where the Condon Committee Went Wrong'', (World Publishing, 1968); ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/12/archives/science-ufo-verdict-believers-find-it-unbelievable.html Walter Sullivan, "UFO Verdict: Believers Find It Unbelievable," January12, 1969], accessed July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee Report ==
The Committee delivered its Report to the Air Force in November 1968, which released it in January 1969.&lt;ref name=dick299&gt;Dick, ''Biological'', 299&lt;/ref&gt; The Report, 1,485 pages in hardcover and 965 pages in paperback, divided UFO cases into five categories: old UFO reports from before the Committee convened, new reports, photographic cases, radar/visual cases, and UFOs reported by astronauts. Some UFO cases fell into multiple categories. Condon authored 6 pages of "conclusions and recommendations," a 43-page "summary," and a 50-page history of UFO phenomena and research over the preceding twenty years.&lt;ref name=dick299 /&gt;

In his introductory "Conclusions and Recommendations", Condon wrote: "Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby."&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; He also recommended against the creation of a government program to investigate UFO reports.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 224&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the problem that confronts the scientific community, that each scientist must evaluate the record for himself, and that the ''Report'''s recommendation against further research "may not be true for all time."&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', 5; Dick, ''Biological'', 300&lt;/ref&gt; He advised that government agencies and private foundations "ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals...on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis....[E]ach individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits."&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', 4; Craig, 224&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the ''Report'' noted that there were gaps in scientific knowledge in the fields of "atmospheric optics, including radio wave propagation, and of atmospheric electricity" that might benefit from further research in the UFO field.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Report'' detailed 59 case studies, though for legal reasons their locations were changed. ''New York Times'' science editor [[Walter S. Sullivan|Walter Sullivan]], in his introduction to the published version of the ''Report'', said the series "reads like a modern, real-life collection of Sherlock Holmes episodes. The cases range from the eerily perplexing to the preposterously naive. The reader is given a taste of scientific method, even though the cases are often such that they defy anything approaching deductive analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Six chapters covered field studies of such physical evidence as electromagnetic affects, and visual and radar images. One treated the observations of U.S. astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 218-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably in Case 02 in Section IV, Chapter 2 the report said of the 1956 [[Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident]]: "In conclusion, although conventional or natural explanations certainly cannot be ruled out, the probability of such seems low in this case and the probability that at least one genuine UFO was involved appears to be fairly high." &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.ncas.org/condon/text/case02.htm "Case 2: USAF/RAF Radar Sighting"] by [[Staff (military)|Staff]], 1968, Final Report of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before its completion, the Air Force had asked the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to "provide an independent assessment of the scope, the methodology, and the findings" of the Committee. A panel chaired by Yale astronomer Gerald M. Clemence studied the Report for six weeks and concluded that "on the basis of present knowledge the least likely explanation of UFOs is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations by intelligent beings" and that "no high priority in UFO investigations is warranted by data of the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;Dick, ''Biological'', 302; [http://www.project1947.com/shg/articles/nascu.html Review of the University of Colorado Report on Unidentified Flying Objects] by a Panel of the National Academy of Sciences, 1969; Craig, 236-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Report's findings, the Air Force closed [[Project Blue Book]], established in March 1952, on December 17, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, ''Biological'', 274, 278, 307; Craig, 235-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessments ==
The Report earned a mixed reception from scientists and academic journals, while receiving "almost universal praise from the news media". Many newspapers, magazines and journals which published approving reviews or editorials related to the Condon Report. Some compared any continued belief in UFOs with the belief that the earth is flat. Others predicted that interest in UFOs would wane and in a few generations be only dimly remembered. ''Science'', the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said "The Colorado Study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomenon ever conducted."&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 8, 1969 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' offered a generally positive review for the Condon Report, but wondered why so much effort had been expended on such a subject: "The Colorado project is a monumental achievement, but one of perhaps misapplied ingenuity. It would doubtless be inapt to compare it with earlier centuries' attempts to calculate how many angels could balance on the point of a pin; it is more like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, except that the nuts will be quite immune to its impact."&lt;ref&gt;"A Sledgehammer for Nuts", ''Nature'', Volume 221, March 8, 1969, 899-900&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1969, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' headlined its coverage: "U.F.O. Finding: No Visits From Afar." The article said that based on the Report, the ETH could finally be dismissed and all UFO reports had prosaic explanations. It noted that the Report had its critics, but characterized them as "U.F.O. enthusiasts."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/08/archives/u-f-o-finding-no-visits-from-afar-ufo-finding-no-visits-from-afar.html Walter Sullivan, "U.F.O. Finding: No Visits From Afar," January 8, 1969], accessed May 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark says that the author of the ''Times'' assessment, Walter Sullivan, had a conflict of interest. He was the author of the introduction to the Report's paperback edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics made their case repeatedly without obtaining the government support they sought.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, 249-50&lt;/ref&gt; One described the Report as "a rather unorganized compilation of independent articles on disparate subjects, a minority of which dealt with UFOs."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 240&lt;/ref&gt; Hynek described the Report as "a voluminous, rambling, poorly organized" and wrote that "less than half...was addressed to the investigation of UFO reports."&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt; In the April 14, 1969 issue of [[Scientific Research]], Robert L. M. Baker, Jr. wrote that the Condon Committee's Report "seems to justify scientific investigation along many general and specialized frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/shg/articles/sr2.html The UFO Report: Condon Study Falls Short], Robert L. M. Baker, Jr., [[Scientific Research]], April 14, 1969, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the December 1969 issue of ''[[Physics Today]]'', Committee consultant Gerald Rothberg wrote that he had thoroughly investigated about 100 UFO cases, three of four of which left him puzzled. He thought that this "residue of unexplained reports [indicated a] legitimate scientific controversy." &lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; Critics charged that Condon's case summaries were inaccurate or misleading with enigmatic reports "buried" among the confirmed cases.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1969, physicist [[James E. McDonald]] called the Report "inadequate" and said "it represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades, and that its level of scientific argumentation is wholly unsatisfactory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dewoody.net/ufo/Science_in_Default.html James E. McDonald, "Science in Default - Twenty-Two Years of Inadequate UFO Investigations" December 27, 1969] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064152/http://dewoody.net/ufo/Science_in_Default.html |date=July 16, 2011 }}, accessed May 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1969 issue of the ''American Journal of Physics'', Thornton Page reviewed the Condon Report and wrote: "Intelligent laymen can (and do) point out the logical flaw in Condon's conclusion based on a statistically small (and selected) sample, Even in this sample a consistent pattern can be recognized; it is ignored by the 'authorities,' who then compound their 'felony' by recommending that no further observational data be collected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc304.htm Thornton Page, review, ''American Journal of Physics'', Vol. 37, No. 10, October 1969, 1071-1072], accessed May 25, 2011. Page had been a member of the [[Robertson Panel]] which suggested UFOs should be debunked to reduce public interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1970, the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] generally agreed with Condon's suggestion that little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies, but "did not find a basis in the report for [Condon's] prediction that nothing of scientific value will come of further studies."&lt;ref&gt;UFO Evidence:[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc310.htm UFO - An Appraisal of the Problem], 1968 Statement of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Subcommittee on UFOs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principal critics ===
Astronomer [[J. Allen Hynek]] wrote that "The Condon Report settled nothing."&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt; He called Condon's introduction "singularly slanted" and wrote that it "avoided mentioning that there was embedded within the bowels of the report a remaining mystery; that the committee had been unable to furnish adequate explanations for more than a quarter of the cases examined."&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt; Hynek contended that "Condon did not understand the nature and scope of the problem" he was studying&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt; and objected to the idea that only extraterrestrial life could explain UFO activity. By focusing on this hypothesis, he wrote, the Report "did not try to establish whether UFOs really constituted a problem for the scientist, whether physical or social."&lt;ref name="Hynek" /&gt;

Astrophysicist [[Peter A. Sturrock]] wrote that "critical reviews...came from scientists who had actually carried out research in the UFO area, while the laudatory reviews came from scientists who had not carried out such research."&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock, 46&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Sturrock noted a case in which an allegedly supersonic UFO did not produce a [[sonic boom]]. He notes that "we should ''not'' assume that a more advanced civilization could not find some way at traveling with supersonic speeds without producing a sonic boom."&lt;ref name=sturrock40&gt;Sturrock, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Forms of government.svg|300px|thumb|[[Politics of Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[San Marino]] are the only contemporary countries which maintain a directorial system of government.]] 
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Systems}}
{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Expand Italian|Repubblica direttoriale|topic=gov|date=February 2013}} 

A '''directorial republic''' is a country ruled by a college of several people who jointly exercise the powers of a [[head of state]] or a [[head of government]].

In political history, the term '''directory''', in French ''{{lang|fr|directoire}}'', is applied to high collegial institutions of state composed of members styled director. The most important of these by far was the [[French Directory|Directory of 1795–1799]] in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|165043|Directory (French history)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was inspired by the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]], which prominently featured a collegial 12-member Supreme Executive Council with a ''[[primus inter pares]]'' President. Variants of this form of government, based on the French model, were also established in the European regions conquered by France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

In the past, [[National Council of Administration|Uruguay]], [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (after 1974), [[Directorate of Ukraine|Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|165056|Directory (Ukrainian ruling body)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries were ruled by directories. The government of the [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] could in some ways be characterized as a directory, but it developed in a much different pattern discussed in the article on [[Communist state]]s.

The sole country now using this form of government is [[Switzerland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/577225/Switzerland/256999/Labour-and-taxation#toc257001|title=Switzerland - history - geography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and to a lesser extent, [[San Marino]]), where directories rule all levels of administration, federal, [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] and municipal. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] is elected by the Parliament for four years (its members cannot be dismissed), and is composed of seven members, among whom one is President and one is Vice-President, although these are completely symbolic. There is no relationship of confidence between Parliament and the Federal Council. It is a shared system of government that reflects and represents the heterogeneity and multiethnicity of the Swiss people. Direct popular elections are used at the local level.

==Definition==
A Directorial System is a system of government in which the executive power is split among a select number of individuals who are, or ''de facto'' are, equals. Some{{Who|date=January 2016}} have argued that [[Diarchy|diarchies]] such as [[Andorra]] are directorial as executive power is held between more than one person.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Israel]]'s Parliamentary System, a codified, streamlined variant of the [[Westminster System]] under which executive power is vested directly in the Multi-person [[Cabinet of Israel|Cabinet]], as opposed to the President acting on the advice of the Cabinet in a normal Westminster System, can be seen as semi-directorial.

==Examples==

===Current===
* [[Switzerland]]: [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Council]] and equivalent executives of each [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]
* [[San Marino]]: [[Captains Regent]]

===Former===
* [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]

An '''electronic seal''' is a piece of data attached to an electronic document or other data, which ensures data origin and integrity.&lt;ref name="Setsaas1"&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.signicat.com/blog/blog-introduction-digital-seals/ | title=Introduction to digital seals | author=John Erik Setsaas | publisher=Signicat  |date= 24 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114234339/https://www.signicat.com/blog/blog-introduction-digital-seals/ | archive-date=2018-01-15 |access-date=15 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Technically similar to [[digital signatures]], electronic seals serve as evidence that an electronic document was issued by a specific legal entity. For this purpose, electronic seal must be linked to the data sealed with it in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable and also in such a way that a fake seal cannot be created without access to the data (usually a private key) used for creation of the digital seal. This is usually achieved through use of a qualified [[digital certificate]] that is involved in creation of a digital seal. The unique [[private key]] used in the creation of the digital seal ensures non-repudiation: the entity that created the digital seal cannot later deny that it created the seal for that document. If the document is modified after its digital seal was created, the digital seal is not valid for the modified document. This can be checked by anyone with access of the [[public key]] corresponding to the private key used in the creation of the digital seal, ensuring the [[data integrity|integrity]] of the sealed document.

Besides authenticating the document issued by the legal entity, e-Seals can also be used to authenticate any digital asset of the legal person, such as software code or servers. The important difference between a digital signature and an electronic seal is that the latter is usually created by a legal person while digital signatures are created by a natural person. For the creation of a digital signature, action of the person signing a document or data is required. In contrast, the creation of the digital seals can be automatised and incorporated in processes executed automatically in a digital environment.&lt;ref name="Tabor1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/confirm-it-e-seal |  title=Confirm it with an e-seal | author=Michał Tabor | work=eIDAS Observatory | publisher=European Commission |date= 4 July 2016  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235615/https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/confirm-it-e-seal | archive-date=2018-01-15 |access-date=15 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualified electronic seal ==
A qualified electronic seal is an electronic seal that is compliant to EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation) for electronic transactions within the internal European market.&lt;ref name="eIDAS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kreditvergleichsportal24.de/2018/02/11/wie-die-eidas-verordnung-das-kreditwesen-revolutioniert-hat/|title=How the eIDAS regulation has revolutionized the credit system|date=11 February 2018|access-date=22 June 2018|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables to verify the issuer of a document over long periods of time. Qualified electronic seals can be considered as digital equivalent to seals of legal entities on paper. According to the eIDAS regulation, a qualified electronic seal must be created by a qualified electronic device and based on a qualified certificate for electronic seal.&lt;ref name="eIDAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Trust Service Providers according to eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/trust-service-providers-according-to-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Medal of Tolerance''' is a medal established by the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]] (ECTR) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moshekantor.com/en/projects/ectr/events/|title=Вячеслав Моше Кантор|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the prize is to honour and reward extraordinary creative achievements in the promotion of tolerance. The ultimate aim is to draw attention to successful undertakings that can serve as models in the field of tolerance and peace-building. The prize thus recognizes effectiveness as well as vision; impact assessment is a part of the decision process.

This prize is dedicated to effective implementation of the Principles of Tolerance in public and private spheres, in particular in the policy making process, legislative action on the national and regional level and law enforcement activities as well as in the arts, education, culture, science and communication.

The prize is to be awarded to persons, groups of persons, non-governmental, governmental and intergovernmental organizations and institutions for exceptional contributions to and leadership in, the promotion of tolerance on the European continent and to the fight against  intolerance such as xenophobia, anti-Semitism, aggressive nationalism, political extremism and racially motivated hate crime.

The prize may be awarded to the families of outstanding individuals who have lost their lives in the struggle against intolerance.

The prize is a gold 'European Medal of Tolerance' presented to the recipient as a concrete and lasting token of the award.

== History ==
The first Medal of Tolerance was awarded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moshekantor.com/en/projects/ectr/medal/|title=Вячеслав Моше Кантор|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 11, 2008 in the context of the Week of Tolerance in Europe international public initiative.

“We need to unite our efforts to fight any manifestation of extreme nationalism, discrimination, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism throughout Europe,” said European Parliament President [[Martin Schulz]]. “Still today, in parts of Europe, we see the demons of the past raise their ugly heads. This is warning to all of us. As Edmund Burke said ‘All that’s necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/press/press_release_speeches/speeches/sp-2012/sp-2012-october/speeches-2012-october-3.html|title=  Martin Schulz's Speech for the European Medal of Tolerance ceremony to President Ivo Josipović and President Boris Tadić (European Parliament website)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We aim to send a strong message that despite the current difficulties in Europe, a strong and brave leadership can solve problems peacefully," said [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation|ECTR]] Co-Chairman [[Viatcheslav Kantor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/62380|title= President of Croatia and former president of Serbia to receive Medal of Tolerance Award (European Jewish Press)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States|American]] history, the '''Fire-Eaters''' were a group of pro-[[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] Southerners in the [[Antebellum South]] who urged the separation of Southern states into a new nation, which became the [[Confederate States of America]].   The dean of the group was [[Robert Barnwell Rhett]] of [[South Carolina]]. Some sought to reopen the [[international slave trade]], which had been [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|illegal since 1808]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill|title=The American South: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aB-KVztmjcC&amp;pg=PA363|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=363|isbn=9780742563995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
By radically urging [[secessionism|secession]] in the South, the Fire-Eaters demonstrated the high level of [[sectionalism]] existing in the U.S. during the 1850s, and they materially contributed to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861–1865). As early as 1850, there was a Southern minority of pro-slavery [[extremism|extremists]] who did much to weaken the fragile unity of the nation.  Led by such men as [[Edmund Ruffin]], [[Robert Rhett]], [[Louis T. Wigfall]], and [[William Lowndes Yancey]], this group was dubbed "Fire-Eaters" by [[Northern United States|northerners]].  At an [[Nashville Convention|1850 convention]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the Fire-Eaters urged Southern secession, citing irrevocable differences between the North and the South, and they inflamed passions by using [[propaganda]] against the North.  However, the [[Compromise of 1850]] and other moderate counsel kept the Fire-Eaters cool for a time.

In the later half of the 1850s, the group reemerged. During the [[United States presidential election, 1856|election of 1856]], Fire-Eaters used threats of secession in order to persuade Northerners, valuing unity over anti-slavery, to vote for [[James Buchanan]]. They used several recent events for propaganda, among them "[[Bleeding Kansas]]" and the [[Caning of Charles Sumner|Sumner-Brooks Affair]], to accuse the North of trying to abolish [[slavery]] immediately. Using effective propaganda against [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]] presidential candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]], the nominee of the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the Fire-Eaters were able to convince many southerners of this. However, Lincoln, despite abolitionist sentiment within the party, had promised not to abolish slavery in the Southern states, but only to forbid it in the territories.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Douglas L. [https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/lincoln/essays/lincoln-and-abolitionism Lincoln and Abolitionism] ''The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.'' Retrieved March 30 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  They first targeted [[South Carolina]], which passed an article of secession in December 1860.  Wigfall, for one, actively encouraged an attack on [[Fort Sumter]] to prompt [[Virginia]] and other upper Southern States to secede as well.  The Fire-Eaters helped to unleash a chain reaction that eventually led to the formation of the [[Confederate States of America]] and to the [[American Civil War]]. Their influence waned quickly after the start of major fighting.

{{proofreader needed}}
The '''highest official of the subject of the Russian Federation''' or the '''holder of the highest office of subject of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|высшее должностное лицо субъекта Российской Федерации}}) or the '''head of the highest  executive body of state power of the subject of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|руководитель высшего исполнительного органа государственной власти субъекта Российской Федерации}}), colloquially and collectively referred to as the title '''[[governor]]''' ({{lang-ru|губернатор}} - ''gubernator'') or '''head of region''' ({{lang-ru|глава региона}} - ''glava regiona''), is the head and the [[chief executive]] of each the [[federal subjects of Russia]], not directly subordinate to the federal authorities, but the political and ceremonial head of the federal subject, all of which are equal constituent entities of Russia.

The office is defined by the [[Constitution of Russia]] and Chapters 1, 3 and 4 of Russia's Federal Law No. 184-FZ "On the General Principles of the Organization Of the Legislative (Representative) and Executive Organs Of State Power of the Subjects of the Russian Federation" which came into force in 1999. According to the current revision of the Russian Constitution, the Russian Federation consists of 85 federal subjects therefore there are 85 offices of head of region in Russia (see [[List of current heads of federal subjects of Russia]]).

The certain title of office is defined by the federal subject's Constitution or Charter. The names include: governor, president ({{lang-ru|президент}} - ''president''), head of administration ({{lang-ru|глава администрации}} - ''glava administratsii''), head of republic ({{lang-ru|глава республики}} - ''glava respubliki''), mayor ({{lang-ru|мэр}} - ''mer''), non-officially and collectively referred to as '''governors''' for short. The official title governor is most used in Russia and traditionally it is used in [[Oblasts of Russia]]. Presidents of Russia's republics, [[mayor of Moscow]] and [[mayor of St. Petersburg]] are also governors in this sense.

A head of the subject in Russia is said to serve a ''administration'' or ''executive office'', colloquially referred to as ''gubernatorial administration''.

==Role and powers==
The [[Constitution]] preserves the notion that the country is a [[federation]] of semi-sovereign federal subjects and that powers not specifically granted to the [[Federal government of the Russian Federation|federal government]] are retained by the federal subjects. Federal subjects, therefore, are not administrative divisions. Regional governments in Russia are relatively powerful; each federal subject has its own independent criminal and civil law codes, as well as manages its internal government.

The governor thus heads the executive branch in the federal subjects and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, and in many territories the governor has partial or absolute power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or [[pardon]] a [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. All governors serve five-year terms for no more than two terms in row.

In all federal subjects, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the legislature and in some cases by other elected executive officials.

A governor may give an annual address about his achievements in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being "from time to time") on the territory or condition of the republic/oblast. Governors of oblasts may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations. The governor may also have an [[official residence]].

==History==
{{main|Governorate (Russia)}}
{{main|Governorate-General (Russian Empire)}}

In modern Russia, the governor - is the highest official figure in the Russian Federation (territory, region, autonomous region, city), heads the executive branch in the Republics and oblasts of the Russian Federation.

On November 30, 1991, Presidential decree of Yeltsin, appointed [[Boris Nemtsov]] to the post of governor of the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] region in and the first week of work at the new location, Nemtsov then issued a decree according to which he, the head of the regional government is to officially called the governor. Thus, he became the first governor of the new Russia.

From 1995 to 2005, governors were elected by the residents of the Russian Federation in the framework of direct, equal and secret ballot. From 2005 to 2012, governors were appointed by the legislative (representative) bodies of subjects of the Russian Federation by the recommendation of the [[President of Russia]].

On June 1, 2012, an Act came into force, which returns the direct election of senior officials in the regions. In 2015, governors were restricted to a term of five years, with no more than two consecutive terms.

==Demographics==

===Party===
As of October 2017 there are 77 members of [[United Russia]], two [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communists]], one [[LDPR (political party)|Liberal Democrat]], one member of [[A Just Russia]], and four independents serving as governors.

===Tenure===
For each term, governors serve five years in office.

The longest-serving current governor is [[Aman Tuleyev]] of [[Kemerovo Oblast]], who has served six consecutive terms since 1 July 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6284">'''"Harry and Louise"''' was a $14 to $20 million year-long [[television advertisement|television advertising]] campaign funded by the [[Health Insurance Association of America]] (HIAA)—a predecessor of the current [[America’s Health Insurance Plans]] (AHIP)—a [[health insurance]] industry [[lobby group]], that ran intermittently from September 8, 1993 to September 1994 in opposition to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan|proposed health care plan]] in 1993–1994 and [[United States Congress|Congressional]] health care reform proposals in 1994. Fourteen television ads and radio and print advertising depicted a fictional suburban forty-something middle-class married couple, portrayed by actors Harry Johnson and [[Louise Caire Clark]], despairing over bureaucratic and other aspects of health care reform plans and urged viewers to contact their representatives in Congress.  The commercials were ordered by HIAA president [[Bill Gradison]] and HIAA executive vice president [[Charles N. Kahn III|Chip Kahn]], and created by California public relations consultants [[Ben Goddard]] and Rick Claussen of Goddard Claussen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Jeffrey Birnbaum|Birnbaum, Jeffrey H.]]

The couple returned in several newer advertisements pushing health care reform during the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns. In 2000, Harry and Louise appeared in a TV commercial sponsored by HIAA promoting its "InsureUSA" campaign advocating the need to provide health coverage to uninsured Americans.&lt;ref&gt;

Later, they returned in an unrelated 2002 ad, produced by Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli (Goddard Claussen was purchased by [[Porter Novelli]] in 1999), advocating [[human cloning]] for therapeutic purposes on behalf of CuresNow.org. The second ad was the subject of a lawsuit by the HIAA who claimed that they owned the characters; however, a court ruled that the rights to the characters were held by Goddard Claussen, and it aired during a showing of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' on [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

An older couple sitting at the kitchen table bemoans the "foreign-sounding names" of the best actress nominees, then praises [[Reese Witherspoon]] for having an all-American name.

Harry and Louise appeared again in an ad that premiered on August 25, 2008, during the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]], urging that [[health care reform]] be made a top priority. The ad aired again during the [[Republican National Convention]]. The 2008 ad was sponsored by several organizations that have, in the past, advocated diverse views on health care, including The [[American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network]], the [[American Hospital Association]], the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Health Association]], [[Families USA]], and the [[National Federation of Independent Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In July 2009, the couple appeared in a new television advertisement in support of the health-care plan promoted by President [[Barack Obama]].

'''It takes two to tango''' is a common [[idiom]]atic expression which suggests something in which more than one person or other entity are paired in an inextricably-related and active manner, occasionally with negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Eric. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAzOg4eQl2YC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''The new dictionary of cultural literacy,'' p. 52,]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[tango (dance)|tango]] is a [[dance]] which requires two partners moving in relation to each other, sometimes in  [[tandem]], sometimes in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Anthony. [http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25351-2141795,00.html  "Tango with an axe to grind,"] ''The Times Literary Supplement.'' April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The meaning of this expression has been extended to include any situation in which the two partners are by definition understood to be essential—as in, a [[marriage]] with only one partner ceases to be a marriage.

==History==
The phrase originated in a  song, [[Takes Two to Tango (song)|''Takes Two to Tango'']], which was written and composed in 1952 by [[Al Hoffman]] and [[Dick Manning]]. The lyrics and melody were popularized by singer [[Pearl Bailey]]'s 1952 recording.&lt;ref name="mieder125"&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AeC4DCmfaAUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=two+to+tango&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;vq=%22The+Concise+Oxford+dictionary+of+proverbs%22&amp;source=gbs_book_citations_r&amp;cad=1_0#PPA125,M1  The Politics of Proverbs: From Traditional Wisdom to Proverbial Stereotypes,'' p. 125.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was reported widely in the international media when Ronald Reagan quipped about Russian-American relations during a 1982 presidential news conference.&lt;ref name="mieder125"/&gt;  Reagan stated: "For ten years détente was based on words by them [the Russians] and not any words to back them up. And we need some action that they — it takes two to tango — that they want to tango also." &lt;ref&gt;"Transcript of President's News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Affairs," ''New York Times.'' November 12, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since that time, the tango metaphor has appeared regularly in the headline of the international press.  The phrase has gained currency as a proverb in loan translation in other languages.&lt;ref name="mieder125"/&gt;

This expression has become a familiar proverbial expression; and it has also found its way into American legal writing, as in:
* "It takes at least two to tango for conspiracy purposes." -- ''US v. Villasanor,'' 894 F.2d 1422 (5th Cir. 1990).&lt;ref name="brooks185"&gt;Brooks, Peter. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=88BQdDHU9cAC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=#PPA185,M1  ''Law's Stories,'' p. 185.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "This is a situation where it takes more than two to tango," -- ''Gant v. Aliquippa Borough,'' 612 F.Supp. 1139 (W.D. Penn. 1985).&lt;ref name="brooks185"/&gt;
More generally in instances involving a dubious transaction, like a bribe, conventional wisdom in America and in the United Kingdom presumes that if one is guilty, both are.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm3jbg0JalMC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=#PPA255,M1  ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases,'' p. 255.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations on a theme==
The phrase is incorporated in the lyrics of the song "[[Takes Two to Tango (song)|Takes Two to Tango]]", written by [[Al Hoffman]] and [[Dick Manning]] about romance, but the open-ended possibilities of the idomatic expression are available for a wider range of prospective applications.  One stanza of the song explains:
::::You can sail in a ship by yourself,
::::Take a nap or a nip by yourself.
::::You can get into debt on your own.
::::There are lots of things that you can do alone.
::::(But it)
::::Takes two to tango ... etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rfWFu5C-tL0C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''Proverbs: a Handbook,'' p. 233.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, American multi-instrumentalist, [[singer-songwriter]], and record producer [[Todd Rundgren]] released his [[double album]] ''[[Something/Anything?]]'', which includes "It Takes Two to Tango (This is for the Girls)", a song composed, arranged and performed by him.&lt;ref&gt;Rundgren, Todd. (P) 1972. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDYK_Ea1NKg= ''It Takes Two to Tango (This is for the Girls)''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[George Carlin]] observed: "It takes two to tango. Sounds good, but simple reasoning will reveal that it only takes one to tango.  It takes two to tango together, maybe, but one person is certainly capable of tangoing on his own."&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, George. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gz4WFeWIbK4C&amp;pg=PT153&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''Brain Droppings,'' p. 138.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase may be used for situations in which one person is being blamed, but two are actually at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Michael LaFargue, Michael. (1994). [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9ilebsboeYC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''Tao and Method,'' p. 138.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===It takes two to cooperate===
"It takes two to tango" may be used to mean that some things need the active cooperation of two parties in some enterprise—for example, as in the following comment:
* "We'll never pass this bill unless both parties work out a compromise -- ''it takes two to tango''.&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms," p. 348.]&lt;/ref&gt;
===It takes two to make a bargain===
"It takes two to tango" may be used to mean "an agreement or a consensual bargain requires the assent of both parties for the deal to be deemed successful -- for example, as in the following exchange:
* "We decided you should make dinner tonight." and 
* "No, &lt;u&gt;we&lt;/u&gt; didn't decide anything -- you made that decision by yourself and I had no part in it because you walked out the door before I could say anything one way or the other and ''it takes two to tango''."&lt;ref name="dolgopolov255"&gt;Dolgopolov, Yuri. (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wuLrTJ0wtlMC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=it+takes+two+to+tango&amp;lr=  ''A Collection of Confusable Phrases: False 'Friends' and 'Enemies' in Idioms and Collocations,'' p. 255.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===It takes two to make a quarrel===
"It takes two to tango" may be used to mean "a quarrel requires two disputing parties," is an expression which is often used in situations in which both partners in the dispute should or could be said to share responsibility—for example, as in the following observation:
* "Love, affection and honesty are the main bases for a stable and loving parent-child relationship and ''it takes two to tango''."&lt;ref name="dolgopolov255"/&gt;

===It takes more than two to tango, or something like that===
This line was  used by [[Adam Sandler]] in the film [[Billy Madison]], in a misrepresentation of the common idiom.

'''Javanisation''' ({{lang-id|Jawanisasi or Penjawaan}}) is the process in which [[Javanese culture]] dominates, assimilates, or influences other cultures in general. The term "Javanise" means "to make or to become Javanese in form, idiom, style, or character." This domination could take place in various aspects; such as cultural, language, politics and social.

In its modern sense within [[Indonesia]]n social, cultural and politics perspective; Javanisation simply means the spreading of rural [[Javanese people|Javanese population]] of densely populated [[Java]] to less populated parts of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Transmigration program]] of Indonesia, the government policy to resettles the poor Javanese to outer parts of Indonesia are generally not welcomed by native populations, especially when the newcomers threaten to become the majority there.&lt;/ref&gt; While to others it could also mean the conscious or unconscious imposition of Javanese patterns of thought and behaviour throughout Indonesia, in the sense of [[cultural imperialism]]. In previous sense it is more focused on thinking and practice of those in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term "Javanise" however, is not only to describe outward process, but also inward; it is also used to describes the adoption and assimilation of foreign social-cultural influences and elements into Javanese culture. These foreign influences are somehow are interpreted and adopted to suit Javanese frame of reference, style, needs and social-cultural conditions. The adoption of Indian Hindu epics and cultural elements in 5th to 15th-century Java and the adoption of [[Islam]] introduced by [[Wali Songo]] into Javanese culture in 15th-century are the notable examples.

The promotion and expansion of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[Javanese language]], architecture, [[Javanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[batik]], [[wayang]], [[gamelan]] and [[kris]] are also can be seen as the manifestation of Javanisation process. The Javanese migration to settle in places out of their traditional homeland in [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]] to other places in Indonesia ([[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], etc.), [[Malay peninsula]] (esp. [[Johor]]), to [[Suriname]], is also a contributing factor of Javanisation process.

==Manifestation==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Wajangfiguur van karbouwenhuid voorstellende een pauzeteken TMnr 4551-27.jpg|thumb|right|Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[wayang]] and [[gamelan]] are often used to promote the excellence of Javanese culture.]]
This Javanese cultural hegemony or domination could take form in various aspects. Such as physical through the expansions and settlements of Javanese diaspora outside their traditional homeland in Java. In spiritual and behavioural aspects, the Javanisation process includes the promotion of [[Javanese culture]] and values; such as obsession with elegance and refinements (Javanese: ''alus''), subtleness, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese values harmony and social order highly, and abhorred direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values were often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[Javanese dance]], [[gamelan]], [[wayang]] and [[batik]] as national culture of Indonesia. It also being reinforced through adherence to Javanese ''adat'' (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as [[Slametan]], [[Satu Suro]], Javanese wedding and [[Naloni Mitoni]].

In the language aspect, such as the using of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] terms, idioms, and vocabularies outside of traditional Javanese language realm. For example, today it is commons for Indonesians to use Javanese terms to address people across Indonesia, such as ''"Mas"'' (to address the same of age or slightly older male) or ''"Mbak"'' (for female counterparts). It is common in national capital [[Jakarta]]; however, this phenomenon has somewhat alarmed the [[Malay language|Malay]]- and [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]-speaking realms in [[Sumatra]] that considered it as a form of Javanisation and cultural imperialism.

In social and politics, the examples of perceived Javanisation such as numbers of [[Indonesian President]]s are always Javanese (with exception of [[B. J. Habibie]]). Also the alleged Javanese political dominance in government administrations, civil service, military and police, as well as Javanese traits in Indonesian political culture.

==Early history==
[[File:Majapahit Empire.svg|thumb|right|The expansion of [[Majapahit]] empire circa 14th century]]
The island of [[Java]] has been a centre stage of [[Indonesian history]] for centuries, and [[Javanese people]] as the largest [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]] has been dominating the [[politics]] and social landscapes in the past as well as modern [[Indonesia]].

In its early stages, Javanese culture was heavily influenced by [[India]]n [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] civilisation. The example of this process is the adoptions of large numbers of [[sanskrit]] loanwords into [[old Javanese]], and the Javanisation of Indian Hindu epics such as [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] into Javanese version, and incorporating local deities such as [[Semar]] and [[Punakawan]] into their [[Wayang]] Purwa stories. The process of adopting Hindu influences is describes as the [[Sanskritisation]] of Java and the Javanisation of the Bharata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The blossoming of Javanese classical literature for example are the composing of [[Kakawin Ramayana]] and [[Arjunawiwaha]].

The early examples of Javanisation is the expansion of Javanese [[Sailendra]]n arts — developed in 8th to 9th-century Central Java — that influences the aesthethics of [[Srivijaya]]n [[Buddhist art]]s discovered in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay peninsula. Despite absorbing Indian influences from [[Gupta]] and  [[Amaravati (mythology)|Amaravati]] arts, to Southern India Pallava influences, Javanese Sailendran art in return influenced the art and aesthethic of the Southeast Asian region.

In early classical period, during Eastern Java [[Medang kingdom]] in 10th-century, saw the expansion of Javanese influence to [[Bali]]. East Javanese princess [[Mahendradatta]] become the queen consort of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of Bali, signify the Javanese increasing influences upon Bali. During the reign of [[Airlangga]], Bali pretty much become parts of East Javanese Hindu kingdom realm.

The expansion of [[Singhasari]] kingdom in 13th-century during the reign of [[Kertanegara]] has strengthen the Javanese influence in the region, especially upon Bali and [[Melayu Kingdom]] in Eastern coast of Sumatra, through [[Pamalayu expedition]]. In 1200 CE, Mpu Jatmika from Java established the Hindu Kingdom of Negara Dipa by the river of Tapin, this was the start of the Javanese-style courts in South Kalimantan.

Followed by the expansion of [[Majapahit]] empire circa 14th-century, the archipelago saw again the Javanese expansion. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]] and [[kris]], being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java; such as Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Borneo. It was during this era that the town [[Banjarmasin]] in [[South Kalimantan]] and [[Sukadana]] in West Kalimantan has been established as Javanese colony as the vassal of Majapahit. In 1400 CE, Negara Dipa was succeeded by the Hindu Kingdom of [[Negara Daha]]. The Javanese influences can be seen on [[Banjar people]] art, culture, and costumes that demonstrated Javanese styles.

It was also during the last period of Majapahit in the 15th century that the native [[Austronesian]] elements of pre Hindu-Javanese style are revived, as demonstrated in [[Sukuh]] and [[Cetho]] temples. The stiffer wayang style figures of statues and bas reliefs, and the [[stepped pyramid]] temple structure replaced the classic towering Hindu temples. This reverse of [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized]] process is also called the "Javanisation" of Hindu-Buddhist prototypes in Javanese art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Later history==
[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 60006336 Portret van een Javaanse vrouw met ee.jpg|thumb|upright|The Javanese diaspora such as those to [[Suriname]] in Dutch colonial period also contributed to the spread of Javanese culture.]]
After the fall of Majapahit, [[Demak Sultanate]] replace its hegemony in Southern Sumatra by appointing Javanese regent to rule [[Palembang]]. In the early 17th century, the Sultanate of Palembang was established by Ki Gede ing Suro, a Javanese nobleman fleeing the Demak court intrique after the death of Trenggana Sultan of Demak. The Sultanate of Palembang are known as the combination of various cultures; Malay, Javanese, Islamic and Chinese. The Javanisation process of Palembang Sultanate court is evident in the adoption of Javanese words and vocabularies into local [[Musi language|Malay Palembang dialect]], such as ''wong'' (people) and ''banyu'' (water).

During the ambitious [[Sultan Agung]]'s reign of [[Mataram Sultanate]] in the first half of the 17th century, Javanese culture again expanded, much of Western and East Java region are being Javanised. [[Mataram conquest of Surabaya|Mataram's campaign]] on Eastern Javanese principalities such as Surabaya and Pasuruan expanded Mataraman influences on Java. Mataram expansion includes [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] principalities of [[Priangan]] highlands; from Galuh Ciamis, Sumedang, Bandung and Cianjur. It was during this period that Sundanese people were exposed and assimilated further into Javanese ''[[Kejawen]]'' culture. [[Wayang Golek]] are Sundanese taking on Javanese Wayang Kulit culture, similar shared culture such as [[gamelan]] and [[batik]] also flourished. It is probably during this times that [[Sundanese language]] began to adopt the stratified degree of term and vocabulary to denote politeness, as reflected in [[Javanese language]]. In addition, [[Javanese script]]s also used to write Sundanese as ''cacarakan''.

Foreign influences and ideas such as religions and beliefs are sometimes consciously and deliberately undergone changes and adaptations, being "Javanised" to be accepted by popular Javanese audiences. The examples such as the process that took place in the 15th century dubbed as "the [[Islamisation]] of Java and the Javanisation of Islam." The [[Wali Songo]]s such as [[Sunan Kalijaga]] are known to use Javanese cultural expressions such as [[gamelan]] and wayang to promote and spread Islamic faith. [[Wayang#Wayang sadat|Wayang sadat]] is a variant of wayang that used to in tabligh and [[da'wah]] to spread Islamic messages. Another example Javanisation of Islam in Java is the construction of pyramidal multi-tiered roof of [[Java-Malay architecture|Javanese mosque]]. Javanese mosque did not applied dome, minaret, brick or stone masonry, but instead adopted wood carpentry of [[pendopo]] and meru-like roofs derived from previous pre-Islamic art and architecture of Java. The example of this kinds of mosque are [[Demak Great Mosque]] and Yogyakarta Grand Mosque.

File:Ganjuran Church, exterior 01.jpg|[[Ganjuran Church]] in Bantul, built in traditional Javanese architecture.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Catholics]] faith for examples are also using Javanese vocabularies and frame of reference by using the term ''"Romo"'' (Javanese: ''father'') for "father" to refer to [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]]. Catholic  proselytising efforts also used traditional wayang art to spread their message; the [[Wayang#Wayang wahyu|wayang wahyu]] used to perform the biblical story and Christianity. In architecture, Catholicism also adopted Javanese style and architecture for their church, such as the [[Ganjuran Church]] in Bantul, Yogyakarta, that constructed the shrine of Jesus in ancient Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] architecture. Another example includes Pohsarang Church in Kediri that built in traditional Javanese architecture.

During colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] period, numbers of Javanese are migrated to [[Suriname]] as plantation workers. Within the archipelago, Javanese are also migrate to several places such as Sumatra, Kalimantan and Johor in Malay peninsula. Regions such as northern [[West Java]], [[Lampung]] and [[South Kalimantan]] are known to have large numbers of Javanese settlers.

==Modern history==
[[File:Pernikahan Jawa-Javanese Wedding 2011 Bennylin 24.jpg|thumb|upright|Javanese cultural identity were reinforced through traditional ceremonies, such as Javanese wedding]]
After the [[Indonesian revolution]] (1945-1949) and the independence of Indonesia, many of Indonesian national symbols are derived from its [[Majapahit]] legacy, an empire that centred in Java in 14th to 15th century. [[Indonesian flag]] displayed Majapahit colours, the national motto [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]] and the state ideology [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] also demonstrates its Majapahit legacy. Indonesian founding fathers, especially [[Sukarno]] did dig into Indonesian past of indigenous wisdom and philosophy to formulate the new nationhood of Indonesia. Naturally Javanese culture as one of the most influential major element in Indonesian culture contributed its share of influences.

During [[Suharto]]'s New Order regime (1966-1998), the political culture of Indonesia is somewhat perceived as being Javanised. The administration levels were also arranged in Javanese styles and idioms, such as ''[[Kabupaten]]'' and ''desa'', the terms that originally not familiar in some of Indonesian provinces, such as [[West Sumatra]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. In this post-independence Indonesia sense, the term "Javanisation" is used to describe the process whereby [[Javanese people|ethnic Javanese]] and Javanised individuals gradually became the overwhelming and disproportionate majority of the governing elite in the Indonesian post-independence era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==
[[File:Suharto and wife in Javanese attire.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Suharto]] and wife, [[Tien Suharto|Tien]], in traditional Javanese attire. His authoritarian New Order regime has been criticised as "Javanising" Indonesian politics.]]
The issue of Javanisation has been a sensitive and critical issues in [[Indonesia]]n national building and national unity. The Javanese domination is regarded not only on the realm of culture, but also social, politics and economy. The [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime is criticised as has Javanised Indonesian politics during decades of his rules. In politics, administration, authority and civil service perspective, this Javanisation is sometimes perceived negatively as it contains the worst elements of Javanese culture, such as rigidity of social hierarchy, [[authoritarianism]] and arbitrariness. A development that sometimes called as "[[Mataram Sultanate|Mataramisation]]" and "[[feudalism|feudalisation]]", accompanied by fondness of status display and arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; A typical negative description of [[priyayi]] behaving like the member of Javanese upper class.

The [[Transmigration program]] that relocate people from densely populated Java to other Indonesian islands, such as [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Indonesian New Guinea]], is also criticised has accelerated and promoted the Javanisation process of Indonesia. The issue also fuels with development disparity issues, where other islands are dissatisfied with the development and social welfare in their region, in contrast with infrastructure development and wealth distribution that seems to be in favour and focused on Java.

However today in the era of local autonomy, it is not relevant to connect the transmigration program to Javanisation issues, because the migration process is also conducted internally within Java, or within certain provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Eastern Indonesia such as in [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and Papua, the majority of the non-native settlers are from Sulawesi ([[Bugis]]-Makassar and [[Buton]]) and Maluku itself, and not from Java. The transmigration should carefully examine economic potential, as well as social and cultural impact of the area. It is also based on the fact that the provinces which open themselves to [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and accept inter-province settlers and migrations are usually developing more rapidly compared to those that isolate themselves. It is also important to note, that Java itself has attracted ''perantau'' (migrant settlers) and workers from all over the Indonesian archipelago, and subsequently the demographics of Java is not homogenous.

'''Kenneth J. "Ken" Block''' (born October 11, 1965) is an American businessman, [[software engineer]], and [[political reformer]]. He is the founder of the [[Moderate Party of Rhode Island]], the state's third-largest political party, and ran as the Moderate candidate for [[Governor of Rhode Island]] in the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]].

While leader of the Moderate Party, Block was an advocate for economic, educational, and political reforms in Rhode Island. His court battle to gain official state recognition for the Moderates in 2009 overturned several [[unconstitutional]] laws and made it easier for [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] to gain signatures and access election ballots. In a highly contested four-way election, Block received 6.5% of the vote in the Governor's Race.

Block emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] in the aftermath of the 2010 elections. He publicly opposed the controversial $75 million loan and subsequent taxpayer bailout of [[38 Studios]], the taxpayer-funded redevelopment the [[Superman Building]], and introduction of the [[Sakonnet River Bridge]] [[Toll bridge|toll]]. Block has also called for the elimination of the "[[master lever]]" from election ballots which he argues creates [[voter disenfranchisement]] and unfairly benefits larger political parties. He eventually created [[MasterLever.org]] to explain his position and enable the public to contact state officials via [[e-mail]].

As a small business owner, Block has run several [[software companies]] which have worked with state governments to identify [[welfare fraud|fraud]] and [[government waste]] in [[social service]] and [[welfare]] programs. In 1995, Block was able to save the [[Government of Texas|state of Texas]] over $1 billion by developing a new statewide [[debit card]] system. Shortly after the 2010 election, Block offered his company's help free of charge to find waste and fraud in Rhode Island's entitlement programs. He was subsequently involved in the state's [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] waste and fraud report as well as assisting the [[List of law enforcement agencies in Rhode Island|Providence Police Department]]'s fraud unit to better access state records in late 2012. Police investigators have claimed that the new computer software will help detect millions of dollars in fraud.

He also served as president of RI Taxpayers, a [[taxpayer groups|taxpayer advocacy]] and [[List of consumer organizations|watchdog]] group, until his resignation in May 2013 when he announced his candidacy for governor in the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]]. In October 2013, Block announced that he had joined the [[Rhode Island Republican Party]] and intended to challenge [[Cranston]] Mayor [[Allan Fung]] in the upcoming Republican primary. He based his campaign on a plan to save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion by eliminating wasteful spending.

== Early life ==
Kenneth J. Block was born and raised in [[Milford, Connecticut]]. The oldest of three children, Block's family lived in the same house as his grandparents. He graduated from [[Milford High School (Connecticut)|Milford High School]] in 1983 and then attended [[Dartmouth College]] where he earned a [[bachelor’s degree]] in [[computer science]] four years later. Block began his career writing software for [[Wall Street]] [[trading desk]]s during the late 1980s. He was employed by the [[Bank of New England]] and worked at small software consultancy firms Dalcomp Corporation and LOBB Systems. In 1991, Block moved to Rhode Island to work for the Providence-based [[GTECH Corporation]]. Although initially a one-year consultancy, he stayed with the company for another six years. From 1995 to 1999, Block was president of Kinetic Consulting, Inc., a software consultation firm that worked with state agencies to identify government waste and abuse as well as improving the overall efficiency of their spending programs, until the [[dot-com bust]] forced him to close the company.&lt;ref name="Nagle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golocalprov.com/news/ken-block-to-run-for-rhode-island-governor-as-republican/ |title=Ken Block to Run for Rhode Island Governor as Republican |author=Nagle, Kate |date=October 28, 2013 |website=GoLocalProv.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Block founded Simpatico Software Systems, a [[data mining]] service used by government agencies and private businesses to track waste and fraud.&lt;ref name="Bashkatova"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ken Block enters Republican gubernatorial primary |author=Bashkatova, Mariya |url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/11/05/ken-block-enters-republican-gubernatorial-primary/ |newspaper=[[The Brown Daily Herald]] |date=November 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it supplies software services to the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP program]]. Similar to his first company, Simpatico Systems also provided engineering and consulting services. Its clients have included the EVERTEC and GTECH Corporations, [[Northrop Grumman]], and the [[Government of Texas|state government of Texas]]. In Texas, Block's company developed a statewide [[debit card]] system for [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamp]] and [[welfare]] recipients that saved the state more than $1 billion.&lt;ref name="RILPB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/News/pr1.asp?prid=7411 |title=Baldelli Hunt: Ken Block volunteer offer good news for R.I. |author=Rhode Island General Assembly |date=June 10, 2011 |website= |publisher=Rhode Island Legislative Press Bureau |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/29/kenneth-block/block-says-system-he-helped-create-detect-welfare-/ |title=Block says system he helped create to detect welfare fraud has saved more than $1 billion |author=Emery, C.

{{main|Moderate Party of Rhode Island}}
In 2007, Block decided to enter the [[Politics of Rhode Island|Rhode Island political scene]]. In later interviews, Block said that he entered politics out of frustration with the state government's inability to solve Rhode Island's declining economy and education system.&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt; He was particularly concerned that his children were not getting a quality education in [[State school|public school]]s and, like many young Rhode Islanders, would eventually have to leave the state due to high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastbayri.com/news/barringtons-ken-block-has-a-new-party/ |title=Barrington’s Ken Block has a new party |author=Bickford, Josh |date=November 11, 2013 |website=EastBayRI.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted the difficulty for small business owners to operate in the state and that the high tax rate forced many companies to relocate to Massachusetts and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Bashkatova"/&gt; As a longtime business owner himself, Block believed many of these problems could easily be fixed though basic [[fiscal responsibility]] and "[[common sense]]" leadership.&lt;ref name="Mikolay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ivn.us/2013/05/23/ken-block-hopes-to-represent-centrists-in-rhode-island/ |title=Dennis Mikolay: Ken Block Hopes to Represent Centrists in Rhode Island |author=[[Dennis Mikolay|Mikolay, Dennis]] |date=May 23, 2013 |website=IVN.us |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Block |first=Ken |interviewer=Patrick Little |title=Coffee with the Candidates: Ken Block |url=http://www.foxprovidence.com/rhode-show/coffee-with-the-candidates-ken-block-for-governor |publisher=[[WNAC-TV]] |location=Providence, Rhode Island |date=October 1, 2013 |work=The Rhode Show |accessdate=October 1, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disillusioned with both the Democratic and Republican parties, who he felt were more concerned battling over [[social issues]], Block believed that starting a [[centrist]]-based third-party would be the best option.&lt;ref name="Bickford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moderate Party withers in R.I., like other parties |author=Smith, Michelle R. |url=http://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/state/2758842-129/moderate-party-withers-in-ri-like-other-parties.html |newspaper=[[The Westerly Sun]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political affiliation is unknown before 2007, however, Block has stated his admiration for former RI Governor [[Bruce Sundlun]].&lt;ref name="WPRI-Newsmakers"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Block |first=Ken |interviewer=Tim White and Ted Nesi |title=Newsmakers 11/15: Ken Block, Republican candidate for governor |url=http://www.wpri.com/target-12/tim-white/newsmakers-1115-ken-block-republican-candidate-for-governor |publisher=[[WPRI-TV]] |location=[[Providence, Rhode Island]] |date=November 15, 2013 |work=Newsmakers |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118174445/http://www.wpri.com/target-12/tim-white/newsmakers-1115-ken-block-republican-candidate-for-governor |archivedate=November 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Brown University]] political poll reported that 74% of Rhode Islanders were dissatisfied with the state's political leadership and "would be supportive of a new moderate political party". A poll run by Block produced similar numbers. He reasoned that if his party could attract enough moderate voters, they would be able to put pressure on then Republican Governor [[Donald L. Carcieri]] and the Democrat-controlled [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] to address vital issues being neglected by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moderate Party touted as an antidote for RI’s woes |author=Donnis, Ian |url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/59593-moderate-party-touted-as-an-antidote-for-ris-woes/ |newspaper=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] |date=April 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101042543/http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/59593-moderate-party-touted-as-an-antidote-for-ris-woes/ |archivedate=November 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moderate Party of Rhode Island]] was founded by Block a year later. An official website was launched in early-2008 and several candidates were endorsed in the general election - Jean Ann Guiliano (D), John Pagliarini (R), Matt McHugh (I), and Christopher Little (I). On October 23, 2008, Block co-hosted [[Operation Clean Government]]'s ''[[State of the State (TV series)|State of the State]]'' with former RI attorney general [[Arlene Violet]] interviewing all four candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Guiliano |first=Jean Ann |last2=Pagliarini |first2=John |last3=McHugh |first3=Matt |last4=Little |first4=Christopher |interviewer=Block, Ken and [[Arlene Violet]] |title=Interview with Jean Ann Guiliano, John Pagliarini, Matt McHugh, and Christopher Little |url=http://moderate-ri.org/news/state_ofthestate.htm |publisher=[[Cox Communications]] |location=[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] |date=October 23, 2008 |work=[[State of the State (TV series)|State of the State]] |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105212452/http://moderate-ri.org/news/state_ofthestate.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining official recognition by the state was "a fight and a half" according to Block. In February 2009, Block and [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit against the state to gain official party status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moderate-ri.org/news/lawsuit.htm |title=The Rhode Island ACLU has today filed a federal lawsuit against Rhode Island elections officials on behalf of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island (MPRI) |author=Moderate Party of Rhode Island |date=February 3, 2009 |website=Moderate-RI.org |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311191000/http://www.moderate-ri.org/news/lawsuit.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge William Smith, striking down several ballot access laws as [[unconstitutional]], ruled in the Moderate Party's favor three months later. The Moderate Party were able to collect over 34,000 signatures, the 12th highest number of signatures in the country, to qualify as a political party and were placed on the 2010 ballot.&lt;ref name="Mikolay"/&gt; Afterwards, Block said that Rhode Island was the most difficult state to start a political party.&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt; The Moderate Party would find support from a number of prominent figures including former [[Hasbro]] [[CEO]] [[Alan G. Hassenfeld]], Arlene Violet, and former U.S. Attorney [[Robert Clark Corrente]], the latter briefly serving as party chairman.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcelo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Political Scene: New Republican Ken Block decides that third way is no way in R.I. politics |author=Marcelo, Philip |url=http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20131103-political-scene-new-republican-ken-block-decides-that-third-way-is-no-way-in-r.i.-politics.ece |newspaper=The Providence Journal |date=November 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 election ==
{{main|Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010}}
Block was the Moderate Party's candidate for Governor during the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]]. He had not intended to run for office, however, Block reluctantly stepped in failing to find a suitable candidate in time.&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt; Block had developed an interest in civics and government while at [[Dartmouth College]] in the 1980s though he had no political experience prior to the campaign. He was successful in gaining the necessary signatures 1,000 registered voters to get on the ballot. His door-to-door campaigning in [[South Kingstown]] was included in a feature story for ''Rhode Island Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Liberman, Ellen |date=October 2010  |title=Vacancies in top posts, anti-incumbency fever and a new third party have created an election field like none other in Rhode Island this year.

Block finished fourth in the statewide general election with 22,146 votes garnering 6.5% of the vote.&lt;ref name="DeQuattro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt; He followed Democrat [[Frank T. Caprio|Frank Caprio]] with 78,896 votes (23%), Republican [[John Robitaille]] with 114,911 votes (33.6%), and the winner Independent [[Lincoln Chafee]] with 123,571 votes (36.1%).&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt; Though an impressive performance for a first-time candidate&lt;ref name="Mikolay"/&gt; Block was blamed for his part in the four-way race that allowed Chafee to win the election. The Republican Party of Rhode Island was particularly critical of Block for splitting the race&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite news|title=Block: RI must be fixed up |author=Baron, Jim |url=http://www.pawtuckettimes.com/content/block-ri-must-be-fixed |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140228013508/http://www.pawtuckettimes.com/content/block-ri-must-be-fixed |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[Pawtucket Times]] |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |quote=In 2010, running under the Moderate Party banner, he finished fourth in a crowded field with about 6.5 percent of the vote.

== Post-election ==
Block continued his political activism as leader of the Moderate Party stressing the need for economic, educational, and governmental reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolninst.edu/news-events/news-listing/articletype/articleview/articleid/2164/rhode-island-ranked-least-tax-friendly-state-for-retirees |title=Rhode Island Ranked Least Tax-Friendly State for Retirees |author=Nagle, Kate |date=August 30, 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several guest appearances on [[WSBE-TV|Rhode Island PBS]]'s public affairs television program ''A Lively Experiment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A Lively Experiment |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHIdoO4yS8w |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |series= |serieslink= |first=Dyana (host) |last=Koelsch |network=[[PBS]] |station=[[WSBE-TV]] |location=[[Providence, Rhode Island]] |date=August 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALE2"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A Lively Experiment |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHl_xX9JGBI |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |series= |serieslink= |first=Dyana (host) |last=Koelsch |network=PBS |station=WSBE-TV |location=Providence, Rhode Island |date=April 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Operation Clean Government]]'s ''[[State of the State (TV series)|State of the State]]''. He began a movement to abolish the "master lever" and worked with the state to uncover fraud and waste in the state's welfare programs&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt; going so far as to offering his company's services to Governor Chafee at no charge.&lt;ref name="DeQuattro"/&gt; In January 2013, Block began teaching a technology and business class as an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[University of Rhode Island]].

An outspoken critic of the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]], he challenged a number of controversial decisions made by the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt; While running for Governor, Block criticized the state's $75 million loan to [[38 Studios]], in exchange for the [[video game company]] moving its headquarters from [[Maynard, Massachusetts]] to Providence, Rhode Island, suggesting that the money would be better spent investing in local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/11/rhode-island-politicians-speak-out-against-38-studios-deal/ |title=Rhode Island politicians speak out against 38 Studios deal |author=McElroy, Griffin |date=August 11, 2010 |website=[[Joystiq]].com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also strongly opposed to taxpayer-funded redevelopment of the [[Superman Building]]&lt;ref name="Chartier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanstatecurrent.com/analysis/ken-block-not-one-taxpayer-dime-to-the-superman-building/ |title=Ken Block: Not One Taxpayer Dime To The Superman Building |author=Chartier, Monique |date=May 2, 2013 |website=Oceanstatecurrent.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the [[Sakonnet River Bridge]] [[Toll bridge|toll]].&lt;ref name="Bickford"/&gt; Block called this most recent legislation by the assembly an "awful decision" and condemned the [[Rhode Island Democratic Party]] as "[proving] itself completely incapable of governing the state."&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt;

=== Combating fraud and government waste ===
Shortly after the 2010 election, Democratic State Representative Lisa Baldelli Hunt urged Governor Lincoln Chafee to contact Block about working with state agencies to uncover fraud in Rhode Island's [[Medicaid]] programs. In April 2011, Block volunteered his company's services free of charge to help the state identify waste and fraud in Health and Human Services spending.&lt;ref name="Mikolay"/&gt; He was not able to testify in person before the House and Senate Finance Committee that month, however, a written statement was submitted into the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2011/04/rhode-island-ken-block-wants-to-find-ri-hhs-fraud-waste/ |title=Rhode Island: Ken Block wants to find RI-HHS fraud &amp; Waste |author=Montoni, Marc |date=April 13, 2011 |website=Independentpoliticalreport.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Block talked with both the Department of Human Services and the Department of Labor and Training about using his company's services free of charge.&lt;ref name="RILPB"/&gt; After several months negotiating with the Chafee administration, Block announced on [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]]'s ''The John DePetro Show'' that his company was close to reaching an agreement to start working with state agencies to investigate waste and abuse in Rhode Island's welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Block |first=Ken |interviewer=[[John DePetro]] |title=Block: Agreement with Chafee administration almost official |url=http://wpro-am.fimc.net/Article.asp?id=2323066&amp;spid=37719 |publisher=WPRO |location=Providence, Rhode Island |date=October 31, 2011 |work=The John DePetro Show |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301162511/http://wpro-am.fimc.net/Article.asp?id=2323066&amp;spid=37719 |archivedate=March 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block's company, Simpatico Software Systems, began working with the [[List of law enforcement agencies in Rhode Island|Providence Police Department]]'s fraud unit in late 2012. Simpatico Systems developed a computer program so that fraud investigators can more easily access state records. The unit's two investigators, Jack Costa and Daniel Murphy, had previously been dependent on more than a dozen other agencies throughout the state and records were often unavailable in the current system. The Simpatico system specifically assisted the Providence Housing Authority in sharing data with the state government. Their efforts were featured on the November 6th edition of [[WPRI]]'s ''Eyewitness News''. It was claimed that the new computer software would help investigators detect millions of dollars in fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Estaphan, Nicole (Host) |date=November 6, 2012 |title=Fraud unit working to protect RI taxpayers |url=http://www.wpri.com/news/local/providence/providence-fraud-unit-working-to-protect-ri-taxpayers |medium=Television |location=Providence, Rhode Island |publisher=WPRI }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later involved in the Rhode Island Health and Human Services Waste and Fraud Report which submitted its preliminary findings in early 2013.&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSP"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=St. Pierre, Ron and Kate Nagle (hosts) |date=October 28, 2013 |title=Ken Block to Run for Rhode Island Governor as Republican |medium=[[Radio]] |url=http://www.920whjj.com/media/podcast-ron-st-pierres-podcasts-ronstpierre/ken-block-to-run-for-rhode-23894168/ |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |location=Providence, Rhode Island |publisher=[[WHJJ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ban the Master Lever initiative ===
Another reform pushed by Block was the elimination of [[straight-ticket voting|straight-ticket]] or "master lever" voting, which allows voters to cast a ballot for all candidates of a single political party with one vote, arguing that it confuses and [[voter disenfranchisement|disenfranchises voters]]. The master lever was first introduced to Rhode Island in 1939 when voting machines required voters to physically pull multiple levers to cast a vote. These machines were eventually replaced with a modern electronic system in the late 1990s, however, the laws remained in place.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"&gt;{{cite news |title=RI considers ban on 'master lever' |author=Kalunian, Kim |url=http://www.warwickonline.com/stories/Move-on-to-ban-master-lever-single-party-voting-option,78273 |newspaper=[[Warwick Beacon]] |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block was among those who testified before the Rhode Island Senate in a judiciary hearing on the elimination of the master lever in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanstatecurrent.com/liveblog/030612-ri-senate-judiciary-hearing/ |title=03/06/12 – RI Senate Judiciary Hearing |author=Katz, Justin |date=March 6, 2012 |website=Oceanstatecurrent.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later study conducted by the Moderate Party, which examined ballots from the 2010 election in [[Burrillville, Rhode Island]], indicated that voters did not understand how to use the master lever. Voters that chose to vote for all Democratic candidates would often cancel out their votes when continuing to cast individual votes further down in the ballot.&lt;ref name="GoLocalProv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golocalprov.com/politics/ri-taxpayers-urges-passage-of-bill-to-eliminate-master-lever/ |title=RI Taxpayers Urges Passage of Bill to Eliminate Master Lever |author= |date=March 13, 2013 |website=GoLocalProv.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefederalhillgazette.com/5948/rhode-island-is-a-one-party-state-democratic/ |title=Rhode Island is a One Party State – Democratic |author=White, John Hazen Jr. |date=March 20, 2013 |website= |publisher=Federal Hill Gazette |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block cited the Moderate Party's campaign in the November 2012 election as an example with, he said, over 9,000 Rhode Island voters using the Moderate Party master lever mechanism despite not having a Moderate candidate on the ballot.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Block |first=Ken |interviewer=John Carlevale (host) |title=Interview with Ken Block |url=http://vimeo.com/channels/365354/58209460 |publisher =Cox Communications |location=Providence |date=January 24, 2013 |work=State of the State |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politifact judged this claim as 'mostly true" saying that there were slightly ''under'' 9,000 such votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/22/kenneth-block/block-says-moderate-party-has-lots-votes/ |title=Block says 9,000 R.I. voters used master lever for Moderate Party -- with no party candidates on ballot |author=McKinney, Michael |date=February 22, 2013 |website=PolitiFact.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue caused by the master lever, critics argue, is "under voting" at the local level, where many offices are officially non-partisan, with candidates being skipped on the ballot because they do not belong to a political party.&lt;ref name="Perilli"/&gt; The master lever also created an unfair advantage for majority political parties at the expense of minority and third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Achorn, Edward |date=May 26, 2009 |title=Drive for fair elections gains traction in R.I. |newspaper=The Providence Journal |location= |publisher= |quote=Worst of all, the master lever tends to give a huge advantage to members of the majority party, particularly well down the ballot, in races that would otherwise not draw as many votes. Independent and third-party candidates face a huge disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;That is obviously one reason for the overwhelming dominance of one party in the General Assembly. Many seats go uncontested because potential opponents do not believe they have a fighting chance. They start a race, in effect, hundreds of votes behind because of the advantage the master lever provides the other guy. The system is inherently unfair, a racket. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Allan Fung]] and [[Scott Avedisian]], Republican mayors of [[Cranston]] and [[Warwick]] respectively, agreed with this view; a ballot recount by Fung in his 2006 election revealed serious irregularities in votes cast by the master lever.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"/&gt; In [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential elections]], many voters unknowingly elect candidates simply by voting for a presidential nominee. An estimated 46,000 voters used the master lever during the 2010 gubernatorial elections, a number which doubled during the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]], giving local Democrats a huge advantage over non-Democratic candidates.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"/&gt;

In January 2013, Block launched MasterLever.org to inform the public about the problems using the obsolete voting system in local and state elections. The website allowed supporters to send an automated letter to state officials including House Speaker [[Gordon D. Fox|Gordon Fox]], Senate President [[M. Teresa Paiva-Weed]], and Governor Lincoln Chafee. Within a week of its launch, 500 people had sent letters via the website in support the banning the master lever.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"/&gt; That number rose to 2,600 within four months.&lt;ref name="Mikolay"/&gt; Although the majority of the General Assembly remained silent on the issue, Block's initiative eventually gained support from key political figures including Democratic Secretary of State [[Ralph Mollis]]&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perilli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brownpoliticsmemo.com/2013/01/09/ocean-state-pulling-the-master-lever/ |title=Ocean State: Pulling the master lever |author=Perilli, John |date=January 9, 2013 |website=BrownPoliticsMemo.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Governor Chafee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ri.gov/press/view/18339 |title=Governor Lincoln D. Chafee Supports Elimination of 'Master Lever' |author=Office of the Governor |date=January 8, 2013 |website=RI.gov |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block polled legislators at the State House for their stance on the master lever which he then made available on the website.&lt;ref name="Kalunian-ML"/&gt; A ban on the master lever was also supported by RI-based government watchdog groups [[Common Cause]], [[Operation Clean Government]], and the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition.

Block made a second appearance on the April 5th edition of ''A Lively Experiment'' where he talked about his views on the master lever, [[payday loan]]s, and [[Tax credit#State tax credits|state tax credits]]. Block's report on waste and fraud in Rhode Island's state social service programs was also a topic of discussion on the show.&lt;ref name="ALE2"/&gt;

=== Involvement with RI Taxpayers ===

As president of the organization, Block was an active public speaker and made numerous appearances before state committee hearings. On March 13, 2013, he testified before RI House Judiciary Committee on behalf of both the Moderate Party and RI Taxpayers urging the members to pass legislation for eliminating "master lever" voting in the state.&lt;ref name="GoLocalProv"/&gt; At the RI Taxpayers' annual meeting on May 11, Block issued a formal challenge to the General Assembly to "stop stalling" on economic-related legislation for businesses and taxpayers before adjourning next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golocalprov.com/politics/block-ri-taxpayers-organization-challenge-general-assembly-on-economy/ |title=Block/RI Taxpayers Organization Challenge General Assembly on Economy |author= |date=May 10, 2013 |website=GoLocalProv.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another meeting, Block called for more citizen involvement in local government and warned that [[voter apathy]], especially among people under 40, would continue to result in poor legislation and a lack of accountability by political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Block calls for more citizen involvement |author=Baron, Jim |url=http://www.woonsocketcall.com/node/8225 |newspaper=[[The Call (Woonsocket)|Woonsocket Call]] |date=May 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke about the importance of economic reforms and the need to improve the state's business climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhodybeat.com/stories/Flawed-RI-business-brand-critiqued-by-RI-Taxpayers-group,82012 |title=‘Flawed RI business brand’ critiqued by RI Taxpayers group |author=Howell, John |date=May 14, 2013 |website=Rhodybeat.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025019/http://rhodybeat.com/stories/Flawed-RI-business-brand-critiqued-by-RI-Taxpayers-group%2C82012 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-month term, Block resigned his position with RI Taxpayers to run in the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 elections]].&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/FitzProv/status/336857339275640832?screen_name=FitzProv |title=RI Taxpayers says Ken Block formally resigned as the group's president late last week.

{{main|Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014}}
On May 21, 2013, Block announced he would once again run for office as Governor of Rhode Island in the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010|2014 election]].&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"/&gt; Weeks later, political operative Jeff Britt joined the Moderate Party as Block's [[campaign manager]]. Britt was previously a political ally of Democratic House Speaker Gordon Fox and former Republican governor [[Don Carcieri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ripr.org/post/jeff-britt-manage-ken-blocks-campaign-governor |title=Jeff Britt to Manage Ken Block's Campaign for Governor |author=Donnis, Ian |date=July 22, 2013 |website=RIPR.org |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was endorsed by blogger and third-party activist [[Dennis Mikolay]] praising him as a [[List of consumer organizations|government watchdog]].&lt;ref name="Mikolay"/&gt; One of his last public appearances as a Moderate candidate took place at [[Roger Williams University]] on September 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdq.rwu.edu/events/meet-and-greet-ken-block |title=University Events: Meet and Greet with Ken Block |author=[[Roger Williams University]] |date= |website=RWU.edu |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Switch to the Republican Party ==
On October 28, 2013, Block officially announced at a [[Barrington, Rhode Island|Barrington]] [[town hall meeting]] that he would be joining the Republican Party with the intention of running as its candidate for the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial election]].&lt;ref name="Bickford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turnto10.com/story/23804926/block-to-announce-race-for-governor-as-republican |title=Block enters race for governor as Republican |author=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 28, 2013 |website=[[WJAR|Turnto10.com]] |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was not totally unexpected as Block, who had been largely funding the Moderate Party with his own finances,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcelo"/&gt; including his 2010 campaign, held a poll on his chances running as a Moderate or Republican candidate over the summer.&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt; A [[Brown University Graduate School|Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions]] poll indicated only 9% of participants would vote for Block as a Moderate candidate.&lt;ref name="Bashkatova"/&gt; Three months earlier, Block suggested that he would be open to running as a Republican&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lincoln Chafee’s exit kick-starts R.I. governor’s race |author=Klepper, David |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/05/chafee-exit-kick-starts-governor-race/q8OCl3Coxln1lOy2pCmPSM/story.html |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]] interview with [[Buddy Cianci]]. He had also been courted by Republican  Joe Trillo to join the party partially to prevent another four-way race which allowed then independent candidate Lincoln Chafee to win the 2010 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanstatecurrent.com/analysis/ken-block-a-republican/ |title=Ken Block a Republican? |author=Chartier, Monique |date=July 25, 2013 |website=Oceanstatecurrent.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John DePetro]] called Block's decision a "smart political move" and speculated on the upcoming GOP primary between Block and Republican party favorite [[Cranston]] mayor [[Allan Fung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.depetro.com/2013/10/will-ken-block-fung.html |title=Will Ken Block Fung? |author=[[John DePetro|DePetro, John]] |date=October 28, 2013 |website=Depetro.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was also discussed on ''A Lively Experiment'' with guest panelists Dave Layman, [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]]/[[WPRI]] legal analyst Louis Pulner, [[Brown University]] [[political science]] professor Wendy Schiller, and Arlene Violet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A Lively Experiment |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOL2usaVCfU#t=11m52s |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |series= |serieslink= |first=Jim (host) |last=Hummel |network=PBS |station=WSBE-TV |location=Providence, Rhode Island |date=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block declared his intention to run as the party's nominee in a letter to 20,000 Republican voters and based his campaign on an ambitious plan to save the state $1 billion in government waste over a four-year period.&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeQuattro"/&gt; He further explained that this amount could easily be achieved by focusing on "off budget" spending such as public sector retiree healthcare, temporary disability, and unemployment insurance. Block offered the state's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) program as an example. Cutting the annual costs in half for the TDI program, which is twice as much to run as [[New Jersey]], would save $80 million alone.&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSP"/&gt; Block outlined his plan on his official website in addition to other forums as well.&lt;ref name="Bickford"/&gt; In November 2013, he was invited to write a column for ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' to make his case for saving the state $1 billion by eliminating government waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ken Block: I can save R.I. taxpayers $1 billion |author=Block, Ken |url=http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/commentary/20131113-ken-block-i-can-save-r.i.-taxpayers-1-billion.ece |newspaper=The Providence Journal |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531123901/http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/commentary/20131113-ken-block-i-can-save-r.i.-taxpayers-1-billion.ece |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Block was also interviewed by Tim White and Ted Nesi on the November 15th edition of WPRI's ''Eyewitness News'' and further explained his plan to save the state $1 billion.&lt;ref name="WPRI-Newsmakers"/&gt;

That same month, [[PolitiFact.com]] rated a claim by Block that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country as "false". According to the "2014 State Business Tax Climate Index", published by the [[Tax Foundation]], Rhode Island ranked 46 out of the 50 states. In the report, Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system was rated the worst in the country, however, that alone did not indicate it was the most expensive. Block’s policy director, Matthew Schweich, defended the statement pointing out that Rhode Island was ranked near the bottom in almost every category and argued that the cumulative effect supports their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/17/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-rhode-islands-unemployment-insuranc/ |title=Ken Block says Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system is the most expensive in the U.S. |author=Emery, C. Eugene Jr. |date=November 17, 2013 |website=PolitiFact.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block responded to the website in a [[letter to the editor]] of ''The Providence Journal'' acknowledging the error "but choosing the wrong words and intentionally misleading voters are different types of mistakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't overlook the real problem R.I. faces |author=Block, Ken |url=http://blockforgovernor.com/news/kbfg_news.php?id=6&amp;cat_id=&amp;p= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140228013502/http://blockforgovernor.com/news/kbfg_news.php?id=6&amp;cat_id=&amp;p= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 28, 2014 |newspaper=The Providence Journal |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, longtime Rhode Island GOP fundraiser Tony Bucci resigned his slot on Fung's campaign committee to join Ken Block's gubernatorial campaign as a senior adviser and finance chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ripr.org/post/gop-fundraiser-tony-bucci-joins-block-campaign-fung-returns-fire |title=GOP Fundraiser Tony Bucci Joins Block Campaign; Fung Returns Fire |author=Donnis, Ian |date=December 9, 2013 |website=RIPR.org |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants were executed under heresy laws during persecutions against [[Protestant]] religious reformers for their [[Christian denomination#Protestant Reformation .2816th century.29|religious denomination]] during the reigns of [[Henry VIII]] (1509–1547) and [[Mary I of England]] (1553–1558). Radical Christians also were executed, though in much smaller numbers, during the reigns of [[Edward VI]] (1547–1553), [[Elizabeth I]] (during whose reign, 1558–1603, [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation|some Roman Catholics also were executed]], charged with treason), and [[James I]] (1603–1625). The excesses of this period were recorded in [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Foxe's ''Book of Martyrs'']].

Protestants in England and Wales were executed under legislation that punished anyone judged guilty of heresy against [[Catholicism]]. Although the standard penalty for those convicted of treason in England at the time was execution by being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], this legislation adopted the punishment of burning the condemned. At least 300 people were recognised as burned over the five years of Mary I's reign by contemporary sources.

Briefly imprisoned in 1587 for his book ''the Aequity of an Humble Supplication'', in which he called for more preaching in the Welsh language. Returned to London from exile in Scotland in September 1592, and allied himself with the Separatist followers of Henry Barrow. Arrested on 22 March 1592/3. Indicted under the Act of Uniformity (1 Eliz. cap. 2). Executed by hanging at S. Thomas a Watering on 29 May 1593. The first signature on his death warrant was that of [[John Whitgift]], Elizabeth I's Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Historical context==
{{POV|section|date=June 2015}}
The [[English Reformation]] had put a stop to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] ecclesiastical governance in England, asserted [[Acts of Supremacy|royal supremacy]] over the English Church and [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] some church institutions, such as monasteries and [[chantry|chantries]].

An important year in the English Reformation was 1547, when Protestantism became a new force under the child-king [[Edward VI]], England's first Protestant ruler. Edward died at age 15 in 1553. [[Lady Jane Grey]] tried to succeed as Queen for nine days before Edward's Catholic half-sister Mary deposed her and assumed the crown, as was stipulated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in his [[Third Succession Act]] but revoked by Edward VI.&lt;ref name=PITE&gt;[[David Loades]]: ''Power in Tudor England''.  New York: St Martin's Press, 1997.&lt;!--ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p62}}

The relationship between the English church and Rome was restored under Mary in 1553. She went on to reign for five years (1553–1558) until her death. Protestants opposed Mary's actions. Many people were exiled, and hundreds of dissenters were burned at the stake, earning her the nickname "Bloody Mary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Haigh|title=The English Reformation Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55CBPm7CYlEC|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=29 May 1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people executed for their faith during the persecutions is thought to be at least 287.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth O. Morgan|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPALAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954475-2|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troubles for Protestants===
After the accession of Queen Mary I to the English throne in 1553, and her [[First Statute of Repeal|repeal]] of all religious legislation passed under Edward VI, Protestants faced a choice: exile, reconciliation/conversion, or punishment.&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"&gt;Richards, Judith M. ''Mary Tudor,'' Routledge 2009 {{ISBN|0415327210}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.186}} Mary had some 284 Protestants burned at the stake (including 56 women). Thirty others died in prison.&lt;ref name=Duffy&gt;[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]] ''Fires of Faith: Catholic England Under Mary Tudor,'' New Haven, Yale 2008 {{ISBN|0300152167}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.79}} While the so-called "Marian Persecutions" began with four clergymen,&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"/&gt;{{rp|p.196}} relics of Edwardian England's Protestantism, ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' offers an account of the executions, which branched well beyond the anticipated targets – high-level clergy. Tradesmen were also burned, as well as married men and women, sometimes in unison, "youths" and at least one couple was burned alive with their daughter.&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"/&gt;{{rp|p.196}}

===English Inquisition and the judicial process===
However bloody the end, the trials of Protestant heretics were judicial affairs, presided by Bishops (most notably [[Edmund Bonner#Under Mary I|Bishop Bonner]]) adhering to a strict legal protocol under the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy council]], with Parliament's blessing.&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"/&gt;{{rp|p.195}} Mary had difficulty forming an efficient Privy Council, which eventually numbered over 40 and never worked as a source of political advice, though it effectively pursued police work and enforcement of religious uniformity.&lt;ref name=PITE/&gt;{{rp|p62-65}} During the session that restored the realm to papal obedience parliament reinstated the heresy laws.&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"/&gt;{{rp|p.196}} From 20 January 1555, England could legally punish those judged guilty of heresy against the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.91}}

Thus it became a matter of establishing the guilt or innocence of an accused heretic in open court – a process which the lay authorities employed to reclaim "straying sheep" and to set a precedent for authentic Catholic teaching.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.102}} If found guilty, the accused were first excommunicated, then handed over to the secular authorities for execution.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.102}} The official records of the trials are limited to formal accusations, sentences, and so forth; the documents to which historians look for context and detail are those written by the accused or their supporters.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

==John Rogers's execution==
Before Mary's ascent to the throne, [[John Foxe]], one of the few clerics of his day who was against the burning of even obstinate heretics, had approached [[John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr)|John Rogers]] to intervene on behalf of [[Joan Bocher|Joan of Kent]], a female Anabaptist who was sentenced to burning in 1550.&lt;ref name="Richards 2009"/&gt;{{rp|p.193}} Rogers, a Protestant preacher and royal chaplain, refused to help, as he supported the burning of heretics. Rogers claimed that the method of execution was "sufficiently mild" for a crime as grave as heresy.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.87}} Later, after Mary I came to power and restored England to Catholicism, John Rogers spoke quite vehemently against the new order and was burnt as a heretic.&lt;ref name=Duffy/&gt;{{rp|p.97}}

==Observations==
The figure of 300 victims of the Marian Persecutions was given by Foxe&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and later by [[Thomas Brice (martyrologist)|Thomas Brice]] in his poem, "The Regester".&lt;ref name="Farr"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Throughout the course of the persecutions, Foxe lists 312 individuals who were burnt or hanged for their faith, or died or sickened in prison. Lists of these names are available [http://www.johnfoxe.org/freeman-marion.pdf here] &lt;ref group="n" name="johnfoxe" /&gt;  and [https://archive.org/stream/transactionscong2190cong#page/362/mode/2up here].&lt;ref group="n" name="Summers"/&gt; Three of these people are commemorated with a gothic memorial in Oxford, England but there are many other memorials across England.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Baker|title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVJLa5jgzQ4C|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=4 March 2008|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-7478-0495-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known locally as the "Marian Martyrs".

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group="n"|colwidth=35em|refs=
&lt;ref group="n" name="William Collins"&gt;Foxe describes him as being 'mad ... ravished of his wits ... beside his wits'.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="William Cowbridge"&gt;Foxe describes him as being 'mad and beside his right senses ... and destitute of sense and reason'.  The Critical Apparatus to Foxe's Book of Martyrs lists a number of unorthodox beliefs which he held.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="William Dighel"&gt;
The 1563 edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs records that William Dighel was burned at about the same time as Nicholas Sheterden.  However, this information is not repeated in subsequent editions of Foxe's work.  "Was his omission in subsequent editions due to an accident in the print shop or did Foxe come to doubt his information on Dighel?"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Thomas Ormond"&gt;
Buried in St. Michaels &amp; All Angels Marble placed in 1748&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="William Bamford"&gt;
May be the same as ... Butter, burnt (day unknown) June 1555, Location unknown (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Margaret Polley"&gt;
The same as Jone Polley, burnt (day unknown) July 1555, Location unknown (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="John Frankesh"&gt;
which calls him 'Sir Franke'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="John Warne"&gt;
husband of Elizabeth Warne, burnt in August 1555&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Elizabeth Warne"&gt;
widow of John Warne, burnt in May 1555&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Joan Lashford"&gt;which says that 'Joan Lashford ... was the daughter of one Robert Lashford ..., and of ... Elizabeth, who afterward was married to John Warne'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Joan Catmer"&gt;may be the same as Jone Painter (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Ipswich"&gt;which refers to 'two women in Ippeswiche towne'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Salisbury"&gt;which refers to 'two brethren more'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Gloucester"&gt;which refers to 'two at Glocester'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Beccles"&gt;which refers to 'two men and a syster dere'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Leicester"&gt;the same as 'A merchant's servant burned at Leicester' and the same as 'the yong man at Leicester'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Milles"&gt;may be the same as John Milles&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Stratford"&gt;which refers to "two women"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Agnes George"&gt;her husband then married Christian George, mentioned below&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Aleworth"&gt;may be the same as William Ailewarde (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Richard Smith"&gt;Richard Smith is said to have died in prison (day unknown) September, Lowlar's Tower/Lollard's Tower, Lambeth Palace, London in 'the Regester', but is described as 'non-existent' in&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Thomas Leyes"&gt;may be the same as Thomas Leyes of [[Thorpe-le-Soken|Thorpe]], Essex, sickened in Lollard's Tower, died (day unknown) September, Location unknown&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Wye"&gt;which refers to 'two at Wye'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Ashford"&gt;which refers to 'two at Asheforde'.  A number of Kentish people of Ashford Area are recorded as having been burnt 16 January 1556 at [[Ashford, Kent]] in [http://www.ashford.gov.uk/parks-and-open-spaces Ashford Borough Council – Parks and Open Spaces].  However, at this time the civil or legal year in England began on 25 March, so the date now known as 16 January 1557 would then have been recorded as 16 January 1556.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Loseby"&gt;may be the same as Jhon Lothesby, burnt at Smithfield, April 1557 (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Hyde"&gt;may be the same as Annis Hide, burnt at Smithfield, April 1557 (the Regester)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="King"&gt;which records an 'other' burnt with Morant and Grathwick&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Milwright"&gt;'The Regester' states that a person called 'Milwright' was burnt along with Harland, Oswald, Reed and Avington. However, this person is not mentioned in Foxe's Book of Martyrs, although he does appear in&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Hayne"&gt;'The Regester' states that a person called 'Hayne' was burnt along with Cuthbert Symion. However, this person is not mentioned in Foxe's Book of Martyrs.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Horn"&gt;May be an error for Edward Horne, burnt at [[Newent]], Gloucestershire in September 1558.  Foxe states that a woman was burnt with Horne.  However, the Critical Apparatus quotes a letter from Foxe's papers stating that 'Edward Horne's wife was condemned with him but she recanted and her life was spared'&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Driver"&gt;'The Regester' gives the name of the woman burnt with Alexander Gooch as Elizabeth Launson.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Groves"&gt;May be the same as Christian Grover of the archdeaconry of [[Lewes]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Buckinghamshire"&gt;'Foxe has a terse report in the Rerum of an old man of Buckingham- shire being executed in 1531 for eating pork during Lent (Rerum, p. 126). Foxe's source for this episode is unknown; Bale does not mention this old man in any of his works. Perhaps Laurence Humphrey, who was Foxe's friend, a native of Buckinghamshire, and who was with Foxe in Basel, was the source for this story. In any case, the Rerum account was translated word-for-word in the 1563 edition. The story was dropped from all subsequent editions, possibly because Foxe grew unsure of this individual's existence or at least of his ability to prove it.' [http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=more&amp;gototype=modern&amp;type=commentary&amp;book=3&amp;anchor=Buckingham#C214.32 Foxe's Book of Martyrs, Critical Apparatus]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Calais"&gt;Six months before the execution of Robert Harvey for treason in Spring 1541 [http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=more&amp;gototype=modern&amp;type=commentary&amp;book=8&amp;anchor=Robert Harvey#C241.56 Foxe's Book of Martyrs, Critical Apparatus]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Dodd"&gt;'within the space of a year, or thereabout, after' the previous man&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="johnfoxe"&gt;That list does not include John Wade, the three members of the Dangerfield family or the three who died in Chichester Castle – numbers 7 and 19 to 24 in the list of prisoners above. It appears to conflate Thomas Ravensdale and the shoemaker who was burnt with him – numbers 158 and 160 in the list of prisoners above. In other words, eight people appear above, but not in that list. On the other hand, numbers 212 and 213 in that list (two people burned in Suffolk on 18 June 1557) do not seem to appear elsewhere, and are not shown above. As a result, there are six fewer names in that list of 312 people than the totals above of those executed (284) and those who sickened or died in prison (34) – a grand total of 318.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Summers"&gt;That list does not include the following eight people mentioned above – (34) Margery Polley, (49) Roger Hues, (154) Rose Pencell, (175) William Carman, (212) George Egles – as he was hanged, drawn and quartered, as opposed to being burnt, (225) Robert Stevenson, (227) the woman at Rochester, (243) ... Lawton. On the other hand, that list duplicates (38) Richard Hook, (127) Thomas Milles/John Milles (128) Thomas Moor and (209) Mary Groves/Christian Grover. It counts (147) Perotine Massey's infant son separately. It includes John Warner and Thomas Athoth who are shown above as 'Also mentioned by Foxe'. It includes a woman said to have been burnt with (164) John Horne of Wotton-under-Edge. In other words, eight people appear in that list but not above. As a result, that list contains the same number of people as the list of martyrs above – 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Anabaptist"&gt;An Anabaptist&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Unitarian"&gt;A Unitarian&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Arian"&gt;An Arian&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Carman"&gt;William Carman burnt unknown month 1557 and Thomas Carman burnt 19 May 1558 were brothers&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="n" name="Polley"&gt;Foxe erred in stating that Polley came from Pepenbury; see PRO C/85/144/33r.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Lombard credit''' is the granting of credit to banks against pledged items, mostly in the form of securities or life insurance policies. The pledged items must be readily marketable. Lending is via central banks, in particular the securities 'eligible for collateral' which are registered on lists; as a general rule, the Lombard rate (interest rate) is more or less one per cent above discount rate. The pledging of securities means that the credit institutions have the opportunity of acquiring money in the short term from central banks.

== Etymology ==

The term comes from [[Lombards]], people who conquered Italy 6c. and settled in the northern region that became known as [[Lombardy]]. Rich cities in north Italy - Lombardy - were the birthplace of modern banking, and many of their inhabitants became notable in Middle Ages throughout Western Europe as bankers and money-lenders, also pawn-brokers; London's Lombard Street (1598) originally was occupied by "Lombard" bankers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Lombard Etymology online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

One prominent role of Lombard credit is in use by the [[Federal Reserve System]] of the [[United States of America]]. Traditionally, the [[Discount window|discount rate]],{{Clarify me|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- why pipe to Discount window? That article has direct links to [[Discount rate]], so it is confusing the reader. Also need to specify which discount rate, presumably the United States Federal reserve one? --&gt; or the rate charged by the Fed to member banks in need of funds (ostensibly to maintain the required [[reserve ratio]]), was ''lower'' than the target [[federal funds rate]], or the rate charged among banks for the same type of overnight credit.  This meant that banks could borrow from the [[Central Bank]] at a lower rate than they could from each other, which somewhat conflicts with the [[Central Bank]]'s role as a "[[lender of last resort]]". A discount rate lower than the rate typically charged by another bank opened the possibility of [[arbitrage]] and thus required extra scrutiny of potential borrowers.  The [[Federal Reserve Board]] of the [[United States]] switched to a so-called "Lombard facility," in which the discount rate is actually ''higher'' than the targeted federal funds rate, thus creating an ''economic'' incentive for banks to look elsewhere before asking to borrow from the Fed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/faqsrn.cfm?genid=23&amp;desc=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions&amp;url=faqsrn.cfm#ps1 The Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window &amp; Payments System Risk Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 economic brief from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] said many bank executives and market participants perceive a stigma attached to borrowing from the Discount window, so while the vast majority of federal funds loans occur below the discount rate (at or near the Target federal funds rate), there have been instances when banks have paid above-market rates (particularly, rates at or even above the discount rate) for [[federal funds]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2010/pdf/eb_10-05.pdf Economic Brief (EB10-05): Is There Stigma Associated with Discount Window Borrowing?, Renee Courtois and Huberto M.

'''Motion''', ''a software motion detector'', is a [[Free software|free]], [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] software application developed for [[Linux]].

It can monitor video signal from one or more cameras and is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed saving away video when it detects that motion is occurring (it can also do time lapse videos, et al.).

The program is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and is made for Linux (exploiting [[Video4Linux|video4linux]] interface). Motion is a command line-based tool whose output can be either [[jpeg]], [[Netpbm_format|netpbm]] files or [[mpeg]] video sequences. It is strictly command line driven and can run as a [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] with a rather small footprint&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome former homepage for the Motion project], retrieved on May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and low [[Central processing unit|CPU]] usage.&lt;ref name="askslash"&gt;[http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/12/15/166244 ask.slashdot.org - ''What Is the State of Linux Security DVR Software?''], discussion in December, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is operated mainly via config files, though the end video streams can be viewed from a web browser.
It can also call to user configurable "triggers" when certain events occur.

The party, which was initially intended to work as a political movement, was founded by [[Barthélemy Boganda]] in [[Bangui]], Ubangi-Shari (later known as the [[Central African Republic]]) on 28 September 1949, to connect "all the Blacks of the world"&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalck|first=Pierre|authorlink=|others=translated by Xavier-Samuel Kalck|year=2005|edition=3rd|title=Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]|isbn=0-8108-4913-5|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "to promote the political, economic and social evolution of black Africa, to break down the barriers of tribalism and racism, to replace the degrading notion of colonial subordination with the more human ones of fraternity and cooperation."&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Biographies des députés de la IV République: Barthélémy Boganda |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/boganda-barthelemy-04041910.asp |publisher=[[National Assembly of France]] |date= |accessdate=2008-03-02 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutes of the movement were written in April 1950, and the group's branches were set up in [[Ubangui]], [[N'Djamena|Fort Lamy]] and [[Brazzaville]]. The formation of MESAN did not sit well with the French territorial administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Titley|first=Brian|authorlink=|year=1997|title=Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|location=[[Montreal]]|isbn=0-7735-1602-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They set up divisions of the [[Rally of the French People|Rassemblement du Peuple Français]] (French People's Party, also known as RPF) in Ubangi-Shari to oppose the MESAN. The movement also encountered resistance in [[French Equatorial Africa]] from the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]] (African Democratic Rally, RDA), a political party initially geared towards [[Pan-Africanism]] that later became hostile towards efforts for African independence.&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p136"&gt;Kalck (2005), p136&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election, 1957|Territorial Assembly elections]] in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James S. (ed.)|authorlink=|year=1991|title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|location=[[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]|isbn=0-313-26257-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; cast and won every legislative seat,&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pxxxi&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p90&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited.&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p136"/&gt; After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN. The party won every seat in the [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1959|1959 elections]], with Dacko becoming the country's first president after the CAR formally received [[independence]] from France. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including former Prime Minister and [[Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa|Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale]] (MEDAC) leader [[Abel Goumba]], who he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pxxxii&lt;/ref&gt; MESAN won every seat again in the [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1964|1964 elections]], whilst Dacko was re-elected as President in an [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1964|unopposed election]].

On 31 December 1965, General [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], a cousin of both Boganda and Dacko, seized power in the CAR through a [[coup d'état]]. The next day, 1 January 1966, he proclaimed himself president, prime minister, and head of MESAN.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pp171–172&lt;/ref&gt; Bokassa stayed in power for the next 13 years. In 1972, he appointed [[Elisabeth Domitien]] as vice president of the party, and three years later as prime minister, a first for any woman of an African nation.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; At the MESAN congress on 4 December 1976, Bokassa instituted a new constitution and declared the [[republic]] a [[monarchy]], to be known as the [[Central African Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pp28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1979, Bokassa was overthrown and Dacko once again became president of the CAR. On 24 November 1979, he abolished MESAN and replaced it with the [[Central African Democratic Union|Union Démocratique Centrafricaine]], which he proclaimed as the new political party for the CAR.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was re-established after the return of multi-party politics in the early 1990s. In the [[Central African Republic general election, 1993|1993 general elections]] it won a single seat in the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2059_93.htm Elections held in 1993] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

The party nominated only one candidate for the [[Central African Republic general election, 2011|2011 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election CAR: Number of National Assembly candidates by party in the 2011 election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135656/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election |date=2015-04-02 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; failing to win a seat.

The '''National Intelligence Organization''' (NIO) is the [[intelligence agency]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

It was established by the ''National Intelligence Organization Act'', an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|Parliament]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/pg/legis/consol_act/nioa1984339/ ''National Intelligence Organization Act'' 1984], Pacific Law Database&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by the Act (art.7), the Organization's functions are to "collect, collate and process intelligence information", and provide the authorities with "timely, accurate and impartial assessments, forecasts and reports in respect of–
:(a) matters affecting the maintenance of good order in the country; and
:(b) the combating of seditious enterprises, espionage and sabotage and the provision of warning of potential military attack, armed incursions into the territory of Papua New Guinea or the use of military pressures against Papua New Guinea; and
:(c) the preservation of national sovereignty and the detection of any attempts by a foreign power or person to engage in political, military or economic activities contrary to Papua New Guinea’s interests; and
:(d) the prospects for world and regional, political, economic and social stability insofar as these could have implications for, or could affect, Papua New Guinea; and
:(e) future trends of the availability of resources and of prices as these could have implications for Papua New Guinea."

The NIO is headed by a Director-General of Intelligence, appointed by the Head of State (the [[Monarchy of Papua New Guinea|Queen]], whose duties are exercised by the [[Governor General of Papua New Guinea|Governor General]]), who appoints him or her [[Advice (constitutional)|acting on the advice of]] the [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]], after consultation with the [[Leader of the Opposition (Papua New Guinea)|Leader of the Opposition]]. (art.8(1)(a))

The Act specifies that, before authorising the NIO to "collect intelligence information outside the country by other than overt means", the Director-General must obtain written authorisation from the Prime Minister. (art.12)

The NIO may not search any person or premises, nor subject any person or premises to listening devices, nor access or intercept a person's post, without a warrant delivered by the National Security Council, which consists in the Prime Minister and various [[Cabinet of Papua New Guinea|Cabinet]] Ministers. (part VI)

The identity of the Organization's agents and employees (other than the Director-General) is to be kept secret, and divulging the identity of any such agent or employee is an offence. (art.47)

The Organization is currently operational, and the key findings of its reports are occasionally made public and commented on in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianetworknews.com/stories/200911/2734818.htm "PNG intelligence agency warns of ethnic tensions"], Australian Network News, 6 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]] appointed former police commissioner Gari Baki to lead the NIC, and to revive it as it had become "run down". O'Neill added that Papua New Guinea was now working with "some intelligence friends from [[Israel]]" so as to "beef up our intelligence gathering activities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/papua-new-guinea/3781/australian-envoy-to-png-summoned-to-explain-spy-sc/ "Australian envoy to PNG summoned to explain spy scam"], ''Post Courier'', 26 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Occupational inequality''' is the unequal treatment of people based on gender, sexuality, height, weight, accent, or race in the workplace. When researchers study trends in occupational inequality they usually focus on distribution or allocation pattern of groups across occupations, for example, the distribution of men compared to women in a certain occupation.&lt;ref name="Tam 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tam | first1 = T | year = 1997 | title = Sex Segregation and Occupational Gender Inequality in the United States: Devaluation or Specialized Training? | doi = 10.1086/231129 | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 102 | issue = 6| page = 1653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they focus on the link between occupation and income, for example, comparing the income of whites with blacks in the same occupation.&lt;ref name="Tam 1997" /&gt;

==Effects==
Occupational inequality greatly affects the [[socioeconomic status]] of an individual which is linked with their access to resources like finding a job, buying a house, etc.&lt;ref name="wox.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miech | first1 = R | year = 2003 | title = Occupational stratification over the life course: a comparison of occupational trajectories across race and gender during the 1980s and 1990s | url = http://wox.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/440 | journal = Work and occupations | volume = 30 | issue = 4| page = 441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual experiences occupational inequality, it may be more difficult for them to find a job, advance in their job, get a loan or buy a house. Occupational standing can lead to predictions of outcomes such as social standing and [[wealth]] which have long-lasting effects on the individual as well as their dependants.&lt;ref name="wox.sagepub.com"/&gt; Segregation by gender in the labor force is extremely high, hence the reason why there remain so many disparities and inequalities among men and women of equitable qualifications. The division of labor is a central feature for gender based inequality. It influences the structure both based on its economic aspects and construction of identities. However, studies show that the general overall picture of gender and labor has not been evaluated. The importance of these issues is pertinent for the future structure of our labor force.

==History==
The enactment of federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws were passed in the 1960s to enforce equal employment opportunities and to eradicate past discrimination against women and minority men in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carlson | first1 = S | year = 1992 | title = Trends in Race/Sex Occupational Inequality: Conceptual and Measurement Issues | url = | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 268–290 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0035i}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the US saw a tremendous decrease in occupational inequality; however, in the 1980s and 1990s, it began to rise again.

==Theories==
Occupational inequality has historically always been a problem, but could diminish over time, according to Richard A. Miech, who attributes this potential change to [[economic theory]]. He determines that race and sex [[discrimination]] is inefficient in a competitive world because it calls for only white men to be employed. White men, however, will demand a higher salary than women or people of other races who have the same education and abilities, thus discriminating employers lose more money.&lt;ref name="Miech, R 2003"/&gt; Non-discriminating employers can gain an edge in the competitive market by hiring women and minorities, thereby reducing occupational inequality.&lt;ref name="Miech, R 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miech | first1 = R | year = 2003 | title = Occupational stratification over the life course: a comparison of occupational trajectories across race and gender during the 1980s and 1990s | url = http://wox.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/440 | journal = Work and occupations | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 441–442 | doi=10.1177/0730888403256459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan, if taken on by employers, could perpetuate over time to other employers in which occupational inequality could decrease nationally.&lt;ref name="Miech, R 2003"/&gt; Other theories and research suggests occupational inequality is increasing and will continue to do so.

According to the process of "aging effects", occupational inequality will continue with advancing age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miech | first1 = R | year = 2003 | title = Occupational stratification over the life course: a comparison of occupational trajectories across race and gender during the 1980s and 1990s | url = http://wox.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/440 | journal = Work and occupations | volume = 30 | issue = 4| page = 442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the labor market consists of two sectors of jobs; one is the "primary" core of good jobs with good working conditions, advancement opportunities and job safety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The other is the "peripheral" sector of bad jobs with bad working conditions, low advancement opportunities and little job safety. [[Social mobility|Mobility]] between these two groups is very difficult.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Women and minorities are disproportionately placed into the peripheral sector early on in their careers with little chance of moving into the primary group to achieve equal occupational status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The theory of "homosocial reproduction" points to a trend where those in high position tend to pick the employees who have similar social backgrounds as their own for advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miech | first1 = R | year = 2003 | title = Occupational stratification over the life course: a comparison of occupational trajectories across race and gender during the 1980s and 1990s | url = http://wox.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/440 | journal = Work and occupations | volume = 30 | issue = 4| page = 443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the majority of managers are men, women are less chosen for career advancement and thus occupational inequality increases.

==Measurement==
The Duncan Socioeconomic Index (SEI) has been most commonly used to measure Occupational Status. It is based on two factors, occupational earnings and occupational education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miech | first1 = R | year = 2003 | title = Occupational stratification over the life course: a comparison of occupational trajectories across race and gender during the 1980s and 1990s | url = http://wox.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/440 | journal = Work and occupations | volume = 30 | issue = 4| page = 445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way occupational inequality is measured is by the [[index of dissimilarity]] (D). The equation is as follows:

D=½ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;|

where X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; equals the percent of race or sex group X in the labor force in occupation i and Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; equals the percent of race or sex group Y in occupation i. D is the measure of one half the sum of the [[absolute difference]] between the percentage distributions. The values range from 0 to 100 and measures the relative separation or integration of groups across an area.&lt;ref name="Chart disimilarity"&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s40/p75000/chart_dissimilarity.html Chart disimilarity], censusscope.org.&lt;/ref&gt; If the value equals 0% it means the area is distributed evenly.&lt;ref name="Chart disimilarity"/&gt; If the value is 100% it means the area is completely segregated.&lt;ref name="Chart disimilarity"/&gt; If the value is 60%, for example, it means 60% of workers would have to change occupations to make the distributions equal.&lt;ref name="Chart disimilarity"/&gt;

==Occupational segregation==
Occupational inequality is often linked with [[occupational segregation]] in a work place.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huffman | first1 = M. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = P. | year = 2004 | title = Racial Wage Inequality: Job Segregation and Devaluation across U.S. Labor Markets | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 108 | issue = 4| pages = 902–936| doi = 10.1086/378928 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.560.2662 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the segregation in a workplace, the greater the occupational inequality.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"/&gt; This is true specifically for jobs dominated by a certain minority or women.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"/&gt; They often have bad work environments and less income than white males who usually make up the managerial positions with better work environments and more pay.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

==Gender inequality==
Some common inequalities that take place in the workplace are the gender-based imbalances of individuals in [[power (philosophy)|power]] and command over the management of the organization. Women are not able to move up into higher paid positions as quickly as men. Some organizations have more inequality than others, and the extent to which it occurs can differ greatly. In the workplace the men usually hold the higher positions and the women often hold lower paid positions such as [[secretaries]].&lt;ref name=Devey&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tomaskovic-Devey|first=Donald|title=Gender &amp; Racial Inequality at Work|year=1993|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequality can also be understood when looking at transgender workers. Workers have different experiences when transitioning at the workplace. Power that was held previously can be lost when transitioning to a woman while workers transitioning to a man can experience a power gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CONNELL|first=CATHERINE|date=2010-01-01|title=DOING, UNDOING, OR REDOING GENDER? Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople|journal=Gender and Society|volume=24|issue=1|pages=31–55|jstor=20676845|doi=10.1177/0891243209356429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial inequality==
{{further|Racial wage gap in the United States}}
Ethnicity has a large influence on the quality of jobs as well as the amount of money an individual will make in the workforce. Today, African American men working full-time and year-round have 72 percent of the average earnings of comparable white men. Between African American and white women, the wage ratio is 85 percent. The black unemployment rate is typically at about double the rate among white people. White men have many substantial advantages in the workplace.&lt;ref name="prospect.org"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rodgers III |first= Williams |title = Understanding the Black-White Earnings Gap |url= http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=understanding_the_black_white_earnings_gap |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are offered a larger variety of job opportunities. The positions that earn the most money and have the most power are usually occupied by white men. Though this type of inequality has been lowered in the last 20 years, it is still common.&lt;ref name="prospect.org"/&gt;

==Causes==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
There are organizing processes that produce class, racial, and gender inequalities. Many inequalities occur because of [[implicit stereotype|implicit bias]]. Many people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued that the women gain their [[social position]] from the men around them, such as their fathers and their husbands{{clarify|date=July 2011}}. This is because womanhood has, throughout history, been attributed to child bearing and raising a family. Employment, and the benefits that came with it, always came after their family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author =Wolf, Wendy, and [[Neil Fligstein]]. |title= Sex and Authority in the Workplace: the Causes of Sexual Inequality. |year= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the workplace it is required that a worker shows up on time and works continuously for the entire workday, which usually consists of eight hours. Since women were responsible for raising children, they had much less time and flexibility to partake in full-time jobs, and thus women in the workforce were generally only seen in part-time positions.  This trend is part of what leads to modern-day inequality.

==Inequality in education==
{{main article|Educational inequality}}

As the occupational pipeline, the educational background and environment in which people develop profoundly shapes the direction in which their career path with follow. Historically, there has been a significant gender imbalance in fields of study. Women have always dominated the humanities,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} while men have held a sizeable difference when it comes to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) fields. Some of the primary factors leading to gender imbalances in collegiate fields of study include differences in pre-college preparation, personal preference for a field of study, and career prospects.

==Getting a job: skills, networks, and discrimination==

===Role of socioeconomic status and human capital in building workforce skills sets===
The American Workforce has become increasingly specialized in the last century developing from a mix of agricultural and industrial jobs to greater specialization among American workers. The growth of outsourcing of American jobs to countries such as China and other nations of Southeast Asia has been linked to the decline of employment opportunities for Americans from low-income, urban communities who once were the employee base for the American industrial sector. Over the last 15 years, however, the number of outsourced has increased by 23%.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Workshop: Measuring skills and human capital in local economies (Paris, France). 12 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This development has had a significant effect on the employment prospects of certain sectors of the American population, most notably on those of low socio-economic status.

Skill-Based technical Change, as this shift in production and employment trends is called, favors the skilled worker over the unskilled worker and has been occasioned by the development of increasingly complex technologies, which both require more training of employees and, in some instances, can replace unskilled workers. The combination of increased specialization and digitalization and the outsourcing of jobs for unskilled workers have led to an increased need among American employees to invest in greater technical and intellectual skills building. This, however, proves difficult for those of low socioeconomic status, which has been shown to limit education, and, by extension, income and occupation.

Low socioeconomic status also correlates with an individual's human capital, defined by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the "knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes that are relevant to economic activity".&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Bruce. National Center for Policy Analysis. 24:207 . Web. 20 November 2012. [http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba480 How Outsourcing Creates Jobs in America]&lt;/ref&gt; The term capital-skill complementarity describes the close relationship that exists between access to human capital and skills development. The existence of this complementarity indicates that the socioeconomic status, by means of its direct effect on access to human capital, determines employee skill sets and employability.

Those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds have less access to resources as a result of unequal distribution of the resources, which contribute to greater community skill building.&lt;ref&gt;[American Psychological Association Education and Socioeconomic Status Fact Sheet. http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-education.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Higher socioeconomic status, by contrast, has been linked to access to greater high-quality connections, greater proficiency in technical skills like ordinal sequencing and ability to problem-solve.  Access to high-quality connections, in turn, is linked to greater social capital. Technical skills are a result of access to greater human capital which, when defined as access to knowledge and skill-building opportunities, is lacking in low SES communities. Gaps in the socioeconomic status of Americans have led to the current division of the American workforce into a base of low SES, unskilled workers and skilled employees who generally come from higher SES, highly educated backgrounds and are, therefore, more likely to attain the higher education necessary to enter the market for skilled workers. Members of low-SES communities lack access to the educational opportunities, which would enable them to develop the skills they need to advance economically and increase their employability in a skills-biased economy.

Existing disparities between socio-economic groups continue the perpetuation of a workforce divided into unskilled and skilled workers and ensures that low SES Americans will continue to lack the human capital they need to develop employable skills. Evidence from research conducted by the OECD shows that ''the skills-education gap has widened in Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and most developed OECD countries.''&lt;ref&gt;"Valuable Skills, Human Capital and Technology Diffusion" George Messinis and Abdullahi D. Ahmed Centre for Strategic Economic Studies, Victoria University.&lt;/ref&gt; Because skills facilitate the diffusion of technical knowledge and innovation and human capital is key to the individuals' ability to assimilate new technology and to develop institutional knowledge as well as to increase access to high-quality connections low SES has been shown to contribute to inequalities in skill building and thus depresses the employability of low-income Americans.

===Skills and employment: job placement and employment trends===

An integral part of anyone's ability to obtain a job lies in his or her skills and ability to perform that job successfully and efficiently. And beyond simply attaining a job, the skills they are able to acquire over time along with the skills they possessed previously also affect their wages once they have a job. However, it is difficult to discuss the role of skill in the workplace without discussing its relationship to racial and gender discrimination. The sections on discrimination will talk about more specifically about how the ability to get hired and the gaps in wages are affected by race and gender, but in the context of skill, the two relate in the context of educational opportunities and resources. In nationwide studies, skill supply can often be incorrectly measured because people assume that any standard level of educational achievement (such as high school graduate) should provide a common standard for skill; however, minorities that only have access to local, less academically rigorous schools are likely to be less skilled than whites that are at the same standard educational level.&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = Curtis | year = 2002 | title = High School Graduate Earnings In New York City: The Effects Of Skill, Gender, Race And Ethnicity | url = | journal = Journal of Urban Affairs | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 219–238 | doi=10.1111/1467-9906.00123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, differences in wages between racial groups can be attributed to differences in skill that began during early education. According to human capital theory, there is a positive correlation between a worker's skill supply and their wage earnings.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;{{rp|221}} The more skilled the worker and the better they are at their job, the more they will get paid. There is also a correlation between skill and education, suggesting that the more educated a worker is, the more skilled they will be.&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;David R. Howell and Edward N. Wolff |title=Industrial and Labor Relations Review , Vol. 44, No. 3 (Apr. 1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;486–502&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there will be wage gaps between racial groups because of the differences in education and therefore, skill.

Also concerning the role of education in acquiring skills, people are now required to receive more education and earn higher degrees in order to get jobs than they have in the past. For example, many nurses are now required to have a bachelor's degree in nursing in order to work, which increases the enrollment in nursing courses at four-year colleges, as well as forcing many to return to school in order to fulfill the requirements.&lt;ref name="Pérez-Peña"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pérez-Peña |first= Richard |title= More Stringent Requirements Send Nurses Back to School |publisher = The New York Times |date= 24 June 2012 |accessdate= 20 November 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/education/changing-requirements-send-nurses-back-to-school.html?pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They have even opened programs for people who are already registered nurses, so that they can earn bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name="Pérez-Peña"/&gt; Not only are workers having to earn more degrees to find jobs than before, but with the increasing role of new technology in the workplace, workers must be more specialized in their skills as well. We are entering an age of hyper-specialization, meaning that companies are now more frequently subdividing labor into complex networks of individual, specialized tasks.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{Cite book |author = Malone, Thomas W., Robert J. Laubacher, and Tammy Johns. |title= The Big Idea: The Age of Hyperspecialization. |publisher = Harvard Business Review. |date= July 2011 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because employers are looking for more specialized skill sets, people are required to develop more highly specialized skills. This makes it more difficult to find jobs, especially for older workers who are not as familiar with modern technology and specializing in specific skills. In the past, people have been able to have a more general skill set that encompasses many aspects of a business, but now they must be highly specialized in one or two specific skills. Although it remains consistent that the more skillful a worker is, the higher their wages will be, the role of skills in the workplace has transformed over time to require more education and more specialized skill, making it even more difficult to bridge the racial and gender wage and employment gaps.

===Introduction to discrimination===

Discrimination is the unfair treatment of an individual based on different characteristics such as age, race, or sex. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically addresses protection against discrimination in regard to employment, outlawing employment discrimination of an individual "because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;SEC. 2000e2. [Section 703a].&lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulates the compliance to Title VII of employers with fifteen or more employees. The EEOC investigates and, if deemed necessary, files suit against employers who face charges of discrimination. A brief overview of the forms of discrimination the EEOC investigates shows the advances in equal opportunity legislation over the years.

''Age'' discrimination outlaws unfair treatment of individuals who are age forty or older. Discrimination practices may include excessive harassment of an individual or limiting an individual's work opportunities based on their age. [[Disability]] discrimination policies protect individuals covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act from unfair treatment.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Website. Discrimination by type. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/index.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt; Policies require the employer to provide "reasonable accommodation" (example: wheelchair accessibility) for disabled individuals, unless the employer provides sufficient reasons for why changes would cause "undue hardship".&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

''Equal pay and compensation policie''s state that employers must provide men and women in the same workplace equal pay (this includes all types of salary) for equal work. Based on content, the jobs must be "substantially" equal, but not necessarily identical.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

''Genetic information'' (including family medical history) must remain confidential information. Employers are prohibited from discriminating against an individual based on genetic information or requiring the disclosure of genetic information.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

''National origin'' policies prohibit discrimination against an individual because of their real or assumed ethnicity, accent, or geographic roots. These policies also protect against discrimination toward individuals associated with people from particular national origins or groups.

''Pregnancy'' policies state that women who are temporarily unable to perform their regular duties at work due to pregnancy or childbirth must receive the same benefits and treatment that a temporarily disabled employee would receive.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt; This may include such opportunities as unpaid leave, alternative work assignments, or disability leave.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

''Race/color discrimination'' includes the unfair treatment of an individual based on race, physical characteristics associated with certain races, or skin color. Policies protect spouses, and individuals affiliated with or belonging to race-based or color-associated organizations.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;
 
''Religious discrimination'' policies protect all individuals "who have sincerely held religious, ethical or moral beliefs".&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt; Unless the employer proves it an undue hardship, dress and grooming accommodations, as well as reasonable adjustments to allow for the individual to practice their religion may be required.
 
''Retaliation'' policies prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who have filed discrimination charges, complaints, or help with an investigation.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

''Sex discrimination'' policies protect individuals from facing unfair treatment because of their sex or their association with a sex-specific group or organization.

''Sexual harassment'' laws protect individuals from, " ''sexual harassment' or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature'' ".&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt; Offensive comments also fall under sexual harassment and may result in legal charges.

More recently, groups have claimed reverse discrimination: as employers strive to reach affirmative action minority quota goals, majority group members may receive unfair treatment as a result.&lt;ref&gt;FindLaw. Reverse discrimination. (2012). Retrieved from http://employment.findlaw.com/employment-discrimination/reverse-discrimination.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The EEOC regulates employer practices regardless of minority or majority status.

===Discrimination in the workplace===
{{main article|Employment discrimination}}

Despite the anti-discrimination legislative measures taken, discrimination in the workplace is still a prevalent issue. Racial discrimination particularly remains problematic.

===Networks: the mechanisms and advantages of professional connections===

Complex networks are a core part basic employment and business practices that exist in our society today. More and more, people are using personal connections to find opportunities that would normally be found through job searches. These connections can be through an educational institution, friends, family members, and even networking websites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Networking is a somewhat recent phenomenon of using connections to foster new relationships and opportunities. There are two kinds of network ties: strong ties, which are connections with people who you have frequent and close interactions with, and weak ties, which are connections with people whom you have infrequent and sparse interactions with. However, the basic goal is to make as many connections you can and in every direction possible. Whether that is laterally, below you, and above you, it is beneficial to know people of all calibers.
Although the law prohibits employers from choosing not to hire some one based on an uncontrollable factor like race or gender, it is still very prominent in our society today. The Fourteenth Amendment, stating that all citizens be treated equally, has promoted and created equality in the work force, but it isn't able to offer everyone the same opportunities. Many people are born into lifestyles that don't give them the same opportunities that more fortunate people have, and these disadvantages are the cause of the inequality we still see today. Although socioeconomic factors play a huge role in these opportunities, a person's race and gender are equally responsible for the connections and opportunities they are presented with.

In her article, "Don't put my name on it," Sandra Smith, a sociologist at the University of California Berkeley, discusses the prevalence of discriminatory practices in our society today. She focuses on the African American population, and the limitations that burden them as a result of networking disadvantages. "From a social capital theoretical perspective, deficiencies in access to mainstream ties and institutions explain persistent joblessness among the black urban poor".&lt;ref name= Smith&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Sandra | year = 2005 | title = 'Don't put my name on it': (Dis)Trust and Job-Finding Assistance among the Black Urban Poor | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 111 | issue = 1| pages = 1–57 | doi=10.1086/428814}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical disadvantages that African Americans still face today are the reason for the lack of progression in networking. Regardless of true mental or physical capabilities, African Americans are disadvantaged when it comes to attaining a job, simply because they aren't part of the largely white networks that dominate our society today. It is difficult to meet the right people and find the right opportunities when our society subconsciously puts up barriers to them. "Instead, the inefficaciousness of job referral networks appears to have more to do with functional deficiencies (see Coleman and Hoffer 1987)—the disinclination of potential job contacts to assist when given the opportunity to do so, not because they lack information or the ability to influence hires, but because they perceive pervasive untrustworthiness among their job-seeking ties and choose not to assist," (3).

Networking, the idea of using connections to foster new relationships and opportunities should be an advantage to every member of our society. Laws that demand equal opportunity for everyone should also generate similar equality in the work force. However, historical discriminatory attitudes that continue to plague the country today are making it difficult for people of minorities to attain jobs, especially because of the significance of networking and the extent to which is generates success.

== Gender pay gap ==
{{main article|Gender pay gap}}

The gender wage gap is the difference between average earnings for men and women. There are multiple theories for the reasons as to why this exists, but a large amount of the gender wage gap can be attributed to the fact that women work different jobs than men, as opposed to that women are paid differently within the same jobs or establishments.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = Trond | last2 = Morgan | first2 = Laurie A. | year = 1995 | title = Separate and Unequal: Occupation-Establishment Sex Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap | doi = 10.1086/230727 | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 329–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hoff Sommers, Christina|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html|title=Wage Gap Myth Exposed - By Feminists &amp;#124; Christina Hoff Sommers |work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study completed in 2005 it was found that working fathers are paid a 8.6% higher starting wage than working mothers.&lt;ref name="gap.hks.harvard.edu"&gt;Correll, S and Bernard, S. (2005) Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty? Gender Action Portal,http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pay gap between mothers and non-mothers==
It has also been found that there is a pay gap between mothers and non-mothers. "Mothers were recommended a 7.9% lower starting salary than non-mothers" (Correll and Bernard 2005)&lt;ref name="gap.hks.harvard.edu"/&gt;

== Returning to work ==
When women return to work after maternity leave they can feel uncertain about where they stand. "According to figures analysed by the House of Commons library, 14 per cent of the 340,000 women who take maternity leave each year find their jobs under threat, when they try to return to work.”. (Fairley 2013) &lt;ref&gt;Fairley, J. (2013) As a boss, maternity leave is a nightmare for employers, Telegraph.co.uk, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/10269461/As-a-boss-maternity-leave-is-a-nightmare-for-employers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career experiences: gender inequality in the workplace==

===Tokenism===
Tokenism is an extremely common practice in the workplace environment of today; it can essentially be defined as the act of going out of one's way to include members of minority groups. According to Rosabeth Kanter's 1977 publication Men and Women of the Corporation, the inability to achieve equality within the workplace can be largely attributed to the placement of "token status" on certain groups of individuals. Oftentimes tokens possess marginal status as members who are allowed entrance but do not get to experience full participation due to their status as an "outsider" who may be fully qualified for the position but does not possess the necessary characteristics, i.e. sex or race, that are usually expected of persons in said position.&lt;ref&gt;Laws, Judith Long. "The Psychology of Tokenism: An Analysis." Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term token can also be used to describe people who are hired due to their difference from other members of the company or other employees: oftentimes this is done as an attempt to prove that the group does not discriminate against said group of people. This variety of tokenism is thought to have originated in the Southern United States, where schools and businesses would admit token African Americans in order to meet the desegregation orders of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Marden, Charles &amp; Meyer, Gladys. "Minorities in American Society." New York, New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, the number of tokens accepted into a group or company is less than the number of people from the token group who are qualified for acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Beverly. "Women Judges: The End of Tokenism." Washington D.C.: National Center for State Courts, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases, tokens are people who do not possess the necessary qualifications to hold a position but are admitted because of their token status.&lt;ref&gt;Riemer, Jeffrey. "Hard Hats: The Work World of Construction Workers." Beverly Hills, California: Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual who possesses token status can have a very affected career experience. Kanter hypothesizes that oftentimes, the token's experience is less related to whatever attribute makes them a token and more so influenced by the structural restraints that are intrinsic to the positions they fill. To elaborate, the positions held by tokens are generally lacking in power and the opportunity for advancement. Additionally, tokens operating within workplaces with skewed ratios that result in them being extremely outnumbered are "often treated as representations of their category, as symbols rather than individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Kanter, Rosabeth. "Men and Women of the Corporation." New York, New York: Basic Books, 1977. pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Tokens are also extremely visible and subject to scrutiny due to their evident contrast from the majority. This can create large amounts of pressure to perform well; tokens will often either respond to this with overachievement or underachievement, both of which make further advancement difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Lynn. "Women Guarding Men." Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, token status often leads to "demotivation, lower levels of performance, and diminished aspirations for the future".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Susan. "Breaking and Entering: Policewomen on Patrol." Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1980. pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Many solutions to the problem of tokenism have been suggested; though a balanced work force will not eliminate all of the issues faced by tokens in the workplace, movement towards balance will help open the doors to some improvement. However, balancing the numbers and ratios is not necessarily the biggest issue at hand: many researchers suggest that power, privilege, and prestige are more important factors in the relationship between dominant and secondary groups in the workplace. Many believe that as the proportions of minority and majority workers balance out, tension within the workplace is actually more likely to increase rather than decrease. Though this may be true, the theory that increasing the proportions of the token groups would alleviate the issue should not be in any way discounted.&lt;ref&gt;Rustad, Michael. "Women in Khaki: The American Enlisted Woman." NewYork, New York: Praeger, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This solution could possibly "reduce the isolation and effects of tokenism, improve token's position in the power structure of the department, and also increase their opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Susan. "Breaking and Entering: Policewomen on Patrol." Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution could be to increase the number of tokens in managerial positions and to apply new policies of hiring and promotion; this affirmative action could work to give tokens the confidence they need to become full participants in the workplace rather than just representations of their category or token attribute.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "double bind" for female workers===
People's career experiences are largely affected by how they are viewed by their coworkers, and the way employees' actions are perceived may vary based on gender due to the existence of a "double bind" for women. Social scientist Gregory Bateson described the general concept of a double bind as "a situation in which no matter what a person does, he 'can't win.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bateson | first1 = G. | last2 = Jackson | first2 = D. D. | last3 = Haley | first3 = J. | last4 = Weakland | first4 = J. | year = 1956 | title = Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia | url = | journal = Systems Research and Behavioral Science | volume = 1 | issue = 251–264| page = 251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If individuals are instructed or expected to act in contradictory ways, then they are caught in a double bind because no action they choose will be determined acceptable.

Most men do not have difficulty reconciling their gender with expectations as an employee, for "definitions of ideal workers as those who are completely dedicated to their work, without career interruptions or outside responsibilities, privilege male workers."&lt;ref name="Roth, L. M. 2005"&gt;Roth, L. M. (2005). Selling Women Short: Gender and Money on Wall Street. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, being confident and assertive reflects positive traits for both men and leaders. Women, on the other hand, are compared to stereotypes about passive femininity that mean if they are assertive, they are viewed as acting in conflict with their internal nature and criticized.&lt;ref name="Roth, L. M. 2005"/&gt; More generally, "when women act in ways that are consistent with gender stereotypes, they are viewed as less competent leaders," but "when women act in ways that are inconsistent with such stereotypes, they're considered as unfeminine."&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Catalyst. (2007). The Double-Bind Dilemma for Women in Leadership: Damned if You Do, Damned if You Don't. IBM Corp. New York. 2007. Retrieved from http://www.catalyst.org&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a double bind because both perceptions paint women in a negative light.

How women choose to react to this double bind situation will affect their experience in the workplace. For example, while women who act stereotypically masculine "might be viewed as competent because of their leadership style, they also receive more negative evaluations of their interpersonal skills than women who adopt a 'feminine' style" and "not being liked can […] negatively impact women's work relationships, access to social networks, day-to-day interactions and, ultimately, their advancement opportunities."&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; As some industries, such as Wall St. firms, rely on peer evaluations to determine pay, promotion, and more generally assess a worker's contribution and worth, how women are perceived will affect their career experiences. Additionally, women who are continually passed over for advancement may choose to leave rather than stay and feel undervalued.&lt;ref name="Roth, L. M. 2005"/&gt;

Sociologists have specifically studied how the idea of the ideal worker clashes with the view of women as mothers or potential mothers. For example, Catherine Turco explored the leverage buyout (LBO) industry and determined that "by casting the ideal investor as one who puts commitment to work above all else, the LBO image implicitly specifies another social role—that of mother—as mutually incompatible with the occupational role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turco | first1 = C. J. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Foundations of Tokenism | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 894–913 | doi=10.1177/0003122410388491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, lab experiments and audit studies found that a "motherhood penalty" exists that can negatively affect wages and performance evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Correll | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Benard | first2 = S. | last3 = Paik | first3 = I. | year = 2005 | title = Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty? | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 112 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, negative views of mothers working may be expanded to non-mothers and even those who are unmarried because "all women [may be viewed] as potential mothers."&lt;ref name="Roth, L. M. 2005"/&gt; This may be due to cultural assumptions that women will leave work when they have children, thus causing other workers and managers to view them as less committed, even if they have expressed that this is not their plan.&lt;ref name="Roth, L. M. 2005"/&gt; The double bind here exists because even if women try to present themselves as serious workers, their role as mothers or their ability to become pregnant causes employers to treat them differently. As women are being judged by virtue of being female, institutional norms about what it means to be a good worker must be changed to remove the double bind experienced by women.

===Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender workplace inequality===
Since the Stonewall riots of 1969, the visibility and acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) employees in corporate America has steadily been on the rise; the first gay employee network appeared in 1978,&lt;ref name="Raeburn"&gt;Raeburn, Nicole (2004). ''Changing Corporate America from Inside Out : Lesbian and Gay Workplace Rights'', p. 27. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. {{ISBN|0816639981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991, the first Fortune 1000 company offered domestic-partner health benefits to its employees.&lt;ref name="Raeburn" /&gt;  Today, the majority of Fortune 500 companies offer both sexual orientation and gender identity protections, as well as domestic-partner health benefits.&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;Human Rights Campaign. [https://www.hrc.org/corporate-equality-index/#.UKvcL5KmA_Y "Corporate Equality Index"], 2012. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid increase in queer workplace equality can be attributed to a number of factors, most notably isomorphism.

Mimetic pressures, in which competing firms model the procedures of competitors,&lt;ref name="Dimaggio"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = Paul J. | last2 = Powell | first2 = Walter W. | year = 1983 | title = The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–160 | publisher =  | jstor =  2095101| doi = 10.2307/2095101 | format =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; are especially visible in the adoption of domestic-partner benefits.  For instance, after Wells Fargo and Bank of America adopted domestic-partner benefits in 1998, other banks, like Bankers Trust and Chase, soon followed voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Raeburn" /&gt;  These mimetic pressures are still visible today; in 2002, just two percent of Fortune 500 companies included gender identity in their non-discrimination policies, while in 2012, 57 percent of companies do so.&lt;ref name="CEI" /&gt;  
Much like these mimetic pressures, normative isomorphism, which stems from the professionalization of a practice,&lt;ref name="Dimaggio" /&gt; also helped diffuse equitable benefits. A 1991 Forbes story, "Gay in Corporate America", "broke the longstanding silence of the business press regarding gay and lesbian issues",&lt;ref name="Raeburn" /&gt; beginning an important trend; diversity consultants and human resource professionals concluded through the 1990s that "inclusion equals performance".&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Robert (1995)''A manager's guide to sexual orientation in the work place'', p. 117. Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|0415912776}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though much progress has been made in the area of same-sex benefits, GLBT employees continue to face challenges in the workplace that their non-queer coworkers do not.  According to a 2009 survey, 58 percent of GLBT employees say coworkers make jokes or derogatory comments about GLBT people "at least once in a while".&lt;ref name="Degrees"&gt;[https://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/degrees-of-equality], 2009. Retrieved on 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

But perhaps the single greatest contributor to the GLBT experience in the workplace is the decision of employees to come out or remain closeted at work. [[Brian McNaught]], a lauded leader of gay sensitivity training, explained the pressures that surround a decision, noting that "gay people who have to worry about what will happen to them if they come out […] generally produce at a lower level than gay employees who don't" as it takes much energy to "put on a mask";&lt;ref&gt;McNaught, Brian (1993)''Gay Issues in the Workplace'', p. 6. St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0312098081}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 54 percent of closeted employees report "lying about their personal lives in the past twelve months".&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt;  Non-GLBT employees are never required to make the conscious decision to share or hide the details of their personal lives, while GLBT employees make that very decision daily.  Even with the added stress of the "mask", a 2009 survey concluded 51 percent of GLBT employees report hiding their GLBT identity to those at work.

These unique experiences have compounded to create significant concrete inequalities for GLBT workers in today's workplaces.  For queer employees, there is an undeniable "pink ceiling"; not a single Fortune 1000 CEO is openly gay,&lt;ref&gt;Kwoh, Leslie. "A Silence Hangs Over Gay CEOs ", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', London, 25 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is documented that being gay negatively impacts an employee's opportunity for promotion – 28 percent of gay employees remain closeted "because they feel it may be an obstacle to career advancement or development opportunities".&lt;ref name="Degrees" /&gt;  Some of these fears are well founded; only 21 states and the District of Columbia currently have employment laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation&lt;ref name="CEI" /&gt; – in many states it is thus perfectly legal to fire an employee for being gay.

In addition to these challenges, transgender employees also face many more.  Though courts have recently concluded that transgenderism is a protected class under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most notably in Smith v. City of Salem in 2004, courts still allow gender-specific dress and grooming codes, and are legally able to reject exemptions for transgender employees  {{Harvcol|Kirkland|2006|pp=1–2}}; transgender employees thus often face the very difficult choice of complying with the dress code or dressing in the gender they present and potentially losing their jobs. For queer employees, workplace inequality thus remains a fact of life.

The ''Wall Street Journal'' came up with the term "the [[glass ceiling]]" to describe the barriers that women face in efforts to get promoted to top-tier positions within their corporations.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling 2005"&gt;"The Conundrum of the Glass Ceiling." The Economist. 21 July 2005. 19 November 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their qualifications (women constitute 58% of all university graduates&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Cindy. "Gender inequality in the workplace" The Harvard Independent. 1 December 2011. Web&lt;/ref&gt;), women make up less than 8% of the top corporate-level positions.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling 2005" /&gt; Although many firms employ diversity programs aimed at reaching greater number of women in the field, women are still not reaching the top levels within their companies at the same rates as men.&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra, Aditi, et al. "A Survey of Corporate Diversity Practices of the S&amp;P 100." Calvert Investments. Oct 2010. 19 November 2012. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Many major investment banks in particular try to hire women whenever possible (refer to tokenism section). Recruiters, however, still inherently use statistical generalization: the stereotypical woman is more likely to leave her position sooner than a man due to family-related reasons means that women inherently face greater challenges to promotion when the opportunity arise.&lt;ref&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The corporate culture====
Financial rewards often play a huge role in people's decisions to enter and stay in corporate firms,&lt;ref&gt;Blair-Loy, Mary. "The Devotion to Work Schema." Competing Devotions: Career and Family among Women Executives. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2005. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but their experiences there often explain why they left. The "up-or-out" system prevalent in many consulting firms can help to explain the male-dominated hierarchy;&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling 2005"/&gt; for women who require maternity leave their roles cannot be sustained in such an environment. While numerous firms support formal internal diversity initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra, Aditi, et al. "A Survey of Corporate Diversity Practices of the S&amp;P 100." Calvert Investments. Oct 2010. 19 November 2012. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; women are often also excluded from the informal networks that men partake in outside of the office, activities that revolve around a "jock-talk" atmosphere&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling 2005"/&gt; which bonds the men and helps create connections that are important when promotions become available. &lt;br&gt;
Moreover, many Wall Street corporations are deeply rooted in their beliefs concerning gender norms and are said to cultivate machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, employees of professional firms tended toward homophily preferences, where they were drawn to coworkers similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bacharach, Samuel B. "Diversity and Homophily at Work." Academy of Management Journal. 2005. 20 November 2012. Web. http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/smithers/docs/amj_homophily_paper.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, on Wall Street, just being a white, male junior colleague may to give you an advantage in promotional opportunities.&lt;ref name="Roth, Louise Marie 2006"&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these practices also isolated those in the minority who felt a lack of support from their peers and superiors.&lt;ref name="Roth, Louise Marie 2006"/&gt; In efforts to combat such prevailing culture, Wall Street firms have implemented equal opportunity guidelines, followed class action suits, placed diversity initiatives, and created grievance procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access: barriers and advantages====
A preference for coworkers of similar features to oneself meant that managers often specifically selected individuals to share accounts and deals with; many times, this meant disadvantaging women and minorities for account allocations, performance evaluations and relative compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Connections made through informal networks often advantaged those individuals with better access to clients, accounts, and deals. Often, women are driven to switch fields within the business sector, for example from corporate finance to equity research, from heavily male-dominated to those that are more gender neutral. Such trade may result in substantial pay cuts, as the median earning in the new sector can be much lower than the median income in the old sector.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Moreover, mentorship can play an important role in one's experiences at a workplace. Many firms have formal mentorship programs to guide promising new junior employees.&lt;ref&gt;"The Conundrum of the Glass Ceiling." The Economist. 21 July 2005. 19 November 2012. 
Web. http://www.economist.com/node/4197626.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the mentorship starts informally (the senior partner does so without company dictation to do so) some junior employees will inherently have the advantage over their peers. This can often end disastrously for workers who are outside of the informal networks that can start such ties. It should be noted, however, that, on Wall Street specifically, there were many male senior executives who were committed to encouraging success from women junior executives, with 65% of women who had mentors noting their mentors were male.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Louise Marie. Selling Women Short. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inequality in STEM fields===
Gender inequality in the workplace is experienced across many different industries and manifests itself in a multitude of different ways. For science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields specifically, varying workplace experiences among men and women can be attributed to differences in communication styles and social norms in the industry. Because STEM fields are so dominated by men, women working in these industries are often expected to act more masculine to be taken seriously. Furthermore, the lack of women steers the culture and social norms within many of these industries to become more "masculine" and therefore, many women don't have others to model themselves after and as a result feel that they have to change in order to "fit in".

====Communication====
In STEM industries, meetings and technical discussions are often very knowledge and experience based. In these settings, people with more dominant – and often perceived to be "masculine" – personas tend to drive and overpower the conversation because they sound more knowledgeable on a certain topic. This way of communication, often correlated with self-promotion, can put men and people with more masculine personas at an advantage because "self-promotion is a stereotypically masculine communication style involving aggressive displays of confidence that assert one's own superiority".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Joanna. (2012) Communication Styles in Engineering and Other Male-Dominated Fields. In B. Bogue &amp; E. Cady (Eds.). Applying Research to Practice (ARP) Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; And even though "women's abilities to successfully self-promote are often inhibited by fear of backlash or social sanctions for counterstereotypical behavior",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moss-Racusin | first1 = C. A. | last2 = Rudman | first2 = L. A. | year = 2010 | title = Disruptions in women's self-promotion: The backlash avoidance model | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 186–202 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; women in technology often feel the need to be more masculine to have their voice heard.

Another way this manifests itself is in varying communication styles. A person with a "competitive communication style" may frequently interrupt others as a way of showing dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Coats | first2 = E. J. | last3 = LeBeau | first3 = L. S. | year = 2005 | title = Nonverbal behavior and the vertical dimension of social relations: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6| pages = 898–924 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.898 | pmid=16351328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that interruptions are associated with masculinity as a meta-analysis of 43 studies found that men make more intrusive interruptions than women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Leaper | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Meta-analyses of gender effects on conversational interruption: Who, what, when, where, and how | doi = 10.1023/A:1018802521676 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 39 | issue = 3/4| pages = 225–252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, because women are often more likely than men to be the ones interrupted, it causes women to feel inferior during a discussion. This leads to women feeling less competent in their technical abilities, and decreased productivity as they begin to feel like their opinions don't matter as much, leading to a negative work environment.

====Social factors====
Another factor that creates the difference in experience for men and [[women in STEM fields]] is the social climate. The idea of the "old boy culture" is very much pertinent in male-dominated STEM fields where women find it difficult to fit in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wentling | first1 = Rose Mary | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Steven | year = 2009 | title = Workplace culture that hinders and assists the career development of women in information technology | url = | journal = Information Technology, Learning, and Performance Journal | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 25–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, female role models and mentors are rare for young women in these industries. Because mentors are very important in aiding in career development as well as building self-esteem in the workplace, the lack of female mentors inhibits the growth and success of women in STEM workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahuja | first1 = M. K. | year = 2002 | title = Women in the information technology profession: A literature review, synthesis and research agenda | url = | journal = European Journal of Information Systems | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 20–34 | doi=10.1057/palgrave/ejis/3000417}}&lt;/ref&gt; These social factors lead to an environment that may not be inclusive towards women because women feel like they need to be "one of the boys" in order to be included.

Because of these social factors and the communication differences between men and women, the experience for women in STEM fields varies greatly from that of women in more gender-balanced or female-dominated industries.

==Work and family==

===Inequality in household work and childcare===

Beginning in the 1960s, the U.S. began to experience a significant change in the family division of labor. During the past several decades, the contributions of men to household tasks have risen considerably, increasing from about 15% to over 30% of the total housework,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robinson|first=John &amp; Geoffrey Godbey|title=Time for Life: The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time|year=1999|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=0271019700}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the average daily contribution of working, married mothers has decreased by 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Oriel|author2=Ben Gurion|author3=Scott Coltrane|title=Men's Changing Contribution to Housework and Child Care|date=April 2008|url=http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/marriage-partnership-divorce/menchange.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501053233/http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/marriage-partnership-divorce/menchange.html|archivedate=2013-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these changes, there are still inequalities in the distribution of childcare and housework between men and women. Here we discuss several work-family ideologies, the ideology promoted by most American institutions, explanations for why this is the prevailing ideology, and implications of the resulting gendered division of labor.

Generally, the way in which labor is divided in the home is reflective of the work-family ideologies to which the husband and wife individually subscribe. Mary Blair-Loy identifies three of these ideologies: traditional, egalitarian, and transitional.&lt;ref name="Blair-Loy 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blair-Loy|first=Mary|title=Competing Devotions: Career and Family Among Women Executives|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional family arrangement is the breadwinner-homemaker model of the 1950s in which women are expected to fully devote themselves to household management and childcare, while their husband's earn the family income. The egalitarian arrangement entails that the husband and wife be equally active at home and in the workforce. The transitional arrangement allows for both husband and wife to be engaged in the workforce, with the wife taking on the bulk of the homemaking responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Blair-Loy 2003"/&gt; Sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls the additional time spent on housework "the second shift" for women. Families that adopt the transitional arrangement often utilize full-time, paid childcare because the work of both parents demands long hours, even if the wife works only part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie &amp; Anne Machung|title=The Second Shift|year=2003|publisher=The Penguin Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although individuals subscribe to varying work-family ideologies, American institutions reflect a gendered division of labor that encourages women to be active in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] and men in the workforce. There is a stigma associated with women working full-time, especially if they are married or have children, whereas men are expected to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Blair-Loy 2003"/&gt; These gender norms are particularly evident on Wall Street where men and women view either the breadwinner-homemaker model or full-time hired childcare as the answer if they choose to have children. Stay-at-home wives enable men to devote their time and energy to their careers. Even outside of Wall Street, many modern organizations assume that most families employ a traditional ideology although, statistically, this is no longer the norm.&lt;ref name="Roth 2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Louise Marie|title=Selling Women Short: Gender and Money on Wall Street|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of explanations have been posited for the existence of a gendered division of labor. Gary Becker theorizes that women are more likely to leave the labor force or work part-time because they have a lower earning potential than men. Thus, it makes sense economically for men to focus on their careers if the family's aim is to maximize income and provide adequate childcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary|title=A Treatise on the Family|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some support for Becker's assertion. After all, men's earnings increase and women's decrease when they have children. However, equally plausible is the argument that these trends result from the cultural norms that sway potentially high-earning women toward home rather than toward work.&lt;ref name="Roth 2005"/&gt; An additional explanation is that some women simply enjoy and believe that they are well-suited for family caregiving.&lt;ref name="Blair-Loy 2003"/&gt;

The differential distribution of household work has significant implications. For example, most married mothers become economically dependent on their husbands, but the law does not grant them financial equality in marriage. This means that, in the case of divorce, mothers experience a dramatic drop in income. Moreover, the social safety net does not protect divorced or single mothers from poverty, and mothers are not eligible for unemployment insurance if they work part-time or at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ann|first=Crittenden|title=The Price of Motherhood|year=2001|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, the unequal distribution of housework and childcare has meaningful implications and warrants some discussion.

The family factor, especially for married women, is one of the reasons that leads to more mobile inclination for women than men in job market.&lt;ref name="Tharenou 2002 97–117"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tharenou|first=P|title=Gender Differences in Explanation for Relocating or Changing Organizations for Advancement|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford, UK|pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype forces married women to undertake more family responsibilities than men, so women have no choice but to relocate workplaces for fulfilling the family needs. Compared with men who have more freedom to decide their workplaces, to move frequently in working system is obvious a disadvantage for women to improve their positions or to earn more income. On the other hand, men are more willing to relocate workplaces when their wives have better income, but not their wives' careers themselves, which means the power in family can also be transferred through women create more economic value than their husbands.&lt;ref name="Tharenou 2002 97–117"/&gt; This is the progress for women to develop their careers in recent years. Another source describes the variety of women's careers in their lifetime as "snake-like",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O' Neil|first=D. A.|author2=Hopkins, M. M. |author3=Bilimoria, D. |title=Women's Careers at the Start of the 21st Century|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2008|volume=80|issue=4|pages=727–743|doi=10.1007/s10551-007-9465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning they move from job to job through their whole career lives flexibly. Compared with challenge of flexibility, this research provides a new idea that some women actually gain benefits by developing their own business to fulfill family needs.

===Alternative family styles in relation to childcare and career experiences===
The structure of today's family has evolved over the past decades{{When|date=May 2014}} from the "traditional" married, heterosexual couple to an increasing number of alternative family lifestyles.  Non-traditional family units can include single-parent families, families with one biological parent and a step-parent, blended families, gay marriage families, and families where parents are absent and grandparents or other relatives take over parental roles. While all these non-traditional family lifestyles might present social challenges for the children as well as create undesirable career experiences, the two units that warrant the most consideration{{According to whom|date=May 2014}} are the single-mother and same-sex partner lifestyles.

There are a number of ways that women become single mothers: divorce, outside marriage births, and partner death. Only recently{{When|date=May 2014}} did the United States see a spike in outside marriage births as well as divorce rates. In 30 years, the percentage of outside births has gone from under 20% to around 41%, with divorce rates being around 50%.&lt;ref name="Bryce"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryce|first=Covert|title=The Rise and Downfall of The American Single Mother|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brycecovert/2012/07/16/the-rise-and-downfall-of-single-mothers/|publisher=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Divorce rates peaked in 1980, at about 40% for first marriages; by the early 2000s the percentage had dropped to around 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heller|first=Kalman|title=The Myth of the High Rate of Divorce|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2012/the-myth-of-the-high-rate-of-divorce/all/1/|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the number of divorces is decreasing, they along with outside marriage births account for the growing single-mother population.

Single mothers are faced with a number of challenges primarily resulting from low income. On average, single parents account for between 15 and 40% of income inequality, earning an estimated average of $32,597, less than half of what the average married couple earns.&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt; Women's incomes on average are lower than men's due to "occupational segregation".&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt; These statistics indicate that a vast number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2014}} of single-parent children grow up in poverty. Studies have shown children growing up in poverty are 66% less likely to rise out of poverty. Single mothers, although working long strenuous hours at these low-paying jobs, are still unable to cope with the financial burden of childcare. With the burden of single-motherhood becoming more and more of a prevalent issue, one would think that it would begin to be taken into serious consideration by the public. However, progress toward gender integration has slowed, childcare expenses are on the rise, housing isn't getting any cheaper and health care is still expensive.&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt;

Homosexuals have faced much harassment as well as segregation in the workforce community. Individuals of different sexual orientations have been criticized, segregated and physically harassed for decades even within the labor community, a place which being homosexual should not reflect upon how well one performs a job. In fact, "studies have shown that anywhere from 15 percent to 43 percent of gay people have experienced some form of discrimination and harassment in the workplace".&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krehely, Burns|first=Jeff, Corosby|title=Gay and Transgender People Face High Rates of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9872/gay-and-transgender-people-face-high-rates-of-workplace-discrimination-and-harassment/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discrimination and social stigmas can stymie a gay worker's upward mobility within the workforce, causing inequity in pay and advancement. These particular members of society come home to their partners and family similar to how a heterosexual male or female comes home to their families. However, these homosexual families are faced with ridicule by a majority of society. Children who are raised in a gay-marriage family are often faced with tougher social challenges because they are not in a more traditional family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanton|first=Glenn T.|title=Are Children with Same-Sex Parents at a Disadvantage?|url=http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/are-children-with-same-sex-parents-at-a-disadvantage/|publisher=Facts About Youth|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Americans now support same-sex marriage{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} and "60% of Fortune 500 companies [now] offer domestic partnership benefits", the federal government still denies these couples "1,138 federal benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Sally|title=Domestic Double Standard: What About Sally Ride's Partner?|url=http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/are-children-with-same-sex-parents-at-a-disadvantage/|publisher=Time|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Oropolitics''' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' meaning [[mountain]] and ''politikos'' meaning [[citizen]]. In modern usage it denotes the use and abuse of [[mountaineering]] for political purposes.

==Origin of term==
The term "oropolitics" was coined by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in the early 1980s to describe the surreptitious efforts, first by [[Pakistan]] from the 1950s, and then by [[India]] from the late 1970s, to demonstrate control and ownership of the [[Siachen Glacier]] by allowing or organising mountaineering [[expeditions]] to the high peaks such as [[Saltoro Kangri]] and [[Teram Kangri]] flanking the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%2074-49%20Sircar%20Oropolitics.pdf  Joydeep Sircar, "Oropolitics: A dissertation on the political overtones of mountaineering in the East-Central Karakoram, 1975-82", Alpine Journal (1984), p. 74-79. Reprinted from Himalaya Sameeksha.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siachen War]] of 1984 was the direct outcome of these 'oropolitical' activities. Another example is the [[China|Chinese]] publication ''Raising the Five Star Flag on Mount Tomur'', an account of the successful Chinese expedition of 1977 to the [[Tien Shan]] peak better known by its Russian name as [[Pik Pobedy]] (nowadays renamed yet again by Kyrgyzstan as [[Jengish Chokusu]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151896/peak-pobeda-mnt-tomur.html SummitPost - Pik Pobeda/Tomur Feng - Climbing, Hiking &amp; Mountaineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese volume seems to imply a first ascent and completely ignores multiple Russian ascents.

==Other examples==
The strangest oropolitical events must surely be the unpublicised ascents of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Nanda Kot]] by joint Indo-US expeditions in the 1960s to plant devices to monitor Chinese [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Kohli and K. Conboy, "Spies in the Himalayas", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The media disclosure in 1978 that an Indo-American covert expedition had planted a nuclear-fuelled monitoring device atop Nanda Kot in the 1960s, and that subsequently the device had disappeared, led to fears of radioactive contamination of the river [[Ganges]], and a political [[brouhaha]].

Recent examples of oropolitics, again from India, were the claimed ascent of '''Nyegyi Kangsang''' (7047 m) and the attempt on the nearby peak '''Kangto''' (7090 metres) by Indian teams in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Articles in ''The Himalayan Journal'', 1996, Mumbai.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are remote [[Arunachal Pradesh]] peaks difficult of access, located on or very close to the India-China border. These were as much sporting activities as visible demonstrations of de facto control of India over terrain claimed by China. It has been suggested that the actual summit of Nyegyi Kangsang was not even reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pakpotpourri.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/the-myth-of-siachien-an-extreme-case-of-oro-politics/   Jawad Raza Khan, "The Myth of Siachien :An extreme case of Oro-politics", Pakpotpourri.  On line.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simmering dispute between [[China]] and [[Bhutan]] over [[Kula Kangri]] (7554? metres), which is possibly located wholly in Chinese territory, but is claimed by Bhutan to lie on the Bhutan-China border and be the highest peak of Bhutan, has clear oropolitical overtones. A Japanese team attempting nearby [[Gangkhar Puensum]] (7570? metres) on the Bhutan-China border in 1999 from the Chinese side stopped short of the true peak due to the [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]] having prohibited ascent of the unclimbed main summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html Kangkar Punsum and Kula Kangri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311064618/http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">A '''peaceworker''' is an individual or member of an organization that undertakes to resolve violent conflict, prevent the rise of new violent conflicts, and rebuild societies damaged by war.

The term peaceworker is usually reserved for civilian, unarmed members of [[non-governmental organizations]]. Peacework is also carried out by many armed organizations such as the [[UN]], but armed personnel are seldom called peaceworkers.

== Peacework ==
Peaceworker duties include the following:
* Bringing conflicting parties together, opening channels of communication and helping to broker a ceasefire or peace agreement
* Monitoring voting booths, providing technical expertise and other forms of support in order to help ensure a free and fair electioneering environment
* Providing protective accompaniment of people at risk, monitoring borders and other actions for stabilizing preserve ceasefire agreements and preserving human life
* Reintegrating ex-combatants into society
* Promoting a respect for human rights within the local and national legal system, strengthening local institutions and civil society organizations that defend human rights

== Peaceworker Training ==
Peaceworker training and guidance is provided by organizations such as [[International Alert]]. University-provided [[Peace and conflict studies]] courses also provide valuable and relevant knowledge. As peace work can utilize a very wide variety of skills, it allows those with established, unrelated careers to take up peace work without having to abandon what they have already learned.

* [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]]
* International Alert

'''The Progressive Party of Manitoba''', Canada, was a political party that developed from the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), an [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movement that became politically active following [[World War I]]. A successor to the [[Manitoba Grain Growers' Association]], the UFM represented the interests of farmers frustrated with traditional political parties. 

Unlike the United Farmers, the Progressive Party of Manitoba never made any serious effort to cooperate with the labour politicians. The [[Winnipeg General Strike]] was unpopular among farmers, and the Progressive Party of Manitoba was not generally regarded as friendly to labour.

A number of "farmer candidates" ran in Manitoba's [[Manitoba general election, 1920|provincial election of 1920]].  They were not an organized group, and had no pretensions of forming government; nevertheless, twelve of these candidates were elected—eight as supporters of the UFM, and four as independents.  Had the UFM run a united campaign, it probably would have won the election.

The '''Independent-Farmers''' group was formed to represent the victorious candidates in the parliament which followed.  This was never intended to be a permanent political organization, and dissolved when parliament broke up in 1922.  The group's leader was [[William Robson (Canadian politician)|William Robson]], who did not seek re-election thereafter.

The United Farmers of Manitoba entered electoral politics in 1921, and ran an organized campaign in [[Manitoba general election, 1922|the 1922 election]].  However, expectations were still very low.  They had no leader and a shoestring campaign budget, and only ran candidates in two-thirds of the province's [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]]. Despite this, they won 28 out of 55 seats for a strong majority government.  

Faced with the task of selecting a leader who would become the province's new [[Premier of Manitoba|premier]], the UFM asked [[John Bracken]], president of the [[Manitoba Agricultural College]], to become party leader and premier-designate.  Once in government, Bracken's followers identified themselves as the '''Progressive Party of Manitoba''', maintaining an affiliation with the UFM.

Bracken was a political outsider, and gave the party the technocratic credentials that it desired.  The UFM supported the fading away of older political parties, to be replaced by a more "management-centred" approach to government.  In later years, the Progressive Party would advocate "non-partisan government" for the province, via a series of alliances with other parties.

In 1928, the UFM decided to withdraw from politics and concentrate on being a service and lobbying organization.  It became the '''Manitoba Federation of Agriculture'''.  Part of the reason for separating the Progressive Party from the UFM was the perception that the government had a narrow base representing only farmers, rather than all Manitobans.  

Prior to the [[Manitoba general election, 1932|1932 elections]], Bracken's Progressives formed an alliance with the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]].  This occurred on the urging of federal Liberal leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], who was concerned that the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Conservatives]] could form government in the province.  The "Liberal-Progressives" were able to win a [[majority government|majority]], and maintained their alliance after the election.  Eventually, they would become a single party.

The Liberal-Progressive government was reduced to a [[minority government|minority]] in the [[Manitoba general election, 1936|1936 elections]].  When early plans to bring the Conservatives into government failed, Bracken required support from the province's five [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit]] [[Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s to continue. 

In government, the Progressives were fiscally cautious. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], however, the government attempted to deal with unemployment by fostering a 'back to the land' movement, giving resettlement grants to move the unemployed from cities and town to the countryside.

In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government which included the Liberal-Progressives, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], Social Credit, and [[Manitoba Progressive Conservatives|Conservatives]]. In 1942, Bracken left provincial politics to take over the leadership of what became the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]].

[[Stuart S. Garson]] took over as leader of the party and premier, and was himself replaced by [[Douglas Lloyd Campbell]] in 1948.

The [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba|Manitoba CCF]] left the coalition in 1943. The Conservatives had renamed their party the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba]] due to the change in name of the federal party, and despite not having any link with the Progressives. The Conservatives left the coalition in 1950 due to dissatisfaction with Campbell's leadership. 

Although the leadership of the party remained dominated by Progressives, the government was commonly referred to as "Liberal" during the 1940s and 1950s. [[Dufferin Roblin]]'s Progressive Conservatives swept to victory of 1958. The Liberal-Progressives the party formally became known as the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] in 1961.

'''Proposed reforms of mass surveillance by the United States''' are a collection of diverse proposals offered in response to the [[Global surveillance disclosures of 2013]].

==Legislative proposals==

===Amash–Conyers Amendment===
{{main|Amash–Conyers Amendment}}
The Amash–Conyers Amendment was a proposal to end the "NSA's blanket collection of Americans' telephone records", sponsored by [[Justin Amash]] and [[John Conyers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amash.house.gov/speech/amash-nsa-amendment-fact-sheet |title=Amash NSA Amendment Fact Sheet &amp;#124; Congressman Justin Amash |publisher=Amash.house.gov |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 24, 2013, the House rejected the amendment by a vote of 217 to 205.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h412 |title=H.Amdt. 413 (Amash) to H.R. 2397: Amendment sought to end authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot ... |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americablog.com/2013/07/amash-conyers-anti-nsa-amendment-lost-by-12-votes-205-217.html |title=Amash-Conyers anti-NSA amendment lost by just 12 votes, 205-217 |publisher=Americablog.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA Inspector General Act===
{{main|NSA Inspector General Act of 2013}}
The NSA Inspector General Act is a proposed bill introduced by Mark Sanford on October 30, 2013. It would "require the Director of the National Security Agency and the Inspector General of the National Security Agency to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate".  Currently, the Inspector General is appointed by the Director of the NSA. Supporters of the bill argue that this arrangement "curbs their oversight effectiveness because the Director can remove them."

The USA Freedom Act ({{USBill|114|hr|2048}}, {{uspl|114|23}}) is a U.S. law enacted on June 2, 2015 that restored in modified form several provisions of the [[Patriot Act]], which had expired the day before. The act imposes new limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication [[metadata]] on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies, including the [[National Security Agency]]. It also restores authorization for [[roving wiretap]]s and tracking [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorists]].&lt;ref name="CNN passes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diamond|first1=Jeremy|title=NSA surveillance bill passes after weeks-long showdown|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/senate-usa-freedom-act-vote-patriot-act-nsa/|website=CNN|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/02/411534447/senateis-poised-to-vote-on-house-approved-usa-freedom-act|title=Senate Approves USA Freedom Act, Obama Signs It, After Amendments Fail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The title of the act originally was a ten-letter [[backronym]] (USA FREEDOM) that stood for Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act. The act was originally submitted on October 29, 2013 by [[Jim Sensenbrenner]], author of the [[Patriot Act]], and supported by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] as {{USBill|113|S.|1599}}.&lt;ref name=Shabad&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabad|first=Rebecca|title=Sen.

{{main|FISA Improvements Act}}
The [[FISA Improvements Act]] is a proposed act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.1631:|title=S.1631 -- FISA Improvements Act of 2013 (Placed on Calendar Senate - PCS)|publisher=Library of Congress (THOMAS)|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Chair of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]].  Prompted by the disclosure of [[National Security Agency|NSA]] surveillance by [[Edward Snowden]], it would establish the surveillance program as legal, but impose some limitations on availability of the data.  Opponents say the bill would codify warrantless access to many communications of American citizens for use by domestic law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer Ackerman in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance |title=Feinstein promotes bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless searches &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement from multiple Sentators on the intelligence committee explains that "this bill would codify the government's authority to collect the phone records of huge numbers of law-abiding Americans, and also to conduct warrantless searches for individual Americans' phone calls and emails."

===Fourth Amendment Restoration Act===

The Fourth Amendment Restoration Act is a proposed bill introduced by Senator [[Rand Paul]] on June 7, 2013.   It "provides that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution shall not be construed to allow any U.S. government agency to search the phone records of Americans without a warrant based on probable cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen.

===Fourth Amendment Protection Act===
{{main|Fourth Amendment Protection Act}}

The '''Fourth Amendment Protection Acts''', are a collection of state legislation aimed at bulk data collection.     Specific examples include the ''Kansas Fourth Amendment Preservation and Protection Act'' and the [[Arizona Fourth Amendment Protection Act]].  They are proposed [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]] laws. The proposals were made in 2013 and 2014 by legislators in the American states of Utah, Washington, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and California. If enacted as law, they would prohibit the state governments from co-operating with the [[National Security Agency]], whose [[Mass surveillance in the United States|mass surveillance]] efforts are seen as unconstitutional by the proposals' proponents. Some of the bills would require a warrant before information could be released, whereas others would
forbid state universities from doing NSA research or hosting NSA recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;

On March 12, 2013, Director Clappert testified under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the committee charged with oversight of intelligence agencies.   In response to the query "Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?" Clapper testified, "No, sir."&lt;ref name=Greenbergdenied/&gt; Senator Wyden pressed, "It does not?",&lt;ref name=Greenbergdenied/&gt; to which Clapper testified "Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly."&lt;ref name=Greenbergdenied&gt;Greenberg, Andy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The continued role of [[James Clapper]] as director of national intelligence is incompatible with the goal of restoring trust in our security programs and ensuring the highest level of transparency.  Director Clapper continues to hold his position despite lying to Congress under oath about the existence of bulk data collection programs in March 2013. Asking Director Clapper, and other federal intelligence officials who misrepresented programs to Congress and the courts, to report to you on needed reforms ... is not a credible solution."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United States House of Representatives]] member [[Justin Amash]] has openly accused Clapper of criminal perjury.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, Carlos.

Senator Ron Wyden publicly addressed the situation, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/30/why-believe-anything-director-national-i |title=Why Believe Anything Director of National Intelligence Clapper Says? - Hit &amp; Run |publisher=Reason.com |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Andrea |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/29/senators-there-is-a-truth-deficit-between-the-intelligence-community-and-the-public/ |title=Senators: There is a ‘truth deficit’ between the intelligence community and the public |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let me start by saying that the men and women of America's intelligence agencies are overwhelmingly dedicated professionals, and they deserve to have leadership that is trusted by the American people. Unfortunately, that trust has been seriously undermined by senior officials' reckless reliance on secret interpretations of the law and battered by years of misleading and deceptive statements that senior officials made to the American people. These statements did not protect sources and methods that were useful in fighting terror. Instead, they hid bad policy choices and violation of the liberties of the American people.

For example, the director of the NSA said publicly that the NSA doesn't hold data on U.S. citizens. That was obviously untrue.

Justice Department officials testified that Section 215 of the Patriot Act is analogous to grand jury subpoena authority, and that deceptive statement was made on multiple occasions.

Officials also suggested that the NSA doesn't have the authority to read Americans' e-mails without a warrant. But the FISA Court opinions declassified last August showed that wasn't true, either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies''' was a review group formed in light of the Global Surveillance disclosure of 2013.   In December 2013, the five-member group produced a public report.

===President Obama speech of January 17, 2014===
On January 17, 2014,  President Obama gave a public address on mass surveillance. He observed that "totalitarian states like East Germany offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when vast unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes."   He continued,"In fact, even the United States proved not to be immune to the abuse of surveillance. In the 1960s government spied on civil rights leaders and critics of the Vietnam War."

He proposed "restricting the use" of collected, but broadly endorsed the bulk data collection activities.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obamas-restrictions-on-nsa-surveillance-rely-on-narrow-definition-of-spying/2014/01/17/2478cc02-7fcb-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html |title=Obama’s restrictions on NSA surveillance rely on narrow definition of ‘spying’ |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focussing "on surveillance authorized by Congress and overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court"&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1" /&gt; Obama said analysts querying the collection of domestic telephone logs from virtually every American under section 215 of the Patriot Act need first permission from a judge of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court who must approve each phone number before said analysts can run a search on this number in the database. He also restricted the range of people who will potentially get caught in the section 215 telephony metadata database and ordered his advisers within 60 days to find a way how to move the database away from government control. The president asked Congress to convene a panel of public advocates to represent consumers before the FISA court and stated there'll be no spying on "dozens" of foreign heads of state or heads of government.&lt;ref name="WP20140117"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Bryan|title=Everything you need to know about Obama’s NSA reforms, in plain English|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-obamas-nsa-reforms-in-plain-english/|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides reforms aside from those affecting Section 215 include some "protections applied to U.S. citizens abroad will also now be applied to foreign nationals.

{{Property law}}

[[File:Back to Back House.jpg|250px|right]]

In [[England|English]] [[common law]], '''real property''',  '''real estate''', '''realty''', or '''immovable property''' is [[land]] which is the [[property]] of some person and all structures (also called [[Land improvement|improvements]] or [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) integrated with or affixed to the land, including crops, buildings, machinery, wells, dams, ponds, mines, canals, and roads, among other things. The term is historic, arising from the now-discontinued [[form of action]], which distinguished between real property disputes and [[personal property]] disputes. Personal property was, and continues to be, all property that is not real property.

In countries with personal ownership of real property, [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] protects the status of real property in real-estate markets, where [[estate agent]]s work in the market of buying and selling real estate. [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil law calls real property "heritable property", and in French-based law, it is called ''immobilier'' ("immovable property").

==Historical background==
The word "real" derives from Latin ''res'' ("thing"), which was used in Middle English to mean "relating to things, especially real property".&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford English Dictionary'', Tenth Edition,1999,p 1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, real property was property that could be protected by some form of [[real action]],{{clarify|date=December 2013}} in contrast to personal property, where a [[plaintiff]] would have to resort to another form of action. As a result of this formalist approach, some things the common law deems to be land would not be classified as such by most modern legal systems, for example an [[advowson]] (the right to nominate a priest) was real property. By contrast the rights of a [[leaseholder]] originate in personal actions and so the common law originally treated a leasehold as part of personal property.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The law now broadly distinguishes between real property (land and anything affixed to it) and [[personal property]] (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money). The conceptual difference was between immovable property, which would transfer title along with the land, and movable property, which a person would retain title to.

In modern legal systems derived from English common law, classification of property as real or personal may vary somewhat according to jurisdiction or, even within jurisdictions, according to purpose, as in defining whether and how the property may be taxed.

Bethell (1998) contains much historical information on the historical evolution of real property and property rights.

== Identification of real property ==
To be of any value a claim to any property must be accompanied by a verifiable and legal [[land description|property description]]. Such a description usually makes use of natural or manmade boundaries such as seacoasts, rivers, streams, the crests of ridges, [[Shore|lakeshores]], [[highway]]s, [[road]]s, and [[railroad track]]s, and/or purpose-built markers such as [[cairn]]s, [[surveying|surveyor]]'s posts, [[fence]]s, official government surveying marks (such as ones affixed by the [[National Geodetic Survey]]), and so forth. In many cases, a description refers to one or more lots on a [[plat]], a map of property boundaries kept in public records.

==Estates and ownership interests defined==
The law recognizes different sorts of interests, called [[estates in land|estates]], in real property. The type of estate is generally determined by the language of the [[deed]], [[lease]], [[bill of sale]], [[Will (law)|will]], [[land grant]], etc., through which the estate was acquired. Estates are distinguished by the varying [[property right]]s that vest in each, and that determine the duration and transferability of the various estates. A party enjoying an estate is called a "tenant."

Some important types of [[estates in land]] include:

*[[Fee simple]]:  An estate of indefinite duration, that can be freely transferred. The most common and perhaps most absolute type of estate, under which the tenant enjoys the greatest discretion over the disposal of the property.
*Conditional Fee simple: An estate lasting forever as long as one or more conditions stipulated by the deed's grantor does not occur.  If such a condition does occur, the property reverts to the grantor, or a remainder interest is passed on to a third party.
*[[Fee tail]]: An estate which, upon the death of the tenant, is transferred to his or her heirs.
*[[Life estate]]:  An estate lasting for the natural life of the grantee, called a "life tenant."  If a life estate can be sold, a sale does not change its duration, which is limited by the natural life of the original grantee.
**A life estate ''pur autre vie'' is held by one person for the natural [[Life estate#Duration of a life estate|life of another person]].  Such an estate may arise if the original life tenant sells her life estate to another, or if the life estate is originally granted ''pur autre vie''.
*[[Leasehold]]:  An estate of limited term, as set out in a contract, called a lease, between the party granted the leasehold, called the lessee, and another party, called the lessor, having a longer estate in the property.  For example, an apartment-dweller with a one-year lease has a leasehold estate in her apartment.  Lessees typically agree to pay a stated rent to the lessor. Though a leasehold relates to real property, the leasehold interest is historically classified as personal property.

A tenant enjoying an undivided estate in some property after the termination of some estate of limited term, is said to have a "future interest."  Two important types of future interests are:

*[[Reversion (law)|Reversion]]: A reversion arises when a tenant grants an estate of lesser maximum term than his own.  Ownership of the land returns to the original tenant when the grantee's estate expires.  The original tenant's future interest is a reversion.
*[[Remainder (law)|Remainder]]: A remainder arises when a tenant with a fee simple grants someone a life estate or conditional fee simple, and specifies a third party to whom the land goes when the life estate ends or the condition occurs. The third party is said to have a remainder.  The third party may have a legal right to limit the life tenant's use of the land.

[[Estate (law)|Estate]]s may be held jointly as [[joint tenants with rights of survivorship]] or as [[tenants in common]]. The difference in these two types of joint ownership of an estate in land is basically the inheritability of the estate and the shares of interest that each tenant owns.

In a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deed, or JTWROS, the death of one tenant means that the surviving tenant(s) become the sole owner(s) of the estate. Nothing passes to the heirs of the deceased tenant. In some jurisdictions, the specific words "with right of survivorship" must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights of survivorship. The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property.

The death of a co-owner of a tenants in common (TIC) deed will have a heritable portion of the estate in proportion to his ownership interest which is presumed to be equal among all tenants unless otherwise stated in the [[transfer deed]]. However, if TIC property is sold or subdivided,  in some States, Provinces, etc., a credit can be automatically made for unequal contributions to the purchase price (unlike a partition of a JTWROS deed).

Real property may be owned jointly with several tenants, through devices such as the [[condominium]], [[housing cooperative]], and [[building cooperative]].

Bundle of Rights:
Real property is unique because there are multiple "rights" associated with each piece of property.  For example, most U.S. jurisdictions recognized the following rights: right to sell, right to lease, right to acquire minerals/gas/oil/etc. within the land, right to use, right to possess, right to develop, etc.  These multiple rights are important because the owner of the real property can generally do what he/she chooses with each right.  For example, the owner could choose to keep all the rights but lease the right to dig for oil to an oil company.  Or the owner could choose to keep all the rights but lease the property to a tenant.  In other words, the owner can elect to keep and/or lease and/or sell the rights to his/her land.

Other Ownership types:
*[[Allodial title]]: Real property that is independent of any superior landlord. Allodium is "Land held absolutely in one’s own right, and not of any lord or superior; land not subject to feudal duties or burdens. An estate held by absolute ownership, without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2c8AAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=allodial&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=allodium&amp;f=false |title=Black's Law Dictionary - 2nd Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictional peculiarities==
In the law of almost every country, the [[State (polity)|state]] is the ultimate owner of all land under its jurisdiction, because it is the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], or supreme lawmaking authority. Physical and corporate persons do not have [[allodial title]]; they do not own land but only enjoy estates in the land, also known as "equitable interests."

===Australia and New Zealand===
In many countries the [[Torrens title]] system of real estate ownership is managed and guaranteed by the government and replaces cumbersome tracing of ownership. The Torrens title system operates on the principle of "title by registration" (i.e. the indefeasibility of a registered interest) rather than "registration of title." The system does away with the need for a chain of title (i.e. tracing title through a series of documents) and does away with the conveyancing costs of such searches. The State guarantees title and is usually supported by a compensation scheme for those who lose their title due to the State's operation.  It has been in practice in all Australian states and in New Zealand since between 1858 and 1875, has more recently been extended to [[strata title]], and has been adopted by many states, provinces and countries, and in modified form in 9 states of the USA.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[The Crown]] is held to be the ultimate owner of all real property in the realm. This fact is material when, for example, property has been disclaimed by its erstwhile owner, in which case the law of [[escheat]] applies. In some other jurisdictions (not including the United States), real property is held [[Allodial title|absolutely]].

====England and Wales====
[[English law]] has retained the common law distinction between real property and personal property, whereas the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] distinguishes between "movable" and "immovable" property. In English law, real property is not confined to the ownership of property and the buildings sited thereon{{spaced ndash}}often referred to as "land." Real property also includes many legal relationships between individuals or owners of land that are purely conceptual. One such relationship is the [[easement]], where the owner of one property has the right to pass over a neighboring property. Another is the various "incorporeal hereditaments," such as [[Profit (real property)|''profits-à-prendre'']], where an individual may have the right to take crops from land that is part of another's estate.

English law retains a number of forms of property which are largely unknown in other common law jurisdictions such as the [[advowson]], [[chancel repair liability]] and lordships of the [[manorialism|manor]]. These are all classified as real property, as they would have been protected by [[real action]]s in the early common law.

===United States===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Each [[U.S. State]] except [[Louisiana]] has its own laws governing real property and the estates therein, grounded in the [[common law]]. In [[Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} real property is generally defined as land and the things permanently attached to the land.  Things that are permanently attached to the land, which also can be referred to as ''improvements'', include homes, garages, and buildings. Manufactured homes can obtain an [[affidavit]] of affixture.

==Economic aspects of real property==
Land use, land valuation, and the determination of the incomes of landowners, are among the oldest questions in economic theory. Land is an essential input ([[factor of production]]) for agriculture, and agriculture is by far the most important economic activity in pre-industrial societies. With the advent of industrialization, important new uses for land emerge, as sites for factories, warehouses, offices, and urban agglomerations. Also, the value of real property taking the form of man-made structures and machinery increases relative to the value of land alone. The concept of real property eventually comes to encompass effectively all forms of [[capital (economics)|tangible fixed capital]]. with the rise of extractive industries, real property comes to encompass [[natural capital]]. With the rise of tourism and leisure, real property comes to include scenic and other amenity values.

Starting in the 1960s, as part of the emerging field of [[law and economics]], economists and legal scholars began to study the [[property right]]s enjoyed by tenants under the various estates, and the economic benefits and costs of the various estates. This resulted in a much improved understanding of the:
*[[Property right]]s enjoyed by tenants under the various estates. These include the right to:
**Decide how a piece of real property is used;
**Exclude others from enjoying the property;
**Transfer (alienate) some or all of these rights to others on mutually agreeable terms;
*Nature and consequences of [[transaction cost]]s when changing and transferring estates.
For an introduction to the economic analysis of property law, see Shavell (2004), and Cooter and Ulen (2003). For a collection of related scholarly articles, see Epstein (2007). Ellickson (1993) broadens the economic analysis of real property with a variety of facts drawn from history and [[ethnography]].

The '''Requetés''' ({{IPA-es|rekeˈtes|lang}}, from the [[French language|French]] ''requêté'', “hunting call”)&lt;ref name = "EUS"&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Sopena.  Diccionario Ilustrado de la Lengua Española.''  Vol. 7 (Per-Sak).  (Barcelona: Editorial Ramón Sopena, S.A., 1965), 7353. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the [[Carlism|Carlist]] [[militia]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Wearing red [[beret]]s, they mostly came from [[Navarre]] and were highly religious with many regarding the war as a [[Crusades|Crusade]]. They were often accompanied by priests as field chaplains, who were known for risking their lives to perform the [[Last rites#In the Latin Catholic church|last rites]] on the battlefield and who also urged the men on. A Spanish encyclopedia of 1965 defines the Requetés:{{quote|[A] group of traditionalists whose object is to encourage amongst themselves the goals of the political party, valorous sentiments, physical prowess, initiative, spirit of resistance, and the acceptance of responsibility, and who, during the [[Carlist Wars|civil wars of Spain]], fought in corps (''tercios'') in defense of the religious and monarchical traditions.|''Enciclopedia Universal Sopena''&lt;ref name="EUS"/&gt;}}

The earliest use of the term was applied to the Third Battalion of Navarre (''Tercer Batallón de Navarra'') in 1835 during the [[First Carlist War]], and it was later applied generally to all Carlist combatants. 
[[File:TTV.87.11.jpg|thumbnail|left|Requeté, 1912]]
The Carlist ''Requetés'' had been receiving military training during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. During the early and middle periods of the Spanish Civil War the Requeté units were well known as highly motivated and (comparatively) well trained assault troops for the nationalists. Carlist units were instrumental in several nationalist victories, notably during the tough fighting in and around the two northern provinces of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], during the Northern Campaign in 1937. The negotiations with the conspiring generals were tough.

By July 1936, however, Carlism unanimously supported the far-right [[Spanish nationalism|nationalist]] side on the Spanish Civil War.  From the start there were serious troubles between the Carlists, especially their then political head [[Manuel Fal Conde]], and the military government. On 8 December 1936, Manuel Fal had to leave temporarily for [[Portugal]] after a major clash with Franco.

On 19 April 1937, the Requetés' political branch was "unified" with the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista]]. Both the Falange and the regent, [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma]], protested this move, and, after a meeting with [[Francisco Franco]], Prince Xavier was expelled from Spain. Due to the necessities of the war, actions against the Unification did not go much further, but it meant the loss of all material wealth of the party: buildings, newspapers, etc. Many Carlists refused to join the new party and violence between the factions broke out at the [[Basilica of Begoña]] on August 16, 1942, when Falangists attacked a Carlist crowd with grenades, causing many injuries and  several deaths.

'''Salt''', '''table salt''' or '''common salt''' is a [[mineral]] composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), a [[chemical compound]] belonging to the larger class of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]; salt in its natural form as a [[crystallinity|crystalline]] mineral is known as rock salt or [[halite]]. Salt is present in vast quantities in [[seawater]], where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of solids per litre, a [[salinity]] of 3.5%.

[[Sodium in biology|Salt is essential for life in general]], and saltiness is one of the [[Basic tastes|basic human tastes]]. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food [[seasoning]]s, and [[Salting (food)|salting]] is an important method of [[food preservation]].

Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 B.C., when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled [[spring (hydrology)|spring water]] to extract salts; a [[Salt in Chinese History#Ancient China and the early empire|salt-works in China]] dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], the Romans, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Hittites]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and the [[Ancient India|Indians]]. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.

Salt is processed from [[salt mining|salt mines]], and by the [[evaporation]] of seawater ([[sea salt]]) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are [[caustic soda]] and [[chlorine]]; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million [[tonne]]s of salt, about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, [[de-icing]] highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an [[anti-caking agent]] and may be [[iodised salt|iodised]] to prevent [[iodine deficiency]]. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.

[[File:Salzproduktion-Halle.jpg|thumb|Salt production in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] (1670)]]

All through history, the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. What is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is [[Solnitsata]], in [[Bulgaria]], which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the [[Balkans]] with salt since 5400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;LA Times&lt;br /&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/01/science/la-sci-sn-oldest-european-town-20121101 Bulgarians find oldest European town, a salt production center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307053627/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/01/science/la-sci-sn-oldest-european-town-20121101 |date=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the name Solnitsata means "salt works".

Evidence indicates that [[Neolithic]] people of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Precucuteni Culture]] were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of [[briquetage]] to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC.{{sfn|Weller|Dumitroaia|2005}} The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began.{{sfn|Weller|Brigand|Nuninger|2008|pp=225-230}} The harvest of salt from the surface of [[Xiechi Lake]] near [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]] in [[Shanxi]], China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks.{{sfn|Kurlansky|2002|pp=18–19}}

There is more salt in animal tissues, such as meat, blood, and milk, than in plant tissues.&lt;ref name=HMSO/&gt; [[Nomad]]s who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |title=Salt (NaCl) |last=Wood |first=Frank Osborne |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502184136/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities.

{{main article|Sodium chloride}}
Salt is mostly [[sodium chloride]], the [[ionic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NaCl, representing equal proportions of [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. [[Sea salt]] and freshly mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of [[trace element]]s (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health {{cn|date=October 2018}}). Mined salt is often refined in the production of table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also [[iodised salt|iodized]]. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The [[molar mass]] of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801&amp;nbsp;°C (1,474&amp;nbsp;°F) and its boiling point 1,465&amp;nbsp;°C (2,669&amp;nbsp;°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |title=Salt (NaCl) |last1=Wood |first1=Frank Osborne |last2=Ralston |first2=Robert H. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=16 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502184136/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the [[water of hydration|dihydrate]] NaCl·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10–22 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion Paper on the setting of maximum and minimum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/documents/akj_en.pdf|publisher=Directorate-General Health &amp; Consumers|accessdate=5 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103050102/http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/documents/akj_en.pdf|archivedate=3 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium ferrocyanide]], also known as yellow [[prussiate]] of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an [[anticaking agent]]. The additive is considered safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="hansard.millbanksystems.com"/&gt;{{sfn|European Commission|2001|p=3}} Such anticaking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morton Salt FAQ |url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/general-company-faqs#q3 |accessdate=12 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119105846/http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/general-company-faqs#q3 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the [[Committee on Toxicity]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="hansard.millbanksystems.com"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/may/05/table-salt Discussions of the safety of sodium hexaferrocyanate in table salt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090336/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/may/05/table-salt |date=4 March 2016 }}.

In "doubly fortified salt", both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates [[iron deficiency anaemia]], which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is [[Iron(II) fumarate|ferrous fumarate]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}} Another additive, especially important for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, is [[folic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), which gives the table salt a yellow color. Folic acid helps prevent [[neural tube defect]]s and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

A lack of [[fluorine]] in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of [[dental caries]].{{sfn|Selwitz|Ismail|Pitts|2007}} [[Fluoride]] salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where [[water fluoridation]] is not carried out. In [[France]], 35% of the table salt sold contains added [[sodium fluoride]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

===Other kinds===
[[File:Sea Salt.jpg|thumb|left|Irregular crystals of [[sea salt]]]]
Unrefined [[sea salt]] contains small amounts of [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[halides]] and [[sulfate]]s, traces of [[algae|algal products]], salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt [[hygroscopic]] (i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered). Algal products contribute a mildly "fishy" or "sea-air" odour, the latter from [[Organobromine compound#Organobromine compounds in nature|organobromine compounds]]. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance. Since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients.{{sfn|McGee|2004|p=642}} The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough [[iodine]] salts to prevent [[Iodine deficiency|iodine deficiency diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=References on food salt &amp; health issues|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Articles-references/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-food-salt-health-issues|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163713/http://www.saltinstitute.org/Articles-references/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-food-salt-health-issues|archivedate=19 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different natural salts have different [[Minerality#I–P|mineralities]] depending on their source, giving each one a unique flavour. [[Fleur de sel]], a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a unique flavour varying with the region from which it is produced. In traditional [[Korean cuisine]], so-called "[[jugyeom|bamboo salt]]" is prepared by roasting salt{{sfn|Livingston|2005|p=45}} in a [[bamboo]] container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the [[clastogen|anticlastogenic]] and [[mutagen|antimutagenic]] properties of [[doenjang]] (a fermented bean paste).{{sfn|Shahidi|Shi|Ho|2005|p=575}}

[[Kosher salt|Kosher or kitchen salt]] has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking. It can be useful for [[brining]], bread or [[pretzel]] making and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltworks.us/salt_info/kosher-salt.asp |title=Kosher Salt Guide |publisher=SaltWorks |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224110615/http://saltworks.us/salt_info/kosher-salt.asp |archivedate=24 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pickling salt]] is made of ultra-fine grains to speed dissolving to make [[brine]].  Gourmet salts may be used for specific tastes.

===Salt in food===
Salt is present in most [[food]]s, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as [[canning|canned foods]] and especially [[salting (food)|salted foods]], [[pickling|pickled foods]], and [[snack food]]s or other [[convenience food]]s), where it functions as both a [[preservative]] and a [[flavor]]ing. [[Dairy salt]] is used in the preparation of butter and cheese products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pieters |first=A. J. |last2=Flint |first2=D. |last3=Garriott |first3=E.

Thus, [[herring]] contains 67&amp;nbsp;mg sodium per 100&amp;nbsp;g, while [[kipper]], its preserved form, contains 990&amp;nbsp;mg. Similarly, [[pork]] typically contains 63&amp;nbsp;mg while [[bacon]] contains 1,480&amp;nbsp;mg, and [[potato]]es contain 7&amp;nbsp;mg but [[potato crisp]]s 800&amp;nbsp;mg per 100 g.&lt;ref name=HMSO /&gt; Salt is also used in [[cooking]], such as with [[salt crust]]s. The main sources of salt in the Western diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.&lt;ref name=HMSO&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual of Nutrition |last=Buss |first=David |last2=Robertson |first2=Jean |year=1973 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |isbn=0112411126 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are used in the manufacture of [[PVC]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production of [[aluminium]]. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of [[soap]]s and [[glycerine]], where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the [[Saponification|saponified]] products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of [[synthetic rubber]], and another use is in the firing of [[pottery]], when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]].&lt;ref name=WASG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wasalt.com.au/SaltUses.html |title=Salt uses |publisher=WA Salt Group |accessdate=10 October 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131011054052/http://www.wasalt.com.au/SaltUses.html |archivedate= 11 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] (7% in Europe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eusalt.com/salt-uses | title=Salt Uses | publisher=European Salt Producers' Association | accessdate=5 May 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212060035/http://eusalt.com/salt-uses | archivedate=12 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roskill.com/reports/salt | title=Roskill Information Services | publisher=Roskill.com | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=7 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030618234222/http://www.roskill.com/reports/salt | archivedate=18 June 2003 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, total world production of salt was 264 million [[tonne]]s, the top five producers being China (71 million), the United States (40 million), India (18 million), Germany (12 million) and Canada (11 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/salt/mcs-2014-salt.pdf | title=Salt | publisher=US Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries | date=February 2014 | accessdate=8 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630102120/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/salt/mcs-2014-salt.pdf | archivedate=30 June 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either [[salt mine|mined]] directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in [[Open pan salt making|shallow open pans]] which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under [[vacuum]].{{sfn|Kostick|2011}} The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are [[kiln]]-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090409144219/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/aboutsalt-prod02.htm About salt: Production].

One of the largest [[salt mining]] operations in the world is at the [[Khewra Salt Mine]] in Pakistan. The mine has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} of passages. The salt is dug out by the [[room and pillar]] method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of [[Himalayan salt]] is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum.&lt;ref name="The Seattle Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pennington |first=Matthew |title=Pakistan salt mined old-fashioned way mine |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002159747_saltmine25.html |accessdate=11 October 2013 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=25 January 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725072022/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002159747_saltmine25.html |archivedate=25 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
[[File:Russian bread and salt.jpg|thumb|[[Bread and salt]] at a Russian wedding ceremony]]
Salt has long held an important place in religion and culture. At the time of [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanic]] sacrifices, in [[Hittites|Hittite]] rituals and during festivals held by [[Semitic people|Semites]] and Greeks at the time of the [[new moon]], salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/salt-eorl-12/ |title=Research article: Salt |work=Encyclopedia of Religion |accessdate=13 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050505/http://www.bookrags.com/research/salt-eorl-12/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of [[Holy Water]] in the Christian faith.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Aztec]] mythology, [[Huixtocihuatl]] was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amoxtli.org/cuezali/festivals.html |title=The Aztec Festivals: Toxcatl (Dryness) |last=Quipoloa |first=J. |year=2007 |work=The Aztec Gateway |accessdate=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916191933/http://www.amoxtli.org/cuezali/festivals.html |archivedate=16 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], there are thirty-five verses which [[Salt in the Bible|mention salt]].&lt;ref name=BLB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/translationResults.cfm?Criteria=salt&amp;t=KJV |title=Dictionary and Word Search for '"salt"' in the KJV |date=1996–2013 |work=Blue Letter Bible |publisher=Sowing Circle |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414094030/http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/translationResults.cfm?Criteria=salt&amp;t=KJV |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these mentions [[Lot's wife]], who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] destroyed the city of [[Shechem]], he is said to have "[[salting the earth|sown salt]] on it," probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The [[Book of Job]] contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" (Job 6:6).&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt; In the [[New Testament]], six verses mention salt. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], [[Jesus]] referred to his followers as the "[[Salt and Light|salt of the earth]]". [[Paul the Apostle|The apostle Paul]] also encouraged Christians to "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" (Colossians 4:6).&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt; Salt is mandatory in the rite of the [[Tridentine Mass]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Salt]]&lt;/ref&gt; Salt is used in the third item (which includes an [[Exorcism]]) of the Celtic Consecration (''cf.'' [[Gallican Rite]]) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water "where it is customary" in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

In [[Judaism]], it is recommended to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing [[Kiddush]] for [[Shabbat]]. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush.&lt;ref&gt;Naftali Silberberg [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484194/jewish/Why-dip-in-salt.htm Why is the Challah dipped in salt before it is eaten?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120034528/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484194/jewish/Why-dip-in-salt.htm |date=20 January 2012 }}, Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the [[Sabbath]] bread in salt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=10+1 Things you may not know about Salt |journal=Epikouria |year=2006 |volume=Fall/Winter |issue=3 |url=http://www.epikouria.com/issue3/article6-things.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704055740/http://www.epikouria.com/issue3/article6-things.php |archivedate=4 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wicca]], salt is symbolic of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies.

In [[voting system]]s, the '''Schwartz set''' is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all '''Schwartz set components'''. A Schwartz set component is any non-empty set ''S'' of candidates such that
# Every candidate inside the set ''S'' is pairwise unbeaten by every candidate outside ''S''; and
# No non-empty [[proper subset]] of ''S'' fulfills the first property.

A set of candidates that meets the first requirement is also known as an '''undominated set'''.

The Schwartz set provides one standard of optimal choice for an election outcome. Voting systems that always elect a candidate from the Schwartz set pass the '''Schwartz criterion'''. The Schwartz set is named for [[political science|political scientist]] Thomas Schwartz.

==Properties==
*The Schwartz set is always non-empty—there is always at least one Schwartz set component.
*Any two distinct Schwartz set components are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]].
*If there is a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]], it is the only member of the Schwartz set. If there is only one member in the Schwartz set, it is at least a [[Condorcet method#Related terms|weak Condorcet winner]].
*If a Schwartz set component contains multiple candidates, they are all in a beatpath cycle with each other, a '''top cycle'''.
*Any two candidates that are in different Schwartz set components are pairwise tied with each other.

==Smith set comparison==
The Schwartz set is closely related to and is always a [[subset]] of the [[Smith set]]. The Smith set is larger if and only if a candidate in the Schwartz set has a pairwise tie with a candidate that is not in the Schwartz set.
For example, given:
* 3 voters preferring candidate A to B to C
* 1 voter preferring candidate B to C to A
* 1 voter preferring candidate C to A to B
* 1 voter preferring candidate C to B to A
then we have A pairwise beating B, B pairwise beating C, and A tying with C in their pairwise comparison, making A the only member of the Schwartz set, while the Smith set on the other hand consists of all the candidates.

==Algorithms==
The Schwartz set can be calculated with the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] in time '''[[big O notation|Θ]]'''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or with a version of [[Kosaraju's algorithm]] in time '''[[big O notation|Θ]]'''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Complying methods ==
The [[Schulze method]] always chooses a winner from the Schwartz set.

'''Sheldon Mervin Chumir''' (December 3, 1940 – January 26, 1992) was a lawyer and politician from [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].

Sheldon Chumir was born in [[Calgary]]. He studied law at the [[University of Alberta]], from which he graduated in 1963 with the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;Cotler, Irwin. ''The New Human Rights Agenda:The First Sheldon Chumir Lecture''. Centre for Constitutional Studies/Centre d'etudes Constitutionnelles, 'Constitutional Forum Constitutionel' Vol.6 Number 2, Winter 1995, p. 43. http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/images/journals/forum/1-ConstitutionalForum6_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his education as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Letters]] degree from [[Oxford University]] in 1965.

==Law, business career and political activism==

Chumir began his professional career as a tax lawyer with the federal Department of Justice in Toronto.  In 1971, he joined a Calgary law firm. In 1976, he launched his own private practice focusing on civil liberties cases which on occasion provided representation on a [[pro-bono]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;^ Cotler, Irwin. The New Human Rights Agenda:The First Sheldon Chumir Lecture. Centre for Constitutional Studies/Centre d'etudes Constitutionnelles, 'Constitutional Forum Constitutionel' Vol.6 Number 2, Winter 1995, p. 43. http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/images/journals/forum/1-ConstitutionalForum6_2.pdf, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured on civil liberties and human rights at the [[University of Calgary]] Law School and founded the Calgary Civil Liberties Association.  He was also an entrepreneur; he founded a small oil and gas company, co-founded the entertainment promotion firm Brimstone Productions and engaged in real estate.

In 1983, he ventured into activism by creating Save Public Education, an organization which opposed public funding of religious schools.&lt;ref name="fonds"&gt;[http://ww2.glenbow.org/search/archivesMainResults.aspx?XC=/search/archivesMainResults.aspx&amp;TN=MAINCAT&amp;AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;RF=WebResults&amp;DL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;NP=255&amp;MF=WPEngMsg.ini&amp;MR=5&amp;QB0=AND&amp;QF0=Main%20entry%2B%7C%2BTitle&amp;QI0=Sheldon%20Chumir%20fonds Sheldon Chumir fonds], The Glenbow Museum. Retrieved August 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The group ran a successful slate of candidates in a Calgary Board of Education election. 

== Political career ==
In the [[Alberta general election, 1986|1986 Alberta general election]], he ran as a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] in the riding of [[Calgary Buffalo]] and defeated incumbent [[Brian Lee (politician)|Brian Lee]] of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]]. He was among the first four Liberals elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] since 1969. In the Assembly, he advocated on legal affairs, human rights, energy, finance and community service, and he advocated legislation that supported human rights and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fonds"/&gt;  He was re-elected in [[Alberta general election, 1989|1989]].

== Death and legacy ==
Chumir died in 1992.

The [[Sheldon M. Chumir Centre]], an eight-story medical facility named in honor of Chumir, opened in Calgary in April 2008. The facility includes an Urgent Care Centre, Mental Health clinic, Diagnostic Imaging department and the [[Southern Alberta HIV Clinic]].

Chumir was called one of Alberta's New Mavericks by Jamie Komarnicki of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', who in Chumir's obituary described him as a "soft-spoken man with a quirky sense of humour [who] was a determined champion of public education and individual freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=1dcedb61-74d3-4df2-b1b9-72d89f407d27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820064409/http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=1dcedb61-74d3-4df2-b1b9-72d89f407d27 |archivedate=2013-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/long+list+Mavericks/3655259/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Chumir was posthumously honored by the Calgary Stampede Foundation with the centennial edition of the Western Legacy Award. This unique edition award recognized contributions of 100 Calgarians and their services to Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/january16-2013/westernlegacy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2027">A '''squirrel''' is a term in [[debate|debating]] jargon, particularly in [[parliamentary debate]], that indicates a definition from the side of the opening speaker that makes it too easy for his or her side. The first speaker in a debate, who is defending the [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] or [[proposition]], generally has to define the terms used in the motion. When this definition is done in an unexpected way, it can favour the opening side, because that side had been able to prepare for the particular interpretation in the preparation time. For example, if the motion read "This House Would dissolve the police", it would be a squirrel to refer to the band [[The Police]] instead of the [[police]]. Another squirrel in this case, that helps the opening side by making the debate generally easier for them, is to add unreasonable exceptions to the motion. For example, defending "dissolving the police" except in cases where it has to "uphold the law" is rather easy.

In competitive debating, judges usually consider a squirrel a negative thing. There is, however, no clear standard on what constitutes a squirrel, and the judges have to decide this on their own. Sometimes the other side in the debate tries to notify the judges of the squirrel. A notable example is the so-called "open motion" debate, where debaters are expected to come up with their own far-fetched interpretation of an ambiguous motion.

A squirrel can also refer to an affirmative so obscure that there is no known negative against it. These cases are rare and will typically win the round for the affirmative team.

The '''State Border Guard Service of the Kyrgyz Republic''' also commonly known as the '''Kyrgyz Frontier Force''' is the [[border guard]] of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]]. It is currently a Public Service department of the government of the republic and is not part of any ministries.

==History==
Upon its independence in 1992, Kyrgyzstan took command over the former Soviet Republic's directorate of the [[KGB|KGB's]] Central Asian Border Troops District which was part of the wider [[Soviet Border Troops]], that numbered at about 2,000 mostly [[Russia]]n troops. However in late 1992, Russia established a joint Kyrgyzstani-Russian Border Troop Command, which effectively brought the border protection responsibilities under Russian command again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Kyrgyzstan/sub8_5d/entry-4792.html#chapter-4|title=MILITARY IN KYRGYZSTAN: WEAPONS, TROOPS, POLICY Facts and Details| last=Hays| first=Jeffrey| website=factsanddetails.com| language=en| access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borders of Kyrgyzstan with [[post-Soviet states]] were thus mostly unguarded as the Russian Border Troops mostly concentrated on guarding the borders facing countries such as Afghanistan and China. In August 1999, the duties of border protection was finally transferred from the [[Border Guard Service of Russia]] to the Kyrgyzstani government, which would eventually set the basis for the future State Border Guard Service and the tightening of its borders with the neighbouring countries.

On 31 August 2002, the State Border Guard Service of the Kyrgyz Republic was officially established from a merger of the Main Border Guard Directorate of the [[Ministry of Defense of the Kyrgyz Republic|Ministry of Defense]] and the Main Directorate of Border Control of the [[State Committee for National Security (Kyrgyz Republic)|National Security Service]], so as to have a more centralised system. Over the subsequent few years, the border guard service would be transferred to and removed from the command of the National Security Service for several times by presidential decree till on 4 September 2012, it was permanently established as an independent Public Service department within the government of the Kyrgyz Republic. Despite the similarities in the scope of work covered, the service is not under the command of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Kyrgyzstan)|Ministry of Interior Affairs]] of the republic, neither is it part of the [[military of Kyrgyzstan]]. 

Since the independence of the republic, it has had many disagreements and even confrontations with the border service of neighbouring countries, including those of [[Tajik Border Troops|Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan Frontier Service|Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.trend.az/regions/casia/kyrgyzstan/1916343.html| title=Uzbekistan's Frontier Service: Kyrgyzstan aggravates situation in Sokh enclave| date=2011-08-10| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several land border crossings with neighbouring countries have also not been consistently opened as a result. The border guard service has also because of the disagreements, taken steps to train and upgrade itself. For example in 2013, the border service took part in a joint military drill with [[China]] on the two countries' borders. Additionally it has also requested and received training and equipment from China and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/kyrgyz/kyrgyzstan/2014/05/140528_border| title=15 Anniversary of the Border Service| date=2014-05-28| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
As the border guard of the Kyrgyz Republic, its primary duty is to protect the territorial integrity of the republic by ensuring that all the borders of the republic are not compromised, be it by other nation states or criminal elements. The border guard does so by deploying troops to patrol and monitor its borders at all times by varying means. A combination of high altitude, rough terrain and an usually high number of [[Batken Region#Enclaves and exclaves|exclaves]] in the republic makes border policing even more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyzstan-tajikistan-exclaves-vorukh-tensions/25232311.html| title=Small Exclave Spells Big Problems For Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan| date=2014-01-16| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its secondary role is to assist in [[immigration]] formalities at all entry and exit checkpoints in the country, including those at land border crossings and airports. It works together with the [[State Customs Service (Kyrgyz Republic)|State Customs Service]] in [[customs]] formalities too.

==Border Guards Day==
{{Main|Border Guards Day}}
[[Border Guards Day]] is a holiday celebrated in the republic by active and ex-servicemen of the border guard service. The holiday has its roots from the Soviet times and is still celebrated on May 28. The day is set for the public to also pay tribute and understand the importance of the border guard service in the republic. The date of the holiday was shifted to October 29 in 2003 but due to appeals from the veterans of the service, was shifted back to its original date from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gps.gov.kg/ru/department/history| title=Border Guard Service History| year=2017| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On 20 August 2012, at the Echilitash frontier outpost that served as the [[Issyk-Kul]] border units command headquarters, 19-year-old Kyrgyz border guard Kulbarak Balbai in a state of desertion fired at his fellow servicemen with a rifle instantly killing four; the outpost commander, senior soldier, warrant officer and junior soldier. A fifth visiting civilian wife of one of the guards was also killed as a result of the gunshot fire. The three other Kyrgyz guards who occupied the border crossing outpost fled in a car upon hearing the shooting take place in the main building. Kulbarak later fled the scene in a stolen car and was confronted in a nearby gorge the next day while attempting to defect to [[Uzbekistan]]. A firefight ensued between police officials and the gunman, eventually leading to Kulbarak's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-kyrgyzstan-shooting/kyrgyz-forces-kill-fugitive-border-guard-after-attack-idUKBRE87K0F620120821| title=Kyrgyz forces kill fugitive border guard after attack| date=2012-08-21| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motive although unknown is believed to be "hazing", which is the bullying of younger servicemen.

{{Norway during World War II}}
'''Statspolitiet''' (shortened '''STAPO''') was from 1941 to 1945 a [[National Socialist]] armed police force that consisted of Norwegian officials after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] pattern. It operated independently of the ordinary Norwegian police. The force was established on June 1, 1941 during the [[German occupation of Norway]]. The initiative for the force came from the later chief [[Karl Marthinsen]] and other prominent members of the collaborationist party [[Nasjonal Samling]]. At its peak, in 1944 there were 350 employees in Statspolitiet, in addition to a larger number who collaborated or rendered services for them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8366853 Namngjev nordmenn som torturerte] [[Norwegian broadcasting corporation]] {{nn icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was primarily to combat so-called ''political crimes'', refugees, espionage, sabotage, armed resistance and other kinds of resistance against the German occupation forces or the Norwegian collaborationist [[Quisling regime]]. Statspolitiet played an important role during the [[Holocaust in Norway]], aiding in [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|the deportation]] of the [[History of the Jews in Norway|Jews in Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jus.uio.no/ikrs/tjenester/kunnskap/kriminalpolitikk/aktuelt/Tema/jodeforfolgelse/samfunnetspansredeneve.pdf "Fra arbeiderkrig til verdenskrig" and "Politiet som aldri gikk lei", chapters of ''"«Samfunnets pansrede neve»'' by P.O. Johansen] Institute for criminology and justice sociology [[University of Oslo]] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegians were arrested by contemporary laws, and many were later sent to prison camps in Norway and [[concentration camp]]s in what was then Germany. Statspolitiet was organized with a headquarters in [[Oslo]] and six subsidiaries in Oslo and Aker, [[Stavanger]], [[Bergen]], [[Trondheim]], [[Tromsø]] and [[Kirkenes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkivportalen.no/side/aktor/detaljer?aktorId=no-a1450-01000001377594 Statspolitiet - Hovedkontoret / Osloavdelingen] [[National Archives of Norway]] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftenposten20121022"&gt;aftenposten.no [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Slik-opererte-det-norske-Gestapo-7024130.html Slik opererte det norske Gestapo] ''[[Aftenposten]]'' October 22, 2012 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statspolitiet was subordinate to the chief of the security police and the Norwegian Minister of Police, [[Jonas Lie (government minister)|Jonas Lie]]. Statspolitiet also received orders directly from the German [[Sicherheitspolizei]].&lt;ref name =nade&gt;Eirik Veum: Nådeløse nordmenn: Statspolitiet 1941-1945.

== After World War II ==

{{See also|Legal purge in Norway after World War II}}
After the German capitulation on May 8, 1945, Statspolitiet was disbanded immediately. Former officers of Statspolitiet were arrested and tried in Norwegian courts, and were found guilty of varying degrees of such crimes as treason, illegal detention, torture, maltreatments, murders and illegal executions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klikk.no/produkthjemmesider/vimenn/reportasje/article810459.ece Norsk politi torturerte nordmenn] [[Vi Menn]] Oct 28, 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishments were harsh and included the use of [[Capital punishment in Norway|capital punishment]]. The death sentences for the Statspolitiet officers [[Reidar Haaland]], [[Arne Saatvedt]], [[Hans Jacob Skaar Pedersen]], [[Holger Tou]], [[Ole Wehus]], [[Olav Aspheim]] and [[Einar Dønnum]] were fulfilled, the officers being executed by [[firing squad]].&lt;ref name="nade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asbjørn Jaklin: ''De dødsdømte'' (page 101), Gyldendal, Oslo 2011, {{no icon}} {{ISBN|978-82-05-41088-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Swardspeak uses elements from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and some from [[Japanese language|Japanese]], as well as celebrities' names and trademark brands, giving them new meanings in different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thepoc.net/thepoc-features/buhay-pinoy/buhay-pinoy-features/6340-gayspeak-not-gor-gays-only.html |title= Gayspeak: Not for gays only |author= Jessica Salao |date= 30 April 2010 |work=  |publisher= thepoc.net |accessdate= 23 December 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201034008/http://www.thepoc.net/thepoc-features/buhay-pinoy/buhay-pinoy-features/6340-gayspeak-not-gor-gays-only.html |archivedate= 1 December 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely localized within [[Gay community|gay communities]], making use of words derived from the local languages and/or dialects, including [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], [[Waray-Waray language|Waray]] and [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]].

==Usage==
A defining trait of swardspeak slang is that it more often than not immediately identifies the speaker as homosexual, making it easy for people of that orientation to recognize each other. This creates an exclusive group among its speakers and helps them resist cultural assimilation. More recently, though, even non-members of the gay community use this way of speaking, particularly [[heterosexual]] members of industries dominated by gays, such as the fashion and film industries. 

By using swardspeak, Filipino LGBT+ people are able to resist the dominant culture of their area and create a space of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/swardspeak/ |title= swardspeak|author=|date= |work= |publisher= http://www.doubletongued.org|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is constantly changing, with old phrases becoming obsolete and new phrases frequently entering everyday usage, reflecting changes in their culture and also maintaining exclusivity. The dynamic nature of the language refuses to cement itself in a single culture and allows for more freedom of expression among its speakers. Words and phrases can be created to react to popular trends and create alternatives to a strictly defined lifestyle. By these characteristics, swardspeak creates a dissident group without any ties to geographical, linguistic, or cultural restrictions, thus allowing its speakers to shape the language as appropriate to the times. In this way, the language is not only "mobile" and part of a larger community, but also open to more specific or local meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bangkok2005.anu.edu.au/papers/Suguitan.pdf |title= A SEMANTIC LOOK AT FEMININE SEX AND GENDER TERMS  IN PHILIPPINE GAY LINGO |author=Cynthia Grace B.

Gay people who speak the language almost exclusively are humorously called ''Bekimons'' (a contraction of ''Baklang Jejemon'', 'Gay [[Jejemon]]s').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pinoylgbt.com/ang-bekimon-baklang-jejemon/ |title= Ang Bekimon (Baklang Jejemon) |author=Sharlyne Ang  |date= July 7, 2010|work= |publisher=pinoylgbt.com|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swardspeak is also spoken by ''[[Fag hag|babaeng bakla]]'', women who associate exclusively or mostly with gay men (literally 'gay women', though they are actually heterosexual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thepoc.net/thepoc-features/buhay-pinoy/buhay-pinoy-features/6340-gayspeak-not-gor-gays-only.html |title= Gayspeak: Not for gays only |author= Jessica Salao |date= 30 April 2010 |work=  |publisher= thepoc.net |accessdate= 23 December 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201034008/http://www.thepoc.net/thepoc-features/buhay-pinoy/buhay-pinoy-features/6340-gayspeak-not-gor-gays-only.html |archivedate= 1 December 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word "Swardspeak", according to [[Jose Javier Reyes|José Javier Reyes]], was coined by columnist and film critic Nestor Torre in the 1970s. Reyes himself wrote a book on the subject entitled "Swardspeak: A Preliminary Study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?i=289&amp;subcat=13 |title= The Filipino Gayspeak (Filipino Gay Lingo)|author= Reinerio A. Alba |date= June 5, 2006|work= |publisher=ncca.gov.ph|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sward" is an outdated slang for 'gay male' in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://badinggerzie.blogspot.com/2005/05/gay-speaks-on-swardspeak.html |title= GAY SPEAKS on "SWARDSPEAK"  |author= |date= May 13, 2005|work= |publisher= badinggerzie.blogspot.com|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|date=January 2018|reason=The source used is a blog.}} The origin of the individual words and phrases, however, has existed longer and come from a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.philjol.info/index.php/KK/article/viewPDFInterstitial/754/699|title= GAY LANGUAGE: DEFYING THE STRUCTURAL LIMITS OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN THE PHILIPPINES |author= Norberto V.

==Conventions==
Swardspeak is a form of [[slang]] (and therefore highly dynamic, as opposed to [[colloquialism]]s) that is built upon preexisting languages. It deliberately transforms or creates words that resemble words from other languages, particularly [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese languages|Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]]. It is colorful, witty, and humorous, with vocabularies derived from popular culture and regional variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/views-and-analysis/05/05/08/philippine-gay-lingo-danton-remoto |title= On Philippine gay lingo |author=Danton Remoto |date= 2008-05-05|work= |publisher= abs-cbnnews.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unintelligible to people not familiar with the Filipino gay culture or who do not know the rules of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://philippines-butchokoy.blogspot.com/2008/11/gay-lingo-made-in-philippines.html |title= Gay Lingo (Made in the Philippines)|author=|date= November 16, 2008|work= |publisher= doubletongued.org|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no standardized set of rules, but some of the more common conventions are shown below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unitedsea.blogspot.com/2007/07/deciphering-filipino-gay-lingo.html |title= Deciphering Filipino Gay Lingo|author= Empress Maruja|date= 27 July 2007|work= |publisher= United SEA|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20198">The '''Twelve Generals' Letter''' ({{lang-hr|Pismo dvanaestorice generala}}) was an [[open letter]], signed by twelve [[general]]s of the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian Armed Forces]], that criticized the government, politicians and media for perceived criminalization of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] and asserted that [[war veteran]]s had suffered undignified treatment. On 29 September 2000, a day after the letter was published by the [[Croatia]]n media, [[President of Croatia|Croatian President]] [[Stjepan Mesić]] reacted by sending into forced retirement all seven of the signatories who were [[active duty|active-duty]] officers. The affair was a source of significant controversy in Croatia and is considered one of the key events in Mesić's ten-year presidential incumbency.

==Background==
Croatia underwent major political changes in late 1999 – early 2000. The first [[President of Croatia]] and leader of the ruling [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), [[Franjo Tuđman]], died in office in December 1999. In January 2000 Tuđman's HDZ, a nationalist party that had ruled Croatia since independence in 1991, lost power in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary elections]] and was replaced by a center-left coalition of six parties. [[Stjepan Mesić]], one of Tuđman's fiercest critics, won the [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]] in the same month.

The new liberal and pro-European government began to investigate [[war crime]]s committed by Croatian forces in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995), aiming to improve cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) in [[the Hague]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000930"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000914"/&gt; These developments enraged the war veterans' groups and extreme nationalists.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000914"/&gt;

After a key [[whistleblower]] and war crime witness [[Milan Levar]] was murdered on 28 August 2000, a wave of arrests of war crime suspects followed.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000914"/&gt; In response, veterans' groups organized protests that escalated into threats and violence.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000930"/&gt; An anonymous death threat was sent to President Mesić and Prime Minister [[Ivica Račan|Račan]].&lt;ref name="HRT News"/&gt;

The new government also started a cycle of defense reforms,&lt;ref name="Balkananalysis"/&gt; which aroused further concern among high-ranking officers of the Croatian Army who were themselves war veterans.

==Content==

The letter was titled "An Open Letter of Croatian Generals to the Croatian Public" ({{lang-hr|Otvoreno pismo hrvatskih generala hrvatskoj javnosti}}) and organized into six points.&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The first point noted "with bitterness" that a significant proportion of media and politicians spoke of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] as "something bad, problematic, even shameful, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty".&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000930"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The signatories stressed in the second point that they were not against the sanctioning of individual criminal acts. However, they asserted that recent actions by the police had left the impression of a crackdown on terrorism or organized crime, rather than an act of a democratic country within the rule of law, in accord with the actual circumstances and the dignity of war veterans and Croatian Army officers.&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The third point denounced what the signatories called an "unnecessary show of force" and presumptions of guilt, including speculation about indictments by the ICTY, deeming them detrimental to tolerance and democracy in Croatia.&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The fourth point rejected conflicts, violence and terrorism, which the signatories deemed to not be in the interests of "anyone responsible", war veterans in particular.&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The fifth point comprised a comment by the signatories on speculation regarding the reorganisation of the Croatian Army. They declared their support for the promotion of the most educated and most capable individuals, "which means those who proved themselves in the Croatian War of Independence".&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

In the sixth and final point, the signatories urged the government, civil society and the media to "resist the negativist, historically incorrect and untrue portrayals of the Croatian War of Independence" and to "protect the dignity of Croatian officers and soldiers" as the foundations of Croatian freedom and independence, as well as the future of a democratic and prosperous Croatia.&lt;ref name="HRT Letter"/&gt;

The letter was signed by [[General of the Army]] (ret.) [[Janko Bobetko]], [[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ante Gotovina]], Lt. Gen. [[Krešimir Ćosić (politician)|Krešimir Ćosić]], [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Mirko Norac]], Admiral [[Davor Domazet-Lošo]], Maj. Gen. (ret.) [[Ivan Korade]], Maj. Gen. [[Damir Krstičević]], Lt. Gen. (ret.) [[Ivan Čermak]], Maj. Gen. [[Ivan Kapular]], Maj. Gen. (ret.) [[Nojko Marinović]], Lt. Gen. (ret.) [[Ivan Basarac]] and Maj. Gen. [[Miljenko Filipović]].&lt;ref name="HRT News"/&gt;

==Reactions==
In his first public comment on the letter, [[President of Croatia|Croatian President]] [[Stjepan Mesić]] noted that he also supported preserving the dignity of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], provided "that the government is still functioning, that there is no selective approach, and that the law applies to everyone". He said that some individuals from the HDZ were responsible for the letter's creation.&lt;ref name="HRT News"/&gt;

The Office of the President of Croatia and the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Defense]] called the letter "inappropriate". The Ministry of Defence also described it as "unprofessional", noting that the law forbids the members of Croatian Armed Forces from engaging in political activities.&lt;ref name="HRT News"/&gt;

On 29 September 2000, a day after the letter was published, President Mesić announced that he was retiring all seven serving officers (Gotovina, Ćosić, Krstičević, Kapular, Filipović, Domazet-Lošo and Norac) who signed the letter.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20000930"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He stated that "those who thought a ''[[coup d'état]]'' in this country could be achieved with [[pamphlet]]s have played the wrong card. As of today, they are not members of the Croatian Army."&lt;ref name="CER"/&gt;

Mesić's actions produced widely varied reactions from the political parties. The ruling coalition parties generally supported the move, calling it "logical", and even "necessary", while [[Ivo Sanader]], president of the HDZ, criticized it as "extremely dangerous".&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20000930"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SD 20000930"/&gt; Mesić was also severely criticised by Croatian war veterans' organisations.&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20000930"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20001003-5C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20001003-5D"/&gt; On the other hand, polls showed that the majority of Croatian public supported the President's actions.&lt;ref name="CER"/&gt;

An article by ''[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]'' weekly warned that twenty more generals were planning to sign a letter against the government, which created concern about an actual coup.&lt;ref name="CER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20001004"/&gt; President Mesić, however, dismissed such speculations as "nonsense".&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20001004"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Mesic cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|One year into his first term, [[Stjepan Mesić]] said that retiring the generals was one of the best moves he had made as a president.&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20010207"/&gt;]]
On several occasions it was speculated that the retired generals might return to active duty.  On 2 October 2000, President Mesić hinted that his decision might not yet be final for Maj. Gen. [[Damir Krstičević|Krstičević]], stating that Krstičević's fate depended on "his further conduct".&lt;ref name="Vjesnik 20001003-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dani"/&gt; At 33 years of age, he was the youngest among the signatories, and was – apart from [[Nojko Marinović]] – the only general from the Tuđman era with no party affiliation.&lt;ref name="Dani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SD 20010124"/&gt; Krstičević declined Mesić's implicit offer, saying that he had "nothing to repent for".&lt;ref name="SD 20010124"/&gt;

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 election campaign]], [[Ivo Sanader]], president of the HDZ, announced the possibility of reactivating the generals. However, according to ''Nacional'' weekly, Sanader abandoned the idea due to his inability to implement it against the wish of President Mesić, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;

The issue was raised again in the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009–2010|2009/2010 presidential election]]. Three presidential candidates, [[Milan Bandić]], [[Andrija Hebrang (son) |Andrija Hebrang]] and [[Nadan Vidošević]], stated that, if elected, they would rehabilitate the generals and return some of them to active duty. The eventual winner of the election, [[Ivo Josipović]], rejected this suggestion, saying that the generals' retirement was final.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji 20091125"/&gt;

Mesić's decision to retire the generals is widely seen as one of the most important events of his presidency.&lt;ref name="Balkananalysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jutarnji 20070721"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jutarnji 20100109"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jutarnji 20100120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vesna"/&gt; Stjepan Mesić's successor Ivo Josipović stated that this was Mesić's best move in both of his five-year terms,&lt;ref name="Vecernji"/&gt; while Croatian military analyst Igor Tabak described it as a "hard decision to take", since it came early in the Mesić's first term, and went against an old authoritarian system that was still strong.&lt;ref name="Balkananalysis"/&gt;  The move is seen as important in the context of the depoliticisation of the armed forces and defence reforms that ultimately led to the [[accession of Croatia to NATO]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Balkananalysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zurnal" /&gt;  On the other hand, Mesić's critics contend that the supposed "coup" was non-existent and that his decision was essentially a continuation of anti-military sentiment which the generals had to publicly address as their patriotic duty.&lt;ref name="Hakave Tudjman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakave Letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIC"/&gt;

The organization was founded in April 2012 and is noticed to oppose [[Ukraine–European Union relations|European Union]] and [[Ukraine–NATO relations|NATO membership of Ukraine]] and would prefer instead Ukraine's membership in [[Eurasian Economic Space]]. The group also wants "decentralization of power followed by the transition to a federal structure, while maintaining the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine".&lt;ref name="UCMay 18, 2014"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-insight-idUSBREA4H02520140518 Failing Ukraine state plays in to Russia's hands], [[Reuters]] (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian Choice also emphasizes Slavic Orthodox values: in July, 2013, it organized a conference on the topic "Orthodox-Slavic values - the basics of the civilizational choice of Ukraine", where [[Vladimir Putin]] held a speech.&lt;ref name=fPagco/&gt; (Putin is the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Medvedchuk's 2004 born daughter Darina).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/person/47372d5025f16/ | script-title=uk:Медведчук і Марченко помінялися місцями | work=[[Tablo ID]] | date=2007-11-11 | accessdate=6 January 2014 | language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
According to [[The New York Times]] the group aimed at stopping former president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to sign Ukraine's [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=fPagco&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/world/europe/friend-of-putin-assumes-role-of-negotiator-in-ukrainian-conflict.html?_r=0 Close Friend of Russian Leader Takes Role as a Negotiator for Ukraine], [[The New York Times]] (FEB. 11, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In a leaked June 2013 Russian-ordered consultation document, whose contents has been corroborated by a former security source in Ukraine, the Russian government wanted Ukrainian Choice to influence public opinion.&lt;ref name="UCMay 18, 2014"/&gt; At the time Medvedchuk and the organization had marginal popular support in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="VMUCVMUC"&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/54398 Kremlin-imposed “Ukrainian choice”], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (3 July 2012)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/topic-day/playing-opposition Playing opposition], [[Den (newspaper)|Den]] (15 August 2013)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-ukraine-leaked-strategy-document/25081053.html Russia's Plan For Ukraine: Purported Leaked Strategy Document Raises Alarm], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (20 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2013 Ukrainian Choice ran an aggressive [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-gay]] ad campaign warning against decayed values in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name=fPagco/&gt; Some of the ads claimed that association with the European Union would mean the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=agmUC/&gt; At the time Medvedchuk described the European Union as the modern heir to the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name=fPagco/&gt;

During [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in March 2014, the organization organized blockage of Ukrainian military logistics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160919182130/https://news.pn/ru/incidents/98190 Pro-Russian group of people blocked the Odessa highway in Mykolaiv impeding transportation of Ukrainian military transport].

The '''Association of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime/Federation of Antifascists''' (''Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes – Bund der Antifaschistinnen und Antifaschisten'') (VVN-BdA) is a confederation founded in 1947 and based in Berlin. The VVN-BdA, formerly the VVN, emerged from victims' associations in Germany founded by political opponents to Nazism after the Second World War and the end of the Nazi dictatorship.

During the Cold War, the VVN was the subject of political struggles between East and West Germany. In the West, the association was seen as dominated by the Communist Party (KPD); in the East, the VVN was accused of spying. In 1953, the VVN was abolished in the GDR and the Committee of Antifascist Resistance Fighters was founded in its place.

Since 2002, the association has extended to cover the whole of Germany, including camp communities of former prisoners of the concentration camps as incorporated associations. The VVN-BdA claims to be the biggest [[antifascist]] organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Purpose of the association==
The VVN-BdA is characterised as an  independent organisation, with a focus of resistance against fascism and war as its defining moral principle. In West Germany, the organisation was seen as taking its lead from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in the 1950s, and after 1968 of being controlled from the top by German Communist Party (DKP) members. Nevertheless, the spread of membership continues to come from a wide range of political elements, including orthodox communists, members of the party Die Linke, and political independents, along with Green Party members and Social Democrats (in spite of a dissenting resolution adopted by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which remained in force till October 25, 2010).

The VVN-BdA is a member of the [[Fédération Internationale des Résistants]] (International Federation of Resistance Fighters), along with organisations from all over Europe and from Israel.

==History==

===Establishment of the organisation===
With the end of World War II, self-help groups of former resistance fighters were founded in "anti-fascist committees", which were banned immediately by the military administrations of each of the four occupation zones. They supported attending to 200,000 up to 250,000 former political persecutees by the social administrations instead{{clarify|date=February 2016}}.

By June 26, 1945, an "association of political prisoners and persecutees of the Nazi system" had been founded in Stuttgart, and in the following weeks and months, there were regional groups of ex-political prisoners and other persecuted individuals formed with the permission of the allied forces, in each of the four occupation zones. Their concern, next to providing social help for those in need, was to bring the voice of resistance, the political and moral weight of the opponents of the Nazi regime to form a new anti-fascist, democratic Germany.

The initiative for the VVN came from representatives of the labour parties, which had committees that provided direct assistance to people persecuted or victimised by the Nazis, whether political, religious, or racially based.
It set out to be a multi-party organisation, an umbrella group for everyone, regardless of political affiliation, according to its manifesto in August 1946.

Representatives from all the regional organisations in the four occupied zones met in Frankfurt am Main from July 20–22, 1946 and adopted a charter for the "Society of People Persecuted by the Nazi Regime". On October 26, 1946, the first state organisations was founded in [[Düsseldorf]],  [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Others soon followed.

From March 15–17, 1947, the 1st Inter-zonal States Conference of the VVN convened in Frankfurt am Main with 68 delegates from all four of the occupied zones and the city of Berlin and formed an organisation representing all of Germany, with a similarly constituted council and two co-chairmen at the helm.

On the territory of the Soviet occupation zone, the SMAD orders no. 28 from January, 28th, 1947, and no. 92 from April, 22nd, 1947 put the compensation on solid formal ground. The SMAD order no. 228 from July, 30th, 1946 nullified the judgements in political proceedings of the Nazis and therefore made judicial rehabilitations easier; later decrees on regaining the German citizenship made the returning to Germany easier for expatriated emigrants. A similar, but however hesitant development was pursued by the administrations in the western occupation zones.&lt;ref&gt;↑ Jan Foizik; Martin Bronzit, Hermann Weber (Hrsg.): SBZ-Handbuch: Staatliche Verwaltungen, Parteien, gesellschaftliche Organisationen und ihre Führungskräfte in der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München 1993, {{ISBN|978-3-486-55262-1}}, S. 749&lt;/ref&gt;

The "red triangle", the sign sewn on the concentration camp uniforms of political prisoners, was adopted as the symbol for the VVN. The aim of the organisation was to support former prisoners, but the founding VVN members uniformly did not want to limit themselves to just this purpose. Having experienced [[terror]] personally, they wanted to be true to the [[Buchenwald Resistance#Buchenwald Oath|Buchenwald Oath]], to never again let fascism become a reality, "Our motto is the extermination of [[Nazism]] to its roots. Our goal is the creation of a new world of peace and freedom."

The political confrontation of the cold war affected the VVN heavily. [[Kurt Schumacher]], leader of the SPD, declared a resolution of incompatibility (''Unvereinbarkeitsbeschluss'') for Social Democrats, which has been abolished on October 25, 2010. Nonetheless, many SPD members remained in the VVN. Prominent Nazi opponents, such as [[Eugen Kogon]], who were close to the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) resigned from the VVN for political reasons. These actions led to a political narrowing of the VVN, although the organization continued to seek out all Nazi opponents and victims of persecution.

===German Democratic Republic (former East Germany)===
In 1949 and 1950, the [[Stalinist purges]] had repercussions in the [[Soviet occupation zone]], later to become the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), with the SED accusing leading members of the VVN of being agents of the west. At the same time, in connection with the [[Rudolf Slánský]] trial in the former [[Czechoslovakia]], the policies of the GDR leadership began to evidence an increasing anti-semitism toward the Jewish Communists who had fled to western countries after 1933. [[Julius Meyer]], an SED member and elected member of the [[People's Chamber]], [[Hans Freund]] and other Jewish members of the VVN fled to [[West Germany]] in December 1952 and January 1953 because of the threat of persecution. Even [[Leo Zuckerman]], a former state secretary and co-author of the GDR constitution, fled to the west.

Without the consultation of the VVN, the decision was made on January 15, 1953 to dissolve the organization. The VVN's publishing house was dissolved and in its place the [[Committee of Anti-fascist Resistance Fighters]] (''Komitee der antifaschistischen Widerstandskämpfer'') was set up. The overnight dissolution of the VVN met little opposition from within the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Hans Coppi (Historian and member of the Board of VVN-BdA Berlin), 2007. [http://www.nadir.org/nadir/periodika/aib/archiv/77/24.php ''60 Jahre Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528005157/http://www.nadir.org/nadir/periodika/aib/archiv/77/24.php |date=May 28, 2009 }}, Anti-fascist newsletter. Retrieved January 4, 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee maintained close contact with the VVN in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG).

In 1990, after the [[Die Wende|democratic revolution in the GDR]], the Association of Former Participants of the Anti-Fascist Resistance, Persecutees and Survivors (''Interessenverband ehemaliger Teilnehmer am antifaschistischen Widerstand, Verfolgter des Naziregimes und Hinterbliebener'') (IVVdN) took over as successor to the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berlin.vvn-bda.org/geschichte.php3?id=6 Berlin VVN-BdA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510234349/http://berlin.vvn-bda.org/geschichte.php3?id=6 |date=May 10, 2006 }}, official website. Retrieved January 4, 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimPeters2006"&gt;Tim Peters. ''Der Antifaschismus der PDS aus antiextremistischer Sicht'', VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden (2006) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2002, the IVVdN merged with the West German VVN, forming one organization for all of Germany.

===Federal Republic of Germany (former West Germany)===
The Communists had a major influence within the organization. The organization was led by the SED and [[German Communist Party|DKP]] till the German reunification in 1989.&lt;ref name="TimPeters2006 2"&gt;Tim Peters: Der Antifaschismus der PDS aus antiextremistischer Sicht, Wiesbaden, VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2006, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, all state chairmen, nearly all the main employees, as well as two-thirds of the membership of the national board and the steering committee were all members of the DKP.&lt;ref name="TimPeters2006"/&gt;

The political scope during the founding years was distinctly limited by the [[Cold War]]. Compounding that, were the declaration of incompatibility by the SPD in May 1948 and the resignation of prominent Nazi adversaries [[Eugen Kogon]], [[Heinz Galinski]] and [[Philipp Auerbach]], which all caused the VVN to be viewed in public discourse as a "Communist front organization". Public servants risked dismissal if they remained members of the VVN, despite being survivors of Nazi terror.

The splits and resignations resulted in a numerical and political dominance of left-wing members. Former Communist Resistance fighters found in the VNN a political forum in which they could to meet legally while the KPD itself was legally banned.

A number of [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]] tried to ban the VVN during the 1950s. A judicial ruling forced [[Lower Saxony]] to lift its ban and in [[Hamburg]], "VAN" was left as a "replacement" organization, but in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], the ban remained in effect. At the end of the 1950s, the federal government went to federal court to establish a ban against the VVN at the national level. The opening of the trial erupted into political scandal when it was revealed that the presiding judge, [[Senate#Alternative meanings|Senate]] President Prof. Dr. Werner had been an aggressive Nazi, resulting in the discontinuation of the case. The anti-communist climate continued to plague members of the VVN during the postwar era, though in sight of constitutional protection and during the 1970s, they were at times criticized by radicals.

From the outset, the VVN concerned itself with care for the victims of Nazi injustice, as well as the admonition and remembrance of the crimes of National Socialism. This included, for example, social counseling according to the federal law on compensation for victims of Nazi persecution, which came into force in 1956, but was retroactive to October 1, 1953. One section of the statute was problematic for VVN members, however. It excluded payments from anyone who advocated communism.

Since the 1960s, among the VVN's key spheres of political activity has been confrontation of old and new Nazis. The VVN has worked against SS reunions, against the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]], and against [[Auschwitz]] denial and other forms of revisionist history.

A crucial step was the May 1971 expansion of the organization to include the "Association of Anti-fascists". This extended the possibility of membership beyond just the persecuted and their family members, to young who have felt a bond with concentration camp survivors and their legacy. The broadening of the VVN changed the organization  considerably during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Attempted ban===
After September 1950, government employees were prohibited from joining the VVN and the [[Bundesregierung]] tried to ban the organization itself in 1951. On August 2, 1951, the police closed the VVN offices in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Following that, came prohibitions in the states of Hamburg and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Other states did not follow suit, though in Bavaria, there was an attempt, which ended with a finding by the Administrative Court in [[Regensburg]] that the VVN was not anti-constitutional. The federal government made another attempt to ban the organization in 1959, but the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] broke off the process after two hearings.

The ban was repealed in Hamburg in 1960 and in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1972.

===Extension to the Federation of Anti-fascists===
Members of the VVN were involved in a number of debates after the war. They fought against reinstalling old Nazis as office holders, against the reemergence of Nazi organizations, against the plan to [[Wiederbewaffnung|re-arm Germany]], against atomic armament and against the white-washing of German history from 1933 to 1945. Initiatives of the VVN led to the erection of memorial sites, such as the development of [[Dachau concentration camp]] into a noteworthy memorial site in the mid-1960s, a project with which VVN members were significantly involved.

In 1971, the VVN expanded itself to include the ''Bund der Antifaschisten'' (Federation of Anti-fascists). In the wake of the student [[protests of 1968]] and the growth of the right-wing extremist [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD), many young people became interested in the debate over Germany's Nazi past. The organization was also faced with a graying and declining membership and needed to invigorate itself with newer, younger members. Key themes of the 1970s and 1980s were the [[peace movement]] and [[anti-fascism]].

===1989 crisis===
In 1989, it became officially known that most of the VVN's work at the federal level was financed through funds from the DDR. With the end of this funding, came a financial crisis that brought VVN to the brink of dissolution. The full-time staff had to be laid off. According to the 1989 [[Verfassungsschutzbericht]] of Lower Saxony (page 26), until the [[fall of communism]], all applications for full-time VVN employees had been reviewed and approved by the Chairman of the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP). The president and secretariat of the national board of the VVN-BdA resigned in January 1990. The organization then voted to continue the work with reduced means and a new organizational structure.

The absence of funding by the DDR opened the door for non-dogmatic influence; the Union became open to unaffiliated anti-fascists.&lt;ref name="TimPeters2006"/&gt;

===Merging the East and West German organizations===
In October 2002, the West German VVN-BdA in Berlin merged with the East German ''Interessenverband ehemaliger Teilnehmer am antifaschistischen Widerstand, Verfolgter des Naziregimes und Hinterbliebener'' (Interest Group of Former Participants in the Anti-Fascist Resistance, Persecutees of the Nazi Regime, and Survivors) and the ''Bund der Antifaschisten'' (Federation of Anti-Fascists). Following the mergers, the organization's membership was around 9,000.

Representatives of domestic and foreign organizations of former persecutees, as well as guests of German organizations took part in the unification congress. Among them was Horst Schmitthenner, executive board member of [[IG Metall]], who emphatically welcomed the VVN merger and declared, "As in the past, IG Metall will support the vital work of the VVN-BdA."

==VVN today==
The VVN-BdA works to fight racism, [[xenophobia]] and anti-semitism; any discrimination based on national origin, race, sexual orientation or ideology and is against physical or other threats resulting from such discrimination.

The organization has under 9,000 members (as of 2003). Twice a month, it publishes the magazine, ''Antifa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antifa.vvn-bda.de/ Antifa magazine official website]. Retrieved April 21, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honorary president is the late [[Kurt Julius Goldstein]].

===Campaign to ban neo-Nazi party===
&lt;!-- [[File:nonpd.svg|thumb|200px|Campaign to ban neo-Nazi party]] --&gt;
The VVN-BdA initiated a nationwide campaign in early 2007, lasting till that December, that called for a renewed effort to ban the NPD. At the heart of the campaign was a petition calling for the [[Bundestag]] to pass "a new ban against the NPD, according to Article 21, paragraph 2 of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[German]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Constitution". The campaign included informational tables and events throughout Germany and had celebrity support from [[Hannelore Elsner]], [[Frank Werneke]] and the board of [[1. FC Nürnberg]].

At the end of the petition campaign on December 12, 2007, the 175,455 signatures were delivered to Bundestag Vice President [[Petra Pau]], Bundestag members [[Gesine Lötzsch]] and [[Dorothée Menzner]] of the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and [[Niels Annen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. A new campaign to ban the NPD began on January 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npd-verbot-jetzt.de/ ''NPD-Verbot jetzt''] Official website for campaign to ban the NPD, a neo-Nazi party.

===Assessment by German intelligence===
The 2005 [[Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution (Germany)|report]] on [[political extremism]] by Germany's [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] considered the VVN-BdA as "influenced by left-wing extremism". It found that
* the "Members and former members of the DKP and traditionalist members of the Left Party-PDS still hold important positions of leadership";
* "The organisation is thus still predominantly committed to orthodox/communist "anti-fascism", which argues that right-wing extremism is inherently linked to market economy systems and that state institutions in western democracies are thus more likely to support right-wing extremist activity than fight it."
* that in this view, "a socialist/communist dictatorship is the only logical alternative to "fascist" threats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The report acknowledged that the VVN-BdA had, since 1989, stopped describing ultra-left violence and injustice as commendable; nevertheless, Communist crimes were consistently qualified, ignored and even denied.

Later reports on the Protection of the Constitution do not mention the organisation anymore. Some state reports, such as from [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]], do still mention them in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andreas-hoffmann.info/download/verfass.schutzinfo_v._15.02.08.pdf Schreiben des Landesamtes für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Württemberg, February 15, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184043/http://andreas-hoffmann.info/download/verfass.schutzinfo_v._15.02.08.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }} and [http://www.andreas-hoffmann.info/news_detail,288,,2496,detail.html Stellungnahme des MdL Andreas Hoffmann] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184043/http://www.andreas-hoffmann.info/news_detail,288,,2496,detail.html |date=July 21, 2011 }} {{de icon}} NB:The DKP won 104 votes in the 2011 state election in BAden-Würteemberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bavarian intelligence agency regards the VVN-BbA's use of the term "anti-fascism," as meaning not just the fight against right-wing extremism, but also to mean agitation against the democratic state and its institutions. In addition, it claims the fight against right-wing extremism is a pretence under which organization tries to influence the middle class and co-opt democrats for its goals against the democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bavarian Ministry of the Interior]], [http://www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/lfv_internet/service/vsb_2009_20druckfassung_internet.pdf "Report on the Constitution" 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202356/http://www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/lfv_internet/service/vsb_2009_20druckfassung_internet.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }} (PDF) p. 183 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
