[[File:SubtreasuryOfAmericanHumor.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Coward-McCann, Inc|Coward McCann]])]]

'''''A Subtreasury of American Humor''''' is a 1941 anthology edited by [[E. B. White]] and [[Katharine Sergeant Angell White|Katharine White]], of contemporary United States humor writers. Both editors were long-time contributors of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and the collection has been sometimes termed as "the ''New Yorker'' school of American Humor."&lt;ref&gt;Dorson, Richard M. (1942) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/360256 Reviewed] work(s): ''A Subtreasury of American Humor'' by E. B. White; Katherine S. White, in ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (Mar., 1942), pp. 180-183&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Vonnegut]] said in 1976 that "an awful lot" of his work is rooted in this single book.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Vonnegut (1976) interview with Charles Reilly, in ''Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut'' quote: {{quotation|An awful lot of what I do is rooted in one book, which is E.B. White and Katherine White's Subtreasury of American Humor. It's a wonderful anthology, filled with the kind of splendid humor which has made us famous around the world -- you know, Mark Twain, Artemis Ward. There were a lot of funny people around.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the book, the following year [[Morris Bishop]] published ''A Treasury of British Humor''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5iu8AAAAIAAJ The publishers weekly, Volume 142, Issue 1], p.997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All the Young Men''''' is a 1960 [[Korean War]] [[feature film]] starring [[Alan Ladd]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] dealing with [[desegregation in the United States Marine Corps]]. Poitier plays a sergeant unexpectedly placed in command of the survivors of a [[platoon]] in the [[Korean War]]. The film explores the [[Executive Order 9981|racial integration]] of the American military, centering on the [[African-American]] sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939200,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures, Aug. 29, 1960 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When a lieutenant is mortally wounded in a winter ambush that decimates his platoon, he passes command to the highest ranking survivor, Sergeant Towler ([[Sidney Poitier]]). However, with the exception of African-American Towler, all of the men left alive are white. Towler feels Private Kincaid ([[Alan Ladd]]), an ex-sergeant with eleven years experience (demoted for doing things his way), is better suited for command, but the lieutenant orders him to take charge and complete their vital mission: to take and hold a farmhouse strategically positioned in a mountain pass for the advance of their [[battalion]]. After the lieutenant dies, [[White Southerners|Southerner]] Private Bracken ([[Paul Richards (actor)|Paul Richards]]) initially refuses to take orders from Towler, but Towler forces him, at gunpoint, to back down. 

With their radio not working, Towler leads ten healthy survivors and a badly wounded Private Casey on a stretcher to their objective. As they warily approach the farmhouse, one soldier spots someone inside and throws a grenade, which wounds a Korean woman. The only other occupants are her young son and her adult, part-French daughter Maya. Kincaid and some of the others want to leave before the enemy attacks, but Towler keeps them there.

They repel an attack later that night. Hunter, a [[Navajo]], volunteers to scout the area in place of Towler. They agree on a password. Hunter is captured, but despite being hit repeatedly, refuses to say the password when he is forced toward the outpost manned by Towler and Kincaid. After his challenges are not answered, Towler fires, striking Hunter and some enemy soldiers. After the enemy is repelled, Hunter gives the password. Towler and Kincaid find him; he talks to Towler before dying.

Bracken tries to force himself on Maya. Her scream brings Towler, but Bracken ignores Towler's order to leave and strikes him. Towler knocks him down, but Bracken remains defiant.

Lazitech, manning the outpost, is the next casualty. At his own request, Casey is carried to a gunport to fight; he dies in the next assault. Towler and Kincaid start brawling when Towler catches Kincaid slacking off afterward, but they break off when they hear a tank approaching. After driving off the accompanying infantrymen with a machine gun, Towler and Kinkaid use kerosene and torches to set the tank on fire. When a tank man opens the hatch, Kinkaid tosses in a grenade. The tank runs over his leg when he jumps off; Corpsman Wade has to amputate it, but the only man who has the right type blood for a transfusion is Towler. The operation is a success, despite Wade's lack of training.

When a column of tanks is spotted, Towler sends his men and the civilians up the pass, while he goes back and carries Kinkaid to the outpost. Fortunately, friendly aircraft appear and bombard the enemy infantry as they advance, signalling the approach of the battalion.

==Production==
[[Hall Bartlett]] designed a film as a vehicle for [[Sidney Poitier]], based on the integration of the military in the [[Korean War]]. Bartlett came up with the original story with Gene Coon and wrote the script himself. He  aimed to make the film independently, though the exact start date was going to be dependent on Poitier's success in ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pryor|first1=Thomas M.|title=Poitier Will Play Marine in Movie — Signs to Star in 'All the Young Men' — Replacement Sought for Lana Turner|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/10/18/91424647.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=436|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=March 4, 1959|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance on the proviso that Bartlett rewrite the script for a white co-star.  Bartlett found the only major star willing to do the movie was [[Alan Ladd]] who co-produced the film.&lt;ref name="Aram"&gt;pp.180-181 Goudsouzian, Aram '' Sidney Poitier: Man, Actor and Icon'' 2004 UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladd, Poitier to Co-Star in War Movie Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 06 May 1959: b3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could have done it [the film] on a shoestring in some canyon in the Hollywood Hills, but I felt that now is the time for me to prove myself with a picture in the million-plus category. I realized that I could not stay in my ivory tower forever, making nice, small, critically praised films. You don't go very far here if you're not successful when the right time comes.&lt;ref name="hal"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The film features an unusual cast who works well together. In addition to Ladd and Poitier, the cast includes comedian Mort Sahl, who does a comedy routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schumach|first1=Murray|title=U.S. Legionnaires to Hear Red Issue — California Unit Will Take Resolution Criticizing Film Industry to Convention|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/07/89219847.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=36|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 7, 1959|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Darren]] who sings the title song (he was meant to sing three songs in all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ole in Warm Film to James Darren — Actor Will Join the Cast of 'All the Young Men' — 'Powder Keg' Planned|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/19/80586050.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=28|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=June 19, 1959|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and boxer [[Ingemar Johansson]] in his American film debut. Bartlett cast his Argentine wife Ana María Lynch/Ana St. Clair as a French Korean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Writer Liberated Schulberg Claims: Creator Now Follows Through; Bartlett Imports 'Only Girl' |author=Philip K. Scheuer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=5 Oct 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mario Alcalde as an American Indian, Hollywood born [[Paul Richards (actor)|Paul Richards]] as a bigoted Southerner, and local [[Blackfoot]] Indians as North Koreans.&lt;ref name="Aram" /&gt;

"I just play myself," said Johansson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johansson Weeps in Film on Korea — Heavyweight Champion Will Mourn Death of a Buddy in 'All the Young Men'|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/10/12/80556372.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=14|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=October 12, 1959|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All the Young Men'' was filmed in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in Montana and [[Mount Hood]], Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitywalk.com/location/glacier_park_all/movies/1189617&lt;/ref&gt; Poitier's commitment to make the film meant he had to leave the run of ''A Raisin in the Sun'' early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zolotow|first1=Sam|title=Play is Canceled by Michael Ellis — Tryout of 'Intermission' by Ned Armstrong Dropped — Author Brings Charges|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/28/80540613.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=24|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 28, 1959|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia planned two separate advertising campaigns for the film to white and black audiences.&lt;ref&gt; ''Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States'', Gormery, Douglas, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia also used [[Quentin Reynolds]] to promote the film in advertising campaigns.  A [[paperback]] novelisation of the film was written by [[Marvin Albert]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysteryfile.com/GM_Albert/goldmedal_albert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marine Corps provided [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Clement J. Stadler, who had been awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/02_awards/index_nx/index-NXs.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[World War II]] as a [[technical advisor]]; a function he also performed in ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'', ''The Outsider'', ''[[Ambush Bay]]'' and ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' television series. The [[United States Marine Corps]] had disbanded separate black Marine units and bases since 18 November 1949.&lt;ref&gt; ''African-Americans at War:An Encyclopedia'', Sutherland, Jonathan, 2004 ABC-CLIO, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]], critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, "Racial integration in the United States Marines is sluggishly celebrated in a variation on a well-used Western plot in the picture that opened at the Forum yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/27/archives/screen-korean-episode-bias-under-fire-seen-in-all-the-young-men.html |title=Screen: Korean Episode; Bias Under Fire Seen in 'All the Young Men' |author=Bosley Crowther |date=August 27, 1960 |newspaper=The New York Times |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:AOTO circe 2010.JPG|thumb|right| Art of the Olympians museum in Fort Myers, Florida, circa 2010]]

Art of the Olympians was founded in 2006 by Olympic gold medalist discus thrower and artist [[Al Oerter]], who died in 2007.&lt;ref name=ut/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite news|title = Al Oerter, 71; discus thrower won gold medals in four consecutive Games|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/02/local/me-oerter2|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2007-10-02|access-date = 2015-10-14|issn = 0458-3035|first = Diane|last = Pucin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the organization put on a touring exhibition of Art by Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/olympic-greats-exhibit-their-art/ Olympic Greats Exhibit Their Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Art of the Olympians put on an exhibition at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://roaldbradstock.com/images/AOTO/Beijing-2008-2.jpg|title = Beijing 2008|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  AOTO also held a 2008 exhibition at the Rauschenberg Gallery, [[Florida SouthWestern State College|Edison College]] in Fort Myers, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2008 Exhibition Archives {{!}} Bob Rauschenberg Gallery|url = http://www.rauschenberggallery.com/2013/11/2008-exhibition-archives/|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 Art of the Olympians held an exhibition at the [[XXI Olympic Winter Games]] in Vancouver. In 2011, graphic artist and former long jumper [[Bob Beamon]] became the CEO of the Art of the Olympians Museum and Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.leevcb.com/sites/leevcb.com/files/AOTO%20Beamon%20CEO%208%2023%2011.pdf|title = leevcb.com|last = |first = |date = August 23, 2011|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bob Beamon: The Beamon dream|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bob-beamon-the-beamon-dream-7994912.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 London summer Olympics AOTO held two international exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]].

On July 16, 2013, CEO Bob Beamon released an open letter directed to the museum's board announcing his resignation.  On July 17, after 3 and a half years, the Art of the Olympians museum and the Al Oerter Center for Excellence closed its doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Art of the Olympians Museum closed|url = http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22861433/the-art-of-the-olympians-closed#.Vh5uC36rQeN|website = NBC-2.com|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.news-press.com/article/20140223/NEWS0110/302230034/Former-Art-Olympians-building-won-t-anything-anytime-soon&lt;/ref&gt; On the AOTO website they posted an announcement: "It's time to reorganize and restructure the foundation.  A new direction focused on National and International Exhibitions programs will further the vision of the founder." Cathy Oerter, Al Oerter's widow, is currently the CEO of Art of the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Executives|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/executives/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, [[Roald Bradstock]] became the Executive Director of the Al Oerter Foundation (AOF) and Art of the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Executives|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/executives/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And on December 2, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert ll of Monaco]] became the Trustee of the Al Oerter Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Trustee|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/trustees/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Art of the Olympians.

The forms of '''Chinese furniture''' evolved along three distinct lineages which dates back to 1000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, G. "Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings" pp. XV-XXXIII, Dover Publications, Inc., 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  based on ''frame and panel'', ''yoke and rack'' (based on post and rail seen in architecture) and ''bamboo'' construction techniques.  Chinese home [[furniture]] evolved independently of Western furniture into many similar forms including chairs, tables, stools, cupboards, cabinets, beds and sofas.  Until about the 10th century CE the Chinese sat on mats or low platforms using low tables, in typical Asian style, but then gradually moved to using high tables with chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture is mostly in plain polished wood, but from at least the [[Song dynasty]] the most luxurious pieces often used [[lacquer]] to cover the whole or parts of the visible areas.  All the various sub-techniques of [[Lacquerware#Chinese_lacquerware|Chinese lacquerware]] can be found on furniture, and become increasingly affordable down the social scale, and so widely used, from about the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards.  [[carved lacquer]] furniture was at first only affordable by the imperial family or the extremely rich, but by the 19th century was merely very expensive, and mostly found in smaller pieces or as decorated areas on larger ones.  It was especially popular on screens, which were common in China. Lacquer inlaid with [[mother of pearl]] was especially a technique used on furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese furniture is usually light where possible, anticipating Europe by several centuries in this respect.  Practical fittings in metal such as hinges, lock plates, drawer handles and protective plates at edges or feet are used, and often given considerable emphasis, but compared to classic fine European furniture purely decorative metal mounts were rare.  From the [[Qing dynasty]] furniture made for export, mostly to Europe, became a distinct style, generally made in rather different shapes to suit the destination markets and highly decorated in lacquer and other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture for sitting or lying on was very often used with cushions, but textiles and upholstery are not, until very late historical periods, incorporated into the piece itself in the Western manner.  [[Openwork]] in carved wood or other techniques is very typical for practical purposes such as chair-backs, and also for decoration.  The Ming period is regarded as the "golden age" of Chinese furniture, though very few examples of earlier pieces survive. Ming styles have largely set the style for furniture in traditional Chinese style in subsequent periods, though as in other areas of [[Chinese art]], the 18th and 19th centuries saw increasing prosperity used for sometimes excessively elaborated pieces, as wider groups in society were able to imitate court styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
What is now considered the Chinese aesthetic had its origins in [[China]] as far back as 1500–1000 BC. The furniture present in some of the artwork from that early period shows woven mats on elevated floors, sometimes accompanied by arm rests, providing seating accompanied by low tables. In this early period both unadorned and intricately engraved and painted pieces were already developing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese-furniture.com/c_furniture/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  High chairs, usually single ones, had existed as status symbols, effectively [[throne]]s, since at least the [[Eastern Zhou]] period (771–256 BCE), but were not used with tables at the same level.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;    

[[Buddhism]], entering China around AD 200, brought with it the idea of (the Buddha) sitting upon a raised platform instead of simply mats. The platform was adopted as an honorific seat for special guests and dignitaries or officials. Longer versions were then used for reclining as well, which eventually evolved into the bed and daybed. Taller versions evolved into higher tables as well. The folding stool also proliferated similarly, after it was adapted from designs developed by nomadic tribes to the North and West, who used them for both their convenience and light weight in many applications such as mounting horses. Later, woven hourglass-shaped stools evolved; a design still in use today throughout China.

Some of the styles now widely regarded as Chinese began appearing more prominently in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD). It is here that evidence of early versions of the round and yoke back chairs are found, generally used by the elite. By the next two Dynasties (the Northern and Southern [[Song dynasty|Song]]) the use of varying types of furniture, including chairs, benches, and stools was common throughout Chinese society.  Two particular developments were recessed legs and waisted tables. Newer and more complex designs were generally limited to official and higher class use.

It was from this basis that more modern Chinese furniture developed its distinguishing characteristics. Use of thick lacquer finish and detailed engraving and painted decoration as well as pragmatic design elements would continue to flourish. Significant foreign design influence would not be felt until increased contact with the West began in the 19th century, due to efforts on the part of the ruling elite to limit trade.

During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties previous bans on imports were lifted, allowing for larger quantities and varieties of woods to flood in from other parts of Asia. The use of denser wood led to much finer work, including more elaborate joinery.  A Ming [[Chinese lacquerware table|Imperial table entirely covered in carved lacquer]], now in London, is one of the finest survivals of the period.

==Four categories==
Chinese furniture traditionally consisted of four distinct categories, all formed by the mid Qing dynasty, but each with its own unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110119040216/http://web.peopledaily.com.cn/shch/199907/20/newfiles/F108.html Traditional Categories of Chinese furnitures]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Beijing]] category (京式家具): characterized by its simple build, directly developed from Ming Dynasty furnitures.
*[[Guangzhou]] category (广式家具): incorporating western influence, fully formed in the 19th century but dating back to at least 17th century&lt;ref&gt;[https://read01.com/e4kB0.html 廣式家具與嶺南文化]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Characterized by the adoptation of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] artistic styles, use of native timbers in the Lingnan region, and the decorative mounting of marble and the shells of shellfish.
*[[Shanghai]] category (海式家具): characterized by its decrorative carving and carved lacquer.
*[[Suzhou]] category (苏式家具): opposite to the Beijing category, characterized by its elaborate decoration, developed from early Qing Dynasty furnitures.

==Material==
Classic Chinese furniture is typically made of a class of hardwoods, known collectively as "rosewood" (紅木, literally "red wood"). These woods are denser than water, fine grained, and high in oils and resins. These properties make them dimensionally stable, hardwearing, rot and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant. The density and toughness of the wood also allows furniture to be built without the use of glue and nail, but rather constructed from joinery and doweling alone. According to the Chinese industry standards the woods are grouped into eight classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=乡土 |date=2010-09-01 |title=红木宝贝 |publisher=CCTV1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA-l5MXU3fI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=国家标准红木分类 |date=2010-06-20 |publisher=北京秋翁堂古典家具有限公司 |url=http://www.qiuwengtang.com/index.php?_m=mod_article&amp;_a=article_content&amp;_r=_page&amp;article_id=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture and carving made from these woods are typically referred to, in the market, as "hongmu furniture" (紅木家具, literally "rosewood furniture"). Due to [[overlogging]] for the said furniture, most of the species are either [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]].

==Construction==
[[File:Yangminshan Zhongshan Furnishings.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chinese furniture in [[Taipei]]'s [[Zhongshan Building]]]]
Construction of traditional wooden Chinese furniture is based primarily of solid wood pieces connected solely using [[woodworking joints]], and rarely using glue or metallic nails. The reason was that the nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Michael Huntley demystifies the furniture making techniques of Chinese craftsmen prior to 1900 |first=Michael |last=Huntley |date=20 January 2009 |publisher=GMC Publications |journal=Wood Worker's Institute |url=http://s1074.photobucket.com/user/mrconstantinela/media/ttjvj-ujp7f_zpsceo6lbix.jpg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the oily and resinous woods used in Chinese furniture generally do not glue well, even when pre-cleaned with modern industrial solvents.

Platform construction is based on box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods.  While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, different parts of the construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction.  First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets.  Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached to the bottom of the feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way mitered corners.  Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.

The Yoke and Rack construction differs critically in the way that the legs of the piece are joined to the horizontal portion (be it tabletop, seat or cabinet carcass) using a type of wedged mortise-and-tenon joint where the end grain of the leg is visible as a circle in the frame of the tabletop. The cross-pieces (stretchers in the western equivalent) are joined through mortise-and-tenon joinery as well. The legs and stretchers are commonly round rather than square or curvilinear. The simplest pieces are simply four splayed legs attached to a solid top, but more complicated  pieces contain decorative brackets, drawers and metal latches. Cabinets in this style typically have an overhanging top similar to western-style cabinetry.

Bamboo construction style, although historically rooted in pieces made from bamboo, later saw many pieces made from hardwood with patterning to imitate the look of bamboo, or simply in the style of previous pieces made from bamboo. The construction is more similar to the Yoke and Rack style with some apparent crossover.

==Plot==
In a [[voice-over]], Chloe discusses her business as a [[call girl]]. Catherine is a gynecologist and her husband David is a [[college professor]]. Catherine suspects David of having an [[Extramarital affair|affair]] after she sees a cell-phone picture of him with a female student.

Catherine stops by the hotel bar where Chloe waits for clients, telling Chloe that she wants to hire her to test David's loyalty. Chloe later tells Catherine that David asked her if he could kiss her, which he did. Catherine is angered but insists that Chloe meet with David again.

Over the next few days, Catherine and Chloe meet multiple times, and Chloe describes in explicit detail her encounters with David, which [[Sexual arousal|arouses]] Catherine during one meeting; Chloe kisses Catherine, and Catherine, surprised by this, abruptly leaves. Later, when meeting with David at a get-together, she is taken aback by his awareness of the scent of her lotion; it is the same lotion that Chloe wears. Upset by this, Catherine leaves and meets with Chloe at a hotel. The two go into a hotel room, where Catherine starts undressing Chloe before asking Chloe to tell her how David touches her, visibly aroused. Chloe then dominates Catherine and has erotic sex with her.

After having sex with Chloe, Catherine arrives home later than usual, leading David to ask her if she has been unfaithful. Catherine tells him she thinks he has been unfaithful as well, and the two argue, stopping after being interrupted by their son, Michael.

Catherine meets with Chloe and calls off their relationship but later asks her to meet her at a coffee house frequented by David. While there, she demands that David admit that he is having an affair. Chloe walks in, and David does not recognize her. Chloe leaves quickly, and Catherine realizes that Chloe made up her encounters with David.

David admits that he has fantasized about other women, and expects Catherine to make a similar admission with regard to men. When she does not, David becomes agitated. Catherine then confesses her passionate sexual encounter with Chloe. She apologizes, saying that she felt she became invisible to David as she aged, while David became more attractive to her, and that this got in the way of their sex life. The couple reconciles.

Chloe goes to Catherine and David's house and seduces Michael before having sex with him in Catherine's bed. Catherine arrives home, and Chloe tells Catherine that she is in love with her. She threatens to hurt Catherine with her hairpin.

Catherine asks Chloe what she wants. Chloe requests a kiss, and Catherine complies. Michael sees, startling Catherine and causing her to push Chloe into the bedroom window. Chloe manages to grab hold of the frame, but she [[Suicide|intentionally lets go]] and falls to her death. Sometime later, Catherine attends Michael's graduation party and wears Chloe's hairpin in her hair.

==Production==
The film was the first film produced by the director [[Atom Egoyan]] which was not written by himself.

The entire film production time is only 37 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352824/trivia |title=Trivia |publisher=Imdb.com |accessdate=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was financed solely in [[France]]. The film was shot in [[Toronto]] and [[Lake Ontario]]. Some local restaurants and scenic spots appear in the film under actual names, such as [[Allan Gardens]], Cafe Diplomatico, [[The Rivoli]], the [[Windsor Arms Hotel]], the [[Fairmount Royal York|Royal York Hotel]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], the [[CN Tower]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] and the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyclassics.com/chloe/|title=Official website of Chloe|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Jason Reitman]] helped persuade Amanda Seyfried to star in this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seguin |first=Denis |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reports/interviews/the-great-entertainer/5006120.article |title=The great entertainer &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; Screen |publisher=Screendaily.com |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seyfried accepted the role of Chloe after a friend of hers withdrew from consideration due to discomfort with the nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeanne |last=Wolf |title=Amanda Seyfried |work=Parade.com |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2015-07-12 |quote= |url=http://parade.com/40248/jeannewolf/0322-amanda-seyfriend-chloe/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julianne Moore described Seyfried as a "very dependable" acting partner and claimed that they were largely comfortable with the intimacy in the film. In describing her view of Catherine's relationship with Chloe, Moore noted "an emotional quality to their intimacy that has to do with their conversation and their basic receptivity to one another. Now what they turn into personally obviously is very different. They are having completely subjective experiences, but that doesn't mean [they're] not incredibly receptive to one another and it clearly creates something in-between them. And that's what love and sex and intimacy and all that is. Someone who is listening to you, hearing you, there for you, that's the person you end up having a relationship with, sexual or just emotional or whatever. I don't know if that has to do with gender necessarily".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rocco |last=Passafuime |title=Julianne Moore Interview for Chloe |work=thecinemasource.com |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2015-07-12 |quote= |url=http://www.thecinemasource.com/blog/interviews/julianne-moore-interview-for-chloe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liam Neeson]]'s wife, [[Natasha Richardson]], had a skiing accident during filming. Neeson decided to leave the set to take care of his wife, who died from her injury a few days later. The filmmakers re-arranged the shooting schedule accordingly for Neeson's absence.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Just a few days after his wife's death, Neeson returned to the set and filmed the remainder of his scenes in two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CA |url=http://www.journalpioneer.com/index.cfm?sid=246100&amp;sc=121 |title=Director Atom Egoyan praises grieving Liam Neesons professionalism - Entertainment - Arts |publisher=The Journal Pioneer |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian [[indie rock]] band [[Raised by Swans]] has two songs featured in the movie and the band is mentioned several times by Chloe.

[[Anne Fontaine]] (the writer/director of ''[[Nathalie...]]'') said that she was interested in Egoyan's take on it. Fontaine also said that she was not happy with ''Nathalie...'' because the two lead actresses of the film objected to her original intention for a [[lesbian]] relationship to develop between their characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tiff/story/2009/09/14/egoyan-chloe-press-conference.html |title=Egoyan's Chloe a reinvention of sexy French drama |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atom Egoyan]] studied at the University of Toronto, and [[Joe Medjuck]], one of the film's producers, was a teacher of Egoyan at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johnson, Brian|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/odd-couple/ |title= Odd Couple |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behind the scenes==

===Creative process===

After determining the plan for the remake of the film ''[[Nathalie...]]'' directed by [[Anne Fontaine]], the investor [[StudioCanal]] believes that it is necessary to find a reliable screenwriter to write a script for the film because it tells a relatively complicated family and emotional story. Producer [[Ivan Reitman]] locked [[Erin Cressida Wilson]]. This script also took [[Erin Cressida Wilson]] a lot of time and energy to create, and many times she couldn't figure out what real life was and what was the story in the script. When [[Erin Cressida Wilson]] wrote the script, she always thought she was Chloe, and when the script came back to life, she would think she was Catherine again. Waiting for the script to be finished, but this aftereffect is still there. The characters in the play continue to influence [[Erin Cressida Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weinreich, Regina |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/regina-weinreich/erin-cressida-wilsons-sex_b_510853.html |title= Erin Cressida Wilson's Sex Education: Chloe |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making photography===
''Chloe'''s director [[Atom Egoyan]] insists on using [[35 mm film]] to shoot the film. This is undoubtedly a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, but [[Atom Egoyan]] enjoys it. The photographer [[Paul Sarossy]] thinks filming this film is obviously symbolic. In this [[digital age]], choosing to use [[film]] to shoot a movie is more of a feeling of escape from [[digital electronics]]. Although the film eventually uses some [[digital technology]], it is not a digitally produced film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.commeaucinema.com/notes-de-prod/chloe,142407-note-75791 |title=Chloé : Notes de production |publisher=Commeaucinema.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===
The film also took great pains in the art design and [[costume design]]. In the movie, mirrors and glass were used as props for reflection and refraction. The [[costume design]] of the film also pays attention to the concept of mirroring. In order to complement the artwork, costume designer [[Debra Hanson]] specifically uses a layered mirror effect on the costume design. Those repeated laces, laces, structures and decorations are also mirrored images. The effect is the same as showing the heart of a character. In addition, the relationship between clothing and the external environment has also been deliberately taken care of. In the film, Chloe's scene in the greenhouse was decorated with a lot of leaves and patterns on the clothes she wore, which could reflect some of her inner unrest. Similarly, Catherine's clothes are in part echoed by Chloe's clothing, and their relationship in the film is complex and subtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pushing-pixels.org/2011/04/22/the-art-and-design-of-chloe-interview-with-phillip-barker.html |title= The art and design of "Chloe" – interview with Phillip Barker |publisher=Pushing-pixels.org |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing and distribution==
[[StudioCanal]] fully financed ''Chloe'', and StudioCanal were able to fully recoup the film's budget via international [[Film finance|pre-sales]].&lt;ref name="horowitz1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Lisa |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922211832/http://www.thewrap.com/sony-picks-egoyans-chloe-8453/ |title=Sony Picks Up Egoyan's 'Chloe' |publisher=TheWrap.com |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/egoyan-closes-us-deal-for-chloe/article1318927/ |title=Egoyan closes U.S. deal for Chloe |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= 2009-10-09|accessdate=2010-07-26 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the film received award nominations from [[London Film Festival]], [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], and [[Toronto International Film Festival]] under the category of Film Presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/movie/chloe/1430056/awards |title=Chloe (2009) Awards |publisher=Moviefone |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group]] paid a low seven-figure sum to acquire the [[United States]] distribution rights of ''Chloe'',&lt;ref name="horowitz1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009736.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Sony seduced by 'Chloe' - Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the group opened this film in [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on March 26, 2010 through [[Sony Pictures Classics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyclassics.com/chloe/ |title=CHLOE &amp;#124; a film by Atom Egoyan |publisher=Sonyclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this film grossed $3 million theatrically and became one of the higher-grossing [[specialty films]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=chloe.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "$3 million is the new $10 million" for specialty films' box office in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430060632/http://variety.com/article/VR1118018219.html?categoryid=3768&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Specialty pics face reduced expectations | first=Andrew | last=Stewart | date=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the wake of ''Chloe'', Egoyan had since received many scripts of erotic thrillers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100713/100713_chloe_DVD/20100713/ |title=Atom Egoyan sifts through sex thriller scripts in wake of 'Chloe' - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television |publisher=CP24 |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Seyfried's performance in this film also helped her to gain industry acclaim and become considered for more roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barshad |first=Amos |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/03/star_market_can_amanda_seyfrie.html |title=Star Market: Can Amanda Seyfried Live Out a Hollywood Fairy Tale? - Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Chloe'' was released in the United States on July 13, 2010 in both [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The disc includes an [[audio commentary]], making-of featurette, and [[deleted scene]]s.

Several months following the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release of ''Chloe'', Egoyan said that ''Chloe'' had made more money than any of his previous films.&lt;ref name="Pevere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e-TF1"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film opened in 350 theaters to mixed reviews; on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Chloe'' holds a 51% approval rating based on 151 reviews, with a [[Weighted mean|rating average]] of 5.8/10. The site's consensus is that "Despite its promising pedigree and a titillating premise, ''Chloe'' ultimately fails to deliver the heat—or the thrills—expected of a sexual thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10011774-chloe | title=Chloe Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' | accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized score from major reviewers, gave the film a 48 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating "Mixed or average reviews."&lt;ref name="Chloe Reviews, Ratings, Credits"/&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100324/REVIEWS/100329990/1023 Chloe :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Retrieved 2011-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; while Elizabeth Weitzman of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film 1 out of 5 stars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6097">'''Commercialization''' or '''commercialisation '''is the [[business process|process]] of introducing a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Methods of production|production method]] into [[commerce]]—making it available on the [[market (economics)|market]]. The term often [[connotation|connotes]] especially entry into the [[mass market]] (as opposed to entry into earlier [[niche market]]s), but it also includes a move from the [[laboratory]] into (even limited) commerce. Many technologies begin in a [[research and development]] laboratory or in an inventor's workshop and may not be practical for commercial use in their infancy (as [[prototype]]s). The "development" segment of the "[[research and development]]" spectrum requires time and money as [[industrial engineering|systems are engineered]] with a view to making the product or method a paying [[commerce|commercial]] proposition. The product launch of a new product is the final stage of [[new product development]] - at this point [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], and other [[marketing]] efforts encourage commercial [[early adopter|adoption]] of the product or method. Beyond commercialization (in which technologies enter the business world) can lie [[consumerization]] (in which they become [[final good|consumer goods]], as for example when [[computer]]s went from the laboratory to the enterprise and then to the home, pocket, or body).

== Process==
Commercialization is often confused{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} with [[sales]], marketing, or [[business development]]. The commercialization process has three key aspects:
# The funnel.&lt;ref&gt;

In the funnel framework [...] the market/competitor analysis, target customer needs, and technology assessment establish the basis for concept development - the first phase of the process. The next phase is the product/process design, which leads to the product launch and commercialization phase.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential{{cn|date=November 2016}} to look at many ideas to get one or two products or businesses that can be sustained long-term.
# Commercialization is a stage-wise process, and each stage has its own key goals and milestones.
# It is vital to involve key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] early, including [[customers]].

== Issues ==
Proposed commercialization of a product can raise the following questions:

# When to launch: Factors such as potential cannibalization of the sales of a vendor's other products, any requirement for further improvement of the proposed new product, or unfavorable [[economy|market conditions]] may operate to delay a product launch.
# Where to launch: A potential vendor can start marketing in a single location, in one or several [[marketing region | region]]s, or in a [[national market | national]] or [[international market]]. Existing resources (in terms of capital, and operational capacities) and the degree of managerial confidence may strongly influence the proposed launch-mode. Smaller vendors usually launch in attractive cities or regions, while larger [[company | companies]] may enter a national market at once.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;Global roll-outs generally remain the preserve of multinational conglomerates, since they have the necessary size and make use of international distribution systems (e.g., [[Unilever]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]). Other multinationals may use a [[lead country|"lead-country"]] strategy: introducing the new product in one country/region at a time (e.g. [[Colgate-Palmolive]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
# Whom to target: [[market research|Research-]] and [[test marketing | test-marketing]] may identify a [[primary consumer group]]. The ideal primary consumer group should consist of [[innovators]], [[early adopter]]s, heavy users and/or [[Opinion leadership|opinion leader]]s. This will encourage adoption by other buyers in the market during the [[product growth|product-growth]] period.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
# How to launch: Prospective vendors should decide on an [[action plan]]{{cn|date=November 2016}} for introducing a proposed product - a plan shaped by addressing the questions above. The vendor has to develop a viable [[marketing mix|marketing-mix]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and to structure a corresponding marketing-[[budget]].

The '''Creative Industries Federation''' is a national organisation for all the UK's creative industries, cultural education and arts. It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision-making.

Through this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries' position as the fastest growing sector of the UK economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html | date = 26 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Anne | last = McElvoy | newspaper = [[London Evening Standard]] | title = Anne McElvoy: Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/business-issues/creative-industries/|title=Creative industries - CBI|website=www.cbi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently worth £91.8bn in Gross Value Added to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/27-november-3-december-2017/creative-sectors-worth-92bn-uk-economy-government-research-reveals/|title=Creative sectors worth £92bn to UK economy, Government research reveals|last=|first=|date=30 November 2017|work=Design Week|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Federation was the brainchild of [[John Sorrell (designer)|Sir John Sorrell]],&lt;ref name="telegraph-williams"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/11248763/Creative-industries-join-forces-to-lobby-Government.html | date = 23 Nov 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Christopher | last = Williams | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | title = Creative industries join forces to lobby Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-brown"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/01/john-kampfner-creative-industries-federation-austerity-fears-arts | date =  1 January 2015 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Mark | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | title = Head of Creative Industries Federation fears ‘dangerous’ cost of austerity}}&lt;/ref&gt; the designer and UK business ambassador, and a team of creative leaders including [[Peter Bazalgette|Sir Peter Bazalgette]], [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], [[Tim Davie]] of [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Caroline Rush]] of the [[British Fashion Council]], [[Amanda Nevill]] of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Darren Henley]].

The ambition of the Federation was to give political clout to a sector that has been the fastest growing part of the UK economy over the previous decade, but had never punched above its weight with government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html|title=Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?|last=|first=|date=26 November 2014|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations commenced in March 2014, with early development of the organisation led by the Federation's founding CEO, [[John Kampfner]], and originally funded by more than 200 founder supporters prior to the launch of its membership scheme.&lt;ref name="guardian-brown" /&gt;

The Creative Industries Federation was officially launched in November 2014 with an event at [[Central Saint Martins|Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]]. This event was attended by more than 500 people from across the creative industries and featured keynote speeches by [[George Osborne]], [[Martha Lane Fox]] and UK President of Warner Bros, Josh Berger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/2014/11/25/creative-industries-federation-launches-uk/|title=Creative Industries Federation launches in the UK|last=|first=|date=25 November 2014|website=TBI Vision|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation's membership scheme commenced in January 2015.&lt;ref name="broadcastnow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/uk-creative-industries-launch-federation/5080325.article | date = 24 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Andreas | last = Wiseman | publisher = [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] | title = UK creative industries launch federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/uks-first-independent-membership-organisation-for-the-creative-industries-launches/3039448.article | date = 25 November 2014| accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Angus | last = Montgomery | publisher = [[Design Week]] | title = UK’s "first independent membership organisation for the creative industries" launches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year of operation, the Federation forged working relations with the UK government and political parties of all hues, working closely with eight Whitehall departments as well as devolved and city administrations and local authorities. Its work helped secure a better-than-expected settlement for the arts in the November 2015 spending review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/25/arts-council-museums-galleries-relief-funding-settlement-autumn-statement|title=Arts leaders relieved at better-than-expected funding agreement|last=|first=|date=25 November 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Federation's survey prior to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU Referendum]] revealed that 96% of its members backed remaining in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/05/31/creative-industries-federation-members-96-per-cent-against-brexit-eu-referendum/|title=UK creatives reject Brexit, according to poll|last=|first=|date=31 May 2016|website=Dezeen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Federation continued to canvas its members and produce a series of events and reports to help inform UK government policy with regards to Brexit and its potential impact on the creative industries. In February 2017, Creative Industries Federation former CEO, [[John Kampfner]], was invited to present evidence on this issue to a [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] Select Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/impact-of-brexit-16-17/publications/|title=The impact of Brexit on the creative industries, tourism and the digital single market inquiry - publications|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[Peter Bazalgette|Sir Peter Bazalgette]], then chair of Arts Council England, and [[Nicola Mendelsohn]], Vice President EMEA, Facebook.

In March 2017, the Federation announced the appointment of its new chair, [[Richard Haythornthwaite|Rick Haythornthwaite]], who succeeded founding chair [[John Sorrell (designer)|Sir John Sorrell]] in April 2017.

In July 2018, Alan Bishop, former CEO of the Southbank Centre, succeeded John Kampfner as CEO of the Creative Industries Federation.

== Membership ==

'''Cryptomnesia''' occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original. It is a [[memory bias]] whereby a person may falsely recall generating a thought, an idea, a tune, or a joke,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, F..K. (1965).Cryptomnesia and plagiarism. British Journal of Psychiatry, 111, 1111–1118.&lt;/ref&gt; not deliberately engaging in [[plagiarism]] but rather experiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration.

==Early use==

The first documented instance of cryptomnesia occurred in 1874 with the medium [[Stainton Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Righi. (2008). ''Chapter 4: Talking Boards and Ghostly Goo''. In ''Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists''. Llewellyn Publications. {{ISBN|978-0738713632}} "An early example of this occurred in 1874 with he medium William Stanton Moses, who communicated with the spirits of two brothers who had recently died in India. Upon investigation, it was discovered that one week prior to the séance, their obituary had appeared in the newspaper. This was of some importance because Moses's communications with the two spirits contained nothing that wasn't already printed in the newspaper. When the spirits were pressed for further information, they were unable to provide any. Researchers concluded that Moses had seen the obituary, forgotten it, and then resurfaced the memory during the séance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2014). [http://skepdic.com/cryptomn.html "Cryptomnesia"]. ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used by the psychiatrist [[Théodore Flournoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, ''From India to the Planet Mars: A Case of Multiple Personality with Imaginary Languages'' (1901/1994) quoted at www.answers.com/topic/cryptomnesia-psychoanalysis&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the case of medium [[Hélène Smith]] (Catherine-Élise Müller) to suggest the high incidence in psychism of "latent memories on the part of the medium that come out, sometimes greatly disfigured by a subliminal work of imagination or reasoning, as so often happens in our ordinary dreams."

[[Carl Gustav Jung]] treated the subject in his thesis "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena" (1902)&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl Gustav. (1902). On the psychology and pathology of so-called occult phenomena. Coll. works, Vol. 1, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; and in an article, "Cryptomnesia" (1905),&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl Gustav. (1905). Cryptomnesia. Coll. works, Vol. 1, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; United States Bollingen Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the phenomenon in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The idea was studied or mentioned by Géza Dukes, Sándor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Stekel as well as by Sigmund Freud in speaking of the originality of his inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. (1920). ''A note on the prehistory of the technique of analysis'' SE 18: 263-265. (1923) and ''Josef Popper-Lynkeus and the theory of dreams'' SE 19: 259-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
In the first empirical study of cryptomnesia, people in a group took turns generating category examples (e.g., kinds of birds: parrot, canary, etc.). They were later asked to create new exemplars in the same categories that were not previously produced, and also to recall which words they had personally generated. People inadvertently plagiarized about 3–9% of the time either by regenerating another person's thought or falsely recalling someone's thought as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. S., &amp; Murphy, D. R. (1989). Cryptomnesia: Delineating inadvertent plagiarism. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15, 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects have been replicated using other tasks such as word search puzzles&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L., &amp; Bower, G. H. (1993). Eliciting cryptomnesia: Unconscious plagiarism in a puzzle task. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 19, 673–688.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L. &amp; Landau, J. D. (1995). Item availability in cryptomnesia: Assessing its role in two paradigms of unconscious plagiarism. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21, 1568–1582.&lt;/ref&gt; and in brainstorming sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L. Landau, J. D. Hicks, J. L. (1997). Contributions of inadequate source monitoring to unconscious plagiarism during idea generation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 23, 886–897.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has distinguished between two kinds of cryptomnesia, though they are often studied together. The distinction between these two types of plagiarism is in the underlying memory bias responsible—specifically, is it the thought that is forgotten, or the thinker? The first type of bias is one of familiarity. The plagiarizer regenerates an idea that was presented earlier, but believes the idea to be an original creation. The idea that is reproduced could be another's idea, or one's own from a previous time. [[B. F. Skinner]] describes his own experience of self-plagiarism:

{{quote|One of the most disheartening experiences of old age is discovering that a point you just made—so significant, so beautifully expressed—was made by you in something you published long ago.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1983) Intellectual self-management in old age. American Psychologist, 38, 239–244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second type of cryptomnesia results from an error of authorship whereby the ideas of others are remembered as one's own. In this case, the plagiarizer correctly recognizes that the idea is from an earlier time, but falsely remembers having been the origin for the idea (or, having lost the specific memory of encountering it in print or conversation, assumes that it "came to" the plagiarizer as an original idea).
Various terms have been coined to distinguish these two forms of plagiarism&amp;nbsp;— occurrence forgetting vs. source forgetting and generation errors vs. recognition errors. The two types of cryptomnesia appear to be independent: no relationship has been found between error rates&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. S., &amp; Halliday, H. E. (1991). Cryptomnesia and source memory difficulties. American Journal of Psychology, 104, 475–490.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two types are precipitated by different causes.&lt;ref&gt;Bredart, S., Lampinen., J. M., &amp; Defeldre, A. (2003) Phenomenal characteristics of cryptomnesia. Memory, 11, 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Cryptomnesia is more likely to occur when the ability to properly monitor sources is impaired. For example, people are more likely to falsely claim ideas as their own when they were under high cognitive load at the time they first considered the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae, C.N., Bodenhasen, G. V. &amp; Calvini, G. (1999). Contexts of cryptomnesia: May the source be with you. Social Cognition, 17, 273–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Plagiarism increases when people are away from the original source of the idea, and decreases when participants are specifically instructed to pay attention to the origin of their ideas. False claims are also more prevalent for ideas originally suggested by persons of the same sex, presumably because the perceptual similarity of the self to a same-sex person exacerbates source confusion. In other studies it has been found that the timing of the idea is also important: if another person produces an idea immediately before the self produces an idea, the other's idea is more likely to be claimed as one's own, ostensibly because the person is too busy preparing for their own turn to properly monitor source information. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

in ''[[Man and His Symbols]],'' "An author may be writing steadily to a preconceived plan, working out an argument or developing the line of a story, when he suddenly runs off at a tangent. Perhaps a fresh idea has occurred to him, or a different image, or a whole new sub-plot. If you ask him what prompted the digression, he will not be able to tell you. He may not even have noticed the change, though he has now produced material that is entirely fresh and apparently unknown to him before. Yet it can sometimes be shown convincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity to the work of another author&amp;nbsp;— a work that he believes he has never seen."

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s story, "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]," is a meta-fictive enactment of cryptomnesia. This work is written in the form of a review or literary critical piece about (the nonexistent) Pierre Menard. It begins with a brief introduction and a listing of all of Menard's work.

Borges's "review" describes this 20th-century French writer who has made an effort to go further than mere "translation" of Don Quixote, but to immerse himself so thoroughly as to be able to actually "re-create" it, line for line, in the original 16th century Spanish. Thus, "Pierre Menard" is often used to raise questions and discussion about the nature of accurate translation or, in this case, the [[hermeneutics]] of cryptomnesia.

==Cases==

===Nietzsche===
Jung gives the following example in ''[[Man and His Symbols]]''.&lt;ref name="jung_nietzsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shellofman.com/post/8962298822/cryptomnesia-occurs-when-a-forgotten-memory|title=Cryptomnesia|publisher=Shell of Man|accessdate=15 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020741/http://shellofman.com/post/8962298822/cryptomnesia-occurs-when-a-forgotten-memory|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' includes an almost word for word account of an incident also included in a book published about 1835, half a century before Nietzsche wrote. This is considered to be neither purposeful plagiarism nor pure coincidence: Nietzsche's sister confirmed that he had indeed read the original account when he was 11 years old; Nietzsche's youthful intellectual capabilities, his later cognitive degeneration, and his accompanying psychological deterioration (specifically, his increasing [[Delusions of grandeur|grandiosity]] as manifested in his later behavior and writings) together strengthen the likelihood that he happened to commit the passage to memory upon initially reading it and later, after having lost his memory of encountering it, assumed that his own mind had created it.&lt;ref name="nietzsche_on_gender"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oppel|first=Frances|date=2005|title=Nietzsche On Gender|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=0-8139-2320-4|page=204|quote=The book of adventure stories as "source" was discovered by Carl Jung, who describes his find, and his subsequent belief that Nietzsche had "crpytomnesia,"&lt;!--sic?--&gt; the concealed recollection of a textual memory, to his seminar of fellow depth psychologists who gathered once a week between 1934 and 1939 to analyze ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. The piece of text "secretly crept up and reproduced itself" in "Of Great Events" (Z 2). Jung recognized the story about seamen stopping on an island to hunt rabbits, having read it in his grandfather's library. He wrote Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, who confirmed that she and Nietzsche had read the same book in their grandfather's library, when Nietzsche was eleven. This, Jung informed his Zarathustra seminar, "shows how the unconscious layers of the mind work." He added, "the absolute parallel is of course formed by the rabbits" (1218).}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byron===
In some cases, the line between cryptomnesia and [[zeitgeist]] (compare the concept of [[multiple discovery]] in science) may be somewhat hazy. Readers of [[Lord Byron]]'s [[closet drama]] ''[[Manfred]]'' noted a strong resemblance to [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. In a review published in 1820, Goethe wrote, "Byron's tragedy ''Manfred'' was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot enough admire his genius."&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in ''Lord Byron: The Critical Heritage'' by Andrew Rutherford [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2xuKwGa1jYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=goethe+manfred&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-Lb_tHZjqA&amp;sig=Q9KLd8996m_UjfWfOowNM-YTT9M&amp;hl=en#PPA109,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Byron was apparently thankful for the compliment; however, he claimed that he had
never read ''Faustus''.

===Barrie===

[[J. M. Barrie]], the creator of [[Peter Pan]], was aware of the occurrence of cryptomnesia. In ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peter and Wendy|last=Barrie|first=J. M.|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy sews Peter's shadow back on and this makes him very happy but he immediately thinks he has attached the shadow himself:

“How clever I am,” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”

Peter exhibits a number of other clinically accurate peculiarities of memory suggesting that Barrie regarded Peter's behavior as a memory disorder rather than self-centredness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J. M. Barrie|last=Ridley|first=Rosalind|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4438-9107-3|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keller===
[[Helen Keller]] compromised her and her teacher's credibility with an incident of cryptomnesia which was misinterpreted as [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bailey. "[https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2015/02/10/5-great-people-who-plagiarized/ 5 Great People Who Plagiarized]". ''Plagiarism Today'', February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Frost King]]'', which Keller wrote out of buried memories of a fairy tale read to her four years previously, left Keller a nervous wreck, and unable to write fiction for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foer|first=Joshua|title=No one has a photographic memory|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2006/04/kaavya_syndrome.single.html|work=Slate|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stevenson===
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] refers to an incident of cryptomnesia that took place during the writing of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', and that he discovered to his embarrassment several years afterward:

{{quote|...I am now upon a painful chapter. No doubt the parrot once belonged to [[Robinson Crusoe]]. No doubt the skeleton is conveyed from [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]. I think little of these, they are trifles and details; and no man can hope to have a monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds. The stockade, I am told, is from ''[[Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific|Masterman Ready]]''. It may be, I care not a jot. These useful writers had fulfilled the poet's saying: departing, they had left behind them Footprints on the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]], Footprints which perhaps another&amp;nbsp;— and I was the other! It is my debt to [[Washington Irving]] that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther. I chanced to pick up the Tales of a Traveller some years ago with a view to an anthology of prose narrative, and the book flew up and struck me: Billy Bones, his chest, the company in the parlour, the whole inner spirit, and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters&amp;nbsp;— all were there, all were the property of Washington Irving. But I had no guess of it then as I sat writing by the fireside, in what seemed the spring-tides of a somewhat pedestrian inspiration; nor yet day by day, after lunch, as I read aloud my morning's work to the family. It seemed to me original as sin; it seemed to belong to me like my right eye...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/rlstevenson/bl-rlst-wri-5.htm |title=The Art of Writing |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |work=[http://classiclit.about.com/ About.com:Classic Literature] |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===George Harrison===
The precedent in United States [[copyright]] law, since 1976, has been to treat alleged cryptomnesia no differently from deliberate plagiarism. The seminal case is ''Bright Tunes Music v. [[Harrisongs]] Music,''&lt;ref&gt;420 F. Supp. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_brightharrisongs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326082447/http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_brightharrisongs.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the publisher of "[[He's So Fine]]," written and composed by [[Ronnie Mack|Ronald Mack]], demonstrated to the court that [[George Harrison]] borrowed substantial portions of his song "[[My Sweet Lord]]" from "He's So Fine." The Court imposed damages despite a claim that the copying was subconscious. The ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit in ''ABKCO Music v. Harrisongs Music,''&lt;ref&gt;722 F.2d 988, 221 U.S.P.Q. 490, ''available at'' http://digital-law-online.info/cases/221PQ490.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the case ''Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Boys Music v.

===McCullough===

In 1987, Australian author [[Colleen McCullough]] published a novella, ''[[The Ladies of Missalonghi]]''. Critics alleged that she had plagiarised ''[[The Blue Castle]]'', a 1926 novel by [[L. M. Montgomery]]. McCullough acknowledged having read Montgomery's works in her youth, but attributed the similarities to subconscious recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maunder|first1=Patricia|title=Outspoken writer Colleen McCullough praised by all except literary establishment|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/outspoken-writer-colleen-mccullough-praised-by-all-except-literary-establishment-20150130-131wf9.html|accessdate=12 September 2016|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819182640/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/outspoken-writer-colleen-mccullough-praised-by-all-except-literary-establishment-20150130-131wf9.html|archivedate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco===
In ''Interpretation and Overinterpretation'', [[Umberto Eco]] describes the rediscovery of an antique book among his large collection, which was eerily similar to the pivotal object in his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.

{{quote|I had bought that book in my youth, skimmed through it, realized that it was exceptionally soiled, and put it somewhere and forgot it. But by a sort of internal camera I had photographed those pages, and for decades the image of those poisonous leaves lay in the most remote part of my soul, as in a grave, until the moment it emerged again (I do not know for what reason) and I believed I had invented it.&lt;ref name="EcoCollini1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Umberto Eco|authorlink1=Umberto Eco|author2=Stefan Collini |author3=Richard Rorty |author4=Jonathan Culler |author5=Christine Brooke-Rose|title=Interpretation and overinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbhROmD3guQC|accessdate=24 August 2011|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42554-4|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It can be used to refer to a philosophy, methodology or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harlow|first=Megan Jean|date=2013|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-multimedia-encyclopedia-of-women-in-todays-world-2013/n94.xml|pages=430–433|edition=2|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452270388.n94|access-date=2018-07-31|title=The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn=9781452270388|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in the early [[1990s]] to describe the work of feminists interested in theorizing, critiquing, exploring and re-making the Internet, cyberspace and new-media technologies in general. The foundational catalyst for the formation of cyberfeminist thought is attributed to [[Donna Haraway]]'s [[A Cyborg Manifesto|The Cyborg Manifesto]], third wave feminism, post-structuralist feminism, riot grrrl culture and the [[Feminist theory|feminist]] critique of the blatant erasure of women within discussions of technology.

==Definition==
Cyberfeminism is a sort of alliance that wants to defy any sort of boundaries of identity and definition and rather be truly postmodern in its potential for radical openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harlow|first=Megan Jean|date=2013|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-multimedia-encyclopedia-of-women-in-todays-world-2013/n94.xml|pages=430–433|edition=2|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452270388.n94|access-date=2018-07-31|title=The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn=9781452270388|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen with the 1997 Old Boys Network's''100 anti-theses'' which lists the 100 ways "cyberfeminism is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obn.org/inhalt_index.html|title=old boys network|website=obn.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelia Sollfrank from the Old Boys Network states that: 
"Cyberfeminism is a myth. A myth is a story of unidentifiable origin, or of different origins. A myth is based on one central story which is retold over and over in different variations. A [[myth]] denies one history as well as one truth, and implies a search for truth in the spaces, in the differences between the different stories. Speaking about Cyberfeminism as a myth, is not intended to mystify it, it simply indicates that Cyberfeminism only exists in plural."&lt;ref name="constantvzw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/reading_room/writings/html/truth.html|title=The truth about cyberfeminism|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|website=obn.org|publisher=The Old Boys Network}}

[[Mia Consalvo]] defines cyberfeminism as: 
# a label for women—especially young women who might not even want to align with feminism's history—not just to consume new technologies but to actively participate in their making; 
# a critical engagement with new technologies and their entanglement with power structures and systemic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|date=2003|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/newmedia/n57.xml|pages=108–109|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412950657.n57|access-date=2018-07-31|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|isbn=9780761923824|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant cyberfeminist perspective takes a [[utopia]]n view of cyberspace and the Internet as a means of freedom from [[social construct]]s such as [[gender]], sex difference and race. It also sees technology as a means to link the body with machines. [[VNS Matrix]] member, [[Julianne Pierce]] defines cyberfeminism: "In 1991, in a cozy Australian city called Adelaide, four bored girls decided to have some fun with art and French Feminist theory…with homage to [[Donna Haraway]] they began to play around with the idea of cyberfeminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Cyberfeminist International|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|publisher=obn|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Hawthorne and Klein explain the different analyses of cyberfeminism in their book: "Just as there are liberal, socialist, radical and postmodern feminists, so too one finds these positions reflected in the interpretations of cyberfeminism."&lt;ref name="Hawthorn"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hawthorne|first1=Susan|title=Cyberfeminism: connectivity, critique and creativity|page=4|year=1999|postscript=.|editor-last1=Hawthorne|editor-first1=Susan|contribution=Introduction|location=North Melbourne|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=9781875559688|ref=harv|last2=Klein|first2=Renate D.|editor-last2=Klein|editor-first2=Renate D.}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NT5F5DabEc0C&amp;pg=PA4 Preview.]

== Theoretical Background ==
Cyberfeminism arose partly as a reaction to "the pessimism of the 1980s feminist approaches that stressed the inherently masculine nature of techno-science", a counter movement against the 'toys for boys' perception of new Internet technologies. As cyberfeminist artist [[Faith Wilding]] argued: "If feminism is to be adequate to its cyberpotential then it must mutate to keep up with the shifting complexities of social realities and life conditions as they are changed by the profound impact communications technologies and techno science have on all our lives. It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment."

[[Donna Haraway]] is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay "[[A Cyborg Manifesto|A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century]]" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42579667|title=Cybersexualities : a reader on feminist theory, cyborgs, and cyberspace|date=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Wolmark, Jenny.|isbn=978-0748611171|location=Edinburgh|oclc=42579667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others. Haraway states that the cyborg "has no truck with pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."

Cyberfeminism is considered a predecessor to [[networked feminism]].  Cyberfeminism also has a relationship to the field of [[Feminist technoscience|feminist science and technology studies]].

British cultural theorist Sadie Plant chose cyberfeminism to describe her recipe for defining the feminizing influence of technology on western society and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/814233726|title=The most radical gesture : the Situationist International in a postmodern age|last=1964-|first=Plant, Sadie,|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415062213|oclc=814233726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== 1990s ===

The term cyberfeminism first came about in 1992, according to Carolyn Guertin, "at a particular moment in time, 1992, simultaneously at three different points on the globe." In [[Canada]], [[Nancy Paterson (artist)|Nancy Paterson]] wrote an article entitled "Cyberfeminism" for [[EchoNYC]].

In Adelaide, [[Australia]], a four-person collective called [[VNS Matrix]] wrote the Cyberfeminist [[Manifesto]] and used the term to label their radical feminist acts "to insert women, bodily fluids and political consciousness into electronic spaces." That same year, British [[cultural theorist]] [[Sadie Plant]] used the term to describe definition of the feminizing influence of [[technology]] on [[western society]]. Guertin goes on to say that the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in [[Germany]], in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the "100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism" instead. Guertin says that Cyberfeminism is a celebration of [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]].

In 1996, a special volume of ''Women &amp; Performance'' was devoted to sexuality and cyberspace. It was a compendium of essays on cybersex, online stalking, fetal imaging, and going digital in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/9/1?nav=tocList|title=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/9/1?nav=tocList|website=tandfonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===

In 2003 the feminist anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium]]'' was published; it includes the essay "Cyberfeminism: Networking the Net" by [[Amy Richards]] and [[Marianne Schnall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/51854519|title=Sisterhood is forever : the women's anthology for a new millennium|last=1941-|first=Morgan, Robin,|date=2003|publisher=Washington Square Press|isbn=978-0743466271|oclc=51854519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===

Usage of the term cyberfeminism has faded away after the millennium, partly as a result of the dot.com bubble burst that bruised the utopian bent of much of digital culture. [[Radhika Gajjala]] and Yeon Ju Oh's ''Cyberfeminism 2.0'' argues that cyberfeminism in the 21st century has taken many new forms and focuses on the different aspects of women's participation online. They find cyberfeminists in women's blogging networks and their conferences, in women's gaming, in fandom, in social media, in online mothers' groups performing pro-breastfeeding activism, and in online spaces developed and populated by marginal networks of women in non-Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/752472588|title=Cyberfeminism 2.0|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang Pub|others=Gajjala, Radhika, 1960-, Oh, Yeon Ju.|isbn=9781433113598|location=New York|oclc=752472588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist action and activism online is prevalent, especially by women of colour, but has taken on different intersectional terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuntsman|first=Adi|last2=Al-Qasimi|first2=Noor|date=2012-08-15|title=Introduction|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/483264|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=1–13|issn=1558-9579}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.wildmysticwoman.com/] While there are writing on black cyberfeminism which argue that not only is race not absent in our use of the internet, but race is a key component in how we interact with the internet,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniels|first=Jessie|date=2009|title=Rethinking Cyberfeminism(s): Race, Gender, and Embodiment|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=37|issue=1/2|pages=101–124|jstor=27655141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women of colour generally do not associate with cyberfeminism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://osf.io/vnvh9|title=Black Cyberfeminism: Ways Forward for Classification Situations, Intersectionality and Digital Sociology|last=Cottom|first=Tressie McMillan|authorlink=Tressie McMillan Cottom|date=2016-12-07|doi=10.31235/osf.io/vnvh9|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rather re-frame afrofuturism in feminist terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Susana M.|date=2013|title=Black Girls Are from the Future: Afrofuturist Feminism in Octavia E.

[http://xenofeminism.org/ Xenofeminism] is an offshoot of cyberfeminism that came into existence through a collective that calls themselves Laboria Cuboniks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992779765|title=Xenofeminism|last=1983-|first=Hester, Helen,|isbn=9781509520626|location=Cambridge|oclc=992779765|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their manifesto,  ''Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation'', it argues against nature as natural and immutable for a future where all identities are non-binary and in which feminism destabilizes and uses the master's tools for their own rebuilding of life: "Xenofeminism is [[gender]]-abolitionist.  'Gender abolitionism' is shorthand for the ambition to construct a society where traits currently assembled under the rubric of gender, no longer furnish a grid for the asymmetric operation of power.  'Race abolitionism' expands into a similar formula -- that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes.  Ultimately, every emancipatory abolitionism must incline towards the horizon of class abolitionism, since it is in capitalism where we encounter oppression in its transparent, denaturalized form: you're not exploited or oppressed because you are a wage labourer or poor; you are a labourer or poor because you are exploited."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://xenofeminism.org/manifesto|title=Xenofeminist Manifesto - xenofeminism|work=xenofeminism|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in volume of cyberfeminist literature in recent years would suggest that cyberfeminism has somewhat lost momentum as a movement, however, in terms of artists and artworks, not only cyberfeminism is still taking place, but its artistic and theoretical contribution has been of crucial importance to the development of [[posthuman]] aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olszanowski|first=Magdalena|date=2014-04-03|title=Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship|journal=Visual Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=83–95|doi=10.1080/15551393.2014.928154|issn=1555-1393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Many critiques of cyberfeminism have focused on its lack of intersectional focus, its utopian vision of cyberspace, especially cyberstalking and cyber-abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Pamela|date=1996-01|title=On sex, cyberspace, and being stalked|journal=Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=125–149|doi=10.1080/07407709608571254|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; its whiteness and elite community building.

One of the major critiques of cyberfeminism, especially as it was in its heyday in the 1990s, was that it required economic privilege to get online: "By all means let [poor women] have access to the Internet, just as all of us have it—like chocolate cake or AIDS," writes activist Annapurna Mamidipudi. "Just let it not be pushed down their throats as 'empowering.' Otherwise this too will go the way of all imposed technology and achieve the exact opposite of what it purports to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Senft|first=Theresa M.|date=2003|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/newmedia/n105.xml|pages=202–205|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412950657.n105|access-date=2018-08-02|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|isbn=9780761923824|chapter=Gender and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberfeminist artist and thinker [[Faith Wilding]] also critiques its utopian vision for not doing the tough work of technical, theoretical and political education.

== Art &amp; Artists ==
The practice of cyberfeminist art is inextricably intertwined with cyberfeminist theory. The 100 anti-theses make clear that cyberfeminism is not just about theory, while theory is extremely important, cyberfeminism requires participation. As one member of the cyberfeminist collective the Old Boys Network&lt;ref name="OBN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/|title=Home page|website=obn.org|publisher=Old Boys Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes, cyberfeminism is "linked to aesthetic and ironic strategies as intrinsic tools within the growing importance of design and [[aesthetics]] in the new world order of flowing pancapitalism".&lt;ref name="constantvzw.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/reading_room/writings/html/truth.html|title=The truth about cyberfeminism|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|website=obn.org|publisher=The Old Boys Network}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberfeminism also has strong connections with the DIY feminism movement, as noted in the seminal text ''DIY Feminism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DIY feminism|last=Bail|first=Kathy|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1996|isbn=9781864482317|location=St Leonards, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grass roots movement that encourages active participation, especially as a solo practitioner or a small collective.

Around the late nineties several cyberfeminist artists and theorists gained a measure of recognition for their works, including the above-mentioned [[VNS Matrix]] and their Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st century,&lt;ref name="Pierce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Julianne|date=1998|title=info heavy cyber babe|url=http://www.obn.org/obn_pro/downloads/reader1.pdf|journal=First Cyberfeminist International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208064706/http://www.obn.org/obn_pro/downloads/reader1.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Faith Wilding]] and [[Critical Art Ensemble]]. Some of the better-known examples of cyberfeminist work include [[Auriea Harvey &amp; Michaël Samyn|Auriea Harvey]]'s work, [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone,]] [[Linda Dement]]'s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindadement.com/cyberflesh-girlmonster.htm|title=Cyberflesh Girlmonster 1995|last=Dement|first=Linda|website=lindadement.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women's body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes; [[Melinda Rackham]]'s ''Carrier,'' a work of web-based multimedia art that explores the relationship between humans and infectious agents;,&lt;ref name="barnett"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Tully|date=July 2014|title=Monstrous agents: cyberfeminist media and activism|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2014/07/issue5-barnett/|journal=[[Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media &amp; Technology]]|volume=5|postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shu Lea Cheang]]'s 1998 work ''Brandon,'' which was the first Internet based artwork to be commissioned and collected by the Guggenheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/15337|title=Review of ''Brandon'' 1998–99, by Shu Lea Cheang|last=Jones|first=Caitlin|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420091516/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/15337|archive-date=20 April 2016|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work of Cheang's, [[I.K.U.]] (2001), is a sci-fi pornographic film that imagines a cybersexual post-Blade Runner universe, where sexual encounters with feminine, shapeshifting [[Replicant|"replicants"]] are distilled and collected for resale, and ultimately reuse.

==Listserves==
An important part of the generation of cyberfeminist theory and critique was the emergence of a few critical listserves that served as the basis for the organization of three international cyberfeminist events and several major publications.
{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Nettime]] - More broadly situated in new media theory the nettime listserve became a site for the discussion, performance, and arbitration of cyberfeminist theory in 1997.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* FACES - The FACES-l.net mailing list started in the spring of 1997 partly out of a series of concurrent dinner conversations known as the Face Settings Project.  The initial goal of the project was to bring together women working in the intersections of art, media to share their work and to counter the lack of women's work presented at international festivals.  Faces-l was created as a means for the artists, curators, djs, designers, activists, programmers, and technologists meeting at festivals to share their work and discuss gender and media with an international community of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |   title = FACES story | url = http://faces-l.net/en/content/faces-storyhtml.html | accessdate = February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delaware Children's Theatre''' ('''DCT''') is a community theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], United States.  The theatre company occupies the historic '''New Century Club''' building.

==Theatre company==
Originally named the Children's Repertory Theatre of Wilmington, the organization began in 1973 with their first production of ''[[Pinocchio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dechildrenstheatre.org/aboutdct/history.html|title=History
|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Delaware Children's Theatre|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization relies on volunteers for all acting and nearly all support positions as a community theater.  To cover operating expenses, DCT sells tickets and receives state support through the Delaware Division of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdel.org/grants/grantawards2010.pdf|title=Delaware Division of the Arts Grant Awards: FY2010|last=|first=|year=2010|publisher=Delaware Division of the Arts|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Award]] winner [[John Gallagher, Jr.]] initially played Tom Sawyer as a child actor at the theatre before going on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.delawareonline.com/pulpculture/2009/09/29/leaving-the-nest-for-birdie/|title=Leaving the nest for 'Birdie'

==New Century Club==&lt;!--This section is linked from other articles--&gt;
The Theatre occupies the historic New Century Club building. The organization constructed the building in 1893 and occupied it until 1975. The Delaware Dinner Theatre and Delaware Ballet Company then used the building until 1982 when DCT moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83001336}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form|last=Briggs|first=Robert|date=January 1983|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minerva Parker Nichols]] of Philadelphia, an early female architect, designed the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building with [[Palladian window]]s and a [[gambrel]] roof.  While serving partly as a clubhouse, it also held a theatre which was used for traveling shows as well as civic speakers, including future president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and birth control advocate [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2294&amp;dat=19540124&amp;id=tswmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bgIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1366,563399|title=New Century Club Celebrates Sixty-Fifth Anniversary|last=Ruston|first=Muriel|date=1954-01-24|publisher=Wilmington Sunday Star|accessdate=2010-01-31|at=Section 3, Page 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is listed as on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and recognized as being an active place for the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/parkmgmt/upload/Appendix%20E.pdf|title=Properties Associated with the Women’s Rights Movement|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2010-01-31, page 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Century Club was a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] upper class women's group dedicated to social improvement and charity as well as [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ843424&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ843424|title=Women's Clubs as Educative Agencies: Wilmington, Delaware New Century Club, 1889-1920|last=Taggart|first=Robert|year=2006|publisher=American [[History of education|Educational History]] Journal|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable members of the Club included Emily P.

The '''digital dark age''' is a lack of historical information in the digital age as a direct result of outdated file formats, software, or hardware that becomes corrupt, scarce, or inaccessible as technologies evolve and data decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apps.sciencefriday.com/data/reawakening.html|title=Data Reawakening|work=Science Friday|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future generations may find it difficult or impossible to retrieve [[Electronic document|electronic documents]] and [[multimedia]], because they have been recorded in an [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] and obscure [[file format]]. The name derives from the term [[Dark Ages (historiography)|''Dark Ages'']] in the sense that there could be a relative lack of records in the digital age, as documents are transferred to digital formats and original copies are lost. An early mention of the term was at a conference of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) in 1997.[[Digital dark age#cite note-Kuny-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The term was also mentioned in 1998 at the Time and Bits conference,[[Digital dark age#cite note-MacLean-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Digital dark age#cite note-Brand-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] which was co-sponsored by the [[Long Now Foundation]] and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]].

== Proprietary and obsolete file formats ==
The problem is not limited to text documents, but applies equally to photos, video, audio and other kinds of electronic documents.[[Digital dark age#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] One concern leading to the use of the term is that documents are stored on physical [[Digital media|media]] which require special [[Computer hardware|hardware]] in order to be read and that this hardware will not be available in a few decades from the time the document was created. For example, it is already the case that disk drives capable of reading 5¼-inch [[Floppy disk|floppy disks]] are not readily available.[[Digital dark age#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The digital dark age also applies to the problems which arise due to [[Digital preservation#Migration|obsolete file formats]]. In such a case, it is the lack of necessary [[software]] which causes problems when retrieving stored documents. This is especially problematic when [[Proprietary format|proprietary formats]] are used, in which case it might be impossible to write appropriate software to read the file.

== Magnetic tape data storage ==
[[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape data]] storage is a method of storing data on [[magnetic tape]]. It is used as a backup method of storage for [[Digital Storage|digital storage]] and is one way of mitigating a possible digital dark age. For example, in 2011 hundreds of thousands of Google accounts were reset and the data in those accounts went missing. Google was able to restore the data to the email accounts from the data stored on magnetic tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/304135|title=Thousands of Gmail users find emails missing|date=2011-02-28|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic data storage is also used by financial institutions, hospitals, movie studios, and manufacturing companies to backup content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apps.sciencefriday.com/data/ghosts.html|title=Ghosts In The Reels|work=Science Friday|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic tape can hold hundreds of terabytes of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-01-01/scientists-warn-we-may-be-creating-digital-dark-age|title=Scientists warn we may be creating a 'digital dark age'|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archiving the internet ==
The [[Internet Archive]] has stated that one of their goals is to prevent the digital dark age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/about/|title=About the Internet Archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002231304/https://archive.org/about/|archivedate=2 October 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 October 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[Vinton Cerf]], Vice President of Google, showed his concerns about data preservation in the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science: "As the way that we store information about ourselves develops, memories stored in files that use older technology are becoming harder to access. That could mean that historians of the future are unable to learn about our lives". His suggested solution consists of preserving a sample of every piece of software and hardware that has ever existed so that it never becomes obsolete. He proposed taking an X-ray snapshot of the content, the application and the operating system along with a description of the machine. This information should be then stored, instead of in a museum, in servers in the cloud. &lt;ref&gt;Pallab, Ghosh. 2015. [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389 "Google's Vint Cerf warns of 'digital Dark Age'"]. BBC News, Science &amp; Environment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples ==
A famous example is [[NASA]], whose early space records have suffered from a dark age issue more than once. For over a decade, magnetic tapes from the 1976 [[Viking program|Viking]] [[Mars landing]] were unprocessed. When later analyzed, the data was unreadable as it was in an unknown format and the original programmers had either died or left NASA. The images were eventually extracted following many months of puzzling through the data and examining how the recording machines functioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Another example is the [[BBC Domesday Project]] in which a survey of the nation was compiled 900 years after the [[Domesday Book]] was published. While the original Domesday Book is still readable today, there were great fears that the discs of the Domesday Project would become unreadable as software and disk drives capable of reading the format became rarer and rarer. However, in 2002 the [[CAMiLEON]] project [[PC migration|migrated]] the information to a system called DomesEm, allowing it to be accessed on modern computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Encryption and data preservation ==
[[Encryption]] may exacerbate the problem of preserving data, since decoding adds complexity even when the relevant software is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, encrypted data is quite rare, but even the very simple means available throughout history have provided many examples of documents that can only be read with great effort. For example, it took the capacity of a distributed computing project to break the mechanically generated code of a single brief World War II submarine tactical message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern encryption is being used in many more documents and media due to publishers wanting the promised protections of [[Digital rights management|DRM]].

==Open source file formats==
As more records are stored in digital form, there have been several measures to standardize electronic file formats so software to read them is widely available and can be re-implemented on new platforms if necessary.

[[PDF/A]] is an [[open standard]] based on [[Adobe Systems]] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|title = Adobe Acrobat Engineering:PDF Standards|accessdate = 7 July 2013|date = 12 March 2013|publisher = Adobe|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130707172612/http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|archivedate = 7 July 2013|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely adopted by governments and archives around the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing government documents|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents|publisher=Cabinet Office|website=GOV.UK|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OpenDocument|The Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument)]] has been standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in 2005, and by ISO in 2006. Since then, support for OpenDocument has been implemented in [[OpenDocument software|a large number of open source and proprietary software]]. Therefore, using OpenDocument is one option for archiving editable documents from office applications. More broadly, the use of [[open source software]] is a prevention measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cassia |first=Fernando |title=Open Source, the only weapon against 'planned obsolescence' |date=March 28, 2007 |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[source code]] for reading and writing a file format is open, the code can be used as a base for future implementations. In 2007, the chief information officer of the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK's National Archives]] stated "We welcome open-source software because it makes our lives easier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''''' (2001) is a book by investigative journalist [[Eric Schlosser]] that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry.

First serialized by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/fast-food-nation-part-one-the-true-cost-of-americas-diet-19980903|title=Fast-Food Nation Part One: The True Cost of America's Diet|last=Scholsser|first=Eric|publisher=Rolling Stone|year=1998|isbn=|location=Rolling Stone|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to [[Upton Sinclair]]'s classic [[muckraking]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jungle|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|publisher=Doubleday, Jabber, &amp; Company|year=1906|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a 2006 [[Fast Food Nation (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Richard Linklater]].

== About the Author ==
An investigative journalist with a degree in history from Princeton, [[Eric Schlosser]] explores subjects ignored by the mainstream media and tries to give a voice to people at the margins of society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barclayagency.com/site/speaker/eric-schlosser|title=Eric Schlosser {{!}} Steven Barclay Agency|website=www.barclayagency.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/14/food/fo-37251|title=The Hamburger Critic (and His Own Critics)|last=SAGON|first=CANDY|date=March 14, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the harvest with migrant farm workers in California, spent time with meatpacking workers in Texas and Colorado, told the stories of marijuana growers and pornographers and the victims of violent crime, gone on duty with the New York Police Department Bomb Squad, and visited prisons throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His aim is to shed light on worlds that are too often hidden.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has contributed to many journals including ''The New Yorker'' and ''The New York Times''. ''Fast Food Nation'' was his first book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
''Rolling Stone'' asked Schlosser to write an article looking at America through fast food in 1997 after reading his article on migrants in ''Atlantic Monthly''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/523/schlosser-food-finances.html|title=Q &amp; A: Eric Schlosser, author of 'Fast Food Nation,' on the state of the American food system|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The experience enraged and appalled him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Summary==
The book is divided into two sections: "The American Way" and "Meat and Potatoes". "The American Way"  takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while "Meat and Potatoes" examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.

=== "The American Way" ===
The first section of ''Fast Food Nation'' opens with a discussion of [[Carl N. Karcher]] and the [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|McDonald brothers]], examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of [[Ray Kroc]] and [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Ray Kroc#Purchasing McDonald's|complicated relationship]] before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits [[Colorado Springs, CO]] and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/17/where-near-minimum-wage-workers-work-and-how-much-they-make/|title=Where near-minimum-wage workers work, and how much they make|date=November 17, 2014|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Meat and Potatoes" ===
The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser's critique is particularly strong when analyzing the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/01/how-to-make-the-countrys-most-dangerous-job-safer/302395/|title=How to Make the Country's Most Dangerous Job Safer|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly more hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for [[E coli]] to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180312150520.htm|title=Water troughs are key to E. coli contamination in cattle|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/|title=Overweight and obesity|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/|title=Obesity and overweight|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Afterword"===
In the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at ''The Daily Beast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/12/still-a-fast-food-nation-eric-schlosser-reflects-on-10-years-later|title=Still a Fast Food Nation: Eric Schlosser Reflects on 10 Years Later|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|date=March 12, 2012|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young reader version==
An adaptation of ''Fast Food Nation'' for younger readers titled ''[[Chew on This]]'' was published in May 2006 by [[Houghton Mifflin]]. It is co-authored by journalist Charles Wilson

==Reception==

Rob Walker, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', remarks that "Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter"" and that "''Fast Food Nation'' isn't an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Rob|title=No Accounting for Mouthfeel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/21/reviews/010121.21walkert.html|accessdate=February 22, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker however does raise concerns over the data which Schlosser bases his claims from.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, Schlosser cites that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food, however, as Walker points out, "[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn't address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''The Atlantic's'' Julia Livshin believes "Schlosser's book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry's astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation's health, environment, economy, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/interviews/ba2000-12-14.htm|title=Interview - 2000.12.14|website=www.theatlantic.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government's efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair's similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry's various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-395-97789-7|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser, Author  Houghton Mifflin Co $26 (288p) ISBN 978-0-395-97789-7|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industry response ===

Terrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country's major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: "It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser's book, 'Fast Food Nation,' categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"[Schlosser] is trying to paint a picture of 1906 in order to scare people. Unfortunately, fear and graphic stories sell," said Janet Riley, vice president of public affairs for the American Meat Institute, the trade association that represents most of the nation's meat packers and processors. "There is no doubt in our minds that our food today is safer than it's ever been because there is so much more science and technology in our plants to ensure that safety. Our families eat from the same food supply that everyone else does. Of course we want safe food."

Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only "snippets" of Schlosser's book but calls it "well-intentioned criticism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Flag of the Church in Wales''' is the flag used to represent the [[Church in Wales]]. It consists of a blue cross on a white background with a gold [[celtic cross]] in the centre. It was adopted in 1954 by the Governing Body.

== History ==
[[File:Flag of Saint David(early).svg|thumb|left|100px|The unofficial flag between 1920 and 1954]]
Prior to 1920, the [[Anglican Church]] in Wales was a part of the [[Church of England]]. The flag used to represent the church was the [[St George's Cross]], the same as the Church of England. Following the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]], the Church in Wales was disestablished and separated from the Church of England. In the 1930s, the Church of England started to fly [[Flag of England|flags of England]] with the coat of arms of the respective [[diocese]] in the upper left of the flag. This practice became popular and was adopted by the Church in Wales unofficially using a [[flag of St David]] with the colours reversed in place of the St George's Cross.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/flag-church-in-wales.shtml |title=Church in Wales flag |publisher=BBC |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 the Church in Wales' governing body passed a motion for an official flag to represent the church. Following negotiations with the [[College of Arms]], it was decided that the new flag would consist of a blue cross with a white background with a gold celtic cross in the centre.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; The flag gained official status on 9 December 1954.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

== Official heraldry ==
The official grant of arms defines the flag as "Argent, on a Cross Azure a Celtic Cross Or". There have been differences in the celtic cross in the flag with versions where the cross has the spaces within it filled with gold rather than showing the blue of the cross.&lt;ref name=crw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-wa-ch.html |title=Wales: Church in Wales |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a flag for the Welsh made separate from England, the flag of the Church in Wales is viewed as a uniquely Welsh flag.&lt;ref name=fi&gt;{{cite paper|url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |first=Robin |last=Ashburner |title=Flags in Wales |publisher=Flag Institute |page=128 |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churches can use the flag, or the flag of their diocese.&lt;ref name=fi /&gt;

The '''Garrick Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]], located on [[Charing Cross Road]], in the [[City of Westminster]], named after the stage actor [[David Garrick]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Peter. "David Garrick", in Banham, Martin (ed.) ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'', London, Cambridge University Press (1995), pp. 411–412&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1889 with ''The Profligate'', a play by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], and another Pinero play, ''[[The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith]]'', was an early success at the theatre. In its early years, the Garrick appears to have specialised in the performance of [[melodrama]]. The theatre later became associated with comedies, including ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'', which played for four years from 1982 to 1986.

==History==
There was previously another theatre that was sometimes called the [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick]] in London, on Leman Street, opened in 1831 and demolished in 1881.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;Allingham, Philip V. [http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html "Theatres in Victorian London"], The Victorian Web, 29 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The new Garrick Theatre was financed in 1889 by the playwright [[W. S. Gilbert]], the author of over 75 plays, including the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]]s. It was designed by [[Walter Emden]], with [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]] brought in as a consultant to help with the planning on the difficult site after an underground river was discovered in the excavation. Originally the theatre had 800 seats on four levels, but the gallery (top) level has since been closed and the [[seating capacity]] reduced to 656.

The theatre's first manager was Gilbert's friend [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://garrick.official-theatre.co.uk/london/history "Garrick Theatre – Theatre history"], Best of Theatre, accessed 24 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The first play at the theatre, ''The Profligate'', by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and starring Hare, opened on 24 April 1889. [[Sydney Grundy]]'s long-running French-style comedy ''A Pair of Spectacles'' opened here in February 1890. [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] starred five years later in Pinero's ''[[The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith]]''.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt; Afterwards, the theatre suffered a short period of decline until it was leased by [[Arthur Bourchier]] for six years, whose wife, [[Violet Vanbrugh]], starred in a series of successful productions ranging from farce to [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, S. R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36623 "Vanbrugh, Dame Irene (1872–1949)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 7 Jan 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, the theatre hosted [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''The Wedding Guest''. [[Rutland Barrington]] presented several stage works at the Garrick, including his popular "fairy play" called ''Water Babies'' in 1902, based on [[Charles Kingsley]]'s [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|book]], with music by [[Alfred Cellier]], among others. The only piece actually premiered by W. S. Gilbert here was ''[[Harlequin and the Fairy's Dilemma]]'' (retitled ''The Fairy's Dilemma'' after a few days), a "Domestic Pantomime" (1904). In 1921, [[Basil Rathbone]] played Dr. Lawson in ''The Edge o' Beyond'' at the Garrick, and the following year Sir [[Seymour Hicks]] appeared in his own play, ''The Man in Dress Clothes''. In 1925 [[Henry Daniell]] played there as Jack Race in ''Cobra'' and appeared there again as Paul Cortot in ''Marriage by Purchase'' in March 1932.

A proposed redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] by the [[Greater London Council|GLC]] in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby [[Vaudeville Theatre|Vaudeville]], [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]], [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess theatre]]s. An active campaign by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]], and theatre owners under the auspices of the ''Save London Theatres Campaign'' led to the abandonment of the scheme.&lt;ref name=Vaud&gt;[http://www.vaudevilletheatre.org.uk/history.html "Theatre History"], Vaudeville Theatre, accessed 12 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The gold-leaf auditorium was restored in 1986 by the stage designer [[Carl Toms]], and in 1997 the front façade was renovated.

The theatre has mostly been associated with comedies or comedy-dramas. More recent productions are listed below and include ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'' (1982), which played for four years at the theatre before transferring to the [[Duchess Theatre]] in 1986. In 1995, the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s multi-award-winning production of [[J. B. Priestley]]'s ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' opened here, having played successful seasons at the Royal National Theatre's Lyttelton and Olivier theatres as well as the [[Aldwych Theatre]] and a season on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

In 1986, the Garrick was acquired by the [[Moss Empires|Stoll Moss Group]], and in 2000 it became a ''Really Useful Theatre'' when [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s [[Really Useful Group]] and [[Bridgepoint Capital]] purchased Stoll Moss Theatres Ltd. In October 2005, [[Nica Burns]] and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the Garrick Theatre, and it became one of five playhouses operating under their company name of [[Nimax Theatres]] Ltd, alongside the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], [[Apollo Theatre]], [[Vaudeville Theatre]] and [[Duchess Theatre]].

The interior retains many of its original features, and was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=209097 English Heritage listing details], accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gundestrup cauldron''' is a richly decorated [[silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD,&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;Nielsen, S; Andersen, J; Baker, J; Christensen, C; Glastrup, J; et al. (2005). “The Gundestrup cauldron: New scientific and technical investigations”, ''Acta Archaeologica, 76'': 1-58. {{ISSN|0065-101X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"&gt;Jouttijärvi, Arne (2009), “The Gundestrup Cauldron: Metallurgy and Manufacturing Techniques”, ''Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 24'': 960-966. {{ISSN|1042-6914}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;NMD, "The dating and origin of the silver cauldron"; Koch&lt;/ref&gt; This places it within the late [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period or early [[Roman Iron Age]].  The [[cauldron]] is the largest known example of [[European Iron Age]] silver work (diameter: {{convert|69|cm|in|abbr=on}};  height: {{convert|42|cm|in|abbr=on}}). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the [[Aars]] parish of [[Himmerland]], [[Denmark]] ({{coord|56|49|N|9|33|E|}}).&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Timothy (1992), “The Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Scientific American, 266'': 84-89. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"&gt;Olmsted, Garrett S (1979), “The Gundestrup cauldron : its archaeological context, the style and iconography of its portrayed motifs and their narration of a Gaulish version of Táin Bó Cúailnge”, ''Collection Latomus 162'' [Latomus: Bruxelle 1979]. {{ISBN|2-87031-102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now usually on display in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], with replicas at other museums; during 2015-16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called ''The Celts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts/ Exhibition page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112064611/http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts |date=2016-01-12 }}, [[National Museum of Scotland]], 10 Mar - 25 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive.  The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with [[repoussé]] work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver.  Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive [[gilding]] and some use of [[inlay|inlaid]] pieces of glass for the eyes of figures.  Other pieces of fittings were found.  Altogether the weight is just under 9 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; NMD&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the fact that the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of [[Gaul]]ish and [[Thrace|Thracian]] origin in  the workmanship, [[metallurgy]], and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the [[Celts]], though attempts to relate the scenes closely to [[Celtic mythology]] remain controversial.  Other aspects of the [[iconography]] derive from the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD; Green, 45, Sandars, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this.  This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at [[Rynkeby]];&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 252; Megaws, 174-175; Laings, 85, and 68-69 on the even larger, but very fragmentary, Brå cauldron&lt;/ref&gt; however the exceptional [[wetland deposits in Scandinavia]] have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived.  It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for [[Celtic art]],&lt;ref&gt;Green, 84&lt;/ref&gt; though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.

==Discovery==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup6.jpg|thumb|The central medallion of the base plate, from a replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron was discovered by peat cutters in a small peat bog called Rævemose (near the larger [[Borremose]] bog) on 28 May 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1RDghDrVJ&amp;sig=fwnvbv0_tjE5JR3O_T585-CZ5E8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gundestrup%20cauldron&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst themselves over its division.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog at the time of the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt; Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

The cauldron was found in a dismantled state with five long rectangular plates, seven short plates, one round plate (normally termed the "base plate"), and two fragments of tubing stacked inside the curved base.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; It is assumed that there is a missing eighth plate because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

A set of careful full-size replicas have been made. One is in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/kingship-and-sacrifice.aspx National Museum of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; and several are in France, including the [[Musée gallo-romain de Fourvière]] at Lyon and the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musée d'archéologie nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].

==Reconstruction==
Since the cauldron was found in pieces, it had to be reconstructed. The traditional order of the plates was determined by [[Sophus Müller]], the first of many to analyze the cauldron. His logic uses the positions of the trace [[solder]] located at the rim of the bowl. In two cases, a puncture mark penetrating the inner and outer plates also helps to establish the order.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In its final form, the plates are arranged in an alternation of female-male depictions, assuming the missing eighth plate is of a female.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; Not all analysts agree with Müller's ordering, however. Taylor has pointed out that aside from the two cases of puncturing, the order cannot be determined from the solder alignments. His argument is that the plates are not directly adjacent to each other, but are separated by a 2&amp;nbsp;cm gap; thus, the plates in this order cannot be read with certainty as the true narrative, supposing one exists.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

==Metallurgy==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret2.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''A''' with the famous horned figure]]
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup5.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''D''' with bull-slaying, replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron is composed almost entirely of silver, but there is also a substantial amount of gold for the gilding, tin for the solder and glass for the figures' eyes. According to experimental evidence, the materials for the vessel were not added at the same time, so the cauldron can be considered as the work of artisans over a span of several hundred years. The quality of the repairs to the cauldron, of which there are many, is inferior to the original craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Silver was not a common material in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through [[cupellation]] of lead/silver ores.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; By comparing the concentration of [[isotope geochemistry|lead isotopes]] with the silverwork of other cultures, it has been suggested that the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from [[Celt]]ic northern [[France]] and western [[Germany]] in the pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. The lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; Specifically, the circular "base plate" may have originated as a [[phalera (harness)|phalera]], and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

The gold can be sorted into two groups based on purity and separated by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure [[gilding]], which is thicker, can be considered a later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made by mechanical means, which  explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

An examination of lead isotopes similar to the one used on the silver was employed for the tin. All of the samples of tin soldering are consistent in lead-isotope composition with ingots from [[Cornwall]] in western [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The tin used for soldering the plates and bowl together, as well as the glass eyes, is very uniform in its high purity.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

Finally, the glass inlays of the Gundestrup cauldron have been determined through the use of [[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence radiation]] to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Flow of raw material==
[[File:Detail of Gundestrup Cauldron.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior plate '''d''']]
The workflow of the manufacturing process consisted of a few steps that required a great amount of skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high [[repoussé]]; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;

It is generally agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron was the work of multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup4.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''B''', replica]]
The silverworking techniques used in the cauldron are unknown from the Celtic world, but are consistent with the renowned Thracian sheet-silver tradition. The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the shoelaces on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Taylor and Bergquist have postulated that the Celtic tribe known as the [[Scordisci]] commissioned the cauldron from native Thracian silversmiths. According to classical historians, the Cimbri, a Teutonic tribe, went south from the lower Elbe region and attacked the Scordisci in 118 BC. After withstanding several defeats at the hands of the Romans, the Cimbri retreated north, possibly taking with them this cauldron to settle in Himmerland, where the vessel was found.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Nielsen believes that the question of origin is the wrong one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, it is highly unlikely that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Detail 2 from Gundestrupkarret.jpg|thumb|Exterior plate '''f''', with [[torc]]-wearing head]]
[[File:Gundestrupkedlen- 00054 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Detail from interior plate '''A''']]
[[File:Gundestrup C.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''C''']]

===Base plate===
The decorated medallion on the circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword; three dogs are also portrayed, one over the bull's head and another under its hooves.  Presumably all of these figures are in combat; the third dog beneath the bull and near its tail seems to be dead, and is only faintly shown in [[engraving]], and the bull may have been brought down. Below the bull is [[Scroll (art)|scrolling]] ivy that draws from classical Greco-Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 175-176; NMD, "The bullfight"&lt;/ref&gt;  The horns of the bull are missing, but there is a hole right through the head where they were originally fitted; they were perhaps gold.  The head of the bull rises entirely clear of the plate, and the medallion is considered the most accomplished part of the cauldron in technical and artistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 256; Laings, 83; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exterior plates===
Each of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', and '''d''' show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.

*On plate '''a''', the bearded man holds in each hand a much smaller figure by the arm. Each of those two reach upward toward a small boar. Under the feet of the figures (on the shoulders of the larger man) are a dog on the left side and a winged horse on the right side.
*The figure on plate '''b''' holds in each hand a sea-horse or dragon.
*On plate '''c''', a male figure raises his empty fists. On his right shoulder is a man in a "boxing" position, and on his left shoulder, there is a leaping figure with a small horseman underneath.
*Plate '''d''' shows a bearded figure holding a stag by the hind quarters in each hand.
*The female figure on plate '''e''' is flanked by two smaller male busts.
*A female figure holds a bird in her upraised right hand on plate '''f'''.  Her left arm is horizontal, supporting a man and a dog lying on its back. Two birds of prey are situated on either side of her head. Her hair is being plaited by a small woman on the right.
*On plate '''g''', the female figure has her arms crossed. On her right shoulder, a scene of a man fighting a lion is shown. On her left shoulder is a leaping figure similar to the one on plate '''c'''.

===Interior plates===
*Plate '''A''' shows an antlered male figure seated in a central position, often identified as [[Cernunnos]]. In his right hand, he holds a [[torc]], and with his left hand he grips a horned serpent a little below the head. To the left is a stag with antlers that are very similar to the human/divine figure. Surrounding the scene are other canine, feline, and bovine animals, some but not all facing the human, as well as a human riding a dolphin. Between the antlers of the god is an unknown motif, possibly a plant or a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=QSuYDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=replicas+of+the+Gundestrup+cauldron+are+found+in+france+and+ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lEeVG2t0jo&amp;sig=UFd8L8JWX6LejfCJ8QF67NrbA1g&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=replicas%20of%20the%20Gundestrup%20cauldron%20are%20found%20in%20france%20and%20ireland&amp;f=false|title=The Witch's Cauldron: The Craft, Lore &amp; Magick of Ritual Vessels|last=Zakroff|first=Laura Tempest|date=2017-05-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738752525|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On plate '''B''', the large bust of a torc-wearing female is flanked by two six-[[spoke]]d wheels, what seem to be two elephants, and two griffins. A feline or hound is underneath the bust.
*The large bust of a bearded figure holding on to a broken wheel is at the centre of plate '''C'''. A smaller, leaping figure with a [[horned helmet]] is also holding the rim of the wheel. Under the leaping figure is a horned serpent. The group is surrounded by three [[griffin]]s facing left below, and above, two strange animals who look like [[hyena]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Green, 137&lt;/ref&gt; facing right.  The wheel's spokes are rendered asymmetrically, but judging from the lower half, the wheel may have had twelve spokes.
*Plate '''D''' depicts a bull-slaying scene, with the same composition repeated three times across the plate; the only place where such repetition appears on the cauldron.  Three large bulls are arranged in a row, facing right, and each of them is attacked by a man with a sword. A feline and a dog, both running to the left, appear respectively over and below each bull.
*On the lower half of plate '''E''', a line of [[warrior]]s bearing spears and shields march to the left with, bringing up the rear a warrior with no shield, a sword, and a boar-crested helmet. Behind him are three [[carnyx]] players. In front of this group a dog leaps up, perhaps holding them back.  Behind the dog, at the left side of the scene, a figure over twice the size of the others holds a man upside down, apparently with ease, and apparently is about to immerse him in a barrel or cauldron. On the upper half, warriors on horseback with crested helmets and spears ride away to the right, with at the right a horned serpent, fitted in above the tops of the carnyxes, who is perhaps leading them.  The two lines are below and above what appears to be a tree, still in leaf, lying sideways.  This is now most often interpreted as a scene where fallen warriors are dipped into a cauldron to be reborn into their next life, or afterlife.  This can be paralleled in later [[Welsh literature]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD, "The Gundestrup Cauldron - The Cauldron of Fate?"; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, some scholars have interpreted the cauldron's images in terms of the [[Celtic theology|Celtic]] pantheon, and [[Celtic mythology]] as it is presented in much later literature in [[Celtic languages]] from the [[British Isles]].  Others regard the latter interpretations with great suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Much less controversially, there are clear parallels between details of the figures and Iron Age Celtic artefacts excavated by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other details of the iconography clearly derive from the art of the [[ancient Near East]], and there are intriguing parallels with ancient India and later [[Hindu]] deities and their stories. Scholars are mostly content to regard the former as motifs borrowed purely for their visual appeal, without carrying over anything much of their original meaning, but despite the distance some have attempted to relate the latter to wider traditions remaining from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].

===Celtic archaeology===
Among the most specific details that are clearly Celtic are the group of [[carnyx]] players.  The carnyx war horn was known from Roman descriptions of the Celts in battle and [[Trajan's Column]], and a few pieces are known from archaeology, their number greatly increased by finds at [[Tintignac]] in France in 2004. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote around 60-30 BC (Histories, 5.30):
:''"Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war''"

Another detail that is easily matched to archaeology is the [[torc]] worn by several figures, clearly of the "buffer" type, a fairly common Celtic artefact found in Western Europe, most often France, from the period the cauldron is thought to have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Green, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other details with more tentative Celtic links are the long swords carried by some figures, and the horned and antlered helmets or head-dresses and the [[boar]] crest worn on their helmet by some warriors.  These can be related to Celtic artefacts such as a helmet with a [[raptor (bird)|raptor]] crest from [[Romania]], the [[Waterloo Helmet]], [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] and various animal figures including boars, of uncertain function.  The shield bosses, spurs and horse harness also relate to Celtic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-177, 160-163; Green, 100-103&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gallo-Roman]] figure of [[Taranis]]/[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] with his wheel and thunderbolt, and carrying torcs]]
The antlered figure in plate '''A''' has been commonly identified as [[Cernunnos]], who is named (the only source for the name) on the 1st-century [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs hanging from his antlers.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 78, 135, 137, 147-148, 151&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is.  Otherwise there is evidence of a [[horned god]] from several cultures. 

The figure holding the broken wheel in plate '''C''' is more tentatively thought to be [[Taranis]], the solar or thunder "wheel-god" named by [[Lucian]] and represented in a number of Iron Age images; there are also many wheels that seem to have been [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 147-149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near East and Asia===
The many animals depicted on the cauldron include [[elephant]]s, a [[dolphin]], [[leopard]]-like felines, and various fantastic animals, as well as animals that are widespread across [[Eurasia]], such as snakes, cattle, deer, boars and birds. [[Celtic art]] often includes animals, but not often in fantastic forms with wings and aspects of different animals combined.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 160-163&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions to this, some when motifs are clearly borrowed, as the boy riding a dolphin is borrowed from Greek art, and others that are more native, like the ram-headed horned snake who appears three times on the cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 135-139&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of [[Thrace]] often shows animals, most often powerful and fierce ones, many of which are also very common in the ancient Near East, or the [[Scythian art]] of the [[Eurasian steppe]], whose mobile owners provided a route for the very rapid transmission of motifs and objects between the civilizations of Asia and Europe.

In particular, the two figures standing in profile flanking the large head on exterior plate F, each with a bird with outstretched wings just above their head clearly resemble a common motif in ancient [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian art]], down to the long garments they wear.  Here the figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show [[griffin]]s borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East.  On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in the centre of the exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common [[Master of Animals]] motif, or held up empty at the side of the head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.

===Celtic mythology===
Apart from Cernunnos and Taranis, discussed above, there is no consensus regarding the other figures, and many scholars reject attempts to tie them in to figures known from much later and geographically distant sources. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate '''B''' as a reference to [[Hannibal#Overland journey to Italy|Hannibal's crossing of the Alps]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; 

Because of the double-headed wolfish monster attacking the two small figures of fallen men on plate '''b''', parallels can be drawn to the Welsh character [[Manawydan]] or the Irish [[Manannán]], a god of the sea and the Otherworld. Another possibility is the Gaulish version of [[Apollo]], who was not only a warrior, but one associated with springs and healing besides.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Olmsted relates the scenes of the cauldron to those of the [[Táin Bó Cuailnge]], where the antlered figure is [[Cú Chulainn]], the bull of the base plate is [[Donn Cuailnge]], and the female and two males of plate '''e''' are [[Medb]], [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]], and [[Fergus mac Róich]].  Olmsted also toys with the idea that the female figure flanked by two birds on plate '''f''' could be Medb with her pets or [[Morrígan]], the Irish war goddess who often changes into a carrion bird.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Both Olmsted and Taylor agree that the female of plate '''f''' might be [[Rhiannon]] of the [[Mabinogion]]. Rhiannon is famous for her birds, whose songs could "awaken the dead and lull the living to sleep". In this role, Rhiannon could be considered the Goddess of the Otherworld.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Taylor presents a more pancultural view of the cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate '''f''', with [[Hariti]], an ogress of [[Bactria]]n mythology. In addition, he points to the similarity between the female figure of plate '''B''' and the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Lakshmi]], whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and [[Vishnu]], a god from Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

[[Hinduism]] includes a range of viewpoints about the [[origin of life]], [[creationism]] and [[evolution]]. There is no single story of creation, due to dynamic diversity of Hinduism, and these are derived from various sources like [[Vedas]], some from the [[Brahmana]]s, some from [[Puranas]]; some are philosophical, based on concepts, and others are narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyo.in/variety/hindusim-world-creation-universe-brahma-vishu-shiva/story/1/19522.html|title=How did the world come into being according to Hinduism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda]] mentions the ''[[Hiranyagarbha]]'' ("golden embryo") as the source of the creation of the Universe, similar to the [[world egg]] motif found in the [[creation myth]]s of many other civilizations. It also contains a myth of  [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origin, in which the creation arises out of the [[dismemberment]] of a cosmic being (the [[Purusha]]) who is sacrificed by the gods.&lt;ref name="Jan2007"/&gt; As for the creation of the primordial gods themselves, the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of Rigveda takes a near-[[agnostic]] stand, stating that the Gods came into being after the world's creation, and nobody knows when the world first came into being.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Ralph T.H. (Transl.): [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10129.htm Rigveda Hymn CXXIX. Creation] in Hymns of the Rgveda, Vol. II, 1889-92. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the later [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts, the creator god [[Brahma]] is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe'. Some texts consider him equivalent to the Hiranyagarbha or the Purusha, while others state that he arose out of these. Brahma is a part of the [[trimurti|trinity]] of gods that also includes [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], who are responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively. 

Many Hindu texts mention the [[Hindu cosmology|cycle of creation and destruction]]. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] states that the current human generation descends from [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the only man who survived a [[flood myth|great deluge]] after being warned by the God. This legend is comparable to the other [[List of flood myths|flood legends]], such as the story of the [[Noah's Ark]] mentioned in the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="Sunil1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sunil Sehgal | title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism: C-G | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWG64bgtf3sC&amp;pg=PA401 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | year=1999 | publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons | isbn=978-81-7625-064-1 | page=401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

In a survey of 909 people, 77% of its respondents in India agreed that enough scientific evidence exists to support [[Darwinism|Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution]], and 85% of God-believing people said they agree with evolution as well.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885|title=Opinions on evolution from ten countries - NCSE|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2100585.ece | title = One in seven Britons believe in creationism over evolution | location=London | work=The Times | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survey conducted by [[Pew Forum]] in the [[United States]], 80% of Hindus agree that evolution is the best explanation for the origin of human life on earth.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;[http://pewforum.org/Science-and-Bioethics/Religious-Differences-on-the-Question-of-Evolution.aspx Religious Groups: Opinions of Evolution], [[Pew Forum]] (conducted in 2007, released in 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in India, there were minimal references to Darwinism in the 1800s. Elements of Victorian England opposed the idea of Darwinism. Hindus already had present notion of common ancestry between humans and animals. The Hindu dharma believes that the gods have animal features, showing a theory that humans can be reborn again as animals or with their features.&lt;ref name="Gosling 345–347-348–353"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: Does What Goes Around Come Around?|journal=Zygon|date=June 2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–347–348–353|url=http://authenticate.library.duq.edu/login?url=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3drfh%26AN%3dATLA0001843790%26site%3dehost-live|accessdate=2014-01-24|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hindu creationism ==

According to [[Hindu]] [[creationism]] all [[species]] on earth including [[humans]] have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]]. Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;Science &amp; Religion: A New Introduction, Alister E. McGrath, 2009, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;The creationists: from scientific creationism to intelligent design, Ronald L. Numbers, 2006, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of [[old earth creationism]]. According to Hindu creationists the [[universe]] may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]] which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the [[earth]].&lt;ref&gt;James C. Carper, Thomas C. Hunt, The Praeger Handbook of Religion and Education in the United States: A-L, 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1, Surendranath Dasgupta, 1992, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation myths ===

Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alone in Unity: Torments of an Iraqi God-Seeker in North America | first=Faris | last=Georgis | publisher=Dorrance Publishing | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFZrxLjtiI8C&amp;pg=PA62 | page=62 | isbn=1-4349-0951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Hindu texts]] do not provide a single canonical account of the creation; they mention a range of theories of the creation of the world, some of which are contradictory.&lt;ref name="Robert1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert M.

==== Rigveda ====

The [[Purusha Sukta]] of the earliest Hindu text [[Rigveda]] mentions [[Purusha]], primeval cosmic being.&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=S. N. Sadasivan | title=A Social History Of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be3PCvzf-BYC&amp;pg=PA227 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2000 | publisher=APH Publishing | isbn=978-81-7648-170-0 | pages=226–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purusha is described as all that has ever existed and will ever exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10090.htm|title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda, Book 10: HYMN XC. Puruṣa.|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This being's body was the origin of four different kinds of people: the [[Brahmin]], the [[Kshatriya|Rajanya]], the [[Vaishya]], and the [[Shudra]].&lt;ref name=Tignor2014&gt;"Worlds Together Worlds Apart", Fourth Edition, Beginnings Through the 15th century, Tignor, 2014, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Viraj, variously interpreted as the [[world egg|mundane egg]]&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"/&gt; (see [[Hiranyagarbha]]) or the twofold male-female energy, was born from Purusha, and the Purusha was born again from Viraj. The gods then performed a [[yajna]] with the Purusha, leading to the creation of the other things in the manifested world from his various body parts and his mind. These things included the animals, the Vedas, the [[Varna]]s, the celestial bodies, the air, the sky, the heavens, the earth, the directions, and the Gods [[Indra]] and [[Agni]]. It is likely that this myth has [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origins, as it is similar to other myths found in the Indo-European cultures, in which the creation arises out of the dismemberment of a divine being (cf. [[Ymir]] of the [[Norse mythology]]).&lt;ref name="Jan2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jan N.

The concept of Purusha is similar to the concept of [[Brahman]] described in the later texts.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"&gt;{{cite book | author=Roshen Dalal | title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA318 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=5 October 2011 | publisher=Penguin Books India | isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 | pages=318–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318}} As for the creation of the primordial beings (such as the gods who performed the sacrifice of the Purusha), the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] states:&lt;ref name="McNamaraWildman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick McNamara|author2=Wesley J.

|Rig Veda 10.129.1-7
}}

Rigveda (10.121) also mentions the [[Hiranyagarbha]] (literally, golden embryo/womb/[[world egg|egg]]) that existed before the creation. This metaphor has been interpreted differently by the various later texts. The [[Samkhya]] texts state that Purusha and the [[Prakṛti|Prakriti]] made the embryo, from which the world emerged. In another tradition, the creator god [[Brahma]] emerged from the egg and created the world, while in yet another tradition the Brahma himself is the Hiranyagarbha.&lt;ref name="Edward2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Edward Quinn | title=Critical Companion to George Orwell | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZET2sSUVsgC&amp;pg=PA188 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2009 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | isbn=978-1-4381-0873-5 | page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the Purusha, the creation of the gods and other details of the embryo creation myth have been described variously by the later Hindu texts.

The early hymns of Rigveda also mention [[Tvastar]] as the first born creator of the human world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/594460?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101565303097 The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda]" by W. Norman Brown. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 62, No. 2 (Jun., 1942), pp. 85-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting the creation of gods, the Rig Veda does seem to affirm ‘’creatio ex nihilo’’. Rig Veda 10.72 states:
{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
देवानां नु वयं जाना पर वोचाम विपन्यया |

1. LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods,
That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.
2 These Brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith,
Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
3 Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 10.72 translation by R.T.H. Griffith (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] mentions a story of creation, in which the [[Prajapati]] performs [[tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] to reproduce himself. He releases the waters and enters them in the form of an egg that evolves into [[Brahmanda|the cosmos]].&lt;ref name="WhitePollak2010"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Merry I.

With further tapas, he created the devas. He also created the [[asura]]s, and the darkness came into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} It also contains a story similar to the other [[List of flood myths|great flood stories]]. After the great flood, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] the only surviving human, offers a sacrifice from which Ida is born. From her, the existing human race comes into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

==== Upanishads ====

The [[Aitareya Upanishad]] (3.4.1) mentions that only the "[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]" (the Self) existed in the beginning. The Self created the heaven (''Ambhas''), the sky (''Marikis''), the earth (''Mara'') and the underworld (''Ap''). He then formed the Purusha from the water. He also created the speech, the fire, the prana (breath of life), the air and the various senses, the directions, the trees, the mind, the moon and other things.&lt;ref name="MaxMuller2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=F. Max Muller | title=The Upanishads, Vol I | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6VFU0jK7UC&amp;pg=PA228 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=30 June 2004 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4191-8641-7 | pages=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (1.4) mentions that in the beginning, only the Atman existed as the Purusha. Feeling lonely, the Purusha divided itself into two parts: male ("pati") and female ("patni"). The men were born when the male embraced the female. The female thought "how can he embrace me, after having produced me from himself? I shall hide myself." She then became a cow to hide herself, but the male became a bull and embraced her. Thus the cows were born. Similarly, everything that exists in pairs, was created. Next, the Purusha created the fire, the [[soma (drink)|soma]] and the immortal gods (the [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]]) from his better part. He also created the various powers of the gods, the different [[varna in Hinduism|classes]], the [[dharma]] (law or duty) and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15055.htm Fourth Brâhmana] in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Fourth Brahmana. Translated by Max Müller as The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15) [1879].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] states that the being (''sat'') was created from the non-being. The Being later became the ''Atman'' (2.7.1), and then created the worlds (1.1.1).&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} The [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] states that the Brahma creates, sustains and destroys the world.&lt;ref name="ANPrasad2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=S.K.

==== Later texts ====
[[File:An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati.jpg|thumb|350px|left|An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati; a steel engraving from the 1850s]]
Belief in evolution is among the [[Samkhya]] philosophy. In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, evolution is symbolized by the Sanskrit term parinama. Many Hindu reformers compare this term and philosophy with Darwinism. The prominent Vivekananda, based most of his cosmological and biological ideas off of the [[Samkhya]].&lt;ref name="Gosling 345–347-348–353"/&gt;  The [[Samkhya]] texts state that there are two distinct fundamental eternal entities: the Purusha and the [[Prakriti]]. The Prakriti has three [[guṇa|qualities]]: ''[[sattva]]'' (purity or preservation), ''[[rajas]]'' (creation) and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'' (darkness or destruction). When the equilibrium between these qualities gets broken, the act of creation starts. ''Rajas'' quality leads to creation.&lt;ref name="Joshi2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dinkar Joshi | title=Glimpses Of Indian Culture | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fw-0iBvmMAC&amp;pg=PA32 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2005 | publisher=Star Publications | isbn=978-81-7650-190-3 | page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later texts such as the [[Puranas]] identify the Purusha with the [[God in Hinduism|God]]. In many Puranic notes, [[Brahma]] is the creator god.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} However, some Puranas also identify Vishnu, Shiva or Devi as the creator.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

In [[Garuda Purana]], there was nothing in the universe except the [[Brahman]]. The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his hair, sheep from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from feet). His body hair became the herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind, Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa. Kashypata married thirrteen of Daksha's daughter and all the devas and the createures were born through them.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} Other Puranas and the Manu Smriti mention several variations of this theory.

In [[Vishnu Purana]], the Purusha is same as the creator deity [[Brahma]], and is a part of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}} The [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] texts mention the Hiranyagarbha as a creation of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Edward2009"/&gt; According to the [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]] Purusha and Prakriti emerged together and formed the [[Brahman]], the supreme universal spirit that is the origin and support of the universe.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}}

The Advaita Vedanta states that the creation arises from Brahman, but it is illusory and has no reality. (Vivarta)&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{realmente p|103}}

===Hindu cosmological view===

Many Hindu philosophies mention that the [[Hindu cycle of the universe|creation is cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|104}} According to the [[Upanishad]]s, the universe and the Earth, along with humans and other creatures, undergo repeated cycles (''[[pralaya]]'') of creation and destruction. A variety of myths exist regarding the specifics of the process, but in general the Hindu view of the cosmos is as eternal and cyclic. The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. In Hindu cosmology, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 years (one [[day of Brahma]], the creator or ''kalpa'')&lt;ref&gt;A survey of Hinduism, [[Klaus K. Klostermaier]], 2007, pp. 495-496&lt;/ref&gt; and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day. This process, called ''pralaya'' (cataclysm), repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion, 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.

== Modern Interpretations of Scriptural archetypes ==

Most Hindus accept the theory of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; They either regard the scriptural creation theories as allegories and metaphors, or reconcile these legends with the modern theory of evolution.

===Dashavatara===
{{main|Dashavatara#Evolutionary interpretation}}

The order of the [[Dashavatara]] (ten principal [[avatar]]s of the god [[Vishnu]]) is interpreted to convey Darwin's evolution.&lt;ref name="Chandra1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suresh Chandra|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|year=1998|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-039-9|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishna2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nanditha Krishna|title=Sacred Animals of India|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306619-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] opined that they are a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of evolution. Like the evolutionary process itself, the first avatar of God is a fish - [[Matsya]], then comes the aquatic reptile turtle, [[Kurma]], then a mammal - the boar [[Varaha]], then [[Narasimha]], a man-lion being, [[Vamana]], the dwarf then the rest four are humans; Kalki is not yet born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cover Story: Haldane: Life Of A Prodigious Mind | journal=[[Science Reporter]] | year=1992 | volume=29 | pages=46 |publisher=Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various thinkers and authors like [[Helena Blavatsky]],  [[Monier Monier-Williams]], [[Nabinchandra Sen]], [[C. D. Deshmukh]] have associated the Dashavatara with evolution.

===Vanara===
[[File:Building of Rama's Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Hindu epics mention an ape-like humanoid species called the [[vanara]]s.]]

The [[Sanskrit]] epics of the Hindus mention several [[exotic tribes of ancient India|exotic creatures]] including ape-like humanoids.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Trikha, A study of the Ramayana of Valmiki, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindus see this as a proof of the historicity of their mythological characters and as support for the theory of evolution in their texts. The [[Ramayana]] speaks of the [[Vanaras]], an ape-like species with human intelligence, that existed millions of years ago. According to the Ramayana alongside these [[ape-men]] existed [[modern humans]]. Thus, according to these ancient writings, the status of such creatures was a state of coexistence rather than evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tribute to Hinduism: Thoughts and Wisdom Spanning Continents and Time about India and Her Culture|page=386|first=Sushama|last=Londhe|year=2008|quote= For example, the Ramayana speaks of the Vanaras, a species of apelike men that existed millions of years ago.|publisher=Pragun Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21694">An '''Internet leak''' occurs when a party's [[confidentiality|confidential]] information is released to the public on the [[Internet]]. Various types of information and data can be, and have been, "leaked" to the Internet, the most common being personal information, computer [[software]] and [[source code]], and artistic works such as books or [[album]]s. For example, a musical album is leaked if it has been made available to the public on the Internet before its official release date; and is still intended to be confidential.

== Source code leaks ==
'''[[Source code]] leaks''' are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] which allow people to get source files by exploiting, by software [[computer bug|bugs]], or by employees that have access to the sources of part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company.

There were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development.

For instance, as [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer IIS]] released in 1994 only a low quality version of their [[MP3]] encoding software ([[l3enc]]), a hacker named SoloH gathered the [[source code]] from the unprotected servers of the [[University of Erlangen]] and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/09/the-heavenly-jukebox/305141/ The heavenly jukebox] on [[The Atlantic]] ''"To show industries how to use the codec, MPEG cobbled together a free sample program that converted music into MP3 files. The demonstration software created poor-quality sound, and Fraunhofer did not intend that it be used. The software's "source code"—its underlying instructions—was stored on an easily accessible computer at the University of Erlangen, from which it was downloaded by one SoloH, a hacker in the Netherlands (and, one assumes, a Star Wars fan). SoloH revamped the source code to produce software that converted compact-disc tracks into music files of acceptable quality."'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=3M2hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;dq=SoloH+mp3+source+code&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FlIeulG_zi&amp;sig=VKYpKgUjOXqOk_aBEH5Kfi3WKk4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8la2n46TRAhUMe1AKHT7fBb4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=SoloH%20mp3%20source%20code&amp;f=false Pop Idols and Pirates: Mechanisms of Consumption and the Global Circulation ...] by Dr Charles Fairchild&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1765/989 Technologies of Piracy? - Exploring the Interplay  Between Commercialism and Idealism in the Development of MP3 and DivX] by HENDRIK STORSTEIN SPILKER, SVEIN HÖIER, page 2072, [[International Journal of Communication]] 7 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc/ euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1996 [[Electronic Arts]] accidentally put  the source code of [[FIFA 97]] on a demo disc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotaku.com/5882488/when-ea-sports-accidentally-put-a-games-source-code-on-a-demo-disc When EA Sports Accidentally Put a Game's Source Code on a Demo Disc] by Luke Plunkett on [[kotaku.com]] (02-05-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a [[software hacking|hacker]] exploited a security hole in [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Microsoft Office Outlook|Outlook]] to get the complete source of the video game ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', which was under development at the time.&lt;ref name="source code leak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/10/07/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ |title=Playable Version of Half-Life 2 Stolen |work=CNN Money |accessdate=February 14, 2007 | date=2003-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-21-the-boy-who-stole-half-life-2-article |title=The Boy Who Stole Half-Life 2 - The story behind the $250 million robbery. |first=Simon |last=Parkin |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |publisher=eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete source was soon available in various [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|file sharing network]]s.  This leak was rumored to be the cause of the game's delay,&lt;ref name="leak delays release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31783.html |title=Half Life 2 Source-Code Leak Delays Debut |work=TechNewsWorld |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later was stated not to be.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/ Catching up with the guy who stole Half-Life 2’s source code, 10 years later] by Simon Parkin on [[Ars Technica]] (Jun 19, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, source code to [[Diebold Election Systems]] Inc. [[voting machine]]s was leaked. Researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Rice University]] published a damning critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth.

In 2003 a Chinese Hacker acquired the [[Lineage II]] source code, and sold it to someone who set up alternative servers. Shutdown by [[FBI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmorpg.com/lineage-2/news/fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server-1000007104 fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server] on mmorpg.com (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212021338/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/feb07/iptheft020107.htm CRACKING THE CODE Online IP Theft Is Not a Game] on FBI.gov (02/01/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, one year after [[3dfx]] was bought by [[Nvidia]] and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/0305/25378.html Treiber-Quellcode von 3dfx im Netz aufgetaucht - Von Nvidia offenbar geduldet] by Christian Klaß on Golem.de (7 May 2003, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[fan-made]], updated drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuangel.net/NuDrivers/ NuAngel.net Drivers] on nuangel.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a large portion of [[Windows NT 4.0]]'s source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of [[Windows 2000]]'s were leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/114771/article.html Windows Code May Be Stolen] on [[PC World]] by Joris Evers (February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, allegedly "there are a dozen or so 'fucks' and 'shits', and hundreds of 'craps'." The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the "uglier" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atdt.freeshell.org/k5/story_2004_2_15_71552_7795.html|title=We Are Morons: a quick look at the Win2k source {{!}}{{!}} kuro5hin.org|website=atdt.freeshell.org|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from [[Mainsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also in 2004, partial (800&amp;nbsp;MB) proprietary source code that drives [[Cisco Systems]]' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which apparently enables some next-generation [[IPv6]] functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SecurityLab.ru|title=SecurityLab|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hackers stole source code (about 1&amp;nbsp;GiB) for [[Symantec]]'s [[pcAnywhere]] from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/symantec-suspected-breach-in-2006-didnt-confirm-until-anonymous-revealed-source-code.ars|title=Symantec suspected source code breach back in 2006|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, the source code of [[Norton Ghost|Norton Ghost 12]] and a [[Norton Anti-Spyware]] version were available via [[BitTorrent]].

In December 2007 and January 8, a [[Pirate Bay]] user published the sources of five [http://www.idera.com Idera] [[SQL]] products via BitTorrent.

In January 2011 the "stolen source code" of [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008]] was published on the Pirate Bay.

On May 20, 2011, [[EVE Online]]'s [[source code]] was published by someone on a [[GitHub]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/eve-online-source-code-posted-online-dmca-takedown-quickly-follows-1382821/ |title=Eve Online source code posted online, DMCA takedown quickly follows |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |publisher=geek.com |quote=It looks as though someone has posted the source code for the space MMO Eve Online there.

In 2011 the [[source code]] of [[GunZ: The Duel]] v1.5 [[Source code leak|became available]] online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ragezone.com/2011/11/20/gunz-1-5-source-code-released/ Gunz 1.5 Source Code released.] on ragezone.com (20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the source code of the [[Solaris 11]] operating system's kernel was leaked via BitTorrent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTAzMDE Oracle Solaris 11 Kernel Source-Code Leaked] on [[Phoronix]] by [[Michael Larabel]] (on 19 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 [[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'s [[X-Ray Engine]] [[source code]] (and its successor) became available on [[GitHub]] under a non-[[open-source license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray xray] on github.com (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16 xray-16] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2015 the [[AmigaOS]] 3.1 source code leaked to the web, confirmed by the rights holder [[Hyperion Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=AmigaOS-3.1-Leak-Confirmed| title=Hyperion Confirms Leak Of AmigaOS 3.1 Source Code

In January 2017 the source code of Opera's [[Presto (layout engine)|Presto]] Browser engine was leaked to GitHub.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/5nk69m/presto_engine_source_code_available_on_github/ presto_engine_source_code_available_on_github] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The source code was shortly after taken down with a DMCA notice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/prestocore/browser/network github.com/prestocore]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 part of Microsoft's [[Windows 10]] source code leaked to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/24/windows-10-source-code-leak-embarrassment-microsoft/ Windows 10 source code leak is an embarrassment for Microsoft - It's less serious than initially thought but still important, given security is high on everyone’s mind.] by Swapna Krishna on engadget.com (June 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End-of-life leaks by developers ===
Sometimes software developers themselves will leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming [[abandonware]] after it has reached its [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]], allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to [[public domain]] or as [[open-source software|open-source]] can include scattered or lost [[intellectual property rights]]. An example is the [[video game]] ''[[Falcon 4.0]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408111542/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archivedate=2004-04-08 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |publisher=Boston.com|title=Diehard pilots keep Falcon flying|author=Hiawatha Bray|date=2004-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falcon4.0leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleared-to-engage.com/2011/03/12/interview-with-kevin-klemmick-lead-software-engineer-for-falcon-4-0/|title=Interview with Kevin Klemmick - Lead Software Engineer for Falcon 4.0 | publisher=Cleared-To-Engage |date=2011-03-12 |first=Giorgio |last=Bertolone |accessdate=2014-08-31 |quote=''[C2E] In 2000 the source code of Falcon 4.0 leaked out and after that groups of volunteers were able to make fixes and enhancements that assured the longevity of this sim.

Another notable example is an archive of [[Infocom]]'s video games [[source code]] which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the [[Internet Archive]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/ |title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=Apr 17, 2008|quote=''From an anonymous source close to the company, I've found myself in possession of the "Infocom Drive" — a complete backup of Infocom's shared network drive from 1989.[...] Among the assets included: design documents, email archives, employee phone numbers, sales figures, internal meeting notes, corporate newsletters, and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made''|publisher=waxy.org |first=Andy |last=Baio |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other leaks ==
* In late 1998, a number of confidential [[Microsoft]] documents later dubbed the ''[[Halloween documents]]'' were leaked to [[Eric S. Raymond]], an activist in the [[open-source software]] movement, who published and commented on them online. The documents revealed that internally Microsoft viewed free and open-source software such as [[Linux]] as technologically competitive and a major threat for Microsoft's dominance in the market, and they discussed strategies to combat them. The discovery caused a public controversy. The documents were also used as evidence in several court cases.
* [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting video game series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' has a history of having unconfirmed content leaked. While the first two games predated its online community, every game since has been leaked in some form:
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the [[Wii]] was leaked by a video on the [[Japanese language]] wii.com website, revealing unconfirmed playable characters on January 28, 2008 (three days before the game's Japanese release).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' was afflicted in August 2014 by the "ESRB leak", where many screenshots and limited video footage of the 3DS version were leaked by a supposed member of the [[ESRB]]. The leak gained traction very quickly due to the screenshots mostly containing elements that the game ratings board would be interested in, such as trophies of suggestively-dressed female characters (some of which were later found to be edited or cut altogether in the final game).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' was leaked in its entirety two weeks before its release, allowing many to play and datamine in advance. While the entire roster of characters and stages had already been officially revealed, many unrevealed collectibles, music tracks, and story elements were discovered and distributed. This prompted Nintendo to issue copyright strikes to many YouTube and Twitch channels.
* Several high-profile books have been leaked on the Internet before their official release date, including ''[[If I Did It]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', and an early draft of the first twelve chapters of ''[[Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]''. The leak of the latter prompted the author [[Stephenie Meyer]] to suspend work on the novel.
* On January 31, 2014 the original uncensored version of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" was leaked, when it was illegally pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without any approval by [[Comedy Central]]. The episode was heavily censored by the network when it aired in 2010 against the will of series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and was never formally released uncensored to the public. The episode was the second in a [[story arc|two parter]] and was censored after the airing of the [[200 (South Park)|first part]] as a result of [[death threats]] from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] who were angry of the episode's storyline satirizing censorship of [[depictions of Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=An uncensored version of South Park's controversial Muhammad episode has surfaced|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-uncensored-version-of-south-parks-controversia-107422|publisher=[[The A.V.

The '''Kammerzell House''' ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Kammerzellhüs'', [[French language|French]]: ''Maison Kammerzell'', [[German language|German]]: ''Kammerzellhaus'') is one of the most famous buildings of [[Strasbourg]] and one of the most ornate and well preserved [[Middle Ages|medieval]] civil housing buildings in late [[Gothic architecture]] in the areas formerly belonging to the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Built in 1427 but twice transformed in 1467 and 1589, the building as it is now historically belongs to the [[German Renaissance]] but is stylistically still attached to the [[Rhineland]] black and white timber-framed style of civil (as opposed to administrative, clerical or noble) architecture.

It is situated on the ''Place de la Cathédrale'', north-west of the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], with whose rosy colour it contrasts in a picturesque way when seen from the opposite direction.

The building's inside has been decorated on all floors by lavish [[fresco]]es by Alsatian painter [[Léo Schnug]] (1878-1933). It now houses a restaurant.

Catherine Clarissa Howarde, better known as '''Kate Howarde''', was a notable actor, playwright, producer and director. She was best known for her play ''[[Possum Paddock]]'' in 1919. The talented Howarde also played a part in numerous roles as playwright in over 10 plays from 1914-1938. She was the first Australian woman to direct a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-female-filmmakers 'Australian Female Filmmakers' at Australia.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074548/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-female-filmmakers |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early and personal life ==
Howarde, was born on 28 July 1864 to parents Edward George Jones and Harriett Hannah in England before migrating to New Zealand as a child.

Kate married her first husband William Henry de Saxe who was a musician, the pair married in Christchurch, New Zealand on 28 April 1884, the couple gave birth to a little girl Florence Adrienne born 5 December 1884. Years went by and Saxe and Howarde separated. The registry has no exact dates when she separated from her first husband. On 26 November 1904, the Kate Howarde Dramatic Theatre company opened for a season at Perth's Theatre Royal, the line up included Scottish comedian and singer Elton Black, the pair hit it off and the two were later married. Records do not show how long Black had been in the country prior to the pair getting married. Shortly after, in May 1905, the pair set their sights for America and remained overseas for some four and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howarde|first=Kate|title=Kate Howarde|url=http://ozvta.com/ practitioners – h /|work=Biography|publisher=Australian Theatre Company|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howarde later died from cerebral thrombosis on 18 February 1939.

== Career ==
The late 1890s saw big things for Howarde when she adopted the stage name Kate Howarde; she began touring Australia and performing in different settings such as tents and halls. She formed a company which consisted of her two younger brothers and her sister. Kate Howarde and her company continued touring Australia and New Zealand up until 1905. The company was involved in such things as occasionally staged pantomimes and burlesques some of which included ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (1897), ''Little Jack Sheppard'', ''Aladdin'' and ''Diavolo''.

Howarde's big break came with the play ''Possum Paddock'' which was released in 1919. The play was written, produced and presented by Howarde. The play brought such success she decided to turn it into a film, which she also starred in, produced, co-directed and co-scripted along with Charles Villiers. This was the first Australian feature film to be co-directed by a woman, making Howarde a female pioneer within the emerging Australian film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-female-filmmakers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074548/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-female-filmmakers |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/howarde-catherine-clarissa-kate-12993]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Possum Paddock|The film]] was set to be released on 29 January 1921.

The success of ''[[Possum Paddock]]'' gained her stardom in the business which led to a 10-month tour across several companies. Howarde did not make any more films but continued to write many more plays with her company which were also great success, the last play she wrote was ''Judgement of jean Calvert'' before her death in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howarde|first=Kate|title=Biography|date=2006|publisher=Australian National University|location=Australia|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10235b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Last Words''''' is the [[autobiography]] of American [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[George Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120502583| title=Comedian George Carlin's 'Last Words'| publisher=National Public Radio| date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/28/entertainment/la-et-book28-2009nov28| author=Steve Appleford| title='Last Words' by George Carlin| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on November 10, [[2009 in literature|2009]]. ''Last Words'' tells the story of his life from his conception, literally, to his final years; he died on June 22, 2008 at the age of 71. He also wrote a special parting gift to the world. The book contains photos taken throughout Carlin's life.

In 1993, George Carlin asked his friend and bestselling author [[Tony Hendra]] to help him write his autobiography, although Carlin called it a "sortabiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-12-29/news/36846900_1_george-carlin-al-sleet-autobiography| author=Jeff Nussbaum| title=George Carlin, daring and delightful to the end| publisher=The Washington Post| date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two of them had scores of conversations, many were recorded, for almost fifteen years. During the conversations, they discussed Carlin's life, times, and evolution as a major comedian artist. After Carlin died, Hendra set out to assemble the book just as Carlin would have wanted.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

This book was also released twice in [[Audiobook]] format.  The first recording at unabridged length narrated by Johnny Heller and the second with George's brother Patrick reading an abridgment.

'''Mookie Tenembaum''' (born 1955) is an Argentine born polymath; philosopher, lawyer, inventor, conceptual multidiciplinary artist and a radio host.

Tenembaum's philosophy, first published under the title "Disillusionism" in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;''Delilusionismo'' (Spanish Edition) Mookie, Tenembaum, Planeta (2012) {{ISBN|9789504928386}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolving around original concepts like "Autothanatodeimia", "Illusions" and "Anti-Forms", introduces original and critical perspectives on human behavior and organization.

Tenembaum's work reflects his views on [[Sovereign state|the State]], freedom, and ecology. For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the [[Plaza de Mayo]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly  projecting  on the chest and backs of six  half naked ballerinas two video spots: one a popular [[Coca-Cola]] TV ad in which a polar bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a polar bear hunts and bloodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit.

Since December 2015, Tenembaum leads a morning radio show called ''El Observador Internacional'', in which he analyses the landscape of international politics. It is delivered by [[Radio Jai]], an Argentine-Jewish radio station.

== Biography ==
He attended Law School at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and specialized in Anthropology at [[Temple University of Philadelphia]]. As a lawyer, he  also  worked as a city attorney of the city of [[Jerusalem]]. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the [[State (polity)|State]] by means of creating new-media works. Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as "Genesis", which by means of an on-line system which generates "trusts" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents "traps" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are [[George Orwell]], [[J.J. Rousseau]], and [[John Locke]]'s theories, as well as [[Minarchist]] ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of [[FiRE]] (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger).

His art piece "Paranoia" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official [[Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes]] the most prestigious award in Argentina.

Recently he was featured on [[CNN]]'s "[[Cala (TV series)|Cala]]".

His works have been the object of numerous individual and collective in his native Argentina, and abroad.

Concurrently, Tenembaum's philosophical work started with a virulent critique of "Illusions", which is the term he uses to dub States, Religions, Families and other such juridical persons. His, is a deconstructive critique revolving around the fundamental claim that these Illusions are nothing but onerous fever phantasms spawned by each physical person's terror of death, or ATD (after its Ancient Greek initials Auto-Thanatos-Deimia).

As of late, Tenembaum's system of Disillusionism has expanded into a wider discussion of human [[ethology]]. According to him, [[behavioral modernity]], depends not only upon ATD and Illusions, but also upon the neuro-physiology that explains pain, relief, pleasure, memory, anticipation and other rival contenders for the very limited [[attentional span]] of human animals. Furthermore, Disillusionism relies heavily upon negativity and discarding as driving forces behind both human evolution and common sense.

On a practical note, Tenembaum's philosophy also distinguishes animal aptitude from each individual's actual willingness to apply the abilities it possesses. Drawing a parallel with the ancestral [[pack hunter|packs]], in which a division of attention and tasks was biologically enforced amongst individuals, Disillusionism attempts to make sense of the exchanges and relationships inside each human individual's Egosphere, and discuses the part [[Common Sense]] might play in optimizing such organization.

Tenembaum is the father of five children and the eldest son of [[Baruch Tenembaum]], founder of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]] and is a resident of Paraguay.

'''Sir Nikolaus Bernhard Leon Pevsner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE|FBA}} (30 January 1902 – 18 August 1983) was a German, later British scholar of the [[history of art]], and especially that of [[history of architecture|architecture]].

Pevsner is best known for his 46-volume series of county-by-county guides, ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' (1951–74), often simply referred to by his surname.

==Life==
The son of a Russian-Jewish fur haulier, Nikolaus Pevsner was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]. He attended the [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|Thomas School]] and went on to study [[art history]] at the Universities of [[Leipzig]], Munich, Berlin, and [[Frankfurt]]/Main, completing a PhD in 1924 on the baroque merchant houses of Leipzig.{{sfn|Engel|2004|p=}} In 1923, he married Carola ("Lola") Kurlbaum, the daughter of distinguished Leipzig lawyer Alfred Kurlbaum.{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}} He worked as an assistant keeper at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden Gallery]] (1924–28).

During this period he became interested in establishing the supremacy of German modernist architecture after becoming aware of [[Le Corbusier]]'s Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes|Paris Exhibition of 1925]].{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}}

In 1928 he contributed the volume on Italian baroque painting to the ''Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft'', a multi-volume series providing an overview of the history of European art. He taught at the [[University of Göttingen]] (1929–33), offering a specialist course on English art and architecture.

According to biographer Stephen Games, Pevsner welcomed many of the economic and cultural policies of the early [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]].{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}}{{sfn|Games|Pevsner|2002|p=}} However, due to [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|Nazi race laws]] he was forced to resign his lectureship in 1933.{{sfn|Harrison|2004|p=}} Later that year he moved to England, settling in [[Hampstead]], where poet [[Geoffrey Grigson]] was his neighbour in Wildwood Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Orbach, [https://www.mychippenham.org.uk/latest/73-nikolaus-pevsner-and-clyffe-pypard-by-julian-orbach "Nikolaus Pevsner and Clyffe Pypard"], ''My Chippenham''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Games, Stephen, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wpm1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey+grigson%2Bwildwood+terrace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3a_ywjHoMP&amp;sig=vdycIuQVA04Ea2MxyY2ZzXxeYrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivqK2jzvneAhUH7IMKHXalD7IQ6AEwAHoECC8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey%20grigson%2Bwildwood%20terrace&amp;f=false "3: Geoffrey Grigson"], ''Pevsner: The BBC Years: Listening to the Visual Arts'', Routledge, 2016, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. F. T. Baker, Diane K. Bolton and Patricia E. C. Croot, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp66-71 "Hampstead: North End, Littleworth, and Spaniard's End"], in C. R. Elrington (ed.),''A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington'', ed.  (London, 1989), pp. 66–71. British History Online. Retrieved 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner's first post was an 18-month research fellowship at the [[University of Birmingham]], found for him by friends in Birmingham and partly funded by the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]].&lt;ref name="bham"&gt;{{cite news|title=A landlady in a million? Snapshots of days gone by|url=http://www.download.bham.ac.uk/buzz/Buzz_57.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=Birmingham University online newspaper|issue=57|year=2005|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the role of the designer in the industrial process, the research produced a generally critical account of design standards in Britain which he published as ''An Enquiry into Industrial Art in England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1937). He was subsequently employed as a buyer of modern textiles, glass and ceramics for the [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]] furniture showrooms in London.

By this time Pevsner had also completed ''Pioneers of the Modern Movement: from William Morris to Walter Gropius'', his influential pre-history of what he saw as [[Walter Gropius]]'s dominance of contemporary design. ''Pioneers'' ardently championed Gropius's first two buildings (both pre–First World War) on the grounds that they summed up all the essential goals of 20th-century architecture; in England, however, it was widely taken to be the history of England's contribution to international modernism, and a manifesto for [[Bauhaus]] (i.e. [[Weimar]]) modernism, which it was not.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In spite of that, the book remains an important point of reference in the teaching of the history of modern design, and helped lay the foundation of Pevsner's career in England as an architectural historian. Since its first publication by [[Faber &amp; Faber]] in 1936, it has gone through several editions and been translated into many languages. The English-language edition has also been renamed ''Pioneers of Modern Design''.

==Second World War==
Pevsner was "[[more German than the Germans]]" to the extent that he supported "[[Goebbels]] in his drive for 'pure' non-decadent German art".&lt;ref name="Pearman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hughpearman.com/pevsner-and-the-nazis-round-two-who-and-what-did-the-great-architectural-historian-want-to-be/ |newspaper=The Sunday Times|date= 28 March 2010 |title=Prepare to be Outraged|quote=Review of ''Pevsner – the Early Life'', by Stephen Games|via=hughpearman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported as saying of the [[Nazis]] (in 1933) "I want this movement to succeed. There is no alternative but chaos.... There are things worse than [[Hitlerism]]".{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}} Nonetheless he was included in the Nazi [[The Black Book|Black Book]] as hostile to the Hitler regime.

In 1940, Pevsner was interned as an enemy alien in [[Huyton]], Liverpool. Geoffrey Grigson wrote in his ''Recollections'': "When at last two hard-faced Bow Street runners arrived in the eary hours of the morning to take [him] ... I managed, clutching my pyjama trousers, to catch them up with the best parting present I could quickly think of, which was an elegant little edition, a new edition, of Shakespeare's Sonnets."&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, Geoffrey, ''Recollections, Mainly of Writers and Artists'' (Hogarth Press, 1984) quoted in Harries 2011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FjSKfNcjGUsC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey+grigson%2BShakespeare+Sonnets&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U2KBIeDxGE&amp;sig=yzkFHMIddSLUfbPQuClabtw3T0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjxkoPF1PneAhUL_IMKHXgCA20Q6AEwC3oECBEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey%20grigson%2BShakespeare%20Sonnets&amp;f=false p. 273].&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner was released after three months on the intervention of, among others, [[Frank Pick]], then Director-General of the Ministry of Information. He spent some time in the months after [[the Blitz]] clearing bomb debris, and wrote reviews and art criticism for the Ministry of Information's ''[[Die Zeitung]]'', an anti-Nazi publication for Germans living in England. He also completed for [[Penguin Books]] the Pelican paperback ''An Outline of European Architecture'', which he had begun to develop while in internment. ''Outline'' would eventually go into seven editions, be translated into 16 languages, and sell more than half a million copies.

In 1942, Pevsner finally secured two regular positions. From 1936 onwards he had been a frequent contributor to the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' and from 1943 to 1945 he stood in as its acting editor while the regular editor [[James Maude Richards|J. M. Richards]] was on active service. Under the ''AR''{{'}}s influence, Pevsner's approach to modern architecture became more complex and more moderate.{{sfn|Pevsner|2010|p=}} Early signs of a lifelong interest in Victorian architecture, also influenced by the ''[[Architectural Review]]'', appeared in a series written under the pseudonym of "Peter F. R. Donner": Pevsner's "Treasure Hunts"  guided readers down selected London streets, pointing out architectural treasures of the 19th century. He was also closely involved with the ''Review''{{'}}s proprietor, [[H. de C. Hastings]], in evolving the magazine's theories on [[picturesque]] planning.{{sfn|Erten|2004|p=}}

In 1942, Pevsner was also appointed a part-time lecturer at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], London; he would eventually retire from the college in 1969 as its first professor of art history. He lectured at Cambridge for almost 30 years, having been [[Slade Professor of Fine Art|Slade professor]] there for a record six years from 1949 to 1955, and would also hold the Slade professorship at Oxford in 1968.

Framing all this was his career as a writer and editor. After moving to England, Pevsner had found that the study of architectural history had little status in academic circles, and the amount of information available, especially to travellers wanting to inform themselves about the architecture of a particular district, was limited. Invited by [[Allen Lane]], founder of [[Penguin Books]], for whom he had written his ''Outline'' and also edited the [[King Penguin Books|King Penguin series]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/writer/K/king-penguins.asp King Penguin], Books and Writers {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102070523/http://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/writer/K/king-penguins.asp |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest ideas for future publications, he proposed a series of comprehensive county guides to rectify this shortcoming.

Work on the ''[[Buildings of England]]'' series began in 1945, and the first volume was published in 1951. Pevsner wrote 32 of the books himself and 10 with collaborators, with a further four of the original series written by others. Since his death, work has continued on the series, which has been extended to cover the rest of the United Kingdom, under the title [[Pevsner Architectural Guides]] (now published by [[Yale University Press]]).{{efn|For a history and bibliography of the Buildings of England series, see {{harvnb|Cherry|1998|p=}} }} After updating and correcting ''London 1: the Cities of London and Westminster'' for its reissue in 1962, Pevsner delegated the revision and expansion of further volumes to others, beginning with Enid Radcliffe for ''Essex'' (1965).{{sfn|Harries|2011|p=}} The gazetteer descriptions of revised volumes do not routinely distinguish between Pevsner's original text and any new writing, but more recent books sometimes supply his words in quotation when the revising author's judgement differs, where a building has since been altered, or where the old text is no longer topical.

As well as ''The Buildings of England'', Pevsner proposed the ''Penguin the Pelican History of Art'' series (1953– ), a multi-volume survey on the model of the German ''Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft'', which he would himself edit. Many individual volumes are regarded as classics.

==Postwar==
In 1946, Pevsner made the first of several broadcasts on the [[BBC Third Programme]], presenting nine talks in all up to 1950, examining painters and European art eras. By 1977 he had presented 78 talks for the BBC, including the [[Reith Lectures]] in 1955 – a series of six broadcasts, entitled ''The Englishness of English Art'',&lt;ref name="Reith"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Englishness of English Art: 1955 | last = Pevsner | first = Nikolaus | work = The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4 | date =  | accessdate = 6 December 2017 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9llv | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he explored the qualities of art which he regarded as particularly English, and what they said about the English national character.{{sfn|Games|Pevsner|2002|p=}} His [[A. W. Mellon Lectures]] in Fine Art at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C., were published in 1976 as ''A History of Building Types''.{{sfn|Harries|2011|p=715}}

Pevsner was a founding member in 1957 of the [[Victorian Society]], the national charity for the study and protection of Victorian and Edwardian architecture and other arts. In 1964 he was invited to become its chairman, and steered it through its formative years, fighting alongside [[John Betjeman]], [[Hugh Casson]] and others to save houses, churches, railway stations and other monuments of the Victorian age. He served for ten years (1960–70) as a member of the National Advisory Council on Art Education (or Coldstream Committee), campaigning for art history to be a compulsory element in the curriculum of art schools. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1965 and awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1967.{{sfn|Harries|2011|pp=672–3}}

Having assumed British citizenship in 1946, Pevsner was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1953 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969 "for services to art and architecture".

Pevsner also received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|website=hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Pevsner died at home in Wildwood Terrace,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wildwood Terrace|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/periodproperty/9821880/Homes-for-sale-with-blue-plaques.html?frame=2460166|publisher=''Daily Telegraph''|location=London|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hampstead]], London, in August 1983.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Waite|title=Pevsner honoured with blue plaque|date=6 November 2007|work=Architects' Journal|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/pevsner-honoured-with-blue-plaque/219615.article}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife predeceased him by 20 years.

His memorial service was held at the [[Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury]], the following December, with the memorial address being given by [[Alec Clifton-Taylor]], a friend of 50 years. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter, [[Clyffe Pypard]], in [[Wiltshire]]. His elder son, Dieter, was an editor at Penguin Books. His younger son, [[Tom Pevsner|Tom]], was a film producer and director who went on to work on several [[James Bond films]].

Although Pevsner oversaw the publication of the initial volumes of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish counterparts of ''The Buildings of England'' (and in each was credited as "Editor-in-Chief", "Founding Editor" and "Editorial Adviser" respectively) he did not write any of them. As with the revisions of his earlier works, many of these volumes were the work of several contributors. Coverage of the whole of Great Britain was completed in 2016, with the Irish series still in progress.

A fictionalised Pevsner appears in the 1998 novel ''[[The Spell (novel)|The Spell]]'' by [[Alan Hollinghurst]].

==Notable ideas and theories==

* "A bicycle shed is a building; [[Lincoln Cathedral]] is a piece of architecture. Nearly everything that encloses space on a scale sufficient for a human being to move in is a building; the term architecture applies only to buildings designed with a view to aesthetic appeal." From ''An Outline of European Architecture'', 1943.
* Pevsner also described the three ways aesthetic appeal could manifest itself in architecture: in a building's façade, the material volumes, or the interior.

==Archive==
In 1984 the [[Getty Research Institute]] acquired the Nikolaus Pevsner Papers,&lt;ref name="Nikolaus Pevsner Papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikolaus Pevsner Papers|url=http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/840209/840209.xml;query=;brand=default|publisher=Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; an archive that includes 143 boxes of typed and handwritten notes, clippings, photographs, books, lecture notes, and manuscripts.

An '''Organist and Master of the Choristers''' is a title given to a [[Director of Music]] at a [[cathedral]], particularly a [[Church of England]] cathedral. The tradition dates back to the Middle Ages. They are often both the [[organist]] and the [[choirmaster]].

As Organist and Master of the Choristers, they are primarily occupied with the training and conducting of the cathedral choir. The sub-organist or assistant organist usually plays at cathedral services, although they will also be expected to take over the choral duties if the organist is unavailable.

One of the longest serving Organist and Master of the Choristers was Andrew Goodwin, who retired from [[Bangor Cathedral]] on 31 October 2009. He had served there for 37 years. He was the master of the choristers when [[Aled Jones]] was in the choir.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other long-serving holders of the title include Charles J Brennan who spent 60 years (1904-1964) at [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|Belfast Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1820&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rose By Any Other Name ...''''' is an American [[Romantic comedy]] whose plot and title are loosely based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Set in the US around the turn of the 21st century, it gently [[Satire|pokes fun]] at life, manners, morals as well as the tensions within the modern [[LGBT culture|LGBT]] and [[Social liberalism|liberal]] communities. It stars lesbian actress [[Cathy DeBuono]].

==Synopsis==
The story follows the main characters Rose a comfortably out woman who identifies as lesbian and Anthony a decent progressive heterosexual man who serendipitously meet and then unexpectedly find themselves falling for each other.  Rose has to navigate the reaction of her friends (they aren't thrilled) and her family (they are) while Anthony too has to deal with his friends who are equally nonplussed.

==Production==
The story was written and produced by [[Kyle Schickner]], who is a bisexual [[civil rights|rights]] activist as well as being a film producer, writer, director and actor.  It began as a successful [[Off-Off-Broadway]] Production in 1996 at New York City's [[Sanford Meisner Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Star-Ledger |title= Filmmaker repays debt to hometown – Shooting of Ally Sheedy movie now through December includes town residents as extras |date=October 27, 2006|first=Nawal |last=Qarooni}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was turned into a well received 1997 [[Indie film]] by Schickner's [[FenceSitter Films]].&lt;ref name="LATimes1"&gt;{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |title=MOVIES; Having It Both Ways; If you think there are more bisexuals in films, it's because there are |date=July 20, 1997|page=20 |first=Michael |last=Szymanski |quote= In his "Rose by Any Other Name," due in October, New Jersey filmmaker Kyle Schickner stars as a straight man baffled by the idea of dating a lesbian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |work=SF Weekly |title=MOVIES; Zoom Lens; Bisexual Film Festival |date=July 22, 1998|first=Morris |last=Morris |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1998-07-22/film/zoom-lens/ |quote=Saturday's double bill begins with a world premiere, Kyle Schickner's often hilarious indie Rose by Any Other Name ... (1997).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008/2009 [[FenceSitter Films]] began working with an [[Cable television in the United States|American Cable TV Network]] to spin-off ''Rose by Any Other Name ...'' into a weekly TV series.&lt;ref name="Bi Magazine"&gt;{{cite news |work=Bi Magazine |title=Rose By Any Other Name|date=November 9, 2009|url=http://bimagazine.org/index.php?id=157|quote=The web series "Rose By Any Other Name..." is based on Kyle Schickner's first film by the same title. The series follows the main character – Rose – as she tries to come to terms with her feelings for Anthony.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
According to Schickner after production had gotten underway "at the 11th hour as they were setting up to shoot the pilot the network expressed concern over how the cutting-edge social theme might play with some of their core viewership and decided to look at more data to see what kind of response the show might get".  So with the assistance of [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] the project was turned into a [[Web series]] with each [[Webisode]] being posted on the FenceSitter Films YouTube channel. Episodes 7–9 and 11 are no longer available on said channel due to a successful copyright claim.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/fencesitterfilms#p/c/1480F27A3206E9FF/9/89qvLFAd64A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Films"&gt;{{cite web|work=Bi Films |title=Introducing Ourselves |date=June 15, 2008 |url=http://bifilms.livejournal.com/327.html |quote=Now we have decided to update 'Rose By Any Other name . . .' to the present day and morph it into a weekly TV series, but while major studios are interested as usual they find my content is a little provocative.

'''Scythian art''' is art, primarily decorative objects, such as [[jewellery]], produced by the [[nomadic]] tribes in the area known to the ancient Greeks as [[Scythia]], which was centred on the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] and ranged from modern [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast of modern [[Poland]] and to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The identities of the nomadic peoples of the [[steppes]] is often uncertain, and the term "Scythian" should often be taken loosely; the art of nomads much further east than the core Scythian territory exhibits close similarities as well as differences, and terms such as the "Scytho-Siberian world" are often used.  Other [[Eurasian nomad]] peoples recognised by ancient writers, notably [[Herodotus]], include the [[Massagetae]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Saka]], the last a name from Persian sources, while ancient Chinese sources speak of the [[Xiongnu]] or Hsiung-nu.  Modern archaeologists recognise, among others, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], [[Tagar culture|Tagar]], and [[Aldy-Bel culture]]s, with the furthest east of all, the later [[Ordos culture]] a little west of [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 2-3, 22-23; Bunker, 3-4, 23; for more peoples in Herodotus see [[Eurasian nomads#Chronological division|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of these peoples is collectively known as '''steppes art'''.

In the case of the [[Scythians]] the characteristic art was produced in a period from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, after which the Scythians were gradually displaced from most of their territory by the Sarmatians, and rich grave deposits cease among the remaining Scythian populations on the [[Black Sea]] coast. Over this period many Scythians became sedentary, and involved in trade with neighbouring peoples such as the Greeks.

In the earlier period Scythian art included very vigorously modelled stylised [[animal style|animal figures]], shown singly or in combat, that had a long-lasting and very wide influence on other [[Eurasia]]n cultures as far apart as [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Celtic art|the European Celts]].  As the Scythians came in contact with the [[Greece|Greeks]] at the Western end of their area, their artwork influenced Greek art, and was influenced by it; also many pieces were made by Greek craftsmen for Scythian customers. Although we know that goldsmith work was an important area of [[Ancient Greek art]], very little has survived from the core of the Greek world, and finds from Scythian burials represent the largest group of pieces we now have.  The mixture of the two cultures in terms of the background of the artists, the origin of the forms and styles, and the possible history of the objects, gives rise to complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1, 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Many art historians feel that the Greek and Scythian styles were too far apart for works in a hybrid style to be as successful as those firmly in one style or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 355&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences from urbanized civilizations such as those of Persia and China, and the mountain cultures of the [[Caucasus]], also affected the art of their nomadic neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Scythian art especially Scythian [[gold]] jewellery is highly valued by museums and many of the most valuable artefacts are in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. Their Eastern neighbours, the [[Pazyryk culture]] in [[Siberia]] produced similar art, although they related to the Chinese in a way comparable to that of the Scythians with the Greek and Iranian cultures. In recent years, [[archeologist]]s have made valuable finds in various places within the area.

==Types of objects==
[[File:Фрагменты Пекторали.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Gold Scythian pectoral, or neckpiece, from a royal [[kurgan]] in [[Tolstaya Mogila]], [[Pokrov, Ukraine]], dated to the second half of the 4th century BC. ]]

The Scythians worked in a wide variety of materials such as gold, [[wood]], [[leather]], [[bone]], [[bronze]], [[iron]], [[silver]] and [[electrum]].  Clothes and horse-trappings were sewn with small plaques in metal and other materials, and larger ones, including some of the most famous, probably decorated shields or wagons.  Wool [[felt]] was used for highly decorated clothes, tents and horse-trappings, and an important nomad mounted on his horse in his best outfit must have presented a very colourful and exotic sight.  As nomads, the Scythians produced entirely portable objects, to decorate their horses, clothes, tents and wagons, with the exception in some areas of [[kurgan stelae]], stone [[stelae]] carved somewhat crudely to depict a human figure, which were probably intended as memorials. Bronze-casting of very high quality is the main metal technique used across the Eurasian steppe, but the Scythians are distinguished by their frequent use of gold at many sites,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1&lt;/ref&gt; though large hoards of gold objects have also been found further east, as in the hoard of over 20,000 pieces of "Bactrian Gold" in partly nomadic styles from [[Tillya Tepe]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Earlier pieces reflected [[animal style]] traditions; in the later period many pieces, especially in metal, were produced by Greek craftsmen who had adapted Greek styles to the tastes and subject-matter of the wealthy Scythian market, and probably often worked in Scythian territory. Other pieces are thought to be imports from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Scythians prospered through trade with the Greeks, they settled down and started farming. They also established permanent settlements such as a site in [[Belsk]], [[Ukraine]] believed to the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] with craft workshops and Greek [[pottery]] prominent in the ruins. The [[Pazyryk burials]] (east of Scythia proper) are especially important because the frozen conditions have preserved a wide variety of objects in perishable materials that have not survived in most ancient burials, on the steppes or elsewhere.  These include wood carvings, textiles including clothes and [[felt]] appliqué wall hangings, and even elaborate [[tattoo]]s on the body of the so-called [[Siberian Ice Maiden]]. These make it clear that important ancient nomads and their horses, tents, and wagons were very elaborately fitted out in a variety of materials, many brightly coloured.   Their [[iconography]] includes animals, monsters and anthropomorphic beasts, and probably some deities including a "[[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]]", as well as energetic geometric motifs.  Archaeologists have uncovered felt rugs as well as well-crafted tools and domestic utensils. Clothing uncovered by archaeologists has also been well made many trimmed by embroidery and appliqué designs. Wealthy people wore clothes covered by gold embossed plaques, but small gold pieces are often found in what seem to be relatively ordinary burials.  Imported goods include a famous carpet, the oldest to survive, that was probably made in or around Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Steppes jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The "looped" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the [[reindeer]], which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period.  The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing.  The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan [[totem]]. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the burial site of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]] in the [[Kuban]] dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*[[Tápiószentmárton]] in [[Hungary]] dating from the 5th century BC, now [[National Museum of Hungary]], [[Budapest]]
*[[Kul Oba]] in the [[Crimea]] dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Loehr|Loehr, Max]], "The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East", ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20066973 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic form is the [[openwork]] plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, Ann, "Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West",
''Artibus Asiae'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, [[DOI 10.2307/3250196]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250196 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.

The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess &amp; powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

The primary weapon of this horse riding culture was the bow, &amp; a special case had been developed to carry the delicate but very powerful composite bow. This case, "the gorytus", had a separate container on the outside which acted as a quiver, &amp; the whole was often decorated with animal scenes or scenes depicting daily life on the steppes. There was a marked following of Grecian elements after the 4th century BC, when Greek craftsmen were commissioned to decorate many of the daily use articles.

Scythian art has become well known in the West thanks to a series of touring loan exhibitions from Ukrainian and Russian museums, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Archaeology==
[[File:HorseAttackedByTigerOrdos4th-1stBCE.JPG|thumb|left|Bronze [[Ordos culture]] plaque, 4th century BC; a horse attacked by a tiger]]
Kurgans are large mounds that are obvious in the landscape and a high proportion have been plundered at various times; many may never have had a permanent population nearby to guard them.  To counter this, treasures were sometimes deposited in secret chambers below the floor and elsewhere, which have sometimes avoided detection until the arrival of modern archaeologists, and many of the most outstanding finds come from such chambers in kurgans that had already been partly robbed.

Elsewhere the [[desertification]] of the steppe has brought once-buried small objects to lie on the surface of the eroded land, and many [[Ordos bronzes]] seem to have been found in this way.

Russian explorers first brought Scythian artworks recovered from Scythian burial mounds to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the early 18th century. These works formed the basis of the collection held by the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. [[Catherine the Great]] was so impressed from the material recovered from the [[kurgans]] or burial mounds that she ordered a systematic study be made of the works. However, this was well before the development of modern archaeological techniques.

[[Nikolai Veselovsky]] (1848-1918) was a [[Russian archaeologist]] specializing in Central Asia who led many of the most important excavations of kurgans in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first sites discovered by modern archaeologists were the kurgans [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], Ulagan district of the [[Altay Republic]], south of [[Novosibirsk]]. The name [[Pazyryk culture]] was attached to the finds, five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949 opened in 1947 by a Russian archeologist, [[Sergei Rudenko]]; Pazyryk is in the [[Altay Mountains]] of southern Siberia. The kurgans contained items for use in the afterlife. The famous Pazyryk carpet discovered is the oldest surviving wool pile oriental rug.
[[File:TilliaTepeCrown2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Golden crown. Treasure of [[Tillia tepe]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

The enormous hoard of "Bactrian gold" discovered at [[Tillya Tepe]] in northern [[Afghanistan]] in 1978 comes from the fringes of the nomadic world, and the objects reflect the influence of many cultures to the south of the steppes as well as steppes art.  The six burials come from the early 1st century AD (a coin of [[Tiberius]] is among the finds) and though their cultural context is unfamiliar, it may relate to the [[Indo-Scythians]] who had created an empire in north India.

Recent digs in [[Belsk]], Ukraine uncovered a vast city believed to be the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] described by [[Herodotus]]. Numerous craft workshops and works of pottery have been found. A kurgan or burial mound near the village of [[Ryzhanovka]] in Ukraine, {{convert|75|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Kiev]], found in the 1990s has revealed one of the few unlooted tombs of a Scythian chieftain, who was ruling in the forest-steppe area of the western fringe of Scythian lands. There at a late date in Scythian culture (c. 250 - 225 BC), a recently nomadic aristocratic class was gradually adopting the agricultural life-style of their subjects. Many items of jewellery were also found in the kurgan.

A discovery made by Russian and German archaeologists in 2001 near [[Kyzyl]], the capital of the Russian republic of [[Tuva]] in Siberia is the earliest of its kind and predates the influence of Greek civilisation. Archaeologists discovered almost 5,000 decorative gold pieces including earrings, pendants and beads. The pieces contain representations of many local animals from the period including panthers, lions, bears and deer.

Earlier rich kurgan burials always include a male, with or without a female consort, but from the 4th and 3rd centuries there are number of important burials with only a female.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
[[Image:Scythian resurrection.jpg|thumb|350px|Golden plaques representing the resurrection of a dead hero (Saka culture, 5th century BC, [[Hermitage Museum]]).]]

The finds from the most important nomad burials remain in the countries where they were found, or at least the capitals of the states in which they were located when found, so that many finds from Ukraine and other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] are in Russia.  Western European and American museums have relatively small collections, though there have been exhibitions touring internationally. The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has the longest standing and the best collection of Scythian art.  Other museums including several local ones in Russia, in [[Budapest]] and [[Miskolc]] in Hungary, [[Kiev]] in Ukraine, the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] and elsewhere have important holdings. The ''Scythian Gold'' exhibition came from a number of Ukrainian exhibitions including the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev and the State Historical Archaeological Preserve at [[Pereiaslav-Khmel'nyts'kyi]].

[[File:Sensation Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Brooklyn Museum 15.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Sensation'' installed at [[Brooklyn Museum]] (October 1999  – January 2000)]]
'''''Sensation''''' was an exhibition of the collection of contemporary art owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], including many works by [[Young British Artists]], (YBAs), which first took place 18 September – 28 December 1997 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London and later toured to the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin and the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York City. A proposed showing at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was "too close to the market."

The show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of [[Myra Hindley]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. It was criticised by New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/093099brooklyn-museum.html |title=Brooklyn Museum Accused of Trying to Lift Art Value |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=30 September 1999 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artworks in ''Sensation'' were from the collection of [[Charles Saatchi]], a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. [[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:
{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition. One gallery will not be open to those under the age of 18.''&lt;ref name="Dalry"/&gt;}}

==London==
[[File:Burlington House-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Academy of Arts]], London|306x306px]]The opening of ''Sensation'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both [[broadsheet]] and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.  Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.

However, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].&lt;ref name="Dalry"&gt;{{citation |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_1_urbanities-trash.html |title=Trash, Violence, and Versace: But Is It Art? |magazine=City Journal |date=Winter 1998 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |title=Attacks force Hindley portrait to be moved |newspaper=The Times |date=19 September 1997 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924CA724CFF0B6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |subscription=yes |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was "a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEEDD1F38F933A1575AC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Art That Tweaks British Propriety] |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 September 1997 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Alison. "Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law". Routledge, January, 2005. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-415-30183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all the protest the painting remained hanging.  Windows at Burlington House, the Academy's home, were smashed and two demonstrators hurled ink and eggs at the picture as a result, requiring it to be removed and restored. It was put back on display behind [[Perspex]]&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/455902.stm "Sensation sparks New York storm"], [[BBC]], 23 September 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and guarded by security men.

In a press conference on 16 September 1997, David Gordon, Secretary of the Royal Academy commented on the controversial portrait: "The majority view inside the Academy was that millions and millions of images of Myra Hindley have been reproduced in newspapers and magazines. Books have been written about the murders. Television programmes have been made. Hindley’s image is in the public domain; part of our consciousness; an awful part of our recent social history; a legitimate subject for journalism – and for art."

The show was extremely popular with the general public, attracting over 300,000 visitors during its run,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; helped by the media attention which the strong subject matter had received.  The BBC described it as "gory images of dismembered limbs and explicit pornography".&lt;ref name=limbs&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/43401.stm "Entertainment Sensational hit for Royal Academy"], [[BBC]], 30 December 1997.

==Berlin==
''Sensation'' was shown at the Berlin's [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] museum (30 September 1998 – 30 January 1999) and proved so popular that it was extended past its original closing date of 28 December 1998. For art critic Nicola Kuhn from ''Der Tagesspiegel'', there was "no sensation about Sensation". She claimed that the Berlin audience found the yBa's work "more sad and serious than irreverent, funny and dazzling"&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton, Rita and Walker, John.

==New York City==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum June 2008 sunset jeh.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The exhibition was shown in New York City at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000. The New York City show was met with instant protest, centring on ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was "smeared", "splattered" or "stained" with elephant dung,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-pPe2HVNb08C&amp;pg=PA38 Judging the image: art, value, law], Alison Young, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30184-X}}, p.38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedlander&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym1ADWLrWmwC&amp;pg=PA88 Feminine look: sexuation, spectatorship, subversion], Jennifer Friedlander, SUNY Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-7914-7295-7}}, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collaged images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]].

New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7&amp;nbsp;million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; [[Cardinal John O'Connor]], the [[Archbishop of New York]], said, "one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself," and the president of America's biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it "deeply offensive".&lt;ref name=whiff&gt;{{citation |last1=Davies |first1=Hugh |last2=Fenton |first2=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/02/wsen02.html |title=Whiff of sensation hits New York |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 October 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]], said the work "induces revulsion".&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for a breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] spoke up for the museum, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/092899brooklyn-hillary.html |title=First Lady Assails Mayor Over Threat to Museum |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |publisher=New York Times |date=28 September 1999 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, Giuliani's stance "promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;Rapp, Christopher.

Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also carried a full-page advertisement in support signed by over 100 actors, writers and artists, including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, "elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a nonbinding resolution to end federal funding for the museum on 3 October 1999, and New York City did stop funding to the Brooklyn Museum.  On 1 November, federal judge [[Nina Gershon]] ordered the City not only to restore the funding that was denied to the Museum, but also to refrain from continuing its ejectment action.  On 16 December 1999, a 72-year-old man was arrested for criminal mischief after smearing the Ofili painting with white paint, which was soon removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |magazine=Art in America |title=Vandal Attacks Ofili Madonna |date=February 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120055422/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |archive-date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show "may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; and Ofili's painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt; Jeffrey Hogrefe, art critic for the ''[[New York Observer]]'', commented about the museum, "They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; The editor-in-chief of the New York City ''[[Art &amp; Auction]]'' magazine, Bruce Wolmer,said: "When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

==Australia==
The show was scheduled to open in June 1999 at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but was cancelled with the director, Brian Kennedy, saying that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was "too close to the market" since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work; $50,000 from [[Christie's]], who had sold work for Saatchi; and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists.&lt;ref name=vogeloz&gt;Vogel, Carol.

Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy said he was unaware of this when he accepted the show. Saatchi's contribution, the largest single one, was not disclosed by the [[Brooklyn Museum]], until it appeared in court documents.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt; Similarly, when the show opened in London at the Royal Academy, there had been criticisms that it would raise the value of the work.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt;

'''Serindian art''' is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century C.E. in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]].

It derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. Greek-influenced culture was most probably in existence prior to [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasions, Afghanistan natives retained this influence which was lost in Greece.{{Verify source|date=November 2017}}

Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this artistic influence, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian.

In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of [[Sir Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

The '''Sherlockian game''' (also known as the '''Holmesian game''', '''the Great Game''' or  simply '''the Game'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sherlock Holmes Fans Play 'Great Game' |first=Sean |last=Cole |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5035037 |newspaper=[[All Things Considered]] |date=December 1, 2005 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the pastime of attempting to resolve anomalies and clarify implied details about [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]] from the 56 short stories and four novels that make up the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes Canon]] by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. It treats Holmes and Watson as real people and uses aspects of the canonical stories combined with the history of the era of the tales' settings to construct fanciful biographies of the pair.

==Origins and early scholars==
The game of examining the stories as if they were non-fiction began in the early twentieth century. There are early examples of Sherlockian essays by [[Arthur Bartlett Maurice]] and Frank Sidgwick, both published in 1902, but neither of these essays received much notice at first. Notable early scholars of the canon included [[Ronald Knox]] in Britain and [[Christopher Morley]] (founder of [[The Baker Street Irregulars]]) in New York. [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], creator of the detective [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later published in ''Unpopular Opinions''. In the foreword to this book, Sayers notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The game of applying the methods of the "[[Higher Criticism]]" to the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes canon]] was begun, many years ago, by Ronald Knox, with the aim of showing that, by those methods, one could disintegrate a modern classic as speciously as a certain school of critics have endeavoured to disintegrate the [[Bible]]. Since then, the thing has become a hobby among a select set of jesters here and in America.&lt;ref name=Sayers&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Unpopular Opinions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1946), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sayers also said that the Game "must be played as solemnly as a [[County Championship|county cricket]] match at [[Lord's]]; the slightest touch of extravagance or burlesque ruins the atmosphere."&lt;ref name=Sayers /&gt;

When a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], Knox issued "Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes",&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Ronald, "[http://www.diogenes-club.com/studies.htm Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes], in: ''Essays in satire''. London: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; an essay which is regarded as the founding text of "Holmesian scholarship".   That essay was re-printed, among others, in 1928 and the following year, [[Sydney Roberts]], then a professor at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], issued a reply to Knox's arguments, in a booklet entitled ''A Note on the Watson Problem''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, S.C., ''A note on the Watson problem''. Cambridge: University Press, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; S.C. Roberts issued then a complete Watson biography. A book by T.S. Blakeney&lt;ref&gt;Blakeney, T.S., ''Sherlock Holmes: Fact or Fiction?''. London: John Murray, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; followed and the "Holmesian" game (commonly referred to simply as "the game"&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Thomas L. ''The Great Game - Sherlock Holmes Devotees Get a New Bible''. ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]''. Issue 208 (Vol. 29, No. 2). Pp.65-67. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;) was born. Early Holmesians of note include the bibliographer and book collector [[Vincent Starrett]]&lt;ref&gt;Starrett, Vincent, ''The private life of Sherlock Holmes.'' New York: Macmillan Co., 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the archaeologist Harold Wilmerding Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Bell. H.W., ''Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Chronology of Their Adventures''. London: Constable &amp; Co., 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of the Game in its traditional form is the effort to resolve or explain away contradictions in the Holmes canon, such as the location of Watson's war wound, which is described as being in his shoulder in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and in his leg in ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]'', or his first name, given as John in ''A Study in Scarlet'' and "[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]" but James in "[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]".&lt;ref name="straightdope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2088/did-sherlock-holmes-really-exist |title=Did Sherlock Holmes Really Exist? |author=Dex |date=April 8, 2003 |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |publisher= |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/12/do-your-own-detecting-sherlock-holmes-and-the-adventure-of-tricky-continuity |title=Do Your Own Detecting: Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of Tricky Continuity |last=Asher-Perrin |first=Emily |date=December 28, 2011 |work=[[Tor.com]] |publisher=[[Tor Books]] |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dorothy Sayers and many of the early "Holmesians" used the works of Conan Doyle as the chief basis for their speculations, a more fanciful school of playing the historical-Holmes game is represented by [[William S. Baring-Gould]], author of ''[[Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street]]'' (1962),&lt;ref&gt;Baring-Gould, William S., ''[[Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street: A Biography of the World's First Consulting Detective]]''. London: Rupert Hart-Davis, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; a personal "biography" of Holmes.

A more recent "biography" is Nick Rennison's ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography]]'' (Atlantic Books, 2005) and, since 1998, Leslie S. Klinger has edited ''The Sherlock Holmes Reference Library'' (Gasogene Books, Indianapolis), which sums up the available Holmesian "scholarship" alongside the original "canonical" texts.

Mark Frost's 1993 novel ''[[The List of Seven]]'' presents a fictionalized account of Sherlock Holmes' literary origins. In the story, Arthur Conan Doyle, an aspiring but struggling author, is caught up in an assassination attempt and is saved by a man exhibiting many of the prototypical characteristics of Holmes. Frost wrote a follow-up novel called ''[[The Six Messiahs]]''.

==The Holmes family==
A particularly rich area of "research" is the "uncovering" of details about Holmes' family history and early life, of which almost nothing is said in Conan Doyle's stories. In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", Watson states: "I had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his early life." But in that story, as well as introducing his brother, Holmes mentions the only facts about his family that are in any of the stories &amp;mdash; "My ancestors were country squires... [M]y grandmother... was the sister of Vernet, the French artist" (presumably [[Horace Vernet]]). Beyond this, all familial statements are speculation. For example, there is a certain belief that his mother was named Violet, based on Conan Doyle's fondness for the name and the four strong Violets in the canon; however, as Baring-Gould noted, in Holmes' Britain, Violet was a very common name.
 
It is clear from references to "the university" in "[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott|The Adventure of the ''Gloria Scott'']]", "[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]", and to some degree "[[The Adventure of the Three Students]]", that Holmes attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], although the question of which one remains a topic of eternal debate. Baring-Gould believed textual evidence indicated that Holmes attended both.

The most influential "biography" of Holmes is ''Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street'' by [[William S. Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]]. Faced with Holmes' reticence about his family background and early life, Baring-Gould invented one for him. According to Baring-Gould, Sherlock Holmes was born in [[Yorkshire]], the youngest of three sons of Siger Holmes and Violet Sherrinford. The middle brother, Mycroft, appears in the canon, but the eldest, Sherrinford Holmes, was invented by Baring-Gould to free Mycroft and Sherlock from the obligation of following Siger as a country squire. In reality, "Sherrinford Holmes" was one of the names Arthur Conan Doyle considered for his hero before settling on "Sherlock".&lt;ref&gt;Conan Doyle, Sir Arthur, ''Memories and Adventures''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; Siger Holmes' name is derived from "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]", in which Sherlock tells Watson that he spent some time pretending to be a Norwegian called Sigerson, which Baring-Gould reads literally as meaning "son of Siger."

Sherrinford had a significant role in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' crossover novel ''[[All-Consuming Fire]]'' by [[Andy Lane]], which also featured a cameo by Siger.

Some other notable versions of Holmes' parentage:
*[[Nicholas Meyer]]'s ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' reveals that his mother was cheating on his father, who then killed both her and himself. The film adaptation, also written by Meyer, further reveals that Moriarty was his mother's lover; in the novel, Moriarty is the man who brought young Sherlock the news of his parents' death. Either circumstance explains not only Holmes's career choice, but also (in an appropriately Freudian manner) his hatred of Professor Moriarty.
*[[Michael Harrison (writer)|Michael Harrison]]'s ''I, Sherlock Holmes'' names his father as Captain Siger Holmes of the [[British East India Company]].
*[[Fred Saberhagen]]'s ''The Holmes-Dracula File'' gives his true father as the lover of Mrs. Holmes: the [[vampire]] [[Radu the Handsome]], a younger brother of [[Vlad III Dracula]], who had succeeded him as a ruler of [[Wallachia]]. This would make Sherlock a nephew of [[Dracula]] (against whom he was pitted in [[Loren D. Estleman]]'s novel ''The Case of the Sanguinary Count'').
*[[Nancy Springer]] introduced Enola Holmes (the younger sister of [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] and Sherlock) in her ''[[The Enola Holmes Mysteries|Enola Holmes Mysteries]]'', a series of detective stories for young readers. Enola was born "shamefully late in life", to her parents Eudoria Vernet Holmes, a suffragist and talented watercolourist, and an unnamed father, who was a country squire.

===The Holmes family and the Wold Newton family===
Based originally on the writings of [[Philip José Farmer]], the concept of the [[Wold Newton family]] is the construction of a giant genealogical tree which connects many [[fictional character]]s to each other and to a number of historical figures. Additions to this tree are based on the writings of the original creators, pastiche writers, and "Wold Newton scholars". Sherlock Holmes has been one of the central characters of this tree. The Holmes family and its various generations have been the subject of many Wold Newton articles.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Bannon (2011) "Re-envisioning nature: The role of aesthetics in environmental ethics," ''[http://www.cep.unt.edu/enethics.html Environmental Ethics]'' 33(4): 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, R. (2008) Andy Goldsworthy: Nature's collaborator, art's alchemist," ''[http://www.queensu.ca/quarterly/ Queen's Quarterly]'' 114(4): 597-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Opp, J. (2011) "Public history and the fragments of place: Archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta," ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rrhi20/current Rethinking History]'' 15: 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: [[Shinto]] has its [[Kami]] which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Principalities|Principalities]], [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Bonpo]] traditions.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5546">[[File:Teatro Verdi.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Facade of Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi]]
The '''Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi''' is an [[opera house]] located in [[Trieste]], Italy and named after the [[composer]] [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. Privately constructed, it was inaugurated as the '''Teatro Nuovo''' to replace the smaller 800-seat "Cesareo Regio Teatro di San Pietro" on 21 April 1801 with a performance of [[Johann Simon Mayr]]'s ''[[Ginevra di Scozia]]''. Initially, the Nuovo had 1,400 seats. In 1821, it became known as the '''Teatro Grande'''.

By the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and finally closed its doors in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. [[Gian Antonio Selva]], the architect of the [[La Fenice]] in [[Venice]], was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium.  However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of [[Milan]]'s [[La Scala]] opera house. The "Nuovo" became a mixture of La Fenice on the inside and La Scala on the exterior.

==History==
Several name changes have occurred during the theatre's lifetime, the first in 1821 when it became the ''Teatro Grande'' &lt;ref&gt;"To distinguish it from those less illustrious", Lynn, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; and it was under this name that the theatre was the site of two Verdi opera premieres: ''[[Il corsaro]]'' in 1848 (featuring the soprano [[Giuseppina Strepponi]], who Verdi married in 1859, in the leading role) and ''[[Stiffelio]]'', a production which Verdi supervised - not without controversy - in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;"Leave the libretto as it is or I will withdraw the opera", Verdi, quoted in Lynn, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; However, before these premieres, Verdi's operas had begun to dominate the Teatro Grande's stage, followed, as the century progressed, by all the major works of the opera repertoire, including those by [[Puccini]] and [[Wagner]].

A further name change followed in 1861 due to a change from private to public ownership. Thus it became the ''Teatro Comunale'' and existed as such throughout the latter years of the 19th century.  By 1881, seating capacity had been increased to 2,000 through the use of existing standing room spaces; but, by that December, the theatre was declared to be unsafe and it was closed for renovations, during which electricity replaced gas lighting for the reopening in 1889 with 1,000 seats.

Within hours of his death in January 1901,&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; the theatre was once again renamed, this time to honour the memory of Giuseppe Verdi. It was extensively restored between 1992 and 1997 and re-opened with about 1,300 seats&lt;ref&gt;"il "Verdi" ha attualmente, a seguito dell’ultima ristrutturazione, la capienza originale di circa 1300 posti", Theatre's website&lt;/ref&gt; and with a ''Viva Verdi'' concert&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt; which included excerpts from many of the composer's operas.  (Like the restoration of [[La Scala]] between 2001 and 2004, a temporary alternative venue was quickly created in Trieste and the ''Sala Tripcovich'' continues to offer space for chamber opera and operettas.)

A major feature of the Teatro Verdi's programming in the past 40 years, which stems from the original Austrian occupation of the city in the 19th century and the fact that Trieste did not become part of Italy until 1918, is the "International Festival of Operetta" which takes place every summer.

==Premieres==
The theatre has seen the world premieres of the following operas:
*''Ginevra di Scozia'' by [[Simon Mayr]], 21 April 1801
* ''Annibale in Capua'' by [[Antonio Salieri]] 20 May 1801 &lt;ref&gt;Rice, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8YOwT4hOUQAC&amp;pg=PA602&amp;dq=%22Annibale+in+Capua%22++Salieri+May+1801 ''Antonio Salieri and Viennese Opera]'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, p. 602. {{ISBN|0-226-71125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ricciarda di Edimburgo'' by [[Cesare Pugni]], 29 September 1832.
*''Enrico II'' by [[Otto Nicolai]], 26 November 1839 &lt;ref&gt;originally given at the first performance as ''Rosmonda d'Inghilterra''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Egg Dance''''' is a 1552 oil on panel genre painting by the Dutch artist [[Pieter Aertsen]], now in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, which bought it in 1839 from the collection of Colonel von Schepeler in [[Aachen]]. It depicts preparations for the Easter or carnival custom of an [[egg dance]].

[[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Layer Monument with four Northern Mannerist figurines]]
'''The Layer Quaternity''' are four marble sculpture figurines approximately {{convert|25|cm|0}} in height located on the two columns of [[the Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century polychrome mural monument ({{convert|320 x 350|cm|disp=sqbr}}) which was installed in the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]] to the memory of [[Christopher Layer (merchant)|Christopher Layer]] (1531–1600).

==Style== 
The quartet of figurines sculptured in marble, ''Pax, Gloria, Vanity, Labor'' exhibit primary thematic concerns and stylistic attributes of [[Northern Mannerist]] art, namely, portraiture of animated human movement, variety and multiplicity, often set in the Classical or mythological world, and inclined towards esoteric concepts.&lt;ref&gt; [[John Shearman]] Mannerism Pelican 1967 {{ISBN|0-14-020808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of symbolism== 
[[File:Alchemical air 1606.jpg|thumb|right| 'The Philosopher's Stone' from 'Alchemia' (1606) Libavius]]
The Layer Quaternity (''circa'' 1598–1604) share a number of iconographical details to a complex illustration found in ''Alchemia'' (1606) by the German academic [[Andreas Libavius]] in a chapter entitled ''De Lapide Philosophorum'' ([[Philosopher's stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]) in which two giants support four figures, the lower pair of which are mortal, the upper pair immortal, they form the apex to –

"Libavius' monument of the opus.......The completion of the Little Work by ''Labor and Industry'' and ''the grace of God'' (Latin lower captions translated) is followed by ''Sol'' and ''Luna'' ascending on swan's wings.....the thanksgiving by the Arab king and his white wife reading as – ''Glory to God on High'' and ''I will exalt thee my God'' ".&lt;ref&gt; Alchemy – Johannes Fabricius pub. Rosenkilde and Bagger, Copenhagen, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin upper captions translated)

Libavius' illustration and the marble sculpture of the Layer Quaternity share an identical pairing including a naked figure (lower pair), a bare-legged royal male and a regal draped female (upper pair) as well as the titled captions ''Gloria'' and ''Labor'', along with the symbols of palm branch, ''rotundum'', and moon. 

The similarities between the captioned phrases of Libavius' illustration to those of the single-word titles of the Layer Quaternity suggest that in time sequence, the Layer monument was based upon and installed before 1606, the publication date of Libavius' illustration.

Biblical verse which parallels the symbolism of each captioned entity includes for the lower and mortal pair – ''Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the '''Labour''' that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was '''Vanity''' and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun''. [[Ecclesiastes]] 2.v.11 With an antithetical response from the upper, immortal, ''Heavenly'' pair –  '''Glory''' ''to God in the highest, and on earth '''Peace''', goodwill to all men.'' [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2 v.14

The Layer Quaternity also corresponds to the alchemical 'deities' [[Apollo]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] as named in emblem XVII of [[Atalanta Fugiens]] (1617) by the German alchemist-physician [[Michael Maier]].&lt;ref&gt; J.B.

==Interpretation==

The four figurines housed in the monument's pilasters, ''Pax'' and ''Gloria'', ''Vanitas'' and ''Labor'', (Peace, Glory, Vanity, Labor) are relatively rare examples of Northern Mannerist sculpture extant in Britain. Collectively they exemplify how Christian iconography during the era of [[Elizabeth I]], in tandem with Renaissance Europe, integrated symbolism from the western esoteric traditions of alchemy and astrology into works of art, including the funerary monument. The Layer Quaternity in their totality are a unique alchemical mandala.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam McLean]] The Alchemical Mandala pub. Phanes 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Through polarised symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). They also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, as well as pleasure and suffering. In essence, the Layer Quaternity, not unlike the ''Scaiolae''&lt;ref&gt; 'Spiritual powers of the mind comparable to psychic powers such as thought, love, hate, imagination, hope, fear'. C.G.Jung CW 13:206 citing [[Martin Ruland the Younger|Martin Ruland]],'They emanate from the soul in man. Fancy, imagination, speculative faculty, etc. are included under the term.' – from ''Lexicon Alchemiae'' (1612)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Paracelsus]] (which are discussed by Libavius in ''Alchemia'') are a quaternity of differentiated virtues or psychic entities which represent a complete wholeness or totality in sum.

==Psychological associations==

The role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed at length by [[Carl Gustav Jung]]. Much of his in-depth study and observations upon the function and role of the quaternity in religious symbolism is applicable to the Layer Quaternity. To Jung the quaternity was a natural expression of differentiation which always represents a totality, citing the four elements, the four seasons, the ancient Greek schemata of the [[four humours]], and the [[four temperaments]], as well as the four Evangelists with their respective emblems in the form of the [[tetramorph]] in Christian iconography, as examples.  

The symbolism of the four entities of the Layer Quaternity exemplify Jung's observation that individuation develops through psychic qualities consisting of two pairs of opposites, which are often polarised to each other.&lt;ref&gt; C.G. Jung 'The Quaternio and the mediating role of Mercurius' 

CW 14 para. 5 – 13 pub. RKP 1955
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung 'The Quaternity of the Homo Maximus' 

CW 13 para. 206 -209 pub. RKP 1968

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G.Jung 'The Philosophical Tree'(1954) 3.The Tetrasomia CW 13 para. 358-68 RKP 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; C.G. Jung 'The Concept of the Quaternity' CW 11 para. 243 – 267 and CW 11 para. 268 -279 pub. RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the Layer Quaternity may be viewed as exemplary of Renaissance-era psychology. Its four highly-symbolic figurine entities are simultaneously, a 'map' of the psyche, and a highly-original alchemical [[mandala]] in western funerary art.&lt;ref&gt;The Layer Monument: An introduction and interpretation as an alchemical mandala.

[[File:تک شاخ هخامنشی.jpg|thumb|240px|Winged aurochs, 510 BC, [[Palace of Darius in Susa]], Susa, Iran ([[Louvre]])]]

The '''unicorn''' is a [[legendary creature]] that has been described since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and was mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] in accounts of [[natural history]] by various writers, including [[Ctesias]], [[Strabo]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|year=1911|volume=27|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] also describes an animal, the [[re'em]], which some versions translate as ''unicorn''.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white [[horse]]-like or [[goat]]-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], it was commonly described as an extremely wild [[forest|woodland]] creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the [[narwhal]] was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.

== History ==
=== In antiquity ===
[[File:Indus civilisation seal unicorn at Indian Museum, Kolkata.jpg|thumb|Unicorn seal of Indus Valley, [[Indian Museum]]]]
[[File:wesh unicorn statue.jpg|thumb|right|Gilt statue of a unicorn on the [[City Hall, Bristol]]]]

A number of seals seemingly depicting unicorns have been found from the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. These have also been interpreted as representations of [[aurochs]]—a type of large wild cattle that formerly inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa—or derivatives of aurochs, because the animal is always shown in profile, indicating there may have supposed to have been another horn, which is not seen.&lt;ref&gt;Geer, Alexandra Anna Enrica van der (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ3quxh9gsgC Animals in stone: Indian mammals sculptured through time]''. Brill, Leiden. {{ISBN|90-04-16819-2}}. pp. 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicorns are not found in [[Greek mythology]], but rather in the accounts of [[natural history]], for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from [[Ctesias]], who in his book ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indika]]'' ("On [[India]]") described them as [[Onager|wild ass]]es, fleet of foot, having a horn a [[cubit]] and a half ({{Convert|700|mm|in|disp = comma|abbr = in}}) in length, and colored white, red and black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He states, from report, that "it is impossible to take this ferocious beast alive; and that all its strength lies in its horn.

[[File:Wildweibchen mit Einhorn.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Wild woman with unicorn,'' c. 1500–1510 ([[Basel Historical Museum]])]]

[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from [[Re'em|biblical]] and ancient sources, and the creature was variously represented as a kind of [[Onager|wild ass]], [[goat]], or [[horse]].

The predecessor of the medieval [[bestiary]], compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] and known as ''[[Physiologus]]'' (''Φυσιολόγος''), popularized an elaborate [[allegory]] in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]), stood for the [[Incarnation]]. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of [[Sacred art|religious art.]] Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a [[Virginity|virgin]]; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.

The unicorn also figured in [[courtly love|courtly terms]]: for some 13th-century [[France|French]] authors such as [[Theobald I of Navarre|Thibaut of Champagne]] and [[Richard de Fournival]], the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in [[Petrarch]]'s ''Triumph of Chastity'', and on the reverse of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband [[Federico da Montefeltro]] (painted ''c'' 1472-74), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn by a pair of unicorns.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, 2002. ''Piero della Francesca'', pp260-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Throne Chair of Denmark]] is made of "unicorn horns" – almost certainly [[narwhal]] tusks. The same material was used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following classical authors.

The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time [[Marco Polo]] described them as "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in [[mud]] and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Noah |title=The Story of Marco Polo |date=1898 |publisher=Palala Press (originally The Century Co.) |isbn=978-1341338465 |page=221 |edition=2015 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[German language|German]], since the 16th century, ''Einhorn'' ("one-horn") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.

==== Alicorn ====
{{Main article|Unicorn horn}}

The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called '''alicorn''', and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The [[Danish people|Danish]] physician [[Ole Worm]] determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mythical creatures|author=Linda S Godfrey|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=2009|page=28|isbn=978-0-7910-9394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of [[narwhal]]s or horns of various animals, has been sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exotic Zoology|author=Willy Ley|year=1962|publisher=Viking Press|pages=20–22|oclc=4049353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make "cures" and sell them. Cups were made from alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of [[ivory]] or [[walrus]] ivory. Entire horns were very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shepard, Odell|title=The Lore of the Unicorn|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/lou/index.htm|publisher=London, Unwin and Allen|year=1930|isbn=978-1-4375-0853-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
[[File:Französischer Tapisseur (15. Jahrhundert) 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Maiden with Unicorn'', tapestry, 15th century ([[Musée de Cluny]], [[Paris]])]]

One traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by a virgin.

[[File:The Hunt of the Unicorn Tapestry 7.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The Unicorn Is Penned,'' Unicorn Tapestries, c. 1495–1505 ([[The Cloisters]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]])]]
[[File:Frederik vi in coronationrobes1830.jpg|thumb|The [[Throne Chair of Denmark|unicorn throne]] in [[Denmark]].]]

In one of his notebooks [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalleonardo.org/work.php?id=438 (Ashmolean Museum) "Young woman seated in a landscape with a unicorn", Leonardo, Late 1470s]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The famous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] series of seven [[tapestry]] hangings ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' are a high point in [[Europe]]an tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in [[the Cloisters]] division of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the series, richly dressed [[Nobility|noblemen]], accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against ''[[mille-fleur]]'' backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, "The Unicorn in Captivity", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a [[pomegranate]] tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the [[Low Countries]], probably [[Brussels]] or [[Liège (city)|Liège]], for an unknown patron. A set of six [[engraving]]s on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist [[Jean Duvet]] in the 1540s.

Another famous set of six tapestries of ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn|Dame à la licorne]]'' ("Lady with the unicorn") in the [[Musée de Cluny]], [[Paris]], were also woven in the [[Southern Netherlands]] before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love ("A mon seul desir" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in [[Stirling Castle]], [[Scotland]], to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|16th-century inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient unicorn tapestries recreated at Stirling Castle|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-33237947|website=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' in religious art combined the [[Annunciation to Mary]] with the themes of the ''Hunt of the Unicorn'' and ''Virgin and Unicorn'', so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The [[Council of Trent]] finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 52-4 &amp; figs 126-9, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}, [http://www.sagen.at/fotos/data/603/medium/Maria_Gail_HortusConclusus_Detail.jpg another image]&lt;/ref&gt; partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.

[[Shakespeare]] scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Shakespeare'', Fourth Edition, [[David Bevington]], pg. 1281;''The Norton Shakespeare'', Second Edition, pg 2310, footnote 9; ''[[The Riverside Shakespeare]]'', Second Edition, page 1515&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Timon of Athens]], Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: "wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury".)

=== Heraldry ===
In [[heraldry]], a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead&lt;ref name="friar"&gt;{{cite book

Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt; Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.

=== Scotland ===
{{See also|The Lion and the Unicorn}}
In heraldry the unicorn is best known as the symbol of [[Scotland]]. The unicorn was chosen because it was seen as a proud and haughty beast which would rather die than be captured, just as Scots would fight to remain sovereign and unconquered.&lt;ref name=Nisbet&gt;{{cite book|last=Nisbet|first=Alexander|title=A System of Heraldry|publisher=William Blackwood|location=Edinburgh|date=1816|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/304/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two unicorns supported the [[royal arms of Scotland|royal arms]] of the King of Scots, and since the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 union]] of England and Scotland, the [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence.

Golden coins known as the [[unicorn (coin)|unicorn]] and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the [[obverse]], were used in Scotland in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of [[Mercat cross]]es, and denoted that the settlement was a [[royal burgh]]. Certain noblemen such as the [[Earl of Kinnoull]] were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an [[augmentation of honour]].&lt;ref name=Nisbet/&gt;   The crest for [[Clan Cunningham]] bears a unicorn head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U5pkxvtxyr8C&amp;q=clan+cunningham+unicorn&amp;dq=clan+cunningham+unicorn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4vZullfDMAhVJU1IKHdcCADwQ6AEIIDABClans &amp; tartans] George Way, Romilly Squire; HarperCollins, 1995; page 84 "Cunningham CREST A unicorn's head couped Argent armed Or MOTTO 'Over fork over'&lt;/ref&gt;

An animal called the ''[[re’em]]'' ({{lang-he|רְאֵם}}) is mentioned in several places in the [[Hebrew Bible]], often as a metaphor representing strength. "The allusions to the ''re'em'' as a wild, un-tamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns (Job xxxix. 9–12; Ps. xxii. 21, xxix. 6; Num. xxiii. 22, xxiv. 8; Deut. xxxiii. 17; comp. Ps. xcii. 11), best fit the [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius''). This view is supported by the Assyrian ''rimu,'' which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=27&amp;letter=U ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; This animal was often depicted in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n art in profile, with only one horn visible.

The translators of the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] (1611) followed the Greek [[Septuagint]] (''monokeros'') and the Latin [[Vulgate]] (''unicornis'')&lt;ref&gt;Ps 21:22, Ps 28:6, Ps 77:69, Ps 91:11, Is 34:7. The Latin ''rhinoceros'' is employed in Nm 23:22, Nm24:8, Dt 33:17, Job 39:9–10&lt;/ref&gt; and employed ''unicorn'' to translate ''re'em'', providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its un-tamable nature. The [[American Standard Version]] translates this term "wild ox" in each case.

The classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the ''Re'em'' animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the [[Talmud]] debate the proposition that the ''[[Tahash]]'' animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned [[kosher]] creature that existed in Moses' time, or that it was similar to the ''keresh'' animal described in [[Morris Jastrow]]'s Talmudic dictionary as "a kind of antelope, unicorn".&lt;ref&gt;[http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_28.html Babylonian Talmud, ''Mo'ed, Shabbath'' 28ab]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese mythology===
[[File:Pottery unicorn. Northern Wei (386-534 CE).jpg|thumb|left|Pottery Unicorn. Northern Wei. Shaanxi History Museum]]
The ''[[qilin]]'' ({{zh|c=麒麟}}), a creature in [[Chinese mythology]], is sometimes called "the Chinese unicorn", and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a [[:Category:Mythological hybrids|hybrid animal]] that looks less unicorn than [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] and a long forwardly-curved horn. The [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] version (''kirin'') more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese ''qilin''. The Quẻ Ly of [[Vietnam]]ese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated "unicorn" is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of [[Tây Nguyên]]. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the [[Korean Central News Agency|Korea News Service]], reported that the [[Kiringul]] had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by [[King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lair of King Tongmyong's Unicorn Reconfirmed in DPRK|date=November 29, 2012|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news29/20121129-20ee.html|publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203012958/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news29/20121129-20ee.html|archivedate=December 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Ben|title=Unicorn lair 'discovered' in North Korea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/unicorn-lair-discovered-north-korea|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the [[Ming Dynasty]], the ''qilin'' became associated with [[giraffe]]s, after [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|voyage]] to [[East Africa]] brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in [[Nanjing]] as ''qilin''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M.

==Plot==
The book details humorous anecdotes and stories of Hart's life, with a cocktail recipe accompanying each chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube star and author Mamrie Hart made us a custom cocktail|url=http://fusion.net/video/139914/youtube-star-and-author-mamrie-hart-made-us-a-custom-cocktail/|publisher=Fusion|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''You Deserve a Drink'' was generally well-received by reviewers. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', actor and comedian [[Michael Ian Black]] stated that "Hart is a pull-no-punches comedian with a talent for self-deprecation in the guise of self-aggrandizement, a winning formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Michael|title=Humor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/humor.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleen Stinchcombe, writer for [[SheKnows Media|She Knows]] said that "She is undeniably a funny lady, and her humor translates beautifully — even more powerfully, I'd argue — to the page. Her jokes have more time to build, her punchlines land harder. She's created an entirely hilarious read that will delight her current fans by giving them a pitcher-sized serving of her normally shot-sized jokes and entice new readers who have enjoyed recent books by other humor heavy-hitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stinchcombe|first1=Colleen|title=Mamrie Hart's new memoir is a hilarious lesson in radical self-acceptance|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1084050/you-deserve-a-drink-is-a-book-about-radical-self-acceptance|publisher=She Knows|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zuhair Fayez Partnership''' ('''ZFP''') ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''شركة زهير فايز ومشاركوه''), formerly Zuhair Fayez and Associates (ZFA), is an Architectural, Engineering, Project Management, Construction Management, and Engineering Information System consultancy firm in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

== History ==

Zuhair Fayez Partnership was established in 1975 as Zuhair Fayez and Associates and started with a small number of professional architects, engineers, planners, and support staff. The growing number of commissions and projects eventually prompted the organization to open an office in London to meet the demand.

Eight departments were initially formed: Design, Architectural Production, Structural Engineering, Civil Engineering, HVAC, Specifications, and Quantity Surveying departments. However, the demand for professional management and supervision of large scale projects led to the creation of the Project Management and Construction Management departments to effectively monitor and control all contractors and subcontractors' work on any construction project.

In 1991, the organization launched its Information Technology division to provide clients with software and hardware solutions. The division handled the software integration of Maintenance Management Systems (MMS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Facilities Management Systems (FMS) into a single Graphical User Interface (GUI). In the same year, the Engineering Information Systems division was formed and is responsible for on-site implementation and provision of GIS, MMS, and FMS based on the clients' needs and requirements.

Zuhair Fayez Partnership's Quality Assurance department was formed in 1993. On the 16th of January, ZFP acquired ISO 9001 + TickIT certification, the first ever awarded to a consultancy firm of their scope of work in the Middle East.

ZFP partnered with [[Avaya]] in May 2011 to create a virtual computing environment (VCE). The purpose is to enable the organization to provide virtual services in a cloud-based environment that would serve 3000 users in 5 branches and 20 remote sites and maximize the efficiency of its existing IT resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia’s Zuhair Fayez Partnership selects Avaya to create virtual computing environment for growing consultancy business|url=http://ameinfo.com/blog/company-news/a/avaya/saudi-arabias-zuhair-fayez-partnership-selects-avaya-to-create-virtual-computing-environment-for-growing-consultancy-business/|website=www.ameinfo.com|publisher=AMEinfo.com|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[SNC-Lavalin]] acquired ZFP's industrial division in Khobar to form SNC-Lavalin Fayez Engineering, a joint-venture with ZFP, in response to Saudi Aramco's General Engineering Services Plus (GES+) initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SNC-Lavalin Saudi JV acquires KSA engineering firm|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-17830-snc-lavalin-saudi-jv-acquires-ksa-engineering-firm/|publisher=Construction Week|date=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Zuhair Fayez Partnership was assigned to build a new campus for the American International School of Jeddah to accommodate 1,700 students. The announcement was made at ZFP's main headquarters during the groundbreaking ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jiffry |first1=Fadia |title=Jeddah's American school to build new campus |url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/573671 |work=Arab News |publisher=Arab News |date=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XE0BU0yl |archivedate=March 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
