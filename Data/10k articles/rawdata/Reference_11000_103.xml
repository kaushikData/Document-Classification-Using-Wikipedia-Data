Indonesian author [[Amir Hamzah]] (1911–46) wrote 50&amp;nbsp;[[poem]]s, 18&amp;nbsp;pieces of [[prose poetry|lyrical prose]], 12&amp;nbsp;[[Article (publishing)|articles]], 4&amp;nbsp;[[short story|short stories]], 3&amp;nbsp;[[poetry collection]]s, and 1&amp;nbsp;[[book]]. He also translated 44&amp;nbsp;poems, 1&amp;nbsp;piece of lyrical prose, and 1&amp;nbsp;book. The majority of Amir's original poems are included in his collections ''[[Njanji Soenji]]'' (1937) and ''[[Boeah Rindoe]]'' (1941), both first published in the literary magazine ''[[Poedjangga Baroe]]''. His translated poems were collected in ''Setanggi Timoer'' (1939). In 1962 documentarian [[HB Jassin]] compiled all of Amir's remaining works&amp;nbsp;– except the book ''Sastera Melajoe Lama dan Radja-Radja'nja''&amp;nbsp;– as ''Amir Hamzah: Radja Penjair Pudjangga Baru''.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=41}}

Born in [[Langkat Regency|Langkat]] to [[Malay people|Malay]] nobility, Amir completed his education at schools run by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] in several cities on [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]].{{sfn|Language Center, Amir Hamzah}} By 1928 he had enrolled in a [[Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs]] (junior high school) in the colonial capital of Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]); he wrote his first poems during this period.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|pp=8–9}} His first published works, poems entitled "Maboek..." ("Nauseous...") and "Soenji" ("Silent"), appeared in the March 1932 issue of the magazine ''[[Timboel]]''; by the end of the year he had published his first short stories and lyrical prose, some in ''Timboel'' and some in the magazine ''[[Pandji Poestaka]]''.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|pp=211–219}}

One of these works, a lyrical prose piece entitled "Poedjangga Baroe" ("New Writer"), was meant to promote the magazine of the same name that Amir established in collaboration with [[Armijn Pane]] and [[Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana]].{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|pp=14–17}} The magazine, first released in July 1933, published the vast majority of Amir's writings; most were written before 1935, then published later. Forced to return to Langkat and marry in 1937, Amir became a representative of the nascent national government after the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945. The following year he was captured, detained, and later executed during a [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communist Party]]-led revolution;{{sfn|Language Center, Amir Hamzah}} his last writing, a [[Literary fragment|fragment]] from his 1941 poem "Boeah Rindoe", was later found in his cell.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=214}}

His earliest poems followed the conventions of traditional ''[[pantun]]s'', including a four-line structure and [[rhyming couplets]].{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=130}} Later works departed from this traditional structure, although Jassin considers Amir to have maintained an unmistakably Malay style of writing.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=15}} Themes in his work varied: ''Boeah Rindoe'', chronologically the first anthology written, was filled with a sense of longing and loss, while works in ''Njanji Soenji'' tended to be distinctly religious.{{sfn|Balfas|1976|pp=62–64}} Amir received wide recognition for his poems; Jassin dubbed him the "King of the ''Poedjangga Baroe''-era Poets",{{sfn|Jassin|1962|loc=cover}} while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature [[A. Teeuw]] described Amir as the only international-class Indonesian poet from before the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=123}}

The following list is divided into tables based on the type of works contained within. The tables are initially arranged alphabetically by title, although they are also sortable. Titles are in the [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|original spelling]], with a literal English translation underneath. Untitled works are recorded with their first words in parentheses. Years given are for the first publication; later reprintings are not counted. Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on the one compiled by {{harvtxt|Jassin|1962|pp=211–219}}.

{{Distinguish|Anti-Japaneseism}}

'''Anti-Japanese sentiment''' (also called '''Japanophobia''', '''Nipponophobia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emmott|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''anti-Japanism''') involves the hatred or fear of anything Japanese. Its opposite is [[Japanophilia]].

Anti-Japanese sentiments range from [[wikt:animosity|animosity]] towards the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]'s actions and [[Contempt|disdain]] for Japanese culture to [[racism]] against the [[Japanese people]]. Sentiments of dehumanization have been fueled by the [[American propaganda during World War II#Anti-Japanese|anti-Japanese propaganda]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] governments in [[World War II]]; this propaganda was often of a racially disparaging character.

In the past, anti-Japanese sentiment contained innuendos of Japanese people as [[Barbarian|barbaric]]. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, Japan was intent to [[Westernization|adopt Western ways]] in an attempt to join the West as an industrialized imperial power, but a lack of acceptance of the Japanese in the West complicated integration and assimilation. One commonly held view was that the Japanese were evolutionarily inferior. {{harv|Navarro|2000|loc=[https://www.msu.edu/~navarro6/srop.html#U.S. "...&amp;nbsp;a date which will live in infamy"]}} Japanese culture was viewed with suspicion and even disdain.

While passions have settled somewhat since Japan's surrender in World War II, tempers continue to flare on occasion over the widespread perception that the Japanese government has made insufficient penance for their past atrocities, or has sought to whitewash the history of these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Periodically, individuals within Japan spur external criticism.

Some anti-Japanese sentiment originates from business practices used by some Japanese companies, such as [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]].

{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States}}

====Pre-20th century====
In the [[United States]], anti-Japanese sentiment had its beginnings well before the Second World War. As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subject to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Asians, and sometimes Japanese in particular. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Early 20th century====
[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown c. 1940]]

Anti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had intensified after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.

The invasion of China in 1931 and the conquest of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.

When the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].

====During World War II====
[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|left|upright|thumb|An American propaganda poster - "Death-trap for the Jap."]]
[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man was later detained nonetheless. This [[Dorothea Lange]] photograph was taken in March 1942, just prior to the [[Japanese American internment]].]]

The most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment outside of Asia had its beginning in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight against the [[Empire of Japan]] and its allies, the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

The surprise attack at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] prior to a [[declaration of war]] was presented to the American populace as an act of treachery and cowardice. Following the attack many non-governmental "[[Jap hunts|Jap hunting]] licenses" were circulated around the country. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article on how to tell a Japanese from a Chinese person by the shape of the nose and the stature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment. Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs). Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.

Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American "conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs."&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p55&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reasoning is supported by [[Niall Ferguson]], who says that "Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] &amp;mdash; as [[Untermensch]]en."&lt;ref&gt;Niall Fergusson, "Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat", ''War in History'', 2004, 11 (2): p.182&lt;/ref&gt; Weingartner believes this explains the fact that a mere 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p54 /&gt;
Ulrich Straus, a U.S. [[Japanology|Japanologist]], believes that front line troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were "not easily persuaded" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered, got "no mercy" from the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&amp;sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender, in order to make surprise attacks.&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/&gt; Therefore, according to Straus, "[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/&gt;

=====Decision to drop the atomic bombs=====
{{See also|Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
Weingartner argues that there is a common cause between the mutilation of Japanese war dead and the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p55-56&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy, saying, "[T]he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands."&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p67&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day after the Nagasaki bomb, Truman stated: "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them.

====Since World War II====
In the 1970s and 1980s, the waning fortunes of heavy industry in the United States prompted layoffs and hiring slowdowns just as counterpart businesses in Japan were making major inroads into U.S. markets. Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the USA and Canada Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) where its products were sold as [[captive import|captives]]). The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.

Other highly symbolic deals — including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[7-Eleven]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms — further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.

Popular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination (with a Japanese majority population and culture), perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' written by [[Philip K. Dick]], the same author on which the film was based, in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book, ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.

As argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious "Japan-bashing" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy. In 1982, Ernest Boyer, a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, publicly declared that, "What we need is another Sputnik" to re-boot American education, and that "maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit."&lt;ref name=Thorsten2012p150&gt;{{Harvnb|Thorsten|2012|p=150n1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, merging with the image of Asian-Americans as the "model minority."

Both the animosity and super-humanizing which peaked in the 1980s, when the term "Japan bashing" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.

===China===
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}
[[File:Japanese-and-dogs-are-not-allowed statement from a restaurant in Higher Education Mega Center 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster outside of a restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]
Anti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan, Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (post-1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the [[Twenty-One Demands]] by the Japanese government led to a serious [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China.

Today, bitterness in China persists&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25411700 China and Japan: Seven decades of bitterness]". BBC News, 13 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and Japan's post-war actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, Japanese government employment of known past war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. From elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail, for example, thousands of children are brought to the [[Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression]] in Beijing by their elementary schools to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labour,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.1937china.org.cn/wmskz/shaiww/wwshiliao/20140407/20516.shtml]"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nanking Massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-02/27/c_133147912.htm People visit Museum of War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing]". Xinhuanet, 27 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and the issues of [[comfort women]]. After viewing the museum, the children's hatred of the Japanese people was reported to increase significantly. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the Second World War, discussions about the Japanese conduct can still evoke powerful emotions today, in part because most Japanese are aware of what happened but their society has never engaged in the type of introspection common in Germany after the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Forney, "[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html Why China Loves to Hate Japan]". Time Magazine, 10 December 2005., accessed 25 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the usage of Japanese military symbols are still controversial in China, such as the incident of Chinese pop singer [[Zhao Wei]] seen wearing a Japanese War Flag dress for a fashion magazine photo shoot in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.china.org.cn/english/23647.htm Chinese Pop Singer Under Fire for Japan War Flag Dress]". China.org, 13 December 2001., accessed 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Huge responses were seen on the Internet; a public letter from a Nanking Massacre survivor was sent demanding a public apology, and the singer was even attacked.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KtgYJI0Lo4AC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=zhao+wei+japanese+flag+feces&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CRAdExEV_y&amp;sig=NI7X1qZFQ0qKfVhb88o-rZLUGmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uJZMU_WPBKTG2wXxloGACA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=zhao%20wei%20japanese%20flag%20feces&amp;f=false Chinese Media]". Lee Chin-Chuan, 2003., accessed 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 BBC World Service Poll, only 22% of Chinese people view Japan's influence positively, with 75% expressing a negative view, making China the most anti-Japanese nation in the world.&lt;ref name="BBC2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2017_country_ratings/BBC2017_Country_Ratings_Poll.pdf |title=2017 BBC World Service poll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-Japanese film industry====
Anti-Japanese sentiment can be seen in anti-Japanese war films currently produced and displayed in mainland China. More than 200 anti-Japanese films were made in China in 2012 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lague |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/25/us-china-japan-specialreport-idUSBRE94O0CJ20130525 |title=Special Report: Why China's film makers love to hate Japan |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=19 October 2013 |date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one particular situation involving a more moderate anti-Japanese war film, the government of China banned the 2000 film, "Devils at the Doorstep", because it depicted a Japanese soldier being friendly with Chinese villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forney |first=Matthew |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html |title=Why China Bashes Japan |publisher=TIME |date=10 December 2005 |accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea}}

The issue of anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea is complex and multi-faceted. Anti-Japanese attitudes in the Korean Peninsula can be traced as far back as the [[Wokou|Japanese pirate raids]] and [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]], but are largely a product of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] from 1910–1945, and subsequent revisionism in history textbooks used in Japan's educational system after World War II.

Today, issues of [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], Japanese policy regarding World War II, and [[Japanese-Korean disputes#Geographic disputes|geographic disputes]] between the two countries perpetuate this sentiment, and these issues often incur huge disputes between Japanese and South Korean Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2007050801032630065004|accessdate=8 May 2008|title=Munhwa Newspaper (in Korean)}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea, together with mainland China, may be considered as among the most intensely anti-Japanese societies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=016&amp;aid=0000181991|date=8 May 2008|title=60th Anniversary of Independence.

===Taiwan===
[[File:2012 Anti-Japan demonstrations7.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators in Taiwan host signs telling "Japanese devils" to "get out" of the [[Senkaku Islands]] following an [[Senkaku Islands dispute|escalation in disputes]] in 2012.]]
During the [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations]] in East Asia, Taiwan remained noticeably quieter than the PRC or Korea, with Taiwan-Japan relations regarded at an all-time high. The [[KMT]] majority-takeover in 2008 followed by a boating accident resulting in Taiwanese deaths has created recent tensions, however. Taiwanese officials began speaking out on historical territory disputes regarding the Diaoyutai/Senkaku Islands, resulting in an increase in at least perceived anti-Japanese sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Various, Editorials. The Yomiuri Shimbun, 18 June 2008. ([http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/editorial/20080618TDY04306.htm in Japanese]), accessed 8 July 2008{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
[[File:Anti-Japan2.png|thumb|A propaganda newspaper clipping that refers to the [[Bataan Death March]] in 1942, which was distributed and sparked outrage worldwide.]]

Anti-Japanese sentiment traces back to World War II and the aftermath of the war, where an estimated one million Filipinos, of a wartime population of 17 million, were killed during the war, and many more injured. Nearly every Filipino family was hurt by the war on some level. Most notably in the city of [[Candaba, Pampanga|Mapanique]], survivors recount the Japanese occupation with Filipino men being massacred and dozens of women being herded to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines is considered to have un-antagonistic relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are about the claim from some quarters that these atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. It is the result of the huge Japanese aid sent to the country during the 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/world/asia/12iht-phils.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Carlos H. | last=Conde | title=Letter from the Philippines: Long afterward, war still wears onFilipinos | date=13 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Davao Region|Davao]] in [[Mindanao]] had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the [[White Australia policy]] was partly inspired by fears in the late 19th century that if large numbers of Asian immigrants were allowed, they would have a severe and adverse effect on wages, the earnings of small business people and other elements of the standard of living. Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to 1900 (perhaps most significantly in the town of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]). By the late 1930s, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia itself]]. This resulted in a ban on [[iron ore]] exports to the Empire of Japan, from 1938. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered (or attempted to surrender) to Japanese soldiers, most famously the ritual beheading of [[Leonard Siffleet]], which was photographed, as well as incidents of cannibalism and the shooting down of ejected pilots' parachutes. Anti-Japanese feelings were particularly provoked by the sinking of the unarmed [[AHS Centaur|Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']] (painted white and with [[Red Cross]] markings), with 268 dead. Treatment of Australians prisoners of war was also a factor, with over 2,800 Australian POWs dying on the [[Burma Railway]] alone.

===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===
In the [[Russian Empire]], the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East, leaving them humiliated. Later, during the [[Russian Civil War]], Japan was part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied interventionist forces]] that helped to occupy [[Vladivostok]] until October 1922 with a puppet White government under [[Grigory Semenov|Grigorii Semenov]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Red Army]] accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 [[Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union|Japanese POWs]] after Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown. Presumably, many were deported to China or North Korea to serve as forced laborers and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=23 February 2007 |title=Russia Acknowledges Sending Japanese Prisoners of War to North Korea |publisher=Mosnews.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061113081334/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |archivedate=13 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yasukuni Shrine==
{{Main|Controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine}}

The Yasukuni Shrine is a [[Shinto]] shrine in [[Tokyo]], Japan. It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean and Taiwanese soldiers killed in various wars, mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 [[crime against peace|Class A criminals]] such as [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kōki Hirota]], who were convicted and [[execution|executed]] for their roles in the Japanese invasions of China, Korea, and other parts of East Asia after the remission to them under [[Treaty of San Francisco]]. A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.

In recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and its neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that "&lt;nowiki&gt;[war]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors" and that the war criminals were "cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces". While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former [[Prime Minister of Japan]], Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. [[Yasuo Fukuda]], chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised "not to visit" Yasukuni.&lt;ref&gt;Blaine Harden, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300112.html Party Elder To Be Japan's New Premier]", ''Washington Post'', 24 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derogatory terms==
There are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as [[racism|racist]]. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.

===In English===
*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word "'''[[Jap]]'''" or "'''[[Nip]]'''" (short for ''Nippon'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "Japan") has been used in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a derogatory word for the Japanese. Tojo is also a racial slur from World War 2, but has since died out.

===In Chinese===
*'''''[[Riben guizi]]''''' ({{lang-zh|日本鬼子}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; [[Pinyin|Mandarin]]: Rìběn guǐzi) – literally "Japanese devils" or "Japanese monsters". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]]. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named [[Hinomoto Oniko]], which is an alternate reading in Japanese.
*'''''[[Wokou]]''''' ({{lang-zh|倭寇}}; {{lang-zh|p=wōkòu}}) – originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] being called "[[Hun]]s"). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.
*'''''[[Xiao Riben]]''''' ({{lang-zh|小日本}}; {{lang-zh|p=xiǎo Rìběn}}) – literally "puny Japan(ese)", or literally "little Japan(ese)". This term is very common ([[Google]] Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.
*'''''Riben zai''''' ({{lang-zh|日本仔}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon zai; [[pinyin|Mandarin]]: Rìběn zǎi) – this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word "Jap". The term literally translates to "Japan kid". This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.
*'''''Wo''''' ({{lang-zh|倭}}; {{lang-zh|p=wō}}) – this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean "dwarf", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]].
*'''''Riben gou''''' ({{lang-zh|日本狗}}; Cantonese: Yatboon gau; {{lang-zh|p=Rìběn gǒu}}) – "Japanese dogs". The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.
*'''''Da jiaopen zu''''' ({{lang-zh|大腳盆族}}; {{lang-zh|p=dà jiǎopén zú}}) – "big foot-basin race". Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of [[Tianjin]].
*'''''Huang jun''''' ({{lang-zh|黃軍}}; {{lang-zh|p=huáng jūn}}) – "Yellow Army", a pun on "皇軍" (homophone ''huáng jūn'', "Imperial Army"), used during World War II to represent [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese soldiers]] due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), ''huang jun'' is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus "appear like" Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese [[comfort women|forcing women into prostitution]] during World War II.
*'''''Zi wei dui''''' ({{lang-zh|自慰隊}}; Cantonese: zi wai dui; {{lang-zh|p=zì wèi duì}}) – a pun on the homophone "自衛隊" (same pronunciation, "self-defense forces", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of "慰" (Cantonese: wai; pinyin: ''wèi'') used is "to comfort". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as "自衛隊") being [[Stereotypes of East Asians#Predators of white women|stereotypically hypersexual]], as "自慰隊" means "self-comforting forces", referring to [[masturbation]].
*'''''Ga zai''''' / '''''Ga mui''''' ({{lang-zh|架仔 / 架妹}}; Cantonese: ga zai / ga mui) – used only by Cantonese speakers to call Japanese men / young girls. "架" (''ga'') came from the frequent use of simple vowels (''-a'' in this case) in Japanese language. "仔" (''jai'') means "little boy(s)", with relations to the stereotype of short Japanese men. "妹" (''mui'') means "young girl(s)" (the speaker usually uses a lustful tone), with relations to the stereotype of disrespect to female in Japanese society. Sometimes, ''ga'' is used as an adjective to avoid using the proper word "Japanese".
*'''''Law baak tau''''' ({{lang-zh|蘿蔔頭}}; Cantonese: law baak tau; {{lang-zh|p=luo bo tou}}) – "[[daikon]] head". Commonly used by the older people in the Cantonese-speaking world to call Japanese men.

===In Korean===
*'''''[[Jjokbari]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|쪽발이}}) – translates as "a person with cloven hoof-like feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=36450500|title=Definition of Jjokbari|publisher=Naver Korean Dictionary|quote=a derogatory term for Japanese. It refers to Japanese traditional footwear [[Geta (footwear)|Geta]], which separates the thumb toe and the other four toes. [일본 사람을 낮잡아 이르는 말. 엄지발가락과 나머지 발가락들을 가르는 게다를 신는다는 데서 온 말이다.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is the most frequently used and strongest [[ethnic slur]] used by Koreans to refer to the Japanese. It refers to the traditional Japanese footwear [[Geta (footwear)|geta]] or [[tabi]], both of which feature a gap between the thumb toe and the other four toes. The term is also used by [[Koreans in Japan|ethnic Koreans in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Constantine|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Wae-in''''' ({{ko-hhrm|왜인|倭人}}) – translates as "small Japanese person", although used with strong derogatory connotations. The term refers to the ancient name of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] Japan, ''Wae'', on the basis of the stereotype that Japanese people were small (see [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]]).
*'''''Wae-nom''''' ({{ko-hhrm|왜놈|倭놈}}) – translates as "small Japanese creature" and has a similar meaning as ''waein'', although it is a stronger ethnic slur. It is used more frequently by older Korean generations, derived from the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]].
*'''''[[Wokou|Wae-gu]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|왜구|倭寇}}) – originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]], who frequently invaded Korea. The word is today used to refer to all Japanese people in an extremely negative context.

An '''archive file''' is a file that is composed of one or more [[File system|computer files]] along with [[metadata]].  Archive files are used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or simply to [[lossless compression|compress]] files to use less storage space.  Archive files often store [[directory structure]]s, [[error detection and correction]] information, arbitrary comments, and sometimes use built-in [[encryption]].

==Applications==
Archive files are particularly useful in that they store file system data and metadata within the contents of a particular file, and thus can be stored on systems or sent over channels that do not support the file system in question, only file contents – examples include sending a directory structure over email.

Beyond archival purposes, archive files are frequently used for packaging software for distribution, as software contents are often naturally spread across several files; the archive is then known as a [[Software package (disambiguation)|'''package''']]. While the archival file format is the same, there are additional conventions about contents, such as requiring a [[manifest file]], and the resulting format is known as a [[package format]]. Examples include [[Deb (file format)|deb]] for Debian, [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] for Java, and [[APK (file format)|APK]] for Android.

==Features==
Features supported by various kinds of archives include file concatenation, [[data compression]], [[encryption]], [[file spanning]], [[checksum]]s, self-extraction, self-installation, source volume and medium information, [[directory structure]] information, package notes and description, and other [[metadata]]. The [[file extension]] or [[file header]] of the archive file are indicators of the [[file format]] used. Computer archive files are created by [[file archiver]] software, [[optical disc authoring software]], and [[disk image]] software.

==Archive formats==
An '''archive format''' is the [[file format]] of an archive file.  Some formats are well-defined by their authors and have become conventions supported by multiple vendors and communities.

===Types===
* '''Archiving only''' formats only [[concatenate]] files.
* '''Compression only''' formats only compress files.
* '''Multi-function''' formats can concatenate, compress, encrypt, create error detection and recovery information, and package the archive into self-extracting and self-expanding files.
* '''Software packaging''' formats are used to create [[Software package (installation)|software packages]] that may be self-installing files.
* '''Disk image''' formats are used to create [[disk image]]s of mass storage volumes.

===Examples===
{{further|List of archive formats|Comparison of archive formats}}

[[Filename extension]]s used to distinguish different types of archives include [[ZIP (file format)|zip]], [[RAR (file format)|rar]], [[7z (file format)|7z]], and [[tar (file format)|tar]].

Java also introduced a whole family of archive extensions such as [[JAR (file format)|jar]] and [[WAR (file format)|war]] (''j'' is for Java and ''w'' is for web).  They are used to exchange entire byte-code deployment. Sometimes they are also used to exchange source code and other text, HTML and XML files. By default they are all compressed.

== Error detection and recovery ==
Archive files often include [[parity check]]s and other [[checksum]]s for [[error detection]], for instance [[Zip (file format)|zip files]] use a [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC). [[RAR archive]]s may include redundant [[error correction]] data (called recovery records).

Archive files are sometimes accompanied by separate [[parity archive]] (PAR) files that allow for additional error detection and recovery, particularly in recovery of missing files in a multi-file archive.

'''''Californian''''' was built in San Diego, launched in 1984 as a replica of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|United States Revenue Marine]] cutter {{USRC|Lawrence|1848|2}}, which operated off the coast of [[California]] in the 1850s.{{#tag:ref|USRC ''Lawrence'' was sometimes referred to as USRC ''C.W. Lawrence''; the source of her name is unclear.&lt;ref name=Canney22&gt;Canney, p 22&lt;/ref&gt; C.W. Lawrence was possibly Cornelius W. Lawrence, once the Collector of Customs of the Port Of New York&lt;ref name=USCG&gt;{{cite web|title=C. W. Lawrence, 1848|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Lawrence_1848.pdf|website=Cutters, Craft &amp; U.S. Coast Guard-Manned Army &amp; Navy Vessels|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office|accessdate=12 October 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} On July 23, 2003, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed Bill No. 965, making her the "official state [[tall ship]]" of California.&lt;ref name=netstate&gt;"California State Tall Ship", ''Californian'', netstate.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally commissioned by the Nautical Heritage Society, she has flown the [[flag of California]] up and down the coast and in ports ranging from [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]], and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Originally built and operated as a sailing school vessel based in Newport Beach.  She also represented the state at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=netstate/&gt; The model for her figurehead was actress [[Catherine Bach]], who was chosen as she was descended from one of the state's early families.&lt;ref name=Bach&gt;"Dukes' Catherine Bach Model for Tall Ship", Ocala (Florida) Star-Banner, 7 January 1985, p. 2A&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]] acquired ''Californian'' from the Nautical Heritage Society in June 2002 through a grant from the Sheila Potiker Family Foundation of San Diego. The [[California Coastal Conservancy]] provided the Maritime Museum of San Diego with a {{usd}}300,000 grant to complete restoration of the Californian in February 2003. After the overhaul was completed in August 2003 ''Californian'' returned to providing [[sail training]] and sea educational programs up and down the California coast.&lt;ref name=netstate/&gt;

'''''Castle Rock Entertainment Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group''''', 150 F.3d 132 (2nd Cir. 1998), was a U.S. [[copyright]] [[copyright infringement|infringement]] case involving the popular American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Some U.S. copyright law courses use the case to illustrate modern application of the [[fair use]] doctrine. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] upheld a lower court's [[summary judgment]] that the defendant had committed copyright infringement. The decision is noteworthy for classifying ''Seinfeld'' trivia not as unprotected facts, but as protectable expression.  The court also rejected the defendant's [[fair use]] defense finding that any transformative purpose possessed in the [[derivative work]] was "slight to non-existent" under the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', 510 U.S. 569 (1994).

== Facts of the case ==

[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] is the copyright holder and producer of each episode of the sitcom, ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Beth Golub wrote ''SAT: The Seinfeld Aptitude Test'' a 132-page book containing 643 trivia questions and answers about the events and characters depicted in ''Seinfeld'' through her publisher, Carol Publishing Group. The book contained 211 multiple choice questions, in which only one out of three to five answers were correct; 93 matching questions; and a number of short-answer questions. The questions were divided into five levels of difficulty, labeled (in increasing order of difficulty) "Wuss Questions," "This, That, and the Other Questions," "Tough Monkey Questions," "Atomic Wedgie Questions," and "[[Master of Your Domain]] Questions." 
An example from the public record of one of the "Wuss Questions":

{{quote|1. To impress a woman, George passes himself off as

:a) a gynecologist

:b) a geologist

:c) a marine biologist

:d) a meteorologist}}

The book drew from 84 ''Seinfeld'' episodes that had been broadcast as of the time that the Carol Group published ''The SAT''. While Golub had created the incorrect answers, the questions and correct answers were grounded in some part to a ''Seinfeld'' episode. A significant number of questions contained dialogue from the show.  The name "Seinfeld" was displayed prominently throughout the book, and it contained pictures of the show's actors on several pages.  The back cover contained a disclaimer which read, "This book has not been approved or licensed by any entity involved in creating or producing ''Seinfeld''."

At first publication, the book did not provoke a [[lawsuit]].  Instead, [[NBC]] requested several free copies and distributed them with promotions for the program. One of the show's [[executive producers]] exclaimed that ''The SAT'' was a "fun little book." ''Seinfeld'''s audience grew after ''The SAT'' was first published. Nevertheless, Castle Rock had been very selective in its [[license]]s of ''Seinfeld'' merchandise, and had rejected numerous products previously to the publication of ''The SAT''.

== Procedural history ==

In November 1994, Castle Rock contacted Carol Publishing Group concerning its copyright and [[trademark]] infringement claims. Carol Publishing continued to publish ''The SAT'' and in February 1995, Castle Rock filed an action in [[Federal District Court]] alleging federal copyright and trademark infringement and state law unfair competition. Both defendant and plaintiff moved for [[summary judgment]].

Castle Rock succeeded in its motion for summary judgment. In 1997, Judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] held that Carol had infringed on Castle Rock's copyrights in ''Seinfeld'' and further that the copying was not [[fair use]]. The district court entered final judgment against Carol and awarded Castle Rock $403,000 with interest in [[damages]].  It [[injunction|permanently enjoined]] Carol from publishing or distributing ''The SAT'', and ordered that all copies in Carol's possession be destroyed. Carol [[appeal]]ed.

== Ruling of the appeals court ==
=== Plaintiff has a ''prima facie'' case for copyright infringement ===
The appeals court noted that there was no dispute as to whether Castle Rock owned a valid copyright in ''Seinfeld'' nor was it disputed that Carol Publishing copied material from the shows.  The question was only of misappropriation of protectable material.

The appeals court employed both a "qualitative vs. quantitative" method and a "total concept and feel" approach in determining if Carol Publishing had misappropriated ''Seinfeld''.

The qualitative vs. quantitative approach sought to determine if the quality of the copied work was actionable in an infringement lawsuit and if the quantity of the copied work was enough to stake a claim.  The court chose to take the ''Seinfeld'' series as a whole, rather than compare the quantity of copied work from each of the 84 episodes individually.  Altogether, ''The SAT'' contained 643 fragments from the entire series.  The court held that this was a sufficient quantity of copying to overcome the ''[[de minimis]]'' threshold alleged by Carol Publishing.  When analyzing the quality of the copied material, the court rejected the defendant's position that ''Seinfeld'' trivia constituted facts and was therefore not covered by copyright protection.  It reasoned that the "facts" portrayed in ''Seinfeld'' originated in the fictitious expression by the writers of the show.  The court noted that the book did not quiz readers on such facts as the location of the ''Seinfeld'' set or the biographies of the actors, but on characters and events springing from the imagination of the show's authors.  Normally, the court would have eliminated those elements that did not meet the quality requirements through the subtraction method in misappropriation analysis, but in finding nothing to subtract the court held that the plaintiffs had established a ''[[prima facie]]'' case.

Nevertheless, Carol Publishing urged the court to consider the "total concept and feel" approach rather than the subtraction method.  The court noted that because the two works were of different genres, other approaches would be less helpful.  An "ordinary observer", the intended audience, might be misguided in the differences between a book and television program to accurately compare each work's total concept.  The book contained no theme or plot, but only a random and scattered collection of questions, its only concept being a test of ''Seinfeld'' trivia.  From this analysis, the court justified its approach and illustrated the possible different outcome it may have reached had it accepted the defendant's proposed analysis.

=== Defendant's infringement does not constitute fair use ===

The court provided a substantial analysis of Carol Publishing's [[fair use]] defense.  Of particular interest was its handling of the "transformative use" standard established in the Supreme Court's opinion in ''Campbell''.&lt;ref&gt;''see [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', 510 U.S. 569, (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court noted that the fundamental purpose of the fair use doctrine is "promoting the Progress of Science and Useful Arts."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const., art. I sec. 8 cl. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transformative use under the purpose and character standard====

The court held that the book's intended commercial use weighed against a finding of fair use.  In citing ''Campbell'', "no man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell'' at 584.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the court further held that the more critical inquiry was whether ''The SAT'' merely supplanted the ''Seinfeld'' episodes or rather if it added something new, providing new insights, new aesthetics in the manner that the fair use doctrine was meant to enrich society.

The defendants claimed two arguments of transformative qualities in ''The SAT'': first that the subject matter of the work did not bar a finding of fair use, and second that the book was a critique of the show.  Specifically, the defendants stylized ''The SAT'' as a work "decoding the obsession with and mystique that surrounds ''Seinfeld'' by critically restructuring ''Seinfeld'''s mystique into a system complete with varying levels of 'mastery' that relate the reader's control of the show's trivia to knowledge of and identification with their hero, Jerry Seinfeld."&lt;ref&gt;''Castle Rock'' at 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Castle Rock retorted that "had defendants been half as creative in creating ''The SAT'' as were their lawyers in crafting these arguments about transformation, defendants might have a colorable fair use claim."&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court rejected the defendants' arguments holding that any transformative purpose posed by the book was slight or non-existent.  It concluded that the purpose of the book was to entertain the ''Seinfeld'' audience with a book about ''Seinfeld'', much the same purpose as the television show.  Finally, the court noted a potential source of confusion between the "transformative use" doctrine and derivative works.  The court emphasized that derivative works were based upon preexisting works.  They ''transformed'' an original work into a new mode of expression, but unlike a work of fair use expression, a derivative work's ''purpose'' was not transformed.  In addition, when a derivative work transformed an original work into a new mode of expression such that little similarity remained, it would not infringe the copyright of the original work.

====Nature of the copyrighted work====

The court looked to the second statutory factor under the Copyright Act of 1976: the nature of the copyrighted work.  A work's nature "calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell'' at 586.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that the nature of ''Seinfeld'' was fictional, and the second factor tends to favor works based on fact.  Works of fiction generally enjoy greater copyright protection because of their higher content of protectible material.  However, the court noted that transformative use can lessen the importance of the nature of the copyrighted work, but since ''The SAT'' held slight or non-existent transformative purpose, the fictional nature of ''Seinfeld'' disfavored a finding a fair use.

====Amount and substantiality of the portion taken====

The third factor analyzed by the court was whether the portion of copying furthered the purpose and character of use or whether it went beyond what was necessary.  Here again, the transformative use affected the court's analysis.  Use of a substantial part or the "heart" of a protected work is justified when the character of the work is criticism or parody, because these expressions necessarily demand a greater quantity to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;''quoting Campbell'' at 588-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court reasoned that a greater degree of material from ''Seinfeld'' would be necessary for an accurate critique of the show's "nothingness", but because the court found little transformative use for the purposes of critique, this weighed against defendants.  Indeed, the court reasoned that the 643 copied elements in the trivia questions was a substantial portion taken for the rather "straight forward" commentary of ''Seinfeld'''s meaninglessness, and this weighed against fair use.

====Effect of use on the market====

The court noted that the fourth factor was not to be given the greatest weight, but to be taken equally with the other three in a determination of fair use.&lt;ref&gt;''see Campbell'' at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis for market effect does not look to whether the secondary work detracts from market of the copyrighted work, but rather does it substitute the market of the original (the nature of copyright as a [[monopoly]] on publication does not permit a substitution).  The court held that the differences in form between ''The SAT'' and ''Seinfeld'' and the lack of transformative purpose made the book a derivative work in a derivative market.  Because the SAT was the only ''Seinfeld'' trivia book in existence, it completely substituted this derivative market for the show.  The court further reasoned that even though Castle Rock did not intend to enter the trivia book market, the existence of ''The SAT'' effectively usurped its right to do so.  If the derivative market was one that the copyright holder would generally develop or license, a secondary author would be barred from entering it.  On the other hand, if the market was one generally protected by fair use, such as criticism, parody, or academic scholarship, the copyright holder could not enter those markets and attempt to preclude secondary authors from entering.

====Other factors affecting fair use====

The court noted that the four factors enumerated in the fair use statute are not exclusive, but are only a guide in the analysis.  The court held that it was irrelevant whether Carol Publishing continued to distribute ''The SAT'' after Castle Rock notified it of its infringement claim, because such distribution would have been justified if the book was a fair use of ''Seinfeld''.  The court concluded that other considerations affecting fair use such as the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] and the public interest were not relevant to the case.  When taking all factors together, the court held that the book was not fair use.  In a final footnote, the opinion provided an answer key to all trivia questions contained therein.

The '''Chilean Declaration of Independence''' is a document [[Declaration of independence|declaring the independence]] of [[Chile]] from the [[Spanish Empire]]. It was drafted in January 1818 and approved by [[President of Chile|Supreme Director]] [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] on 12 February 1818 at [[Talca]], despite being dated in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] on 1 January 1818.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana"&gt;{{cite book

== Historical background ==

{{quote|¿Jura usted defender la patria hasta derramar la última gota de sangre, para conservarla ilesa hasta depositarla en manos del señor don Fernando VII, nuestro soberano, o de su legítimo sucesor; conservar y guardar nuestra religión y leyes; hacer justicia y reconocer al supremo Consejero de Regencia como representante de la majestad Real?&lt;br/&gt;Do you swear to defend the fatherland to the last drop of your blood, to keep it unharmed in the hands of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]], our lord, or his rightful heir; to uphold and protect our religion and our laws; to maintain justice and recognize the supreme Counselor of the Regency as the representative of His Royal Majesty?|''[[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|First National Junta]] Oath, 18 September 1810''}}

By 1817, the [[Chilean War of Independence]] had entered its final phase, and there was little doubt that its final goal, national independence, would be realized. Even though Chile had been operating independently from Spain for several years, no formal [[declaration of independence]] had yet been produced.

One of the first official documents to address the issue of independence was the [[s:es:Reglamento Constitucional Provisorio de 1812|Provisional Constitutional Regulations of 1812]], introduced by [[José Miguel Carrera]] on 27 October 1812. Article V of this document states that "No decree, ruling or order, issued by any authority or courts outside the territory of Chile, will have any effect; anyone who tries to give them force will be punished as criminals of the State", while also recognizing the authority of [[Fernando VII]] in Article III.

At the beginning of Patria Nueva, a period that began with the victory at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]], Chile had a government with its own authorities which controlled much of the territory of Chile, had a [[Flag of Chile|flag]], a [[Coat of arms of Chile|coat-of-arms]] and its [[Chilean Peso|own currency]], all of which indicated that Chile had become an independent state. Thus, there was no pressing need to make an explicit declaration of independence, as the [[United States of America]] had done in 1776, [[Venezuela]] in 1811, [[Colombia]] in 1813, and [[Argentina]] in 1816.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana" /&gt; 

The President of Chile, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], bore in mind the problems experienced by the previous era, and convinced the members of his assembly that declaring independence would be difficult and problematic at this time, as the country was still warring against the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolutions)|Spanish Royalists]] and because the establishment of internal order was indispensable towards the goal of independence.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana" /&gt; Therefore, it was decided that a [[plebiscite]] would be held instead.

== Popular consultation ==
On 13 November 1817, the [[List of Government Juntas of Chile|Superior Governmental Junta]], in the absence of O'Higgins, who was overseeing military operations in the southern part of Chile, issued a decree declaring that a referendum was to be set up to run for fifteen days. The referendum would be held in each of the four administrative quarters of [[Santiago]], and would run for fifteen days, during which residents would sign their views in favor or against the Declaration of Independence. Cities and towns were advised to follow the same procedure.

The decree was sent alongside the referendum form to the authorities of the regional governments and bore the signatures of several Junta members: [[Luis de la Cruz]], [[Francisco Antonio Pérez]], [[José Manuel Astorga]], and the [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Miguel Zañartu]].&lt;ref name="Plebiscito"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November, Zañartu sent a brief to the same recipients instructing them to publish the form "as soon as possible".&lt;ref name="Plebiscito" /&gt;

The result of the referendum was favorable to O'Higgins. The new order had the support of the majority of citizens who participated in the referendum, though many who did not agree did not participate because they feared their votes would bring persecution towards them.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana" /&gt; However, in Concepción, the plebiscite was not complete, and was only held in a few locations, as reported by O'Higgins on 23 December 1817 from his camp opposite [[Talcahuano]]: "[...] ''habían empezado a remitir algunos partidos las suscripciones'' [...] ''pero las ocurrencias ulteriores en la provincia y la medida últimamente adoptada de hacer emigrar de ella a todos sus habitantes, no permiten esta operación''".&lt;ref name="BCN"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the month of December, after checking the results, the government began preparations to make a solemn declaration of independence. This coincided with news about the upcoming arrival of a new [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolutions)|Royalist]] expedition under the command of Spanish Brigadier [[Mariano Osorio]], aimed at reconquering Chile.

Since the plebiscite had decided in favor of a declaration of independence, it was decided that a formal act would be drawn up which concisely and clearly represented the will of the Chilean people. The process would mimic that of other countries which had already declared their independence. A manifesto was also to be published which would outline the rationale and reasons for the declaration. The person in charge of this work would be [[Miguel Zañartu]], and secondly [[Bernardo Vera y Pintado]].&lt;ref name="BarrosArana" /&gt;

[[Image:Morillo Perales.JPG|thumb|upright=1.05|''Morrillo de Perales'' in [[Talcahuano]]]]

At the end of 1817, O'Higgins was present at the siege of Talcahuano against the Spanish forces. When the uncertain military situation forced O'Higgins' forces to lift the siege, they retreated to ''Morrillos de Perales'' (now known as the "U" hill). This was a position which the patriots had chosen and which dominated one of the gates of Talcahuano. On 1 January 1818, a message of independence asserting that Chile was a "free and sovereign country, not a rebel province" was drafted, written on a [[drum]] according to folklore. The message was addressed to Colonel [[José Ordóñez]], the Spanish controller of the port of Talcahuano and former mayor of Concepción. This document is considered the first declaration of independence of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Pledge of independence ==

The formal ceremony and pledge of independence was set for the first anniversary of the [[Battle of Chacabuco]]: 12 February 1818.

[[Image:JuraIndependencia.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3636364|''Proclamación y jura de la Independencia de Chile'', by [[Pedro Subercaseaux Errázuriz]] (1945)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Bernardo O’Higgins]] erroneously appears in this recreation, as he was actually in [[Talca]] on that day.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On 9 February, [[Luis de la Cruz]] published the [[Event program|program]] of the ceremonies and celebration to be held in Santiago. These activities commenced on 11 February in the afternoon with the firing of cannons from [[Cerro Santa Lucía]]. At nine o'clock on 12 February, all the authorities and people of the [[Palacio Directorial de Santiago]] mounted a stage in front of the [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]] in Santiago.

The ceremony was opened by [[José Gregorio Argomedo]], prosecutor of the [[Judiciary of Chile#Court of Appeal|Chilean Court of Appeals]], who gave a speech representing the government, after which the minister [[Miguel Zañartu]] read the Act of Independence

de la Cruz then requested the oath from [[José Ignacio Cienfuegos]], administrator of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile|Santiago Diocese]], who had earlier added the phrasing "''Y así juro porque creo en mi conciencia que ésta es la voluntad del Eterno''" ("And so I swear on my conscience that this is the will of the Eternal"). Following this, Cruz heard the oath from [[José de San Martín]], the General in Chief of the Chilean Army. Minister Zañartu also took the oath along with several other authorities and public officials. Finally, the Mayor of Santiago, [[Francisco de Borja Fontecilla]], swore the oath to the people.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February, a [[Te Deum]] was sung at the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral|Santiago Cathedral]], and, the next day, the cathedral celebrated a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of thanksgiving. After this, [[Tomás Guido]] gave a speech congratulating the Chilean people on behalf of the [[Buenos Aires]] government. The public celebration of independence in Santiago lasted until 16 February. The declaration itself was widely distributed to the populace. Another document, which covered the motives behind the revolution and declaration of independence, written by Bernardo Vera, was also distributed to the public to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name="BarrosArana2" /&gt;

In [[Talca, Chile|Talca]], on 12 February,  O'Higgins presided over the swearing-in of the Independent Southern Army, and the subsequent ceremony with ceremonial gunfire, a Mass, Te Deum and public festivities. During these few days, the declaration of independence was made in many other cities and towns of Chile, with as many festivities as could be had. In [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], independence was declared on 27 February and the festivities lasted until 1 March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Copiapó, Chile|Copiapó]] the ceremony took place between March 27 and 28.

On 15 June 1820, [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] was sworn into the new nation, after [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] led a successful attempt to [[Capture of Valdivia|capture Valdivia]] from the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolutions)|royalists]]. Later, on 22 January 1826, the pledge of independence would be made in San Carlos, Chiloé, after the Spanish signed the [[Treaty of Tantauco]], which gave the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] to Chile.

WCW recognized Hennig as "one of the best all-round competitors this [wrestling] business has ever produced",&lt;ref&gt;''WCW: The Ultimate Guide''. [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Books]]. 2000. (p.21).&lt;/ref&gt; while WWE credited him for raising the accepted standard of technical wrestling.&lt;ref name="WWEHOF"/&gt; He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2007 by former [[Major League Baseball]] player and longtime friend [[Wade Boggs]].&lt;ref name="WWEHOF"/&gt; Former WWF rival [[Hulk Hogan]] remarked, "Everybody would check their egos at the door when they came to a building that Curt Hennig was in, because you couldn't out-work him, you couldn't outshine him and you couldn't out-perform him.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== American Wrestling Association (1980–1982) ===
[[File:DDP Henning DiaDoll Sc00b1d019.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Diamond Dallas Page|DDP]], Curt Hennig and [[Diamond Dolls|Diamond Doll Tonya]] in 1988.]]
Known as "Cool" Curt Hennig, he began his career on January 30, 1980 in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), the promotion which had made his father, [[Larry Hennig|Larry "The Axe" Hennig]]&lt;ref name=p21-batista&gt;{{cite book|title=Batista Unleashed|first=Dave|last=Batista|authorlink=Dave Batista|author2=Roberts, Jeremy|isbn=978-1-4165-4410-4|publisher=[[WWE Books]]| year=2007|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a star. Hennig left AWA in 1982 and joined [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

=== World Wrestling Federation (1982–1984) ===
Curt Hennig started his WWF career in 1982. He established himself as a promising young performer against the likes of [[Buddy Rose|'Playboy' Buddy Rose]]. Eventually, he was paired-up in [[tag team]] matches with another young upstart, [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]], himself the son of a wrestling legend (Tommy Gilbert).

=== Return to AWA (1984–1988) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CurtHennig&amp;ScottHall.jpg|thumb|170px|Curt Hennig and Scott Hall in 1986.]] --&gt;
Hennig returned to AWA in 1984. He would eventually become one of the promotion's top stars in his own right, winning the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] by defeating [[Jimmy Garvin|"Gorgeous" Jimmy Garvin]] and "Mr. Electricity" [[Steve Regal]] on January 18, 1986 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="AWATag" /&gt;

Later, he resumed his solo career in the AWA, culminating in defeating the legendary [[Nick Bockwinkel]] for the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[SuperClash 2|SuperClash]] on May 2, 1987 with the help of Larry Zbzyszko, and turning [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] in doing so.&lt;ref name=WrestleHistory.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Curt Hennig vs Nick Bockwinkel (Superclash 2))|url=http://www.wrestlehistory.com/2011/09/curt-hennig-vs-nick-bockwinkel-awa-superclash-2/|work=WrestleHistory.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331135704/http://www.wrestlehistory.com/2011/09/curt-hennig-vs-nick-bockwinkel-awa-superclash-2/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWATitle" /&gt; Hennig, along with his father Larry "The Axe", would engage in a long feud with [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]] and his father, [[Verne Gagne]]. He began being associated with [[Debrah Miceli|Madusa Miceli]], the [[AWA World Women's Championship|AWA World Women's Champion]] since December 27, 1987.&lt;ref name=Mowow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/madusa.html|title=Madusa's profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meltzer&gt;{{cite book|author=Meltzer, Dave|pages=50–65|year=2001|title=Wrestling Observer's [[Tributes: Remembering Some of the World's Greatest Wrestlers]]|publisher=Winding Stair Press|isbn=1553660854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig and Madusa joined  [[The Diamond Exchange]], a stable led by [[Diamond Dallas Page]] that also included [[Badd Company]] and [[Colonel DeBeers]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/dallaspage2.html|title=DDP's career|publisher=Wrestling museum|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennig would hold the AWA World Heavyweight Title for about 53 weeks, before losing it to [[Jerry Lawler]] on May 9, 1988.&lt;ref name="AWATitle" /&gt; Like many other AWA stars of the time (including [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Rick Martel]], and [[The Rockers]]), Curt left the AWA for the WWF with the promise of more money and broadened exposure.

=== Return to WWF===
==== Undefeated streak (1988–1990) ====
Hennig returned to the WWF in the mid-1988 at WrestleFest, where he [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]]ned [[Terry Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlefest88.html|title=WrestleFest results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig made his televised in-ring return on the September 11 episode of ''[[WWF All-American Wrestling|All-American Wrestling]]'', defeating [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]] Ron Rovishod. On the October 1 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] began airing on WWF television, during which he was repackaged with a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] of an arrogant braggart [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] who claimed to be able to accomplish difficult tasks "perfectly", thus earning the nickname of '''Mr. Perfect''', which would become his [[ring name]] in 1989 and the use of his real name would be phased out. He presented himself as being superior in athletics or anything else he did. These clips showed him hitting half-court, three-point, and no-look basketball shots, [[Perfect game (bowling)|bowling a score of 300]], running the table in billiards, throwing then catching his own Hail Mary football pass, sinking a long golf putt, hitting home runs and making bulls-eyes in darts. Stars of various major league sports, including [[Wade Boggs]] ([[Major League Baseball|MLB]]), [[Steve Jordan (American football)|Steve Jordan]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]), and [[Mike Modano]] ([[National Hockey League|NHL]]), co-starred with Hennig in these vignettes. Hennig performed for the first time as Mr. Perfect on the October 4 episode of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'', where he defeated [[Jim Brunzell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm|title=WWF Results 1988|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfect made his [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[Survivor Series (1988)|Survivor Series]], where he competed in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|five-on-five elimination tag team match]] as a member of [[André the Giant]]'s team, along with [[Rick Rude]], [[Dino Bravo]] and [[Harley Race]] against [[Jim Duggan]]'s team of [[Jake Roberts]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Tito Santana]] and [[Scott Casey]].

On the October 7 episode of ''Superstars'', Perfect began appearing with [[Lanny Poffo|The Genius]], an arrogant, poetry-reciting scholar on ''[[Bruce Prichard|The Brother Love Show]]'' and began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Hulk Hogan]] over the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]]. Their [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] heated up when Genius defeated Hogan by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]], with Hennig's assistance on the November 25 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXIV|episode]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' and the duo stole Hogan's title belt and destroyed it backstage.&lt;ref name="snme112589"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwf89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm|title=WWF Results 1989|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect and Hogan wrestled on the [[house show|live events]], where he lost to Hogan but they did not compete on television until January 15, 1990 when Hennig received his first opportunity for the WWF Championship against Hogan on the live televised broadcast on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] and this was his first televised match against Hogan, which he won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].&lt;ref name="wwf90"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm|title=WWF Results 1990|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Various storylines (1991–1996) ====
[[File:Hennig-wcw.jpg|thumb|right|Hennig as special guest referee at [[WrestleMania X]] in 1994]]
Hennig spent the following year recovering from his injury. He returned to television on the November 23 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' where he became [[Ric Flair]]'s "executive consultant". The following week on ''Superstars'', Perfect became a color commentator of the show for the next full year, acting as a suitable [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] foil to [[Vince McMahon]]'s play-by-play.&lt;ref name="wwf91"/&gt; During this period, Perfect assisted Flair in winning matches and managed him to two [[WWE Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] reigns in 1992.&lt;ref name="wwf92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=WWF Results 1992|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fall of 1992, Perfect and Flair were in the midst of a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Randy Savage]], building to a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] at [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]] where Flair and [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] would face Savage and [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]]. However, Warrior was released from the WWF weeks prior to the event.&lt;ref name=WWF9099Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling|volume=2: WWF 1990–1999 | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | asin=B00RWUNSRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the November 16 episode of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'', Savage asked Perfect to be his partner. After initially laughing off Savage's offer, Perfect was swayed by Savage's cajoling and by [[Bobby Heenan]]'s degrading comments and commanding Perfect to follow orders, which would lead to Perfect [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning]] into a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] for the first time in WWF by dumping water on Heenan and accepting Savage's offer to return to the ring and become his partner at Survivor Series, much to the delight of the ''Prime Time Wrestling'' cast of [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Jim Duggan]], and [[Vince McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/primetime92-93.htm|title=Prime Time Wrestling Results 1992-1993|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig made his return to the ring at Survivor Series, where Hennig and Savage won their match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1992/results|title=Survivor Series 1992 results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfect began a high-profile rivalry with Flair. He made his return to singles competition on the January 2, 1993 episode of ''Superstars'', where he defeated [[John Nord|The Berzerker]].&lt;ref name="wwf92"/&gt; Hennig participated in the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble match]] to determine the #1 contender for the WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania]]. He eliminated Flair, [[Steve Keirn|Skinner]] and [[Jerry Lawler]] until he was eliminated by [[Ted DiBiase]], [[Koko B.

Luger won their match at [[WrestleMania IX]]&lt;ref name="WM9 results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/9/results|title=Full WrestleMania IX Results|accessdate=July 6, 2013|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though both of Perfect's feet were clearly between the ropes. Afterwards, Perfect chased Luger backstage where he was jumped from behind by Luger's ally [[Shawn Michaels]]. As a result, Perfect began a rivalry with Michaels.&lt;ref name="wwf93"/&gt;

During this time, Hennig qualified for the first-ever televised [[King of the Ring|King of the Ring tournament]] by defeating [[Doink the Clown]].&lt;ref name="wwf93"/&gt; At [[King of the Ring (1993)|King of the Ring]], Perfect defeated [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]] in the quarter-finals but lost to eventual winner [[Bret Hart]] in the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#93|title=King of the Ring 1993 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect competed against Shawn Michaels for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]], where Perfect lost by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] due to interference from Michaels' new bodyguard [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].&lt;ref name="wwf93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/1993/results|title=SummerSlam 1993 results|accessdate=July 6, 2013|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig's last televised match in WWF was on the November 7 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'', where he defeated [[Iron Mike Sharpe]]. He was set to participate as a member of Razor Ramon's team at [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]], but was replaced in the match by Randy Savage without any official explanation given.&lt;ref name="wwf93"/&gt;

Perfect made his surprise return to WWF at [[WrestleMania X]] on March 20, 1994, where he was the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]] for the WWF Championship match between Lex Luger and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/10/results|title=Full WrestleMania X Results|accessdate=July 6, 2013|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]] Luger after Luger manhandled Perfect, who was tending to Yokozuna's stricken managers [[Jim Cornette]] and [[Mr. Fuji]] instead of counting the [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] and turned heel again. Perfect was set to start another [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with Luger, during which he explained that he screwed Luger because of Luger's illegal win over Perfect the previous year at WrestleMania IX. However, plans were scrapped off after Hennig's back problems flared up again. He left the WWF in the spring of 1994.&lt;ref name="wwf94"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm|title=WWF Results 1995|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennig took a year off to recover from a back injury until he returned to the company as a color commentator at the [[Survivor Series (1995)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view in 1995.&lt;ref name="wwf95"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm|title=WWF Results 1995|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following weekend, Jerry Lawler announced Perfect as his replacement on ''Superstars'',&lt;ref name=meltzer/&gt; his second stint as a color commentator on the show with Vince McMahon, this time with [[Jim Ross]] added as the analyst. Later in 1996, McMahon left and Ross switched to the play-by-play role. Perfect also did color commentary at [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]], [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]] and [[In Your House 10: Mind Games]] pay-per-views.&lt;ref name="wwf96"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm|title=WWF Results 1996|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect also served as the special guest referee for the WWF Championship match between Shawn Michaels and [[Davey Boy Smith|British Bulldog]] at June's [[King of the Ring (1996)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#96|title=King of the Ring 1996 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1996, Hennig was placed in an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], where he would come out to the ringside during Helmsley's matches and steal his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|female escorts]], which would often cause distraction for Helmsley and affect his performance in matches. During the rivalry, Perfect helped [[Marc Mero]] in winning the Intercontinental Championship from [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] and assisted him in retaining the title against [[Goldust]] at In Your House 11.&lt;ref name="wwf96"/&gt; The following night on ''Raw'', Perfect was initially going to make his wrestling comeback on against Helmsley but was attacked by Helmsley backstage just moments before their match. It appeared Helmsley's attack left Perfect injured and unable to compete. This all turned out to be a ruse for the purpose of suckering Mero into defending his title against Helmsley. With help from Perfect, Helmsley won the title from Mero.&lt;ref name=meltzer/&gt; Perfect began to serve as a mentor to Helmsley and accompanied Helmsley to the ring. Perfect left the WWF once again shortly before [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], making his last televised appearance on the November 5 episode of ''Raw''.&lt;ref name="wwf96"/&gt;

{{main|The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|l1=Four Horsemen|New World Order (professional wrestling)|l2=New World Order}}
Hennig signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in mid-1997.&lt;ref name=meltzer/&gt; Since his Mr. Perfect ring name was trademarked by the WWF, he began competing under his real name. He debuted in WCW as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] on the June 30 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', during a brawl which erupted after the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]].&lt;ref name="wcw97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw97.htm|title=WCW Results 1997|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first match in the company took place at July's [[Bash at the Beach (1997)|Bash at the Beach]] pay-per-view where he became [[Diamond Dallas Page]]'s mystery tag team partner against nWo members [[Randy Savage]] and [[Scott Hall]].&lt;ref name=meltzer/&gt; Hennig ended up [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning]] on Page costing them the match.&lt;ref name="wcw97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#97|title=Bash at the Beach 1997 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Hennig began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with Page, defeating him in a match at [[Road Wild (1997)|Road Wild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#97|title=Road Wild 1997 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig continued to use the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] as his finishing move, renaming it ''Hennig-Plex''. Shortly after his debut, he became a top favourite of both [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) as both [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|factions]] showed interest in recruiting him. He ultimately joined the Four Horsemen, taking the spot of the retiring [[Arn Anderson]]. Anderson's implorement that Hennig take "his spot" was the subject of the following week's parody of the Horsemen by the nWo, which lead to the [[WarGames match]].&lt;ref name="wcw97"/&gt; At [[Fall Brawl (1997)|Fall Brawl]], Hennig was allegedly jumped backstage by the nWo before the WarGames match and came to ringside mid-match with his arm in a sling.

In the fall of 1997, Hennig was joined by his childhood best friend [[Rick Rude]] in the nWo.&lt;ref name="wcw97"/&gt; In 1998, Hennig and Rude were put into a rivalry with [[Bret Hart]] and his relatives [[Davey Boy Smith|British Bulldog]] and [[Jim Neidhart]], during which both teams competed against each other in several matches throughout the first half of 1998.&lt;ref name="wcw98"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw98.htm|title=WCW Results 1998|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig lost to Hart at [[Uncensored (1998)|Uncensored]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#98|title=Uncensored 1998 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated Bulldog at [[Spring Stampede (1998)|Spring Stampede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/stampede.html#98|title=Spring Stampede 1998 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sidelined due to a knee injury in the mid-1998. During this time, the nWo broke into two different factions, the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)#1998: dissension, nWo Hollywood and Wolfpac|nWo Wolfpac and nWo Hollywood]], both Hennig and Rude joined [[Kevin Nash]]'s fan favorite Wolfpac group. However, the two villains did not really fit in with the fan favorite Wolfpac faction, especially when Rude would still get on the microphone and tell the fans to shut up.&lt;ref name="wcw98"/&gt; Hennig was scheduled to wrestle [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] for the United States Heavyweight Championship at June's [[The Great American Bash (1998)|The Great American Bash]] pay-per-view, but he failed to compete due to injury, so he asked [[Konnan]] to replace him.

In the fall of 1998, Hennig began feuding with Horseman [[Dean Malenko]] over his betrayal of the Four Horsemen the previous year&lt;ref name="wcw97"/&gt; which resulted in a match between the pair at September's [[Fall Brawl (1998)|Fall Brawl]] pay-per-view, which Hennig lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#98|title=Fall Brawl 1998 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the loss, Hennig was taken off television to recover from his knee injury.

However, he was kicked out of the group after speaking against the leaders on the January 25 episode of ''Nitro''.&lt;ref name="wcw99"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw99.htm|title=WCW Results 1999|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== West Texas Rednecks and departure (1999–2000) ====
{{main|The West Texas Rednecks|l1=West Texas Rednecks}}
Hennig formed a [[tag team]] with [[Barry Windham]] and continued the [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]. Hennig and Windham were placed in a tournament for the vacated [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championship]], which they won by defeating Horsemen [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Dean Malenko]] at [[SuperBrawl IX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#IX|title=SuperBrawl IX results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig and Windham held the tag titles for a month, before losing to Benoit and Malenko in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|lumberjack match]], the following month at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored]], after [[Arn Anderson]] hit Hennig with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|tire iron]].&lt;ref name="wcw99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#99|title=Uncensored 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig competed against [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]] in a losing effort the main event of the March 18 episode of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' after [[Horace Hogan|Horace]] saved Hogan from a ''[[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|Hennig-Plex]]''.&lt;ref name="wcw99"/&gt; In May, Hennig formed a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|faction]] called [[The West Texas Rednecks]] with Windham, Barry's brother, [[Kendall Windham]], and [[Bobby Duncum, Jr.]]. The group members were presented as [[Southern United States|southern]] country musicians. They began feuding with rapper [[Master P]]'s [[The No Limit Soldiers|No Limit Soldiers]] and recorded an infamous country song titled "Rap is Crap."&lt;ref name="WWEHOF"/&gt;&lt;ref name=meltzer/&gt; During the rivalry, Hennig and Duncum lost to [[Konnan]] and [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio Jr.]] of the No Limit Soldiers in a tag team match on June 13 at [[The Great American Bash (1999)|The Great American Bash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#99|title=The Great American Bash 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month later, the Rednecks lost to the Soldiers once again in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|elimination tag team match]] at [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach]] on July 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#99|title=Bash at the Beach 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rednecks were intended to be [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] but the southern WCW fans cheered them instead of the Soldiers, resulting in the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] being dropped. The Rednecks made their final pay-per-view appearance at [[Road Wild (1999)|Road Wild]] on August 14, where Hennig, Barry and Duncum lost to [[The Revolution (WCW)|The Revolution]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Multiple man teamed matches|six-man tag team match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#99|title=Road Wild 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Rednecks disbanded, Hennig began a storyline, in which he stated that he was following orders from "[[Professional wrestling authority figures#The Powers That Be|the powers that be]]" that if he lost any match by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]], he must retire.&lt;ref name="wcw99"/&gt; He participated in a [[WCW tournaments#WCW World Heavyweight Championship Tournament (1999)|tournament]] to crown the new [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]], during which he defeated [[Disco Inferno (wrestler)|Disco Inferno]] in the first round but lost to [[Jeff Jarrett]] in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/worldus.html#world99|title=WCW World Title Tournament 1999|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to retire after losing a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]] against [[Buff Bagwell]] at [[Mayhem (1999)|Mayhem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/mayhem.html#99|title=Mayhem 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated by the powers that be a month later, however, and joined forces with [[Harris Brothers|Creative Control]], during which the trio defeated [[Harlem Heat]] and [[Midnight (wrestler)|Midnight]] at [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#99|title=Starrcade 1999 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained on the WCW television, continuing to make sporadic appearances with the company. He entered a feud with [[Shawn Stasiak]] in the spring of 2000, after Stasiak referred to himself as "The Perfect One" which was a ripoff of Hennig's "Mr. Perfect" [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|character]] and even used entrance music composed to sound like Mr. Perfect's theme song.&lt;ref name="wcw2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw00-01.htm|title=WCW Results 2000-2001|work=The History of WWE|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig lost to Stasiak at [[Slamboree (2000)|Slamboree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/slambore.html#2000|title=Slamboree 2000 results|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last televised match in WCW was against [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] on the May 20 episode of ''[[WCW Worldwide|Worldwide]]'', which Hennig won.&lt;ref name="wcw2000"/&gt; Hennig left WCW after his contract expired in the summer of 2000.

=== Xcitement Wrestling Federation (2001–2002) ===
Hennig was a franchise star for the short lived [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] where he had a brief run. The promotion quickly went under due to the WWF buying out many of its major talent, including Hennig himself. Hennig wrestled a well-known match with Hulk Hogan in XWF, where Hogan defeated him.

=== Second return to WWF (2002) ===
During the buildup for January's [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], it was announced that Hennig would be returning as one of the 30 combatants. Hennig, again billed as "Mr. Perfect" (although his real name was widely acknowledged), entered the Royal Rumble at #25, and was one of the final three competitors before being eliminated by eventual winner Triple H. Perfect made a strong showing at the Rumble, hitting the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|Perfect-Plex]] on [[Kurt Angle]] and holding his own with the WWF's best at the time. His performance, along with the positive reaction of the [[Atlanta]] crowd, earned Hennig a full-time contract with the WWF. Perfect appeared the next night on ''Raw'' in a match with [[Val Venis]]. He then had short feuds with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] before forming a tag team with [[Shawn Stasiak]] at [[house show]]s throughout March and April as well as a tag team on television with [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

Hennig's widow, Leonice, signed a WWE Legends contract on her husband's behalf.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Wade Boggs]], who appeared in a vignette with Hennig and was a friend of his, inducted him into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on March 31, 2007. His wife, his four children, and his parents accepted the award on his behalf.&lt;ref name="WWEHOF"/&gt; On July 4, 2007, Hennig was posthumously inducted into the [[George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame|George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. His father, who was inducted the prior year, represented him at the event.

On September 9, 2008, WWE released a two disc DVD set focused on Hennig titled ''The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect''. Promotion for the video included [[Charlie Haas]] spoofing Hennig's memorable sports [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]]s at a [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] on ''Raw''. Finding that he was incapable of performing those feats, Haas decided "there was only one Mr. Perfect." The week after the DVD's release, its first week possible, it went to number one on the Billboard Recreational Sports DVD sales list.

Hennig was mentioned on ''[[Raw 1000]]'' by his old friend [[Bret Hart]], who acted as the guest ring announcer for the night's Intercontinental title match. Hart stated that one of his best moments was winning his first ever Intercontinental title from Hennig, and described him as "one of the greatest superstars that ever lived".

Hennig's son Joe now uses the ring name [[Curtis Axel]], representing his father's first name and his [[Larry Hennig|grandfather]]'s nickname, respectively. He then went on to win the Intercontinental Championship in 2013 at [[Payback (2013)|Payback]] on Father's day, and he dedicated his victory to his father. This title win makes them the first, and only, father-son duo to hold the championship.

Hennig was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in Amsterdam, New York in 2015.

According to court documents, UCLA made no significant efforts to fix the problem filing verbal and written complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/02/21/jury-slams-ucla-with-13m-gender-discrimination-verdict/|title=Jury Slams UCLA With $13M Gender Discrimination Verdict {{!}} The Recorder|work=The Recorder|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinter-Brown was forced to “play dead” at work to avoid additional conflicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">An '''epistolary poem''', also called a '''verse letter''' or '''letter poem''',&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, The Poetry Dictionary, 2d ed. 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vERZtJC5AmkC&amp;pg=PA332 p. 332]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[poetry|poem]] in the form of an [[epistle]] or letter.

==History==
Epistolary poems date at least as early as the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC – 17 or 18 AD), who wrote the ''[[Heroides]]'' (''The Heroines'') or ''Epistulae Heroidum'' (''Letters of Heroines''), a collection of fifteen epistolary poems presented as though written by a selection of aggrieved [[hero]]ines of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], addressing their heroic lovers who have in some way mistreated, neglected, or abandoned them.  Ovid extended this with the ''[[Double Heroides]]'' consisting of three separate exchanges of paired epistles, one each from a heroic lover to his absent beloved and from the heroine in return.

A number of epistolary poems were published as separate works in England during the so-called "[[long eighteenth century|Long Eighteenth Century]]", i.e., about 1688 - 1815.

==Examples==

Examples of epistolary poems include:

* [[Fridugisus]] (8th century)
* [[Baldric of Dol]] (c. 1050 - 1130)
* William Pittis &amp; [[Nahum Tate]], An epistolary poem to N. Tate, Esquire, and poet laureat to His Majesty, occasioned by the taking of Namur, London,  R. Baldwin, 1696
* William Pittis, An epistolary poem to [[John Dryden]], Esq: occasion'd by the much lamented death of the Right Honourable James Earl of Abingdon, London, H. Walwyn, 1699.
* Ricard Butler, A.M., British Michael: an epistolary poem, to a friend in the country, London, J. Matthews,  1710.	
* James Belcher, A cat may look upon a king: An epistolary poem, on the loss of the ears of a favourite female cat, Dublin, 1732.
*T R;  Charles Cathcart, Lord,  An epistolary poem to a lady on the present expedition of Lord Cathcart, London, Olive Payne, 1740. 						
*George Canning,  An epistolary poem: supposed to be written by Lord [[William Russell, Lord Russell|William Russell]], to [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Lord William Cavendish]]; from the [[Newgate Prison|prison of Newgate]], ... the 20th of July, 1683, in the evening before the execution of that virtuous and patriotic nobleman, ... under the false pretext of his being concerned in the pretended ..., London,  R. H. Westley, 1793.
* The conduct of man. A didactic epistolary poem, London, C. Chapple,  1811.
*[[Richard Hugo]] (1923–1982)
*[[Donald Hall]] (1928-2018)

He returned to Wisconsin and defeated Ben Knight for the Wisconsin Heavyweight Championship in a Mineral Point match on March 20, 1883. Moving to Madison in 1885, he later defeated several international wrestlers, including Andre Christol, Tom Cannon, and [[Sorakichi Matsuda|Matsuda Sorakichi]].

Defeating [[Joe Acton]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], for the American Catch-as-Catch-can Championship on March 14, 1887, he later unified the World [[Catch wrestling|Catch-as-Catch-can]] and American [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] Championship in a best-of-five match against [[Ernest Roeber]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] on March 3, 1893 (he also had defeated him for the "Collar and Elbow Championship" on May 18, 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/New011-020.htm |title=The Line of Ascension |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2001 |month= |work= |publisher=The New WAWLI (Wrestling As We Liked It) Papers No. 15-2001 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10516">'''Fitzedward Hall''' (March 21, 1825 - February 1, 1901) was an [[United States|American]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], and [[philologist]]. He was the first American to edit a Sanskrit text, and was an early collaborator in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) project.

==Life==
Hall was born on 21 March 1825 in [[Troy, New York]], where his father was a lawyer.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Hall, Fitzedward |first=W. B. |last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated with the degree of civil engineer from the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] at Troy in 1842, and entered [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in the class of 1846. His Harvard classmates included [[Charles Eliot Norton]], who later visited him in India in 1849, and [[Francis James Child]]. Just before his class graduated but after completing the work for his degree he abruptly left college and took ship out of Boston to [[India]], allegedly in search of a runaway brother. His ship foundered and was wrecked on its approach to the harbor of Calcutta, where he found himself stranded. Although it was not his intention he was never to return to the United States. At this time he began he began his study of Indian languages, and in January 1850 he was appointed tutor in the [[Government Sanskrit College]] at [[Benares]]. In 1852 he became the first American to edit a Sanskrit text, namely the Vedanta treatises [[Atma bodha | Ātmabodha]] and Tattvabodha. In 1853 he became professor of [[Sanskrit]] and English at the Government Sanskrit College; and in 1855 was appointed to the post of inspector of public instruction in Ajmere-Merwara and in 1856 in the Central Provinces.

In 1857 Hall was caught up in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]]. ''The Manchester Guardian'' later gave this account:&lt;ref&gt;"Memorial Notices: Dr. Fitzedward Hall", ''The Manchester Guardian'', Feb. 9, 1901, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; "When the Mutiny broke out he was Inspector of Public Instruction for Central India, and was beleaguered in the [[Saugor]] Fort.  He had become an expert tiger shooter, and turned this proficiency to account during the siege of the fort, and afterwards as a volunteer in the struggle for the re-establishment of the British power in India."

In 1859 he published at Calcutta his discursive and informative ''A Contribution Towards an Index to the Bibliography of the Indian Philosophical Systems'', based on the holdings of the Benares College and his own collection of Sanskrit manuscripts, as well as numerous other private collections he had examined. In the introduction he regrets that this production was in press in Allahabad and would have been put before the public in 1857, "had it not been impressed to feed a rebel bonfire."

He settled in England and in 1862 received the appointment to the chair of Sanskrit, Hindustani and Indian [[jurisprudence]] in [[King's College London]], and to the librarianship of the India Office. An unsuccessful attempt was made by his friends to lure him back to Harvard by endowing a chair of Sanskrit for him there, but this project came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Stephen G. ''William Dwight Whitney and the Science of Language'' (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; His collection of a thousand Oriental manuscripts he gave to Harvard.

Some flavor of Hall's experience as an American Sanskritologist in Benares can be found in a review of his friend [[M. A. Sherring | Sherring]]'s ''The Sacred City of the Hindus'' (to which Hall contributed the introduction), in the July 1869 issue of ''The Christian Examiner'':&lt;ref&gt;"F.W.H.", "Miscellany", ''The Christian Examiner'', July 1869, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Missionary Sherring devotes a large volume to a minute description of the holy city of Benares, because being the living oracle of the nation, presiding over the religious destiny of one hundred and eighty millions, its future requires study.  Here Hinduism is at home, in the bosom of its friends and admirers, courted by princes and millionaires, sustained by innumerable resources, embellished by thousands of temples and hundreds of thousands of idols, swarming with pilgrims, and crowned with the offerings of a superstitious devotion. Unhappily, he confines himself too much to the surface of things, giving us the dimensions of one temple after another in tedious iteration; the abundance of images, the superabundant filth, the manifest decay, the half-hidden traces of more ancient structures, marking them with a general uniformity. These shrines of one of the oldest religions are neither so vast, so beautiful, nor so worthy of imitation, as to require or repay this minute delineation. But very few and imperfectly illustrated are Mr. Sherring's views of the condition of Hinduism itself and its future. Judged externally, it was never so flourishing; making extraordinary effort to maintain itself against the inroads of European civilization under its priests, pundits, and princes; maintaining this immense city almost upon piety alone, gathering pilgrims by the acre, numbering its still occupied temples in its sacred city by the thousand. But beneath all this parade of piety is the increase of the thirst for knowledge as never before, the multiplication of debating societies, the predilection of young men for study, and the absolute freedom of thought; above all, the spreading sect of the Brahmos, who co-operate with the telegraph and railroad, the canal and the metalled road, in throwing India open to the quickening civilization of Europe. Few, indeed, study the Vedas now; Sanscrit is getting out of date; all classes are becoming scandalized by idolatry; Hinduism is held by a relaxing grasp; whenever the tide changes openly, when the warm imagination of the Hindu is turned to Christianity, and his heart vitalized by its influence, India will lead the rest of Asia in casting her idols away, will be the servant of a new civilization and the herald of a higher humanity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hall and the ''Oxford English Dictionary''==

In 1869 Hall was dismissed by the [[India Office]], which accused him (by his own account) of being a drunk and a foreign spy, and expelled from the [[Philological Society]] after a series of acrimonioous exchanges in the letters columns of various journals.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

He then moved to Suffolk&lt;ref&gt;''The Professor and the Madman'', pg. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; where, while leading the life of a recluse, he published more philological work. [[W. W. Skeat]], an early supporter of the OED idea, persuaded him to collaborate as a reader for the project. With another US citizen, Dr.[[William Chester Minor]], he would become one of the most important (and most obsessive) collaborators the OED Project’s director [[James Murray (lexicographer)|Sir James Murray]] (1837–1915) had, and is recognized as such in many of the prefaces to the ''Dictionary'' itself. His task was to read certain books looking for examples of the use of particular words, and then to send the relevant quotations to Murray’s staff.

According to scholar Elizabeth Knowles, who studied the Murray-Hall correspondence in the [[OED]] archives, Hall spent 'four hours a day...on [[Galley proof|proofs]]' and that 'for much of the rest of the time, he was reading for vocabulary'. Once he supplied more than 200 examples of the use of the word “hand” and had to be told that there was no space for so many.

Murray himself would say that “Time would fail to tell of the splendid assistance rendered to the ''Dictionary'' by Dr. Fitzedward Hall, who devotes nearly his whole day to reading the proofs...and to supplementing, correcting, and increasing the quotations taken from his own exhaustless stores. When the Dictionary is finished, no man will have contributed to its illustrative wealth so much as Fitzedward Hall. Those who know his books know the enormous wealth of quotation which he brings to bear upon every point of English literary usage; but my admiration is if possible increased when I see how he can cap and put the cope-stone on the collections of our 1500 readers.”

Hall was best at supplementing existing quotation collections for particular words. After his death, Murray corresponded with Hall’s son to try to find and reference the supplies of quotations his father had noted but not submitted, with unclear results.

Fitzedward Hall died at [[Marlesford]], Suffolk, on 1 February 1901.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

'''Garkain''' is a [[legendary creature]] in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] said to haunt the dense jungle along the [[Liverpool River]] in the [[Northern Territory]]. Should an unwary traveler enter his domain, Garkain swoops down from the trees on his leathery wings and envelops them.&lt;ref name = "firstuse"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Ainslie|last2=Mountford|first2=Charles P.|title=The First Sunrise: Australian Aboriginal Myths in Paintings|date=1971|publisher=Rigby|location=Adelaide|page = 22-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After suffocating his victim with his foul stench, Garkain devours their flesh, leaving the intruder’s spirit to forever wander the vast jungle in search of their final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Time-Life-Books (Editor)|author-link1=Time-Life|title=Tales of Terror - The Enchanted World|date=March 1987|publisher=Time-Life-Books|location=Amsterdam|page = 122-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guantánamo Bay files leak''' (also known as '''The Guantánamo Files''', or colloquially, '''Gitmo Files''')&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt; began on 25 April 2011, when [[WikiLeaks]], along with several independent news organizations, began publishing 779 formerly secret documents relating to detainees at the United States' [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]] established in 2002 after its invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt; The documents consist of classified assessments, interviews, and internal memos about detainees, which were written by [[the Pentagon]]'s [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]], headquartered at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]]. The documents are marked "secret" and [[NOFORN]] (information that is not to be shared with representatives of other countries).&lt;ref name=npr1 /&gt;

Media reports on the documents note that more than 150 innocent Afghans and Pakistanis, including farmers, chefs, and drivers, were held for years without charges.&lt;ref name=telegraph1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=independent1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=democracynow1 /&gt; The documents also reveal that some of the prison's youngest and oldest detainees, who include [[Mohammed Sadiq (detainee)|Mohammed Sadiq]], an 89-year-old man, and [[Naqib Ullah (child detainee)|Naqib Ullah]], a 14-year-old boy, suffered from fragile mental and physical conditions.&lt;ref name=guardian2 /&gt; The files contain statements from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the planner of the [[9/11 attacks]], who said that al-Qaeda [[nuclear terrorism|possessed nuclear capacity]] and would use it to retaliate for any attack on Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=telegraph1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsmax1 /&gt; The files also reveal the fate of wanted terrorist [[Mustafa Mohammed Fadhil]], who had been quietly removed from the FBI's most wanted terrorists list in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2011/04/27/20/us9sa-000713dp.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2011/04/28/05/us9ym-000041dp.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of the leak==
''[[The New York Times]]'' said it received the documents from an anonymous source other than WikiLeaks,&lt;ref name=huffpo1 /&gt; and it shared them with other news outlets such as [[NPR]] and ''[[The Guardian]]''. WikiLeaks suggested on Twitter that the source might be [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], a former associate.&lt;ref name=twitter-wikileaks3 /&gt; WikiLeaks noted that "our first partner, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', published the documents at 1:00 AM [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], long before ''NYT'' or ''Guardian''."&lt;ref name=twitter-wikileaks1 /&gt; Reuters speculated that the original source of the leak may have been [[Chelsea Manning]], a United States soldier then known as Bradley Manning, who was detained for allegedly having leaked other material to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=cnet1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters1 /&gt; ''The Guardian'' reported that "the Gitmo files are the fifth (and very nearly the final) cache of data that disaffected U.S. soldier Bradley Manning is alleged to have turned over to the WikiLeaks website more than a year ago."&lt;ref name=guardian3 /&gt; Before the time of Manning's alleged leak, WikiLeaks was already being reported and rumored to have these documents.&lt;ref name=thenation1 /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) said the documents remained legally classified despite the leaks. It informed the lawyers who represent the prisoners in Guantanamo that they were not allowed to read the documents, which have been published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other major media outlets.&lt;ref name=nyt2 /&gt;

The U.S. government issued a statement: "It is unfortunate that ''The New York Times'' and other news organizations have made the decision to publish numerous documents obtained illegally by WikiLeaks concerning the Guantanamo detention facility."&lt;ref name=guardian3 /&gt; The documents seem to be "Detainee Assessment Briefs" (DABs) written between 2002 and 2009 and "may or may not represent the current view of a given detainee."&lt;ref name=guardian3 /&gt;

==Notable elements==
''The Guardian'' noted that, despite the government's claim of having detained dangerous militants, the files, which covered almost all the prisoners held since 2002, revealed an emphasis of holding people to extract intelligence. Although many prisoners were assessed as not posing a threat to security, they were nonetheless detained for lengths of time.&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt;

The files showed that nearly 100 detainees had been diagnosed with [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] or [[psychotic]] illnesses. The United States tried to retain British nationals and legal residents, such as [[Jamal al-Harith]] and [[Binyam Mohamed]], for intelligence value, although its agents knew neither were members of the [[Taliban]] or [[al-Qaeda]], and Mohamed had been [[tortured]], so any "evidence" he provided was suspect due to that fact.&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt;

''The Guardian'' noted that the files revealed that the U.S. relied strongly on evidence obtained from a relatively few number of detainees, most of whom had been tortured. One detainee made allegations against more than 100 other detainees, so many that his accusations should have been considered suspect. The U.S. issued guidance to its interrogators that was based on assumptions of threat based on flimsy associations – through attendance at particular mosques, stays at certain guest houses in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and other elements.&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt;

The Guantanamo Files revealed that [[Sami al-Hajj]], an [[Al Jazeera]] journalist and cameraman, was detained from 2002 to 2008, allegedly in part so that U.S. officials could interrogate him about the news network. According to the file, he was detained "to provide information on ... the al-Jazeera news network's training programme, telecommunications equipment, and newsgathering operations in Chechnya, Kosovo and Afghanistan, including the network's acquisition of a video of UBL [Osama bin Laden] and a subsequent interview with UBL." He was considered to be "a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests, and allies" and "of HIGH intelligence value."&lt;ref name=wikileaks-gitmo1 /&gt;

Sami al-Haji has said that he was beaten and sexually assaulted in detention. His lawyer [[Clive Stafford Smith]], also legal director of the British organisation [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], said that the U.S. had tried to force al-Haji to become an [[informant]] against his employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Cobain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-sami-al-hajj |title=Guantánamo Bay files: Al-Jazeera cameraman held for six years &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed===
Other documents cited [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the planner of the [[9/11 attacks]], saying that if [[Osama bin Laden]] was captured or killed by [[Coalition of the Willing|U.S. allies]], an Al-Qaeda [[sleeper cell]] would detonate a "weapon of mass destruction" in a "secret location" in Europe. He said it would be "[[nuclear terrorism|a nuclear hellstorm]]".&lt;ref name=telegraph1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsmax1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=news.com.au1 /&gt; By March 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been [[Waterboarding|waterboarded]] at least 183 times by the [[CIA]], which held him in custody until September 2006, when he was transferred to Guantanamo.&lt;ref name=nyt1 /&gt; No such attack has occurred following the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killing of bin Laden]] in May 2011.&lt;ref name=noref/&gt; Al-Qaeda has vowed to retaliate.&lt;ref name=washpost1 /&gt;

==Reactions==
WikiLeaks has said that, as with previous releases, at least as important as the content of the published documents is that readers should note the reaction of each [[media news outlet]]. For instance, WikiLeaks suggested "[comparing] the first paragraph of these two stories about the same thing" by BBC and ''CNN''.&lt;ref name=twitter-wikileaks2 /&gt;

The [[BBC]] version opened with the following statement:&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;

{{quote|Wikileaks: Many at Guantanamo 'not dangerous' – Files obtained by the website Wikileaks have revealed that the U.S. believed many of those held at Guantanamo Bay were innocent or only low-level operatives.}}

[[CNN]] stated:&lt;ref name=cnn1 /&gt;

{{quote|Military documents reveal details about Guantanamo detainees, al Qaeda – Nearly 800 classified U.S. military documents obtained by WikiLeaks reveal extraordinary details about the alleged terrorist activities of al Qaeda operatives captured and housed at the U.S. Navy's detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.}}

The contrast between foreign and United States media was noted by several journalists,&lt;ref name=wsws1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thenation2 /&gt; including [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. He described the differences as "stark, predictable and revealing". He wrote, "Foreign newspapers highlight how these documents show U.S. actions to be so oppressive and unjust, while American newspapers downplayed that fact."&lt;ref name=salon1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4166">The '''Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System''' ('''HCPCS''', often pronounced by its acronym as "hick picks") is a set of [[health care]] [[procedure codes]] based on the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://coder.aapc.com/hcpcs-codes-range|title = HCPCS Codes|last = HCPCS Code range|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The acronym ''HCPCS'' originally stood for ''HCFA Common Procedure Coding System'', a medical billing process used by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS). Prior to 2001, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). HCPCS was established in 1978 to provide a standardized coding system for describing the specific items and services provided in the delivery of health care. Such coding is necessary for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and other health insurance programs to ensure that insurance claims are processed in an orderly and consistent manner. Initially, use of the codes was voluntary, but with the implementation of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] of 1996 (HIPAA) use of the HCPCS for transactions involving health care information became mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo/downloads/HCPCSReform.pdf|title=New CMS coding changes will help beneficiaries|page=1|date=October 6, 2004|publisher=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]|access-date=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of codes==
HCPCS includes three levels of codes:
*'''Level I''' consists of the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) and is numeric.
*'''[[HCPCS Level 2|Level II]]''' codes are alphanumeric and primarily include non-physician services such as [[ambulance]] services and [[prosthetic]] devices, and represent items and supplies and non-physician services, not covered by CPT-4 codes (Level I).
*'''Level III''' codes, also called local codes, were developed by state Medicaid agencies, Medicare contractors, and private insurers for use in specific programs and jurisdictions. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) instructed CMS to adopt a standard coding systems for reporting medical transactions. The use of Level III codes was discontinued on December 31, 2003, in order to adhere to consistent coding standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.optum360coding.com/upload/pdf/1545/Coding%20Pymt.Gde.Behav.Serv.pdf|title=Coding and Payment Guide for Behavioral Health Services|last=|first=|date=|website=www.optum360coding.com|publisher=[[Ingenix]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201230845/https://www.optum360coding.com/upload/pdf/1545/Coding%20Pymt.Gde.Behav.Serv.pdf|archive-date=2018-12-01|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}} Level III codes were different from the modern CPT Category III codes, which were introduced in 2001 to code emerging technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/ama-assn.org/files/corp/media-browser/public/cpt/cat-3-codes-first-10-yrs_1.pdf|title=CPT® Category III Codes: The First Ten Years|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201231638/https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/ama-assn.org/files/corp/media-browser/public/cpt/cat-3-codes-first-10-yrs_1.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-01|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jibaozhai Museum''' was a museum and 'patriotic education center' that was located in the village of [[Erpu]] in [[Jizhou City|Jizhou]], which is in the province of [[Hebei]].&lt;ref name="BBC News China"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23328664 | title=China 'fake exhibit' museum shut down | publisher=BBC | accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was closed in 2013 due to a fraud.

==Construction==
The museum was built in 2007. It contained twelve exhibit halls and 40,000 exhibits. The collection was said to cost 20 million yuan.&lt;ref name="Sankaku Complex"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2013/07/16/china-closes-fake-museum/ | title=China Closes "Fake Museum" | accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a former accountant from the village claims that the collection was worth 30 million yuan, which has made many in the village suspicious that the museum was a front for money laundering by the local communist party chief, [[Wang Zongquan]].&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/fake-museum-china-shut-down-suspected-be-money-laundering-front-1348563?ft=1pz97 | title=Fake Museum In China Shut Down, Suspected To Be A Money-Laundering Front | publisher=[[International Business Times|IBT Media Inc.]] | accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
On July 6, 2013, a popular writer from Beijing named [[Ma Boyong]] visited the museum and discovered that many of the artifacts were fake, and posted this information on his microblog. This led to an investigation by the authorities where it was found that most of the items in the museum were fakes. Exhibits included a vase with contemporary cartoon characters and artifacts that were said to be from 2700 BC but had modern simplified Chinese characters on them.&lt;ref name="Sankaku Complex"/&gt; The authorities closed the museum and revoked its license for fraud.&lt;ref name="CRIENGLISH.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2013/07/14/195s775708.htm | title=An Unauthorized Museum in Hebei under Investigation | publisher=CRIENGLISH.com | accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7436">[[Deutsche Bahn]] and its predecessors [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]], [[Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] and [[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft|DRG]] use a system of letters to denote a station on their network. This [[station code]] is called the '''DS-100 code''', named after the original papers laying out the system, the ''DS 100, Abkürzungen der Betriebsstellen''.

== Description of the code ==
The code is set up as follows:
*'''X''' ''YYYY'' ''Z''
where '''X''' denotes the ''[[Bundesbahndirektion]]'' (''BD'') in West Germany or ''[[Reichsbahndirektion]]'' (''Rbd'') in East Germany and prior to 1949, and '''YYYY''' is the code of the station itself, which can be up to four letters. It is noteworthy that whilst some of the ''Direktionen'' have been merged into others, changed, or otherwise remodeled, their old codes remained in place. For example, most of the Northern areas of Germany still have the BD code '''A''' for '''''Altona''''' (now a part of [[Hamburg]]), even though the BD Altona has long been out of existence.
Further information can be added by an extra letter after the station identifier, for example '''HB''' is the code for [[Bremen Hauptbahnhof]], (BD Hanover (H), station code B) whilst '''HB X''' is the code for the Bremen maintenance works, which are considered a subdivision of Bremen Hauptbahnhof and hence do not have their own code.
Special codes are also used to identify border points, special tariff points for ships et cetera.

==Abbreviations==
For the meaning of the standard German railway abbreviations (''Bf'' etc.) used in the main table below see: [[Railway station types of Germany]]

== Listing of BD/RbD codes ==
* '''A''' &amp;ndash; [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]
* '''B''' &amp;ndash; [[Berlin]]
* '''D''' &amp;ndash; [[Dresden]]
* '''E''' &amp;ndash; [[Essen]]
* '''F''' &amp;ndash; [[Frankfurt]]
* '''H''' &amp;ndash; [[Hannover]]
* '''K''' &amp;ndash; [[Köln]]
* '''L''' &amp;ndash; [[Halle (Saale)]]
* '''N''' &amp;ndash; [[Nürnberg]]
* '''M''' &amp;ndash; [[München]]
* '''R''' &amp;ndash; [[Karlsruhe]]
* '''S''' &amp;ndash; [[Saarbrücken]]
* '''T''' &amp;ndash; [[Stuttgart]]
* '''U''' &amp;ndash; [[Erfurt]]
* '''W''' &amp;ndash; [[Schwerin]]
* '''X''' &amp;ndash; Codes assigned for international destinations west of Germany
* '''Z''' &amp;ndash; Codes assigned for international destinations east of Germany
&lt;!-- not exactly sure whether to put them here, whole of germany would make this list HUGE. left here for the moment to conserve the work already done, might break this up into sub-articles or trim it down to notable stations and junctions. --&gt;

'''MEDLINE''' (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or MEDLARS Online) is a [[bibliographic database]] of life sciences and biomedical information. It includes bibliographic information for articles from [[academic journal]]s covering [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[veterinary medicine]], and [[health care]]. MEDLINE also covers much of the literature in [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]], as well as fields such as [[molecular evolution]].

Compiled by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), MEDLINE is freely available on the [[Internet]] and searchable via [[PubMed]] and NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information's [[Entrez]] system.

== History ==
MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) is a computerised biomedical [[bibliography|bibliographic]] retrieval system. It was launched by the [[National Library of Medicine]] in 1964 and was the first large scale, computer based, retrospective search service available to the general public.&lt;ref name=NLMHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/nlmhistory.html |title=Milestones in NLM History |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial development of MEDLARS ===
Since 1879, the National Library of Medicine had published ''[[Index Medicus]]'', a monthly guide to medical articles in thousands of journals. The huge volume of bibliographic citations was manually compiled. In 1957 the staff of the NLM started to plan the mechanization of the ''Index Medicus'', prompted by a desire for a better way to manipulate all this information, not only for ''Index Medicus'' but also to produce subsidiary products. By 1960 a detailed specification was prepared and by the spring of 1961 a request for proposals was sent out to 72 companies to develop the system. As a result, a contract was awarded to the [[General Electric Company]]. The computer (a [[Honeywell|Minneapolis-Honeywell 800]]) which was to run MEDLARS was delivered to the NLM in March 1963, and [[Frank Bradway Rogers]] (Director of the NLM 1949 to 1963) said at the time "..If all goes well, the January 1964 issue of ''Index Medicus'' will be ready to emerge from the system at the end of this year. It may be that this will mark the beginning of a new era in medical bibliography."

MEDLARS cost $3 million to develop and at the time of its completion in 1964, no other publicly available, fully operational electronic storage and retrieval system of its magnitude existed. The original computer configuration operated from 1964 until its replacement by MEDLARS II in January 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Frank B. "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=198085 The Development of MEDLARS]" Bull Med Libr Assoc. 1964 January; 52(1): 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Wyndham. The History of the NLM: Chapter 20 - [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/miles/miles_20.pdf Evolution of Computerized Bibliographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017211456/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/miles/miles_20.pdf |date=2012-10-17 }} (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MEDLARS Online ===
In late 1971, an online version called MEDLINE ("MEDLARS Online") became available as a way to do online searching of MEDLARS from remote medical libraries.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment (1982), [http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_4/DATA/1982/8219.PDF MEDLARS and Health Information Policy]. {{ISBN|1-4289-2424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early system covered 239 journals and boasted that it could support as many as 25 simultaneous online users (remotely logged-in from distant medical libraries) at one time.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/ecp/sepoct00/nlm.pdf|title=Internet Access to the National Library of Medicine|accessdate=6 April 2016|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102194044/http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/ecp/sepoct00/nlm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this system remained primarily in the hands of libraries, with researchers able to submit pre-programmed search tasks to librarians and obtain results on printouts, but rarely able to interact with the NLM computer output in real-time. This situation continued through the beginning of the 1990s and the rise of the [[World Wide Web]].

In 1996, soon after most home computers began automatically bundling efficient [[web browser]]s, a free public version of MEDLINE was instigated. This system, called [[PubMed]], was offered to the general online user in June, 1997, when MEDLINE searches via the Web were demonstrated, in a public ceremony, by Vice President [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

== Database ==
The database contains more than 26 million records&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=all[sb|publisher=NLM Systems|title=Pubmed all[sb]|date=2016-05-12|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 5,639 selected publications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/num_titles.html|publisher=NLM|title=Number of Titles Currently Indexed for Index Medicus® and MEDLINE® on Pubmed®|date=2013-07-09|accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering biomedicine and health from 1950 to the present. Originally the database covered articles starting from 1965, but this has been enhanced, and records as far back as 1950/51 are now available within the main index. The database is freely accessible on the Internet via the PubMed interface and new citations are added Tuesday through Saturday. For citations added during 1995-2003: about 48% are for cited articles published in the U.S., about 88% are published in English, and about 76% have English abstracts written by authors of the articles. The most common topic in the database is Cancer with around 12% of all records between 1950-2016, which have risen from 6% in 1950 to 16% in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reyes-Aldasoro C | title = The proportion of cancer-related entries in PubMed has increased considerably; is cancer truly “The Emperor of All Maladies”? | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = e0173671 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28282418 | pmc = 5345838 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0173671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retrieval ==
MEDLINE uses [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) for information retrieval. Engines designed to search MEDLINE (such as Entrez and PubMed) generally use a [[Boolean expression]] combining MeSH terms, words in abstract and title of the article, author names, date of publication, etc. Entrez and PubMed can also find articles similar to a given one based on a mathematical scoring system that takes into account the similarity of word content of the abstracts and titles of two articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/423|publisher=BMC Bioinformatics (2007) 8:423|title=
PubMed related articles: a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEDLINE added a "publication type" term for “randomized controlled trial” in 1991 and a MESH subset “systematic review” in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public.|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States.|date=2005|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83790/|chapter=State of Emerging Evidence on CAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
MEDLINE functions as an important resource for biomedical researchers and [[journal club]]s from all over the world. Along with the [[Cochrane Library]] and a number of other databases, MEDLINE facilitates [[evidence-based medicine]]. Most [[systematic review]] articles published presently build on extensive searches of MEDLINE to identify articles that might be useful in the review. MEDLINE influences researchers in their choice of journals in which to publish.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Inclusion of journals ==
More than 5,200 biomedical journals are indexed in MEDLINE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MEDLINE®: Description of the Database |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html |website=www.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. New journals are not included automatically or immediately. Selection is based on the recommendations of a panel, the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee, based on scientific scope and quality of a journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/jsel.html|publisher=LSTRC|title=MEDLINE Journal Selection Fact Sheet|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Journals Database (one of the Entrez databases) contains information, such as its name abbreviation and publisher, about all journals included in Entrez, including PubMed.&lt;ref name=PubMedTutorial&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/020_550.html |title=PubMed Tutorial - Building the Search - Search Tools - Journals Database |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
PubMed usage has been on the rise since 2008. In 2011, PubMed/MEDLINE was searched 1.8 billion times, up from 1.6 billion searches in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/bsd_key.html|publisher=NLM|title=Key MEDLINE® Indicators|date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A service such as MEDLINE strives to balance [[usability]] with power and comprehensiveness. In keeping with the fact that MEDLINE's primary user community is professionals ([[healthcare science|medical scientists]], [[health care provider]]s), searching MEDLINE effectively is a learned skill; untrained users are sometimes frustrated with the large numbers of articles returned by simple searches. Counterintuitively, a search that returns thousands of articles is not guaranteed to be comprehensive. Unlike using a typical Internet search engine, PubMed searching of MEDLINE requires a little investment of time. Using the MeSH database to define the subject of interest is one of the most useful ways to improve the quality of a search. Using MeSH terms in conjunction with limits (such as publication date or publication type), qualifiers (such as adverse effects or prevention and control), and text-word searching is another. Finding one article on the subject and clicking on the "Related Articles" link to get a collection of similarly classified articles can expand a search that otherwise yields few results.

For [[wikt:layperson|lay users]] who are trying to learn about health and medicine topics, the NIH offers [[MedlinePlus]]; thus, although such users are still free to search and read the medical literature themselves (via [[PubMed]]), they also have some help with [[content curation|curating]] it into something comprehensible and practically applicable for patients and family members.

{{Rastafari}}
'''Mansions of Rastafari''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the various groups of the [[Rastafari movement]]. Such groups include the [[Bobo Ashanti]], the [[Niyabinghi]], &lt;!-- If you want to change the spelling used in this article then remember to change all instances --&gt; the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], and several smaller groups, including African Unity, Covenant Rastafari, Messianic Dreads and the Selassian Church&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Darren J. N. (2015) ''Rastafari and the Arts: An Introduction'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415831895}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is taken from the [[Bible|Biblical]] verse in John 14:2, "In my Father's house are many mansions."

Many individual Rastas are only loosely affiliated with these Mansions, or not at all, in keeping with the principle of [[freedom of conscience]], a general distrust of institutionalism shared by many, and the teachings of [[Haile Selassie I]] as Emperor that "faith is private" and a direct relationship requiring no intermediary.{{or|date=December 2017}} Beliefs differ between the mansions, with varying views on the [[Bible]], [[dreadlocks]], diet, and [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]].&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt;

Bobo Shanti are known as the Priestical House of Rastafari, also called EABIC (Ethiopian Africa Black International Congress/ Church of Salvation), Boboshanti live separate from society, and function similarly to the Accompong Maroons, even though it is not official, like an independent nation within Jamaica but have their own constitution. We do not accept the values and lifestyle of the general Jamaican society. The lifestyle closely emulates those of jews, which includes the observation of the Sabbath from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday (or 6 PM), No work is allowed during the Sabbath and the consumption of salt and oil is avoided, we wear the robe and turban, and observe the ten commandments. Women in the church wear clothes down to their ankles and cover their heads. Bobo Shanti women also keep a 21-day "purification principle' related to their menstrual cycle. This limits the number of days woman can interact with men and are allowed to enter the tabernacle and participate in ceremonies. Boboshanti accept all colors and all are welcome.

==Twelve Tribes of Israel==
{{main|Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)}}

'''The Twelve Tribes of Israel''' is a [[Rastafari]] group founded in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] in 1968, and now functioning worldwide.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;Summers, Chris (2014) "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28059303 The Rastafarians' flawed African 'promised land']", [[BBC]], 12 September 2014. Retrieved 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, [[Vernon Carrington]], was known as Prophet Gad, and taught his students to read the Bible 'a chapter a day'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/twelvetribes.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Rastafari: The Twelve Tribes of Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve Tribes of Israel (Ysrayl) [[Rastafari]] organization accept Jesus Christ as Master and Saviour, and [[Haile Selassie I]] as divinely chosen by the [[Creator deity|Creator]] to represent him on earth. Due to the stigma associated with [[slavery]] and the use of the name "Jesus" by outsiders, Some Rastafari prefer to use the ancient names of [[Christ|The Messiah]] (Ha Mashiyahch) which is Yahshuwah, Yahoshua or [[Yahshua]] (original sacred [[Hebrew]] name) and Yesus/I-Yesus Kristos ([[Amharic]]/[[Ge'ez]] name).

Haile Selassie is seen as a divinely anointed king in the lineage of Kings [[King David|David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]].  While he is considered a type/representation of The Messiyah in Kingly Character, he is not Yahshuwah The Messiyah/Yesus Kristos himself, but a representative of the everlasting [[Davidic]] [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], which is to be fulfilled by The Messiah[[Yahshuah]]/ I-Yesus Kristos when he returns as The Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah (Yahudah).

[[The Twelve Tribes]] symbology is based on Yahqob's ([[Jacob]]) 12 sons, and correspond to the months of the ancient Ysraylite ([[Israelite]]) calendar, beginning with April and [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]].&lt;ref name="Summers" /&gt; The Most High [[Jah]]/[[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]]/[[YHWH]] gave Yahqob a new name which was Ysrayl ([[Israel]]). Some people further relate the 12 Tribes to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] signs. Thus [[Bob Marley]] came from the Tribe of Yowseph ([[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]), the eleventh of the biblical Ysrayl's (Israel's) twelve children (because he was born in February). The name [[Levi]] in [[Ijahman Levi]] represents the third child who was born to Yahqob ([[Jacob]]). Another well known [[reggae]] group of this organization is [[Israel Vibration]].

[[Bob Marley]], by quoting a [[Bible|biblical]] passage about Yowseph (Joseph) on the album cover of ''Rastaman Vibration'', was acknowledging his own support for this sect.  [[Dennis Brown]], [[Freddie McGregor]], [[Mikey Dread]], [[Luciano (singer)|Luciano]] and many other [[roots reggae]] artists were associated with The Twelve Tribes of Israel (Ysrayl).&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt;

Some hold that everyone should be free to light up the pipe - but only if they want to.

Like its precursor Nyahbinghi (see below), Twelve Tribes is very anti-racist and often preaches love toward all people, but still ascribe to black uplift as foretold by Marcus Garvey.

==Nyahbinghi==
{{main|Nyabinghi}}

The Nyahbinghi Order (also known as Haile Selassie I Theocratical Order of the Nyahbinghi  Reign) is the oldest of all the Rastafari mansions, named after Queen Niyabinghi, a 19th-century [[Uganda]]n ruler who fought against the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Summers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/nyahbinghi.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Rastafari: Nyahbinghi Order|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be spelled in a variety of other ways, such as "Nyabinghi", "Nyahbinghi", "Niyahbinghi" and so on. &lt;!-- If you want to change the spelling used in this article then remember to change all instances --&gt; It was first used to describe an East African possession cult located in the areas of south Uganda and north Rwanda in 1700 C.E. (Hopkins, p.&amp;nbsp;259).  Early missionaries and anthropologists named the Uganda/Rwanda clans, the Niyabinghi Cult, because their culture was based on the veneration of the goddess spirit, Niyabinghi. The Niyabinghi Cult is said to have thrived due to the possession of the goddess Niyabinghi through dance and religious seances. 

Various oral traditions exist that explain how Niyabinghi became a revered goddess.  One account states that in 1700 C.E., two tribes inhabited the Uganda/Rwanda area: the Shambo and Bgeishekatwa.  Queen Kitami, who is said to have possessed a sacred drum of phenomenal power, ruled the Bgeishekatwa tribe.  When Kitami died, she was given immortal status and the name Niyabinghi (Freedman, p.&amp;nbsp;63).  Another tradition states that Queen Niyabinghi ruled the Northwestern Tanzani kingdom of Karagwe and married the chief of Mpororo from the southwestern kingdom of Uganda.  Envious of the Queen's power, the ruler ordered her death which is said to have brought "untold horrors to his kingdom" (Kiyaga-Mulindwa, p.&amp;nbsp;1163).  After her death, her spirit continued to be praised and to possess her followers for the next two centuries.

The Bgeishekatwa tribe was eventually defeated by the Shambo clan who adopted the Bgeishekatwa’s rituals for Nyahbinghi.  A century later, the Shambo were defeated by the cultivating Kiga clan (there are legends that the Shambo’s defeat is connected to the attempt to kill a woman who was possessed by Nyahbinghi) (Freedman, p.&amp;nbsp;74).  Once the Kiga tribe reigned over the land, Niyabinghi became known as a matriarchal power, and the Kiga’s century-rule is characterized as the reign of the Niyabinghi priestesses.

Kiga women who received Nyahbinghi’s blessings and were said to be possessed by Nyahbinghi came to be called ''bagirwa'' (Hopkins, p.&amp;nbsp;259).  Eventually, the revered ''bagirwa'' gained political dominion and became governors of the Kiga people, living a dual life of political and spiritual leadership.  The bagirwa, including Muhumusa, remained governors of the Kiga people until 1930 after losing their land to British, German, and Belgian imperialists, which they fought for a period of twenty years.  The singular form of the word "bagirwa" is "mugirwa". At some point, men became Nyahbinghi priests as well (Freedman, pp.&amp;nbsp;80–81).

The Nyahbinghi Theocracy Government was named for a legendary [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen of the same name, who was said to have [[spiritual possession|possessed]] a [[Uganda]]n woman named [[Muhumusa]] in the 19th century. Muhumusa inspired a movement, rebelling against African colonial authorities.  Though she was captured in 1913, alleged possessions by "Niyabinghi" continued, mostly afflicting women.

However, Nyahbinghi doesn't have any linkage to or relationship with Ethiopian history or Haile Selassie, it is a part of the Rastafari movement and a manifestation of the wisdom of Jah. Niyabinghi are considered the strictest mansion of the [[Rastafari movement]] in [[Jamaica]], preaching the ideals of a global theocracy to be headed by Emperor [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie I]], whom they proclaim to be the promised [[Messiah]] and incarnation of Jah, the Supreme.

They have also been known to be very [[anti-racist]]. But reflect a deep belief in the uplift of the black race. They also express that oppressors towards anybody will be punished by Jah. People of the Nyahbinghi faith often (but not always) affiliate themselves with [[nonviolence]]. Sometimes they may embrace [[just war theory]] while not necessarily approving of St. Augustine's other principles. However, the Nyabinghi manifesto reads: "Intimate relations with whites is strictly forbidden. A Nyahbinghi Man should not abide with a woman who is not of Rastafari livity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyahbinghi.com/files/guidelines.htm|title=Royal Ethiopian Creed and Anthem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nyahbinghi music ===
The Niyabinghi resistance inspired a number of [[Jamaica]]n [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]], who incorporated what are known as '''[[niyabinghi chants]]''' (also '''binghi''') into their celebrations (''groundations''). The [[rhythm]]s of these chants were eventually an influence of popular [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] music.  Three kinds of drums (called "harps") are used in niyabinghi: [[bass (sound)|bass]], also known as the "Pope Smasher" or "Vatican Basher", reflecting a Rasta association between Catholicism and [[Babylon]], the middle-pitched [[funde]] and [[akete]].  The akete (also known as the "repeater") plays an [[improvisation|improvised]] [[syncopation]], the funde plays a regular one-two beat and the bass drum strikes loudly on the first beat, and softly on the third beat (of four).  When groups of players get together, only one akete player may play at any one time.  The other drums keep regular rhythms while the akete players solo in the form of a conversation. [[Count Ossie]] was the first to record niyabinghi, and he helped to establish and maintain Rastafari culture.

Niyabinghi drumming is not exclusive to the Niyabinghi order, and is common to all Rastafari.  Its rhythms are the basis of Reggae music, through the influential ska band, the [[Skatalites]]. It is said that their drummer revolutionized Jamaican music by combining the various Niyabinghi parts into a 'complete' "drum kit," which combined with jazz to create an entirely new form of music, known as [[Ska music|ska]].  Niyabinghi rhythms were largely a creation of Count Ossie, who incorporated influences from traditional Jamaican Kumina drumming (especially the form of the drums themselves) with songs and rhythms learned from the recordings of Nigerian musician [[Babatunde Olatunji]].

Binghi chanting typically includes recitation of the [[Psalm]]s, but may also include variations of well-known Christian hymns.  Though Count Ossie is clearly the most influential Binghi drummer, practically inventing the genre, the recordings of [[Ras Michael]] and the [[Sons of Negus]], as well as the Rastafari Elders, have contributed to the popularity of the music.

Though Niyabinghi music operates as a form of Rasta religious music outside of Reggae, musicians such as Bob Marley and even non-Rastas such [[Prince Buster]] (Muslim) and [[Jimmy Cliff]] used the idiom in some songs. Recently, dancehall sensation [[Sizzla]], American roots-Reggae artists such as [[Groundation]] and [[Rap music|Hip hop]] have used Niyabinghi drums extensively in their recordings. Though sometimes claimed to be a direct continuation of an African cultural form, Niyabinghi drumming is best seen as the voice of a people rediscovering their African roots.

Combining Jamaican traditions with newly acquired African ones, Count Ossie and others synthesized his country's African traditions and reinvigorated them with the influences of Nigerian master-drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], as a comparison of Count Ossie's ''Tales of Mozambique'' and Olatunji's earlier ''[[Drums of Passion]]'' will reveal.  Indeed, it is that combination of inherited traditions and conscious rediscovery of lost African traditions that makes Niyabinghi drumming&amp;mdash;and [[Rastafari movement|Rasta]]&amp;mdash;so powerful.

A '''media guide''' is a sports-related [[press kit]], distributed as a book or binder, and published by sports teams before the start of the [[Season (sport)|sporting season]]. It features information relating to the team players, history, [[statistics|statistical records]] and other similar items. Media guides are usually distributed to [[Sportswriting|sports journalists]] to assist in their [[broadcasting]] of the team game. 

While generally not sold in retail [[Retailing|stores]], media guides for professional sports teams are often available in their online stores or home web sites, along with being sold in physical form to the game attending public with [[Programme (booklet)#Sporting event|game programs]] at in-stadium stands. Many major college and university sport media guides are available in [[PDF|electronic format]] for free on their home web sites. Following the end of the season, the printed media guides are often discarded or given to fans of the team. 

Press Guides - later known as Media guides - have existed since at least the 1930s and provide one of the few detailed sources of comprehensive historical athletic data before the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] requirements of the 1980s.

'''Microsoft Entourage''' is a discontinued [[e-mail client]] and [[personal information manager]] that was developed by [[Microsoft]] for [[Mac OS 8.5]] and later. Microsoft first released Entourage in October 2000 as part of the [[Microsoft Office 2001]] [[office suite]]; [[Office 98]], the previous version of Microsoft Office for the [[classic Mac OS]] included [[Outlook Express]] 5. The last version was Entourage: Mac 2008, part of [[Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac]], released on January 15, 2008. Entourage was replaced by [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook for Macintosh]] in [[Microsoft Office for Mac 2011]], released on October 26, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Overview==
[[Image:My Day.png|left|thumb|My Day, a mini schedule]]

Entourage provided [[email]], [[calendar]], [[address book]], [[task list]], note list, and project manager functionality. With Entourage 2004, Microsoft began offering a Project Center, which allowed the user to create and organize projects. Information may come from within Entourage or outside the program. Entourage supported retrieving email using [[Post Office Protocol|POP]], [[IMAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Entourage 2008 featured a new "My Day" utility, which assists in organizing one's day, and cites (in the welcome message) improvements to search speed, "to do" flags, improved junk mail and [[phishing]] protection, as well as quick navigation via favorites and customizable toolbars.

==Features==
Entourage supported some Mac OS technologies, like the [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] search engine and AppleScript; however, the use of a monolithic database made it difficult to back up incrementally with Time Machine. Entourage also maintained a separate address book, but allowed synchronization of contacts and calendar events through [[iSync|Sync Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Comparison to Outlook===

Unlike the other applications in the Mac version of the [[Microsoft Office]] suite, Entourage did not share a name with its [[Microsoft Windows]] counterpart. Microsoft claimed that Entourage was intended "to address an entirely different audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===As a client for Microsoft Exchange===
Entourage had included support for Microsoft Exchange servers since August 4, 2003, when the Exchange Update for Entourage X was released. This early release required the use of IMAP for mail connectivity and WebDAV for address and calendar functionality. (Subsequent versions have dropped the requirement for IMAP and rely solely on WebDAV.) Users complained of the lack of a variety of functions present in Outlook for Windows and Outlook 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One major shortcoming of Entourage was its inability to handle complex HTML. While messages could be received and viewed correctly, they could not be forwarded without all formatting being stripped out. As an example, an airline confirmation received from, say, Imaginary Airlines, could not be forwarded without all of the pictorial information being reduced to links, rendering the e-mail unreadable. A workaround for this was to choose "Forward as attachment" which forwarded the message as a [[E-mail#Message format|message/rfc822]] file, and preserved complex HTML formatting.

An additional limitation was the inability to attach what is referred to as an "Item" in Outlook to a message while it was being composed since there was no menu choice to allow this. Instead, a user needed to find the item to be forwarded, i.e., a Contact, select it, then choose Forward as vCard from the menu.

It was also not possible to create or manage server side rules on the Exchange server, so filtering only worked when the Entourage application was running.

===Limitations===

Entourage could not natively read [[.pst|Outlook Personal Folder files]] and could not read Outlook archived emails without first re-importing them back into the main Windows Outlook database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mac/help.mspx?target=1210e1d5-8d1c-47fc-8bd8-d14ce8d490de1033&amp;clr=99-2-0&amp;parentid=c47a6d08-471b-43bf-acfe-f530d36d939e1033&amp;ep=7&amp;CTT=Category&amp;MODE=pv&amp;locale=en-US&amp;usid=26149fe0-9f81-4b5d-aa86-9e5daf5d02ec |title=Microsoft Office Help &amp; How-To’s &amp;#124; Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook Help |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was impossible to directly transfer email data from Outlook (Windows) into Entourage (Mac).

Although Microsoft had released a PST Import Tool for Entourage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9B95CFE2-EA2B-4088-AF2C-2FD497E2A6F8&amp;displaylang=en|title=Download PST Import Tool for Entourage from Official Microsoft Download Center|publisher=Microsoft|work=microsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; this did not directly solve the problem of exporting data from Windows to Mac, because this utility could only import PST files from Outlook 2001 for the Mac.

One could import a Windows Outlook 2000 compatible PST to Mac Outlook 2001, and then use the utility to import into Entourage. To address this, Microsoft made Mac Outlook 2001 available for free download.

This wasn't a solution for all Mac users, because Outlook 2001 only runs in the [[Classic Environment]], which cannot run in OS 10.5 or on any Intel Macs. Outlook for Office 2011 for Intel Macs, is able to import Outlook .pst files from Windows;&lt;ref name="Introducing Office for Mac 2011: The Quintessential Teammate"&gt;{{cite web 
| url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/feb10/02-11msmacworld2010pr.mspx
| title=Introducing Office for Mac 2011: The Quintessential Teammate
| publisher= Microsoft.com
| accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, data will be stored as many individual files, rather than in a single database such as .pst or the Entourage database.

Macworld indicates that Windows Outlook messages can be transferred to Apple Mail or Entourage by using [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] as an intermediate agent.  Thunderbird on Windows is used to import the mail from Outlook.

{{italictitle}}
'''''Munificentissimus Deus''''' ({{lang-la|The most bountiful God}}) is the name of an [[Apostolic constitution]] written by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It defines ''[[ex cathedra]]'' the [[dogma]] of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]]. It was the first ''ex-cathedra'' [[Papal infallibility|infallible]] statement since the official ruling on papal infallibility was made at the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870). In 1854 [[Pope Pius IX]] made an infallible statement with ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' on the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the Virgin Mary, which was a basis for this dogma. The decree was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 1 November 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 207 {{ISBN|0-8160-5455-X}} page 267&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dogma of the Assumption==
On 1 November 1950, invoking his dogmatic authority, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma: 

:"By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory".&lt;ref&gt;''Munificentissimus Deus'', 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Pope Pius XII's previous encyclical ''[[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]]'' (1 May 1946) to all Catholic bishops stated that for a long time past, numerous petitions had been received from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests, religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable private persons, all begging that the bodily Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a dogma of faith.&lt;ref name=Pius&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_01051946_deiparae-virginis-mariae.html Pope Pius Xii. "Deiparae Virginis Maria", §2, May 1, 1946, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; This was also fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] (1869–1870).&lt;ref name=Pius/&gt;

Following the example of [[Pope Pius IX]], who canvassed Catholic bishops before proclaiming the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]], Pius XII asked all bishops for their opinion.
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}

:"Actually God, who from all eternity regards Mary with a most favorable and unique affection, has 'when the fullness of time came' put the plan of his providence into effect in such a way that all the privileges and prerogatives he had granted to her in his sovereign generosity were to shine forth in her in a kind of perfect harmony. And, although the Church has always recognized this supreme generosity and the perfect harmony of graces and has daily studied them more and more throughout the course of the centuries, still it is in our own age that the privilege of the bodily Assumption into heaven of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, has certainly shone forth more clearly".&lt;ref&gt;''Munificentissimus Deus'', §3&lt;/ref&gt;   

At issue was not the belief in the Assumption, but its dogmatisation. ''Munificentissimus Deus'' reports popular acclaim and "nearly unanimous" approval of the contemporary bishops. The names of the bishops attending the dogma celebration in 1950 are listed at the entrance of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].

==Review of Catholic beliefs==
The decree surveys theological history, especially the history of the belief in the [[Catholic]] Christian [[tradition]], ... "the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church have never failed to draw enlightenment from this fact",&lt;ref&gt;''Munificentissimus Deus'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Munificentissimus Deus'' reviews the history of Catholic [[liturgy]] and the many [[liturgical book]]s, ... "which deal with the feast either of the Dormition or of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin",&lt;ref&gt;''Munificentissimus Deus'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; and the teaching of previous popes. ''Munificentissimus Deus'' cites also the teaching of previous bishops and such writers as [[John of Damascus]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Anthony of Padua]] and [[Albert the Great]] among others.

"In the theology of Pope Pius XII, the Assumption of Mary's body and soul into heaven flow from her Immaculate Conception.The end balances the beginning, both having their profound reason in Mary's mission as the Theotokos..."&lt;ref&gt;Tavard, George H., ''The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary'', (Collegeille, Minnesota) Michael Glazier Books, 1996, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to the faithful==
Written not long after the devastation of World War II, the encyclical conveys the hope that meditation on Mary’s assumption will lead the faithful to a greater awareness of our common dignity as the human family.&lt;ref name=Howell&gt;[http://www.chnetwork.org/2011/09/why-did-pius-xii-proclaim-the-dogma-of-marys-assumption/ Howell, Kenneth. "Why Did Pius XII Proclaim the Dogma of Mary’s Assumption?", CH Network, September 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the dogmatic statement, the phrase "having completed the course of her earthly life" was carefully written to leave open the question of whether or not Mary died before her Assumption, or whether, like the Assumption of the Prophet [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]], Mary was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed in the formulation. In articles 14, 17 and 20 of the dogmatic pronouncement, however, it is stated that Mary had indeed died: "...the dead body of the Blessed Virgin Mary remained incorrupt, but ... she gained a triumph out of death, her heavenly glorification after the example of her only begotten Son, Jesus Christ...".

The entire decree (and the title itself) is also worded to suggest that Mary's Assumption was not in any sense a logical necessity, but rather a divine gift to Mary as [[Mother of God (Roman Catholic)|Mother of God]]. ''Munificentissimus Deus'' teaches that Mary lived and completed her life as a shining example to the human race. The gift of her assumption is offered to all the faithful and signifies what to hope for at the end of time. Her assumption signifies God's intention to all those faithful to Him. 

:"Thus, while the illusory teachings of materialism and the corruption of morals that follows from these teachings threaten to extinguish the light of virtue and to ruin the lives of men by exciting discord among them, in this magnificent way all may see clearly to what a lofty goal our bodies and souls are destined. Finally it is our hope that belief in Mary's bodily Assumption into heaven will make our belief in our own resurrection stronger and render it more effective."

==Non-Catholic opinion==

[[Paul Tillich]] asked fellow Protestant theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in March 1950, about eight months before the decree was promulgated, if he expected the Pope to make the declaration about Mary's assumption ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Niebuhr replied: "I don't think so; he is too clever for that; it would be a slap in the face of the whole modern world and it would be dangerous for the Roman Church to do that today".&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tillich|Tillich, Paul]].

Braaten), {{ISBN|0-671-21426-8}}. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistic typology topics}}

A '''nominative–absolutive language''', also called a '''marked nominative language''', is a language with an unusual [[morphosyntactic alignment]] similar to, and often considered a subtype of, a [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] alignment. In a prototypical nominative–accusative language with a [[grammatical case]] system, like [[Latin]], the object of a verb is marked for [[accusative case]], and the subject of the verb may or may not be marked for [[nominative case]]. The nominative, whether or not marked morphologically, is also used as the citation form of the noun. 

In a marked nominative system, on the other hand, it is the nominative case alone that is marked morphologically, and it is the unmarked accusative case that is used as the citation form of the noun. Because that resembles an [[absolutive case]], it is often called a nominative–absolutive system.

Marked nominative languages are relatively rare. They are well-documented in only two regions of the world: in northeastern Africa, where they occur in several branches of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] families of Afro-Asiatic, as well as in the [[Surmic languages|Surmic]] and [[Nilotic languages]] of the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] family; and in the southwestern United States and adjacent parts of Mexico, where they are characteristic of the [[Yuman languages|Yuman]] family. Other languages interpreted by some authors as having a marked nominative system include other Afro-Asiatic languages (such as some [[Berber languages|Berber]] varieties), [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Wappo language|Wappo]].

[[Germanic languages]], such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] also used/use a marked nominative. The table below shows an abbreviated declension of Gothic ''dags'',  Old Norse ''dagr'', Icelandic ''dagur'' and Faroese ''dagur'', 'day' (note that Indo-European linguistic tradition uses the nominative as the citation form, whether marked or not) both of which show a marked nominative and an unmarked accusative:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Gothic !! Old Norse !! Icelandic !! Faroese
|-
| Nominative || dag-'''s'''|| dag-'''r''' || dag-'''ur''' || dag-'''ur'''
|-
| Accusative|| dag || dag|| dag|| dag
|}

The above nominative markers descend from Proto-Indo-European */-s/ and are therefore cognate with other nominative forms, such as Latin -''us'' and Lithuanian -''as''. The accusative marker, however (*/-m/ in Proto-Indo-European), was lost entirely, producing a marked nominative. Most modern Germanic languages have merged the nominative and accusative cases, but [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have preserve the nominative form ''-ur'' in masculine nouns.

In Yuman and many of the Cushitic languages, however, the nominative is not always marked, for reasons which are not known; there may, therefore, not be a strict case system but rather reflect discourse patterns or other non-[[semantics|semantic]] parameters. However, the Yuman language [[Havasupai language|Havasupai]] is reported to have a purely syntactic case system, with a suffix ''-č'' marking all subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs but not of the copula; in the Nilotic language [[Datooga language|Datooga]], the system is also reported to be purely syntactic.

As in many Nilotic languages, Datooga case is marked by tone. The absolutive case has the unpredictable tone of the citation form of the noun, but the nominative is marked by a characteristic tone that obliterates this lexical tone. The tone is high for words of three syllables or less; for words with four or more syllables, the ends of the word have high tone, with a low tone in the middle of the word.

The nominative is used for subjects following the verb; the absolutive with the copula, with subjects in focus position before the verb and in all other situations.

The "rastacap" or "tam" is a tall (sometimes depending on the user's hair length), round, crocheted cap. It is most commonly associated with the pat{{clarify|date=May 2010|reason=That phrase and term mean nothing to 99.99% of our readers; explain or link to something that explains what "the pat" is supposed to mean in this context.}} as a way for [[Rastafarians]] (Rastas) and others with [[dreadlocks]] to tuck their locks away, but may be worn for various reasons (such as religious) by Rastas and non-Rastas. The cap is worn mostly by men.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is sometimes erroneously{{weasel inline|date=March 2017}} referred to as a "[[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam]]" (or "tam"), {{clarify|text=a different kind of hat|date=March 2017}} that was loosely ancestral to the rastacap.{{Citation needed|reason=Dread keepers are referenced as tams in reliable sorces; who is deciding what is erroneous? Linguistic derivation happens. "Shirt" comes from a word meaning skirt. Get over it.|date=March 2017}} Other [[Caribbean]] terms for the rastacap include rastafar (sometimes with a silent terminal ''-r''), toppa[h] and simply cap or hat.

In construction, the rastacap is similar to the [[tuque]], but much larger. Most commonly crocheted, the hat can also be [[knit]], [[woven]], [[sewn]], or constructed in a number of other ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Examples with sun-cured palm leaves woven into the hat exist; this yields a semi-rigid design which a skilled islander can form rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Rastacaps range in size and shape, as well as uses. People with dreadlocks and non-dreaded people alike wear rastacaps for fashion, convenience, socio-political statement, and a number of other reasons. Some Rastas also wear rastacaps and other forms of headdress as a religious headcovering. It may also be worn by health and food service and heavy machinery workers with long hair, for workplace safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{OSHA}}{{clarify|date=May 2010|reason=This is not a real reference citation; you cannot cite all of the huge OSHA regulations, but must provide a SPECIFIC reference within it that actually says that rastacaps are covered by OSHA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2010|reason=This is highly suspect, and improperly cited.}}&lt;ref&gt;Turda and Longley{{Clarify|date=May 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation; use [[Cite book]] or a related template for some other medium (web, journal, news, etc.) to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2010|reason=No such source can be found via Google.}}

People of Jamaica and Barbados, as well as some outlying islands, have separately claimed to have originated the cap style, claiming ancestral heritage or even personal invention, albeit without credible, documented proof, relying on unsubstantiated drawings or mythical reference.

Several politico-constitutional arrangements use '''reserved political positions''', especially when endeavoring to ensure the rights of minorities or preserving a political [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. These arrangements can distort the [[democracy|democratic]] principle of ''[[One man, one vote|one person - one vote]]'' in order to address special circumstances. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Moreover, "one third of the members (''of the [[House of Elders]]'') shall be appointed by the President, for a five-year term, from amongst experts and experienced personalities, including two members from amongst the impaired and handicapped, as well as two from nomads. The President shall appoint fifty percent of these individuals from amongst women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalassembly.af/index.php?id=149 Chapter Five - The National Assembly], [[Constitution of Afghanistan]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]] has seats in the Parliament of the country, State Assemblies, Local Municipal Bodies and Village level institutions reserved for untouchable castes, also called Dalits or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The election of Untouchables and Tribes candidates is by a Joint or mixed electorate, which includes all castes. Out of 543 constituencies in India's parliament, a total of 131 seats (18.42%) are Reserved or blocked for Representatives from [[Scheduled Castes]] (84) and  [[Scheduled Tribes]] (47) only. This is different from separate electorate practiced in other countries. Many Indian states, like [[Kerala]] and [[Bihar]], have parliamentary reserved seats for the [[Anglo-Indian]] community, as does the [[Lok Sabha]].

====Iran====
{{Main|Iranian Parliament religious minority reserved seats}}
[[Iran]] reserves a fixed number of seats in the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly (Iran)|Majlis]] for certain recognized non-[[Muslim]] ethnoreligious groups. To wit, two seats are reserved for the Christian [[Armenian Iranians|Armenian]] community, and one seat each is reserved for the [[Assyrians in Iran|Assyrian and Chaldean Catholic]], [[Persian Jews|Jewish]], and [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian]] communities.

====Jordan====
[[Jordan]] has reserved seats for women, [[Christianity in Jordan|Christians]], [[Circassians]], [[Chechens]], and Bedouins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entikhabat.jo/en|title=Independent Election Commission|website=www.entikhabat.jo|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon====
{{Main|Parliament of Lebanon#Allocation of seats}}
[[Lebanon]] specifies the religious affiliation of several of its high officers, such as the President ([[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]]), the Prime Minister ([[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] Muslim) and the Parliament's Speaker ([[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] Muslim). Every electoral district for the parliamentary elections includes a fixed number of the various religious communities.

====New Zealand====
{{Main|Māori electorates}}
There are currently seven [[New Zealand Parliament]] constituencies – known as the [[Māori electorates]] – that are reserved for representatives of the [[Māori people]]. Māori electorates were introduced in 1867, but have undergone several changes since then. Māori may enrol either in a Māori electorate or on the general roll, but not both. Since 1967 there has not been any specific requirement for candidates in Māori electorates to be Māori themselves, and anyone on either the Māori roll or the General roll can stand as a candidate. Technically, therefore, these seats should not be described as "reserved" as there is no legal or constitutional guarantee that the successful candidate will themselves be of Māori descent. So far, however, every MP from a Māori electorate has been Māori. Also to note, is that under New Zealand's [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system, it is the party vote that is most important. All voters, including Māori, are deemed to be on the same master roll in terms of voting for [[Closed list|party lists]].

====Pakistan====
{{Main|Reserved political positions in Pakistan}}
[[Pakistan]] reserves a fixed number of parliamentary seats for non-[[Muslim]]s and women.

====Slovenia====
The [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]] of [[Slovenia]], has 88 members elected by [[party-list proportional representation]]. Another two seats are elected by the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities using the [[Borda count]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/en/Home/PoliticniSistem/VolitveInVolilniSistem/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zivT39gy2dDB0N_C0N3Qw8Q43dTYx9QwzcAw31wwkpiAJKG-AAjgb6BbmhigBVJ0ba/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh "Slovenian Parliament website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
In the [[Legislative Yuan]] of [[Taiwan]], since 2008 in the total 34 seats of [[party-list proportional representation]], the party nominated candidates must at least half are reserved for women. For example, if one party elected 3 candidates of the party-list in the Legislative Yuan, 2 of them must be women.

====Rwanda====
In the [[Parliament of Rwanda|Parliament]] of Rwanda, a minimum of 30% of elected members of the 26-member [[Senate (Rwanda)|Senate]] must be women. In the 80-member [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)|Chamber of Deputies]], twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members.

Partly resulting from this arrangement, 45 female deputies were elected to the Parliament in 2008, making the country the first and only independent country to possess a female majority in its national legislature.

====Tanzania====
15 seats out of 255 in the Parliament are reserved for women.

====Uganda====
The Ugandan constitution provides for a reserved woman's parliamentary seat from each of the 39 districts.

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|All-women shortlists}}

Political parties are permitted to restrict the selection of their candidates in constituencies to a specific gender under the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]]; to date, only the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] utilises the law.

The UK also reserves 26 seats in the [[House of Lords]] for [[Church of England]] [[bishop]]s, who together are known as the [[Lords Spiritual]].

===Former===

====German Democratic Republic====
[[East Germany]] reserved seats in the [[Volkskammer]] for representatives of women, [[Free German Trade Union Federation|trade unions]] and youth organisations.

====Greece====
During the 1920s and 1930s there was a system of separate electoral [[curia]]e for [[Greek Muslims|Muslim]] and [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish]] electors in [[Greece]], with reserved seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersant|first=Jeanne|author2=Yatropoulos, Nepheli |year=2008|title= Mobilisation identitaire et représentation politique des ‘Turcs’ en Thrace occidentale : les élections législatives grecques de mars 2004|journal=European journal of Turkish studies|publisher=http://www.revues.org/|location=Paris|url=http://ejts.revues.org/index1342.html|accessdate=July 31, 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palestine (British mandate)====
During the [[Mandatory Palestine]], at the third election ([[Assembly of Representatives election, 1931|1931]]) of its [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandatory Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]], there were three curiae, for the [[Ashkenazi Jews]], the [[Sephardi Jews]] and for the [[Yemeni Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Fannie Fern Andrews, The Holy Land under mandate, Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Company - The Riverside Press Cambridge, 1931, 2 vol.

====Palestinian Authority====
While the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] makes no reservations within the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] (there were reserved seats for Christians and Samaritans in the electoral law for the [[Palestinian general election, 1996]]), certain positions in local government are guaranteed to certain minority groups, in order to retain particular traditional cultural influence and diversity. For example, the mayor of [[Bethlehem]] is required to be a [[Palestinian Christians|Christian]], even though the city itself currently has a Muslim majority.

====Syria====
[[Syria]] enjoyed an electoral system like Lebanon's, at least for the parliamentary elections, up to 1949, when the subdivisions among each religion were suppressed, then there were only reserved seats for [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]] up to 1963, when the [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'athist]] regime suppressed free elections.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H.

====Zimbabwe====
{{Main|Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 1985|Zimbabwean general election, 1990}}
Historically, [[Zimbabwe]] reserved 20 of the 100 seats in [[Parliament of Zimbabwe|Parliament]] for the [[White people in Zimbabwe|white minority]], until these seats were abolished by constitutional amendment in 1987. Currently, 60 of the 270 seats in the [[House of Assembly (Zimbabwe)|House of Assembly]] are reserved for women.

'''Scanian''' ({{lang-sv|skånska}} {{IPA-sv|²skɔnːska||sv-skånska.ogg}}) is a closely related group of [[South Swedish dialects]] spoken in the province of [[Scania]] in southern [[Sweden]]. Scanian formed part of the old [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] [[dialect continuum]] and are by most historical linguists considered to be an East [[Danish (language)|Danish]] dialect group,&lt;ref&gt;Perridon, Harry (2003). "Dialects and written language in Old Nordic II: Old Danish and Old Swedish". p. 1018. Old Nordic III: The ecology of language, in ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages''. Volume 1. Eds. Oskar Bandle, Kurt Braunmuller, Ernst Hakon Jahr, Allan Karker, Hans-Peter Naumann and Ulf Teleman. Walter De Gruyter: 2003. {{ISBN|3-11-014876-5}}. See also: Ingers, Ingemar (1939). ''Studier över det sydvästskånska dialektområdet''. Lund: Gleerupska Univ. bokhandeln. (In Swedish) and [http://runeberg.org/nfce/0695.html Nordisk Familjebok] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626003044/http://runeberg.org/nfce/0695.html |date=2006-06-26 }}: "Scanian is one of the three main dialects into which the Danish branch of Old Norse was split". (In Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the modern-era influence from Standard Swedish in the region and because traditional dialectology in the Scandinavian countries normally has not considered [[isogloss]]es that cut across state borders,&lt;ref&gt;Ringgaard, Kristian (2003). "General history of Nordic dialectology". In ''Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages'', p. 280: "[Dialectologists] don't cross the national borders. The Danes say Scanian is an East Danish dialect, and then leave it to the Swedes. The Swedes say the inhabitants of Bornholm speak a South Swedish dialect, and then leave it to the Danes. In Jämtland, [...] they may speak [[Norwegian dialects]], but no [[dialectologist]] has crossed the border since J. Reitan in 1930. Luckily this situation is changing."&lt;/ref&gt; the Scanian dialects have normally been treated as a South [[Swedish language|Swedish]] dialect group in Swedish dialect research. However, many of the early Scandinavian linguists, including [[Adolf Noreen]]&lt;ref&gt;Noreen, Adolf (1887). ''De nordiska språken''. Noreen was a Professor of Nordic Languages at Uppsala university 1887–1919, an internationally recognized linguist, known through his publications in German about Nordic languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and G. Sjöstedt,&lt;ref&gt;Sjöstedt, G. (1936). "Studier över r-ljuden i sydskandinaviska mål". Dissertation, Lund University. The title translates to: 'Studies of r-sounds in South-Scandinavian Dialects.' (Published in Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt; classified it as "South Scandinavian", and some linguists, such as [[Elias Wessén]], also considered Old Scanian a separate language, classified apart from both Old Danish and Old Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;Holmbäck, Åke and Elias Wessén (1933). ''Svenska landskapslagar, 4th ed.: Skåne och Gutalagen''. Awe Gebers: Uppsala, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==
There has been active campaigning from local Scanian interest groups to promote Scanian as a separate language on par with the official [[Minority languages in Sweden|minority languages]], though this has been rejected by Swedish authorities. Swedish linguists generally view Scanian as just one of many local or regional Swedish (or Scandinavian) dialects, some of which differ considerably from [[Standard Swedish]] but don't meet the criteria of a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, Bernard (2004). ''Language Policy''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-01175-2}}; p. 123. For a recent study on the attitudes and the controversy surrounding Scanian, see Göran Hallberg's 2003 paper "Kampen om skånskan", ''Språkvård'' (3/2003).[http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.42699e142b734b55168a/1398151024425/Spr%C3%A5kv%C3%A5rd+2003-3.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513072556/http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.42699e142b734b55168a/1398151024425/Spr%C3%A5kv%C3%A5rd+2003-3.pdf |date=2016-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanian was originally classified as a separate [[language]] in [[ISO 639-3]], but was declassified as a language in 2009.  A request for reinstatement was submitted during the 2009 annual review process, but rejected on the grounds of mutual intelligibility; it is listed in [http://www.geolang.com/iso639-6/ ISO 639-6] with code scyr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/PastComments/CR_Comments_2009-049.pdf Registration Authority decision on Change Request no. 2009-049: to create a new code element &amp;#x5b;scy&amp;#x5d; "Scanian"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925013241/http://sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/PastComments/CR_Comments_2009-049.pdf |date=2011-09-25 }}. "The appropriate part within the ISO 639 body of standards to have an identifier for the language variety Scanian is within the recently adopted ISO 639-6 standard."&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the previous SIL International classification of Scanian were the dialects in the province of [[Scania]], some of the southern dialects of [[Halland]] (''halländska'' in Swedish), the dialects of [[Blekinge]] (''blekingemål'' in Swedish) and the dialects of the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] (''bornholmsk'' in Danish).

With the establishment of the Scanian Academy and with recent heritage conservation programs, funded by Region Skåne and the Swedish Government, there is a renewed interest in the region for Scanian as a cultural language and as a regional identity, especially among younger generations of Scanians. Many of the genuine rural dialects have been in decline subsequent to the [[industrial revolution]] and [[urbanization]] in Sweden.

The population of [[Scania]] consists of around 13.5% of the total population in [[Sweden]].

== History ==
Swedish and Danish are considered to have been the same dialect, [[Old Norse#Old East Norse|Old East Norse]], up until the 12th century. However, some scholars speculate that there might have been certain dialect differences within the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] area as early as the [[Proto-Norse|Proto-Nordic]] period.&lt;ref name="Ottosson"&gt;Ottosson, Kjartan (2003). "Old Nordic:  A definition and delimitation of the period". In ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages''. Volume 1. Eds. Oskar Bandle et al., p. 798.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Swedish is not mentioned specifically in any source until the first half of the 14th century,&lt;ref name="Ottosson" /&gt; and no standard spoken language had developed in either Sweden or Denmark before 1500, although some scholars argue that there may have been tendencies towards a more formal "courteous" language among the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bandle, Oscar. "Diachrony and synchrony in Nordic language history". In ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages''. Volume 1. Eds. Oskar Bandle et al., p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scania Churchlaw.jpg|right|thumb|200px| [[Anders Sunesøn]]'s 13th century version of the [[Scanian Law]] and Church Law, containing a comment in the margin called the "Skaaningestrof": "''Hauí that skanunga ærliki mææn toco vithar oræt aldrigh æn''." (Let it be known that Scanians are honorable men who have never tolerated injustice.)]]

Scanian appeared in writing before 1200,&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Herluf (2003). "The development of Latin Script IV: In Denmark". ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages''. Volume 1. Eds. Oskar Bandle et al., p. 851: The Scanian Law was written before 1200.&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when Swedish and Danish had yet to be codified, and the long struggle between Sweden and Denmark over the right to claim the Old Scanian manuscripts as an early form of either of the two national state languages has led to some odd twists and turns. Two Scanian fragments dated to around 1325 were initially claimed to be (younger) Old Swedish, but further research in modern times has claimed that the language was not Swedish, but Scanian. During the 20th century the fragments were thus relabeled early Old Danish by Scandinavian linguists, and as explained by Danish linguist Britta Olrik Frederiksen, the fragments are now thought to "represent as such a newly claimed territory for the history of the Danish language".&lt;ref name="Frederiksen"&gt;Frederiksen, Britta Olrik (2003). "The history of Old Nordic manuscripts IV: Old Danish". The history of Old Nordic Manuscripts VI: Old Danish, In ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages. Volume 1'', Eds. Oskar Bandle et al., p. 823.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Scanian Law, one of the fragments, a six-leaf fragment (catalogued as SKB A 120), is written in the runic alphabet. The place of writing, according to Frederiksen, has been tentatively identified as the [[Cistercian]] monastery at [[Herrevad Abbey]] in Scania. The fragment contains a translation of Mary's lament at the cross. The other fragment (catalogued as SKB *A 115) is a bifolium with just over a hundred metrical lines of [[knittelvers]], a translation from Latin of the apocryphal gospel [[Evangelium Nicodemi]] about Christ's descent into hell and resurrection.&lt;ref name="Frederiksen" /&gt;

In modern Scandinavian linguistic research, the assertion that Old Scanian was a Swedish dialect before the Swedish acquisition of most of old Skåneland is now seldom argued by linguistic scholars, although the comparative and historical research efforts continue.&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Bandle, Kurt Braunmüller, Ernst Hakon Jahr, Allan Karker, Hans-Peter Naumann, and Ulf Teleman, eds.

One of the artifacts sometimes referred to as support for the view of Scanian as separate from both the Swedish and Danish language is a letter from the 16th century, where the Danish Bible translators were advised not to employ Scanian translators since their language was not "proper Danish".&lt;ref&gt;Johs Brøndum-Nielsen (1914). "Sproglig Forfatterbestemmelse" (a Professor of Nordic Philology, Copenhagen).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language politics ===
After the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, the former [[Denmark|Danish]] provinces of [[Blekinge]], [[Halland]] and [[Scania]] became a [[Swedish dominion]], but they were allowed to keep their old privileges, laws and customs. However, from the 1680s, a process of [[Swedification]] was introduced, including a switch of languages used in churches and restrictions imposed on cross border travel and trade. The situation in Scania was unique from a linguistic point of view; modern sociolinguistic studies often approach it as a way to study the roots of linguistic nationalism. As pointed out by the Norwegian scholar Lars S. Vikør, professor, Nordic and Linguistics Studies, [[University of Oslo]], in the 2001 book ''Language and Nationalism'', the "animosity between the two countries [Sweden and Denmark], and the relative closeness of their standard languages (dialectal differences within each of the two countries were greater than [between] the two standards), made it imperative to stress the difference between them in the standardization process". According to Vikør, the "Swedish treatment of the Scanians perhaps shows [that] the most important element of the [linguistic nationalism] ideology is the desire to stress the difference from another linguistic entity that in some way may be considered threatening or challenging one's own autonomy."&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Stephen and Cathie Carmichael ed. (2001). ''Language and Nationalism in Europe''. Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-823671-9}}, p. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scania, the Swedish government officially limited the use of Scanian in 1683 by nullifying the self-rule granted in the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] and the Malmö Recess of 1662, where Scania had been granted the right to a certain degree of autonomy including preservation of its old laws&lt;ref&gt;Ditlev Tamm, Helle Vogt, 2016, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qpleCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 The Danish Medieval Laws: The Laws of Scania, Zealand and Jutland], p. 49-50. {{ISBN|9781317294825}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and customs.&lt;ref&gt;David Kirby, 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U4yrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 Northern Europe in the Early Modern Period: The Baltic World 1492–1772], p. 282-[https://books.google.com/books?id=U4yrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA283 283]. {{ISBN|9781317902157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Scania became fully integrated into the Swedish Kingdom in 1719, and the assimilation has accelerated during the 20th century, with the dominance of [[Standard Swedish]]-language radio and television, urbanization, and movement of people to and from the other regions of Sweden.

[[Bornholm]] was once part of Skåneland, but rebelled and returned to Denmark in 1659. The Scanian dialect of Bornholm remained in use as a functioning transitional stage, but Standard [[Danish (language)|Danish]] soon became dominant in official contexts and the dialect is thought to be disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/dlh/dialekt/24.html Statsbiblioteket, Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629003415/http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/dlh/dialekt/24.html |date=2006-06-29 }}, L. Wimmer &amp; V. Thomsen et al. (1991). ''Danske talesprog, Dialekter, Regionalsprog, Sociolekter.'' For the development of Modern Danish, see also: Hans Basbøll's "Prosody, productivity and word structure: the stød pattern of Modern Danish" and John D. Sundquist's "The Rich Agreement Hypothesis and Early Modern Danish embedded-clause word order" in ''Nordic Journal of Linguistics'' (26, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic shifts ===
The gradual transition to Swedish has resulted in the introduction of many new Swedish characteristics into Scanian since the 18th century, especially when it comes to vocabulary and grammar. In spite of the shift, Scanian dialects have maintained a non-Swedish prosody, as well as details of grammar and vocabulary that in some aspects differ from [[Standard Swedish]]. The prosody, pronunciation of vowels and consonants in such qualities as length, stress and intonation, has more in common with Danish, German and Dutch (and occasionally English) than with Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;Gårding, Eva et al. (1973). "Talar skåningarna svenska", (Do Scanians speak Swedish), p 107, 112. In ''Svenskans beskrivning.'' Ed. Christer Platzack. Lund: Institutionen för nordiska språk. p. 107, 112). (In Swedish). See also Yip, Moira J. (1980). "Why Scanian is not a case for multi-valued features". ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 11.2: 432–6: "[T]his temporal pattern is not typical of Southern (Scanian) Swedish. Gårding et al. (1974) have shown that Scanian Swedish does not have long consonants following short stressed vowels. There, the duration of the singleton following a short stressed vowel is only 13% longer than when following a long stressed vowel. Thus, Scanian Swedish behaves like the other Germanic languages that have vowel quantity, e.g. German, Dutch and Danish."&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of contrast between Scanian dialects and standard Swedish is sometimes in the popular press compared to the differences between [[British English]] and [[Australian English]]. However, as pointed out by the researchers involved in the project ''Comparative Semantics for Nordic Languages'',&lt;ref&gt;For current research in comparative semantics, see the special issue of ''Nordic Journal of Linguistics'' (2004), 27, devoted to the research project Comparative Semantics for Nordic Languages (NORDSEM), which was funded by the Joint Committee of the Nordic Research Councils for the Humanities in 1998–2001 and involved researchers at the Copenhagen Business School, Göteborg University and the University of Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to quantify and analyze the fine degrees of semantic differences that exist between the Scandinavian languages in general, even between the national languages Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: "[S]ome of the Nordic languages [..]are historically, lexically and structurally very similar.[...]Are there systematic semantic differences between these languages? If so, are the formal semantic analytic tools that have been developed mainly for English and German sufficiently fine-grained to account for the differences among the Scandinavian languages?"&lt;ref&gt;Elisabet Engdahl and Robin Cooper (2004). "Introduction." ''Nordic Journal of Linguistics'' (2004), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic Scanian [[diphthong]]s, which do not occur in Danish or Swedish, are in popular belief often seen as signs of Scanian natives' efforts to adapt from a Danish to a "proper" Swedish pronunciation. However, linguists reject this explanation for the sound change; at present, there are no universally-accepted theories for ''why'' the sound changes occur.

Research that provides a cross-border overview of the spectrum of modern dialects in the Nordic region has recently been initiated through the Scandinavian Dialect Syntax Project, based at the University of Tromsø in Norway, where nine Scandinavian research groups collaborate to systematically map and study the syntactic variation across the Scandinavian dialect continuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uit.no/scandiasyn?Language=en Scandinavian Dialect Syntax] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426051030/http://uit.no/scandiasyn?Language=en |date=2006-04-26 }}. Official site. Retrieved 27 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic preservation ===
Scanian once possessed many unique words which do not exist in either Swedish or Danish. In attempts to preserve the unique aspects of Scanian, these words have been recorded and documented by the Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi.se/ Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527075556/http://www.sofi.se/ |date=2007-05-27 }}. Official site. Retrieved 27 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation is also accomplished through comparative studies such as the Scanian-Swedish-Danish dictionary project, commissioned by the Scanian Academy. This project is led by Helmer Lång and involves a group of scholars from different fields, including Birger Bergh, linguistics, Inger Elkjær and Inge Lise Pedersen, researcher of Danish dialects. Several Scanian dictionaries have been published through the years, including one by Sten Bertil Vide, who wrote his doctoral thesis on the names of plants in [[South Swedish dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;Vide, S.-B. (1966). ''Sydsvenska växtnamn''. Published by Department of Dialectology and Onomastics in Lund.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication and a variety of other Scanian dictionaries are available through the Department of Dialectology and Onomastics in Lund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dal.lu.se/dal/utgivn.htm Department of Dialectology and Onomastics, Lund] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626232323/http://www.dal.lu.se/dal/utgivn.htm |date=2006-06-26 }}. Official site. Retrieved 27 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Scanian realizes the phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} as a [[uvular trill]], {{IPA|[ʀ]}} in clear articulation, but in everyday speech more commonly as a [[voiceless uvular fricative|voiceless]], {{IPA|[χ]}} or [[voiced uvular fricative]], {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, depending on phonetic context. This is in contrast to the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] articulations and [[retroflex]] assimilations in most Swedish dialects north of [[Småland]]. The realizations of the highly variable and uniquely Swedish fricative {{IPA|/ɧ/}} also tend to be more velar and less [[labialization|labialized]] than in other dialects. Though the [[phoneme]]s of Scanian correspond to those of [[Standard Swedish]] and most other Swedish dialects, long vowels have developed into diphthongs which are unique to the region. In the southern parts of Skåne many diphthongs also have a [[pharyngealization|pharyngeal]] quality, similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] vowels.

== Vocabulary ==
Scanian used to have many words which differed from standard Swedish. In 1995 [[Skånska Akademien]] released ''Skånsk-svensk-dansk ordbok'', a dictionary with 2,711 Scanian words and expressions. It should be mentioned however that not all of these words are in wide use today. While the general vocabulary in modern Scanian does not differ considerably from Standard Swedish, a few specifically Scanian words still exist which are known in all of Scania, occurring frequently among a majority of the speakers. These are some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Lång and Vide (1995). ''Skånsk-svensk-dansk ordbok''.

'''Tellme Networks, Inc.''' was an American company founded in 1999 by [[Mike McCue]] and Angus Davis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2006/tc20060313_913136.htm | title = Tellme's Naughty Schoolboy | newspaper = Business Week | date = March 13, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which specialized in telephone-based applications. Its headquarters were in [[Mountain View, California]].

Tellme Networks was acquired by [[Microsoft]] on March 14, 2007, for approximately $800 million; the deal closed in late April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117389108729336936?mod=us_business_whats_news |title=Microsoft Purchase of Tellme Adds Voice To Web Initiative | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|date=March 15, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Tellme's phone network processed more than 2 billion unique calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/technology/09tellme.html?ei=5088&amp;en=38baf9e68e1b36f6&amp;ex=1318046400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Tellme and Cingular Plan Broader Directory Service | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 9, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tellme established an information number which provided time-of-day announcements, weather forecasts, brief news and sports summaries, business searches, stock market quotations, driving directions, and similar amenities. Operating by voice prompts and [[speech-recognition]] software, it was set up in 2000 as a [[loss-leader]] service to demonstrate the Tellme functionality to U.S. consumers.  The voice of the Tellme service is [[Darby Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=20060326&amp;id=hhFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sh8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4862,2922197&amp;hl=en|title=Directory Persistence helps find Darby|last=Weingerten|first=Gene|work=[[Star-News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, Microsoft divested itself of Tellme Networks' [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) service and the majority of its employees to [[24_7_inc|[24]7 Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = ZD net | format = [[World Wide Web]] log | url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-offloads-some-speech-focused-assets-employees-to-247/11834 | title = Microsoft offloads some speech-focused assets, employees to 24/7 | date = February 7, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The service was moved to a non-toll-free number.

== History ==
In April 1999, the Tellme founding team, consisting of [[Mike McCue]], Angus Davis, Rod Brathwaite, Jim Fanning, Kyle Sims, Brad Porter, Michael Plitkins, [[Hadi Partovi]], John Giannandrea, Andrew Volkmann, Anthony Accardi, Patrick McCormick, Danny Howard, Vicki Penrose, and [[Emil Michael]] assembled in [[Mountain View, California]].

In 2000, Tellme announced a service that delivered content to [[telephones]]&amp;mdash;a concept called [[voice portals]]. Early competitors included TelSurf Networks, BeVocal, Hey Anita, and [[Quack.com]]. Quack.com was founded in 1999 and acquired in September 2000 by [[America Online]] for its competing service, AOLbyPhone.  At least ten additional competitors appeared in 2000 in various attempts to mimic the funding success of Tellme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/business/yourmoney/26vall.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1067205762-K/mZabHOHq9Joai8E9gynQ&amp;pagewanted=all | title = As Silicon Valley Reboots, the Geeks Take Charge | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 26, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tellme was featured in the 2001 [[documentary]] ''Wild at Start''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/07/25/wild_start/ | title = Dept. of "Oops" – After four years, heeere's "Wild at Start," a documentary celebrating visionary new-economy entrepreneurs! | newspaper = Salon | date = July 25, 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was referenced in a 2000 [[Malcolm Gladwell]]  article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' about recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_05_29_a_interview.htm | title = The New-Boy Network | author-link = Malcolm Gladwell | first = Malcolm | last = Gladwell | newspaper = [[The New Yorker]] | date = May 29, 2000 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120728154839/http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_05_29_a_interview.htm | archivedate = July 28, 2012 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the company debuted a feature especially for [[Christmas Eve]]; callers can hear recorded messages from [[Santa Claus]]. If called on Christmas Eve, Santa will say what state he is traveling over, and what exactly he is doing. In 2009 they added a service that allows you to receive messages a week early from Santa explaining what he is doing to prepare for Christmas.

At the onset of service, as a way to gain more users, they offered a free long distance call feature. Callers would call Tellme and were given 1 free minute of long distance call time to their desired phone number.  That service was later stopped while other services persisted.

==Services==
Voice portal customers build Internet-powered, voice-enabled applications on the Tellme Network using Tellme Studio. Tellme Studio is a web-based [[VoiceXML]] development tool. The Tellme platform is based on [[open standards]] like [[VoiceXML]], [[CCXML]], and [[VoIP]].

The '''Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument''' (TKI) is a [[conflict style inventory]], which is a tool developed to measure an individual's response to [[conflict (process)|conflict]] situations.

==Development==

A number of [[Conflict Style Inventory|conflict style inventories]] have been in active use since the 1960s.  Most of them are based on the managerial grid developed by [[Robert R. Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in their [[Managerial Grid Model]]. The Blake and Mouton model uses two axes: "concern for people" is plotted using the vertical axis and "concern for task" along the horizontal axis. Each axis has a numerical scale of 1 to 9. These axes interact so as to diagram five different styles of management. This grid posits the interaction of task with relationship and shows that according to how people value these, there are five basic ways of interacting with others.

In 1974, Kenneth W.Thomas and Ralph H. Kilmann introduced their Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (Tuxedo NY: Xicom, 1974). In 1999, CPP, Inc. (Mountain View, CA) acquired Xicom and is now the sole publisher and international distributor of the TKI. The TKI popularized conflict style inventories and, according to the publisher's website, there have been over six million copies published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpp.com/products/tki/index.aspx|title=CPP TKI page|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode instrument consists of thirty pairs of statements. For each pair, the respondent must choose either the A or B item (for example, one item depicts collaborating while the other item describes avoiding). Each pair of statements was specifically designed, through a multi-stage research process, to be equal in social desirability.

The TKI uses two axes (influenced by the Mouton and Blake axes) called "assertiveness" and "cooperativeness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Managerial Grid: The Key to Leadership Excellence|last=Blake|first=R|publisher=Gulf Publishing Co.|year=1964|isbn=0884152529|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TKI identifies five different styles of conflict: Competing (assertive, uncooperative), Avoiding (unassertive, uncooperative), Accommodating (unassertive, cooperative), Collaborating (assertive, cooperative), and Compromising (intermediate assertiveness and cooperativeness). There are some seemingly obvious, but difficult to support, similarities between anger resolution-management style ideas with other tools and theories, such as  [[DISC assessment]], [[Social style]]s, and even the theory of [[five temperaments]], which is based in the theories of ancient Greece.

A '''trade card''' is a square card that is small, but bigger than the modern [[visiting card]], and is exchanged in social circles, that a business distributes to clients and potential customers. Trade cards first became popular at the end of the 17th century in [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[London]]. They functioned as [[advertising]] and also as [[map]]s, directing the public to the merchants' stores (no formal street address numbering system existed at the time).

==Definition==
The term, trade card, refers to a varied group of items made of paper or of card of varying sizes and shapes. Trade cards evolved in different ways in Britain, America and Europe, giving rise to wide variation in their format and design. The characteristic features of a trade card are that it is a small printed item, used by merchants and traders to give to their customers for their use as an aid to memory. Trade cards were sufficiently small so that they could be carried in the gentleman's pocket or lady's purse.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In its original sense, the "trade" in ''trade card'' refers to its use by the proprietor of a business to announce his trade, or line of business. Trade cards were widely used by retailers and tradesmen from around the late 17th-century in Paris, Lyon and London. In the period before mass media, they functioned as advertising and also as [[map]]s, directing the public to the merchants' stores (no formal street address numbering system existed at the time). The trade card is an early example of the modern [[business card]]. The use of trade cards in America became widespread from the mid-19th-century in the period following the Civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, M., "A New and Wonderful Invention: The Nineteenth-Century American Trade Card," Harvard Business School, [Working Knowledge Collection], 9 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. Later they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth century traders wanted cards with impact and sophistication. Accordingly, they often hired notable designers and engravers to design their cards.In 1738, for instance, when leading Parisian art dealer [[Edme-François Gersaint]] changed the name of his business to ''A la Pagode'', he hired the engraver, [[François Boucher]] to design his card.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Card of Edme Gersaint, Jeweller, A La Pagode," Waddesson Rothschild Collection, AYLESBURY, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, https://waddesdon.org.uk/the-collection/item/?id=13776&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, the French painter, [[Gabriel de Saint-Aubin]], designed a trade card for ''quincailler'' (ironmonger), Perier, whose premises were situated at the sign of the Moor's Head on the Quai de la Megisserie in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books,'' 2013, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists who accepted commissions for trade cards included: [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Francesco Bartolozzi|Bartolozzi]] and [[Thomas Bewick|Bewick]].&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for trade cards, and also for catalogs fuelled demand for creative services such as etching, engraving and print-making in the first half of the eighteenth century.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Fuelled by the advent of color lithography and multi-color printing, trade cards entered their heyday in the late 19th-century.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards: A Short History," [Article for the Trade Cards: An Illustrated History Exhibition,] Cornell University, &lt;Online: http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/tradecards/exhibition/history/index.html#modalClosed&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses began to create increasingly sophisticated designs, using color printing. A few American companies specialized in producing stock cards, usually with an image on one side and space on the other side for the business to add its own information.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; In around 1850, [[Aristide Boucicaut]], the founder of the department store ''[[Le Bon Marché|Au Bon Marché]]'' used color printing to great effect when he seized on the idea of using the new chromolithography to offer a weekly advertising color print to children accompanied by their parents. This plan was so successful that it was soon emulated by other Parisian department stores. Cards for ''La Belle Jardiniére'' and ''[[Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann|La Galerie Lafayette]]'' soon followed.

The attractive and colorful designs spawned a passion for collecting trade cards, which became a popular [[hobby]] in the late 19th century. By moving into the realm of [[collecting]], trade cards gave rise to the [[trading card]], the meaning now shifting to the exchange or trade of cards by enthusiasts. Some cards, particularly those produced by [[tobacco]] companies featuring [[baseball]] players, later developed into [[collectible]]s and lost their function as a business advertisement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The interest in collecting trade cards has ensured that many examples have survived. Collections of  rare trade cards, dating from the 17th-century to the 19th century can be found at the British Library,  Bodleian Library, Oxford, and Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, M. and Clifford, H., "Selling Consumption in the Eighteenth Century: Advertising and the Trade Card in Britain and France," ''Cultural and Social History,'' Vol.4, No. 2, 2007, pp 145-170; Scott, K., "The Waddesdon Manor Trade Cards: More Than One History," ''Journal of Design History,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 2004, pp. 91-104&lt;/ref&gt; Another important collection of medical trade cards is the Wellcome Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wellcomecollection.org/works?query=trade+card/ Wellcome Collection of trade cards, 18th century to present]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on information that the [[defendant]] was cultivating [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], two members of the [[Kentucky State Police]], without a [[search warrant]], entered on to the defendant's farm in [[Warren County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Burton189"&gt;''Burton'', 894 F.2d at 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to enter the property the two officers climbed over two series of fences which had "No Trespassing" signs posted all around them.&lt;ref name="Burton189"/&gt;

Upon discovering large quantities of marijuana being grown, the defendant was arrested and charged with four drug related counts.&lt;ref name="Burton189"/&gt; The defendant was convicted of a lesser included offense, of which he appealed challenging that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated.&lt;ref name="Burton190"&gt;''Burton'', 894 F.2d at 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, stating that the case was too factually similar to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'' to justify exclusion of the evidence.&lt;ref name="Burton190-91"&gt;''Burton'', 894 F.2d at 190-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court of Appeals stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only difference between the cases is that here the police climbed over a fence and a locked gate, whereas in ''Oliver'', the officers went around a locked gate. Given the cited language from ''Oliver'' it is evident that this distinction is not of constitutional significance. The same is true of Burton's claim that the police entry onto his land constituted a trespass under Kentucky State law. The Supreme Court, in ''Oliver'', addressed this issue, in the identical context of Kentucky law, observing in the case of open fields, the general rights of property protected by the common law of trespass have little or no relevance to the applicability of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name="Burton190-91"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Wheat Street Baptist Church''' is located at 359 Auburn Ave. in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The building is part of the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District]]; the church and its leader at the time, Rev. [[William Holmes Borders]], played a leading role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=English|first=James W. |title=The prophet of Wheat Street: the story of William Holmes Borders, a man who refused to fail|publisher=D.

The '''Wile Carding Mill''' is a defunct but still operational [[carding]] [[Watermill|mill]], in [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia]], Canada. The mill is now owned by the Province of Nova Scotia and operated as a museum by the [[DesBrisay Museum]].

This water-powered mill was owned and operated by the Wile family from 1860 to 1968. The Wiles ran the mill but employed a number of workers, usually unmarried women, to operate the machinery. The mill was powered by a 7-horsepower (5&amp;nbsp;kW) overshot [[waterwheel]] using the water of Shady Brook, a tributary of the [[Lahave River]].

It became a Registered Heritage Property in Bridgewater in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Boer |first1=Laura |title=Wile Carding Mill Museum to become a Registered Heritage Property |url=https://www.industrialheritagens.ca/apps/blog/show/35663379-wile-carding-mill-museum-to-become-a-registered-heritage-property |website=Industrial Heritage Nova Scotia |publisher=IHNS (2013) |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Witold's Report''', also known as '''Pilecki's Report''', is an official report of over 100 pages (in its final version) written in 1943 by [[Witold Pilecki]], a Polish soldier and agent of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], who entered and escaped from the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp. It was the first comprehensive record of a [[Holocaust]] death camp to be obtained by the [[Allies]].

The report includes details about the [[gas chamber]]s, "[[selektion]]", and the [[Nazi_human_experimentation#Sterilization_and_fertility_experiments|sterilization experiments]]. It states that there were three crematoria in [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] able to burn 8000 people daily. [[Raul Hilberg]] wrote that the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in London, which received the report, filed it away with a note that there was no indication as to its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]]|title=[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]|publisher= Yale University Press|edition= 2003 republication|page= 1212 |date=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilecki's Report preceded and supplemented the "[[Auschwitz Protocols#Component reports|Polish Major's Report]]" by [[Jerzy Tabeau]] (who escaped with Roman Cieliczko on 19 November 1943 and compiled the report between December 1943 and January 1944),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=London has been informed—: reports by Auschwitz escapees |page=94 |author=Henryk Świebocki |year=1997 |isbn=83-85047-60-3 |quote=The chronological order begins with the 'Polish Major's Report,' Jerzy Tabeau's text from his Polish manuscript, which the ... still in the camp, the memoirs of August Kowalczyk, or the accounts of the late Stanisiaw Chybinski and Witold Pilecki.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest of the three eyewitness reports known jointly as the [[Auschwitz Protocols]] which warned about the mass murder and other atrocities that were taking place inside the camp.

==Background==
On November 9, 1939, after the Polish Army was defeated in the [[Invasion of Poland]], the cavalryman [[Witold Pilecki]] together with his commander Major [[Jan Włodarkiewicz]] founded the [[Secret Polish Army]] (''Tajna Armia Polska'', TAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kazimierz |last=Malinowski |title=Tajna Armia Polska. Znak. Konfederacja Zbrojna. Zarys genezy, organizacji i działalności |location=Warszawa |year=1986 |isbn=83-211-0791-5 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Pilecki presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's Auschwitz concentration camp, gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacek |last=Pawłowicz |title=Rotmistrz Witold Pilecki 1901–1948 |year=2008 |isbn=978-83-60464-97-7 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time little was known about the Germans' running of the camp, as it was then an internment or large prison camp.  His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of "Tomasz Serafiński".&lt;ref name="l390"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 1940, he deliberately went out during a Warsaw street roundup ([[łapanka]]), and was caught by the Germans along with some 2,000 innocent civilians. After two days' detention in the Light Horse Guards Barracks, where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber batons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilecki|first=Witold|title=The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery|year=2012|publisher=Aquila Polonica (US) Ltd|location=USA|isbn=978-1-60772-010-2|pages=460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilecki was sent to Auschwitz and was assigned inmate number 4859.&lt;ref name="l390" /&gt;

===In Auschwitz===
Inside the camp Pilecki organized the underground Union of Military Organizations ([[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]], ZOW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Świerczek |first=Lidia |url=http://www.en.pilecki.ipn.gov.pl/rpe/publications/8273,Rotamaster-Witold-Pilecki.html |title=Rotamaster Witold Pilecki 1901–1948 |website=The Institute of National Remembrance |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was connected with other smaller underground organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foot |first=Michael Richard Daniell |authorlink=M. R. D. Foot |title=Six Faces of Courage |publisher=Eyre Methuen |year=1978  |chapter=Secret agents against Nazi tyranny. Witold Pilecki, Leo Cooper |isbn=0-413-39430-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pilecki planned a general uprising in [[Auschwitz]] and hoped that the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp (most likely the [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]], based in Britain), and that the [[Home Army]] would organize an assault on the camp from outside. In 1943, the [[Gestapo]] redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garlinski, Jozef|title= Fighting Auschwitz: The Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp|publisher= Fawcett|date= 1975| pages= 191–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilecki decided to break out of the camp, hoping to personally convince [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] leaders about his idea of uprising in Auschwitz. On the night of April 26/27, 1943, Pilecki made a daring escape from the camp, but the Home Army did not accept his plan, as the Allies considered his reports about the Holocaust exaggerated.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Report ==

ZOW's intelligence network inside the camp started to send regular reports to the Home Army from October 1940. Starting in November 1940, the first information about the genocide that was occurring in the camp was sent via ZOW to Home Army Headquarters in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Adam |last1=Cyra |authorlink1=Adam Cyra |first2=Józef |last2=Garliński |title=Ochotnik do Auschwitz: Witold Pilecki 1901–48 |trans-title=Volunteer for Auschwitz |location=Oświęcim |year=2000 |isbn=83-912000-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From March 1941 Witold Pilecki's reports were forwarded to the [[Polish government in exile]] and through it, to the British government in London and other Allied governments. These reports informed the Allies about the [[Holocaust]] and were the principal source of intelligence on [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] for the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Davies |authorlink=Norman Davies |title=Europe: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-06-097468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaster, a member of ZOW, carried with him a detailed report about conditions in the camp, written by Pilecki. The Germans never recaptured any of them.&lt;ref&gt;

After a daring escape from Auschwitz on April 27, 1943, Pilecki wrote "Raport W". The report was signed by other members of the Polish underground who worked with ZOW: Aleksander Wielopolski, Stefan Bielecki, Antoni Woźniak, Aleksander Paliński, Ferdynand Trojnicki, Eleonora Ostrowska and Stefan Miłkowski, and it included a section called "Teren S" that contained a list of ZOW members. Later, after his release from the German prisoner-of-war camp at [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]] in 1945, Pilecki prepared a version of the report that was over 100 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;

On July 31, 2012, YP was included in PaidContent50's list of "the world's most successful digital media companies" based on 2011 digital ad revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/07/31/pc50/|title=paidContent 50: The world’s most successful digital media companies|first=Robert|last=Andrews|date=31 July 2012|website=paidcontent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was formed on April 4, 2012 preceding a formal announcement that [[AT&amp;T]] would sell off a 53% stake in its directory operations to [[Cerberus Capital Management]]. [[Dex Media]] purchased YP Holdings LLC in 2017, officially announced in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dex Media acquires YP Holdings to create DexYP, expanding its Thryv local business automation software nationwide|url=https://www.dexmedia.com/news/dex-media-acquires-yp-holdings-to-create-dexyp/|publisher=[[Dex Media]]|date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is responsible for the publication yp.com, YP app, the Gas Guru app, and more than 1,300 printed directories, published under the "YP The Real Yellow Pages" brand. It is headquartered in [[Tucker, Georgia]].

==History==
YP Holdings, as a parent company, was founded in 2012 to take over the directory and online advertising businesses that were operated in the AT&amp;T Advertising Solutions and AT&amp;T Interactive divisions of AT&amp;T. The directory business previously operated by Ad Solutions has had several incarnations.

===SBC Yellow Pages===
YELLOWPAGES.com, rebranded as YP.com in 2012, is an Internet web site operated by YP that employs sales representatives to sell preferred positioning on their site, YellowPages.com in addition to marketing additional products that  move their clients' businesses toward the front of major web search pages. 
[[File:SBC SMART Yellow Pages logo, 2002-2004.jpg|thumb|right|SBC SMART Yellow Pages logo, 2002-2004]]
In 2002, SBC Communications dropped its regional telephone company names, switching to a unified "SBC" brand. As a result, the yellow pages operations were combined into one unit (retaining the separate companies) and took on the "SMART Yellow Pages" brand, retained from Pacific Bell Directory.

Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages headquarters were utilized as central headquarters for all SBC Yellow Pages operations in [[St. Louis, MO]] at [[One Bell Center]].

[[Image:Logo sbc yellow.png|thumb|right|SBC Yellow Pages logo, 2004-2005]]
In 2004, SBC sold complete control of its joint venture with [[R. H. Donnelley]], DonTech, to [[R. H. Donnelley]]. Telephone directories formerly published by SBC now became known as SBC Yellow Pages Published by R. H. Donnelley, and R. H. Donnelley's Illinois operations for SBC became known as the [[R. H. Donnelley Publishing &amp; Advertising of Illinois|R. H. Donnelley Publishing &amp; Advertising of Illinois Partnership]]. SBC merged Southwestern Bell Advertising, L.P. with Pacific Bell Directory's advertising division, creating SBC Advertising, L.P. As a result, "SMART" is eliminated as a nickname for all of the yellow pages operations, becoming simply SBC Yellow Pages.

In 2004 SBC Communications and Bell South Corp. acquired YELLOWPAGES.COM, Inc. which operated as a joint venture between the two companies, until Bell South was acquired by in 2006. 
After 2004, R.H. Donnelley published printed directories in the names of SBC and subsequently AT&amp;T in the area in and around Chicago, IL.

===AT&amp;T Yellow Pages===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AT&amp;T Yellow Pages of Wyandotte County.jpg|thumb|right|Typical AT&amp;T Yellow Pages directory, 2006]] --&gt;
In 2005, SBC completed its acquisition of [[AT&amp;T Corp.]], and renamed itself AT&amp;T Inc. As a result, SBC Yellow Pages was renamed AT&amp;T Yellow Pages, and the [[Illinois]] edition was renamed "AT&amp;T Yellow Pages Published by R. H. Donnelley". SBC Advertising, L.P. was renamed AT&amp;T Advertising, L.P. AT&amp;T directory publishing companies began doing business as either AT&amp;T Yellow Pages (in reference to being a directory publisher) or AT&amp;T Directory Operations (in reference to being a unit of AT&amp;T).

[[Image:AT&amp;TYP.PNG|thumb|right|AT&amp;T Yellow Pages logo, 2006-2007]]

===AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages===
[[Image:attRYP.PNG|right|thumb|AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages logo, 2007-2011]]
On December 29, 2006, AT&amp;T added BellSouth Advertising &amp; Publishing Corporation, or "BAPCO" to its roster of directory publishers. As a result, in January 2007, all companies who had been doing business as AT&amp;T Yellow Pages started doing business as AT&amp;T Advertising &amp; Publishing, while the AT&amp;T Yellow Pages name was retained.

On February 26, 2007, however, AT&amp;T announced it would adopt [[BellSouth]]'s directory branding, the Real Yellow Pages. All yellow pages directories published by [[AT&amp;T]] became published under the AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages name.

===YELLOWPAGES.com===
YELLOWPAGES.com LLC. became part of AT&amp;T Interactive, following the AT&amp;T acquisition of Bellsouth in 2006.

YELLOWPAGES.com, rebranded as YP.com in 2009, is an Internet web site operated by YP.  It employees more than 4,000 local marketing consultants and customer service professionals, and offers a broad range of marketing solutions, including online presence, local search, display ads, and direct marketing.  It was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T.

==Sale to Cerberus==
On March 8, 2012, it was announced that [[AT&amp;T]] has entered talks to sell a controlling stake in its Yellow Pages business to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and [[TPG Capital]]. The deal was estimated to be valued at $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204781804577269613924908708|title=AT&amp;T in Talks to Sell Yellow Pages Stake to Cerberus, TPG|first1=Anton|last1=Troianovski|first2=Gregory|last2=Zuckerman|date=8 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the version of the deal reported in the press, AT&amp;T would still own a minority stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/311494/20120308/t-makes-call-plans-sell-yellow-pages.htm|title=AT&amp;T Makes The Call, Plans To Sell Yellow Pages|date=8 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2012, it was announced that AT&amp;T would sell 53% of AT&amp;T Advertising Solutions to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] for $750 million. AT&amp;T Advertising Solutions as a structural unit then became the company '''YP Holdings'''. Included in the sale is [[Yellowpages.com]], YP mobile app as well as the printed directory division. AT&amp;T will retain 47% ownership. Cerberus will assume $200 million of AT&amp;T debt from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303772904577333480760657426|title=AT&amp;T to Sell Yellow Pages to Cerberus|first=Greg|last=Bensinger|date=9 April 2012|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale came after AT&amp;T began removing branding from its directories. In 2011, it removed the [[trade name]]s of its [[Bell Operating Companies]] (a practice adopted in 2002), reduced the size of the AT&amp;T logo, and enlarged the "YP" logo of [[YELLOWPAGES.COM]] as the main logo of the directory. It also as renamed its directory "YP Real Yellow Pages".

The sale made AT&amp;T the last [[Bell System]]-related spin off to sell off its yellow pages business. [[Cincinnati Bell]] sold off [[CBD Media]] in 2002, [[Qwest]] sold [[Dex Media]] in 2002, [[SBC Communications|SBC]] sold off [[Illinois]] directory operations to [[R.H. Donnelley]] in 2004, and [[Verizon]] sold [[Idearc Media]] in 2006.

The deal with Cerberus officially closed on May 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;(2012-05-08).

[[Image:Meßkirch Schloss 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Messkirch Castle|Renaissance castle of Meßkirch]] where the work was written]]
The '''Zimmern Chronicle''' (German: ''Zimmerische Chronik'' or ''Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern'') is a family [[chronicle]] describing the lineage and history of the noble family of Zimmern, based in [[Meßkirch]], Germany. It was written in a Swabian variety of [[Early New High German]] by Count [[Froben Christoph of Zimmern]] (1519–1566). The chronicle is an eminent historical source of information about 16th century nobility in South-West Germany, its culture and its values. It is also an important literary and ethnological source for its many folkloristic texts. The text has survived in two manuscripts, both in possession of the [[Württembergische Landesbibliothek]] in [[Stuttgart]].

== Authorship ==
[[Image:Codex 593a Froben Christoph.jpg|thumb|Froben Christopher of Zimmern and his wife (portrait from a manuscript of Froben's uncle Wilhelm Werner, ''not'' containing the Zimmern chronicle)]]
When the anonymous, unpublished chronicle was rediscovered in the 19th century, historians were not sure about the identity of the author (most of the chronicle is written in the [[Grammatical person|third person]], while at some times the writer slips into the first person). While some considered the author to be the famous law scholar and Imperial judge, [[Wilhelm Werner von Zimmern]] (Froben Christopher's uncle), others believed count Froben Christopher and his secretary Johannes Müller († c. 1600) to be the writers. In 1959, Beat Rudolf Jenny proved in his thoroughly researched book that Froben Christopher is the sole author of the chronicle. However, Wilhelm Werner's influence on his nephew is palpable in some passages.

== Purpose and ambition ==
Writing or ordering a genealogy was a rather common form of representation for Germany's noble families of the time. However, the Zimmern chronicle surpasses other contemporary texts in both volume and scope. It is a compilation of many types of texts, including simple genealogical information, psychologically rich biographies of ancestors and members of other noble families, [[fable]]s, [[schwank]]s (droll stories) and [[facetiae]] (comic and/or erotic short stories).

The purpose of the work is probably twofold: Firstly, Froben Christopher wanted to prove the nobility of his family and to preserve that knowledge to posterity. Secondly, the chronicle was a means to educate future family members. The author does not only tell the stories of shining examples of nobility, but he also gives proof of bad examples. He clearly condemns some of his more spendthrift ancestors for selling family goods and hence giving away economic and political power.

== Contents ==

The Zimmern Chronicle begins with the history of the [[Cimbri]], an ancient Germanic tribe, and tells the story of the Cimbri's forced relocation to the Black Forest under the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. While the link between the Cimbri and the Zimmern family is fictional and only induced by the similar-sounding name, Froben recounts several episodes woven into a stream of historical information to prove it. The work also includes a complete fictional genealogy starting in the 10th century. Historical evidence is entered with the first actually known family member, Konrad von Zimmern, abbot of [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau Abbey]] from {{circa|1234}} to 1255. Starting with the early 14th century, the genealogical and historical parts of the Zimmern Chronicle are finally reduced to facts. Still, Froben inserts entertaining stories to enliven his characterizations and to prove his political points.

== History ==
[[Image:HS-A Folio 177.jpg|thumb|A page from manuscript A showing Froben Christopher's corrections]]
[[Image:Zimmerische Chronik Ms 580a p33.jpg|thumb|Illustration from manuscript B]]
In 1540, Froben Christopher had written the genealogical "Liber rerum Cimbriacarum" whose structure shows many resemblances to the later work.

The beginnings of the chronicle as we know it today lie probably in the year 1559, and it was not even finished at Froben Christopher's death in 1566.

Two manuscripts were written by secretary Johannes Müller at Froben Christopher's chancellery at [[Meßkirch Castle]]:

* ''Manuscript A (Cod. Don. 581):'' 296 sheets, probably started by Müller as a fair copy. Many later corrections by Froben Christopher, some sheets and illustrations removed. Probably eventually used as a draft copy for manuscript B.
* ''Manuscript B (Cod. Don. 580):'' 1567 pages (divided in two volumes since 1792, hence also known as B1/B2), illustrated with 43 images of coats of arms, a picture of a flag bearer and three ornamental pages.

With the Zimmern family expiring with the death of Froben Christopher's only male heir Wilhelm von Zimmern as early as 1594, the work never materialized as the memorial and textbook that it was originally intended to become. The chronicle manuscripts eventually wound up in the possession of the counts of  [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Fürstenberg]], probably via Appolonia von Helfenstein, a daughter of Froben Christopher's. The books were stored for nearly four centuries in the Fürstenbergische Hofbibliothek at [[Donaueschingen]], until that library was sold and scattered by the princes of Fürstenberg for financial reasons in 1993. Since 1993, the manuscripts are in possession of the Wurttemberg State Library (Württembergische Landesbibliothek) in Stuttgart.

== Reception and editions ==
An archivist named Doeppner rediscovered the chronicle around 1776, but it was the literary scholar and author [[Joseph von Laßberg]] who made the text known among scholars and historians by using parts of it in his anthology "Liedersaal". Laßberg's friend Josef Albrecht von Ittner used plots from the chronicle for his own novellas. Laßberg also influenced Friedrich von der Hagen who used parts of the chronicle for his edition of German medieval literature, ''Minnesinger'' (1838), and Josef Eiselein who used the chronicle as a source for his collection of German proverbs (1840). Several monographs on regional history in these years used the chronicle as a source: Ernst Münch's history of the house of Fürstenberg (1829), Krieg von Hochfelden's history of the counts of Eberstein (1836), Ruckgaber's history of the counts of Zimmern (1840), and Vanotti's history of the counts of Montfort and Werdenberg (1845). [[Ludwig Uhland]] took some plots from the chronicle for his collection of folk tales.

In 1869, [[Karl August Barack]] published the first printed edition of the chronicle and hence made it finally available to the public. A revised version of this edition was published in 1882, a further reprint in 1932. Barack's revised edition is the only complete edition and is still widely used. However, Barack did not retain the original sequence of the manuscript and wove Froben Christopher's addenda into the main text, thus giving the lively tale an air of verbosity. This deluded later scholars in both questioning the author's literary abilities and scorning the factual content of the work which now much more resembled a collection of short droll stories than a serious work of genealogy and history.

A new edition was started in the 1960s by Hansmartin Decker-Hauff and Rudolf Seigel, retaining the original sequence of texts in manuscript B. This edition has remained unfinished. Only three volumes have appeared.

Manuscript 580 is available as a digitized version at the website of the Stuttgart library.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.wlb-stuttgart.de/purl/bsz35308316X&lt;/ref&gt; The revised Barack edition is available as a digitized version at the website of the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University Library of Freiburg]]. Since 2006, an electronic text of that edition is available at Wikimedia's German [[Wikisource]] project (see ''External links'').

Modern German renarrations of some parts of the chronicle have been published in 1911, 1940, 1988, 1996 and 1997.
