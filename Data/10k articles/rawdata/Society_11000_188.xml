'''A Protestant parliament for a Protestant people''' is a term that has been applied to the political institutions in [[Northern Ireland]] between 1921 and 1972. The term has been documented as early as February 1939, when [[Bishop Daniel Mageean]], in his [[Lent]]en [[Pastoral letter|pastoral]], stated that prime minister, [[Lord Craigavon]] had adopted the words as his slogan.

The implication was that [[Irish Catholic]]s had no political status in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]],''"Dread of Nocturnal Visits " In Ulster''  20 February 1939; pg 19; col C&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them supported the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] that chose a policy of [[Abstentionism#In_Northern_Ireland|abstentionism]] between 1921 and 1965, resulting in a large majority of Protestant members. They also alleged that local [[Gerrymandering#Northern_Ireland|gerrymandering]] had increased since 1921.

The original similar phrase had been published in the 1934 Northern Irish parliamentary debates (volume 16).

==Actual quotation==
A bitter debate arose in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] on 24 April 1934 on the rights of the minority (the minority in Northern Ireland being [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] supporters, who were mostly Catholic), itemising how these had generally deteriorated since 1921. Craigavon denied the assertions at length, ending with: "''Since we took up office we have tried to be absolutely fair towards all the citizens of Northern Ireland. Actually, on an [[Orange Order|Orange]] platform, I, myself, laid down the principle, to which I still adhere, that I was Prime Minister not of one section of the community but of all, and that as far as I possibly could I was going to see that fair play was meted out to all classes and creeds without any favour whatever on my part.''"

[[George Leeke]] then retorted: "''What about your Protestant Parliament?''", to which Craigavon replied: "''The hon. Member must remember that in the South they boasted of a Catholic State. They still boast of [[Irish Free State|Southern Ireland]] being a Catholic State. All I boast of is that we are a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State. It would be rather interesting for historians of the future to compare a Catholic State launched in the South with a Protestant State launched in the North and to see which gets on the better and prospers the more. It is most interesting for me at the moment to watch how they are progressing. I am doing my best always to top the bill and to be ahead of the South.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=16&amp;pageno=1095 Vol. 16, page 1095 original text online; downloaded February 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190258/http://www.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=16&amp;pageno=1095 |date= 3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the then prime minister, [[Terence O'Neill]] also attributed the phrase itself to his predecessor, but strongly argued that it was no longer representative of the present spirit of [[Ulster Unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, ''Ulster's Prime Minister replies to his critics''; 28 April 1967; pg 11 col E&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers continued to use the term in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in relation to the former [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paradox of political reform at Stormont (News)''; Hugh Munro; '''The Times''' 8 November 1971; pg 12 col F&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mr Whitelaw denies that Army's hands are tied in military action against Northern Ireland gunmen (News)''; '''The Times''' 12 October 1972; pg 6 col A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sectarianism in Ulster (Letters to the Editor)'' BRIAN W.

'''B Corporation''' certification (also known as '''B Lab''' certification or '''B Corp''' certification) is a private certification issued to [[For-profit corporation|for-profit companies]] by [[B Lab]], a global [[501(c) organization|nonprofit]] organization with offices in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a partnership in Latin America with Sistema B. To be granted and to preserve certification, companies must receive a minimum score on an online assessment for "[[Social impact assessment|social and environmental performance]]", satisfy the requirement that the company integrate [[B Lab]] commitments to [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] into [[By-law|company governing documents]],  and pay an annual fee ranging from $500 to $50,000.&lt;ref name="Make It Official"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/make-it-official |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, there are over 2,600 certified B Corporations across 150 industries in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/ |accessdate=August, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Runa B Corp Label.jpg|thumb|Example of a B Corp certification label|193x193px]]
The B Lab certification is a third party standard requiring companies to meet [[social sustainability]] and environmental performance standards, meet accountability standards, and to be [[Sustainability reporting|transparent]] to the public according to the score they receive on the assessment. B Lab certification applies to the whole company across all product lines and issue areas. For-profits of all legal [[business entities|business structures]] are eligible for certification.

===Advantages===
* Similar to other [[Companies law|business associations]], certified B Corporations and their employees have access to a number of discounts from outside entities and fellow members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save Money and Access Services |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/why-become-a-b-corp/save-money-and-access-services |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* B Lab certification has no legal status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Distinction from benefit corporation===
{{further|Benefit corporation}}
* Benefit corporation is a legal status conferred by state law in the US; B Lab certification is issued by a private organisation and has no legislative framework.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are B Corps |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |accessdate=16 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152828/https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B Lab certification is not needed to obtain benefit corporation status.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"/&gt;
* Legislation for the passage of this corporate legal status has been passed in 30 states, including [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]], whereas B Lab certification is privately issued by an organisation run by people principally issued from the business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Ariel |title=Delaware Just Made It A Whole Lot Easier For Socially Responsible Companies To Exist |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company &amp; Inc.]] |date=July 23, 2013 |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682654/delaware-just-made-it-a-whole-lot-easier-for-socially-responsible-companies-to-exist |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification process==

===Online assessment===
To obtain a B Corporation certification, a company first completes an online assessment. Companies that earn a minimum score of 80 out of 200 points undergo an assessment review process, essentially a conference call verifying the claims made in their assessment. Companies are required to provide supporting documentation before they are certified.

The assessment covers the company‚Äôs entire operation and measures the positive impact of the company in areas of [[Corporate governance|governance]], [[Employee engagement|workers]], [[Community service#Personal benefits of serving|community]], the [[Environmental impact|environment]], as well as the product or service the company provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Network for Business Innovation and Sustainability |title=B Corporations, Benefit Corporations and Social Purpose Corporations: Launching a New Era of Impact-Driven Companies |publisher=NBIS |date=October 2012 |url=http://nbis.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ImpactDrivenCompanies_NBIS_Whitepaper_Oct2012.pdf |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social business|Socially]] and environmentally-focused business model points ultimately are accrued in their relevant impact area (governance, workers, community or environment).&lt;ref name=giirs&gt;{{cite web |title=GIIRS Governance |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://giirs.org/about-giirs/how-giirs-works/185 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a company's industry, geographic location, and number of employees, the online assessment adjusts the weightings of the question categories to increase its relevancy. For instance, companies with more employees will have a heavier weighting in the workers category, and companies in [[Manufacturing sector|manufacturing]] will have a heavier weighting in the environment category.

To maintain credibility, the B Corporation certification standard operates under principles that are independent, comprehensive, comparable, dynamic, and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AB 361 Assembly Bill - BILL ANALYSIS |publisher=[[California State Assembly]] |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0351-0400/ab_361_cfa_20110624_120507_sen_comm.html |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; B Lab has an established standards advisory council that can independently make decisions with or without the support of B Lab.&lt;ref name=giirs /&gt;  As of May 2014, 28 of 30 members were listed by their business affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards Advisory Council |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/standards-advisory-council |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council recommends improvements to the B Corp assessment on a biennial basis. There is a 30-day public consultation period before releasing a new version of the B Corporation assessment.&lt;ref name="giirs"/&gt;

Currently the B Corp assessment is its fifth version, with the sixth version scheduled to be released in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Social Responsibility Comes In Many Flavors, Some Not So Tasty |publisher=NonProfit Times Publishing Group |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/corporate-social-responsibility-comes-in-many-flavors-some-not-so-tasty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
Certification also requires companies to integrate their stakeholder commitments into the company governing documents. In the United States, the avenue for corporations making the legal amendment to certify will depend on the state they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in. Some states known as "constituency" states will allow for this change in the articles of incorporation, other states, known as "non-constituency states", will not; and many states now have the option of adopting the [[benefit corporation]] legal structure, which also meets B Lab's requirements for B Corp certification.&lt;ref name=howto&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporation Legal Roadmap |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/legal-roadmap/corporation-legal-roadmap |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the corporate model, other for-profit business entities make an amendment of the company by-laws or governing documents. These include:
* The establishment of clear wording to "consider stakeholder interests" in company [[Articles of Incorporation|articles of incorporation]] or [[By-law|company by-laws]].&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;
* Define "[[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]" as the employees, the community, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Boatright (2006) and Johnstone and Lionais (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* No prioritization of one stakeholder over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OLR Backgrounder: Social Enterprise and the Benefit Corporation |publisher=State of Connecticut, Office of Legislative Research |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0260.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing for the company's values to exist under new management, investors, or ownership.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Lencioni (July 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, B Lab certification allows the company bylaws to remain secret.

==International adoption==
In September 2018, there were over 2,000 certified B Corporations across 130 industries in 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahsweeney/2018/09/13/how-b-corporations-change-the-way-entrepreneurs-think-about-profit-and-consumers/#405f3d5c3470|title=How B Corporations Change The Way Entrepreneurs Think About Profit And Consumers|last=Sweeney|first=Deborah|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Canada]] (78 companies), [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"/&gt; The most active community outside of the United States is '''Sistema B'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The double bottom line: Profit and social benefit  |journal=Business Horizons |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681313001729 | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2013.10.001 |volume=57 |pages=11‚Äì20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2012, Sistema B has been the adaptation of the B Corps movement in [[Latin America]], including in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Camacho |first=Manuel Antonio |title=In Just a Few Months, Sistema B (AKA: B Corp) Finds Fertile Ground for Social Enterprises in Latin America |url=http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=2908 |date=August 15, 2012 |publisher=NextBillion.net |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This non-profit adapts proprietary certifications and evaluation metrics and modifies both to the context of each country.

After the death in prison in 2009 of [[Sergei Magnitsky]], a Russian lawyer and auditor who had represented his company and conducted an investigation into massive tax fraud related to it, Browder lobbied for Congress to pass the [[Magnitsky Act]], a law to punish Russian human rights violators, which was signed into law in 2012 by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://the1a.org/shows/2017-07-25/magnitsky-act-supporter-bill-browder-on-russia-putin-and-american-security| title=Magnitsky Act Supporter Bill Browder On Russia, Putin And American Security| date=July 25, 2017| publisher=1A| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/trumpcast/2017/07/why_does_putin_hate_the_magnitsky_act.html| title=Why Exactly Does Putin Hate the Magnitsky Act?| author=Jacob Weisberg| date=July 21, 2017| publisher=Slate| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Browder was tried in absentia in Russia for tax fraud, jointly in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison. [[Interpol]] rejected Russian requests to arrest Browder, saying the case was political. In 2014, the [[European Parliament]] voted for sanctions against 30 Russians believed complicit in the Magnitsky case; this was the first time it had taken such action.

In July 2017, Browder testified to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee]] on Russia's alleged interference in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]] through use of persons in Washington, D.C.

On October 19, 2017, Canada enacted its own Magnitsky Act, which allows for the freezing of assets and visa bans on officials from Russia and other nations considered to be guilty of human rights violations, and prohibits Canadian firms from dealing with foreign nationals who have grossly violated human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada Passes Version Of Magnitsky Act, Raising Moscow's Ire|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/canada-passes-magnistky-act-russia-sanctions/28804814.html|accessdate=October 23, 2017|work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries including Estonia, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, have also enacted their own version of the Magnitsky Act.

==Early life and education==
William Felix Browder was born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], the son of mathematician [[Felix Browder]], and the grandson of [[Earl Browder]]. He attended the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] before transferring to the [[University of Chicago]], from which he graduated with a degree in [[economics]].

==Family background==
Browder's paternal grandfather was [[Earl Browder]], who was born in Kansas in 1891.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; He was a radical and had lived in the Soviet Union for several years from 1927 and married Raisa Berkman, a Jewish Russian woman, while living there.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; After his return to the United States in 1931,&lt;ref name=family/&gt; Earl Browder became the leader of the [[Communist Party USA]], and ran for U.S. president in 1936 and 1940.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= Clifford J.|last= Levy|authorlink= |title=An Investment Gets Trapped in Kremlin's Vise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/world/europe/24kremlin.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=For Mr. Browder, 44, Russia was more than a place to do business. His grandfather Earl Browder was a communist from Kansas who moved to the Soviet Union in 1927, staying for several years and marrying a Russian.

Earl and his wife Raisa had three children, all sons, and all three became mathematicians who headed the mathematics departments of top American universities&lt;ref name=family/&gt; including Bill Browder's father [[Felix Browder]] who married Eva (Tislowitz). Felix was a mathematics prodigy who had entered MIT at 16, acquired his bachelor's degree in two years, and by the age of 20 received a Ph.D. from Princeton.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; But during the [[McCarthy era]], he could not find work because he was the son of the onetime head of the Communist Party USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/felix-browder-mathematician-shadowed-by-his-fathers-life-as-a-communist-dies-at-89/2016/12/15/4bc626da-c215-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html| title=Felix Browder, mathematician shadowed by his father's life as a Communist, dies at 89| author=Matt Schudel| date=December 15, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/remembering-felix-browder-a-nonlinear-genius-in-a-nonlinear-world| title=Remembering Felix Browder, A Nonlinear Genius in a Nonlinear World| author=Thomas Lin| date=December 20, 2016| publisher=The New Yorker| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of job rejections in the 1950s, he was championed by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the former First Lady who was then chairman of the board of [[Brandeis University]]; she overrode the rest of the board who were afraid to hire him, and he gained a position at Brandeis.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; Felix went on to chair the mathematics department at the [[University of Chicago]], and in 1999 became the president of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

Felix Browder was renowned in the field of [[nonlinear functional analysis]] ‚Äî a branch of mathematics with wide applications to such fields as [[physics]], [[engineering]], and [[finance]]. He was instrumental in establishing a science and technology center in conjunction with [[Princeton University]] and [[Bell Labs]]. In 1999, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] by President [[Bill Clinton]], for his "key role in the explosive growth of nonlinear functional analysis and its applications to partial differential equations in recent years".&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

Bill Browder has one sibling, [[Tom Browder]], who entered the University of Chicago at 15, and became a leading [[particle physicist]].&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

==Career and citizenship==
In 1998, Bill Browder gave up his U.S. citizenship and became a British citizen, partly to avoid paying U.S. taxes on foreign investments.&lt;ref name="taxes"&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/media/5-citizens-who-left-the-us-to-avoid-paying-tax/3/ Jason McCormick, "5 Citizens Who Left the US to Avoid Paying Tax"], CBS News, 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaminsky|first=Matthew|date=9 May 2014|title=The Man Who Stood Up to Putin|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304885404579552120262256240|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|location= |publisher= |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was working in the Eastern European practice of the [[Boston Consulting Group]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laroche|first=Julia|date=3 February 2015|title=The man who was once Russia's largest foreign investor says he should've 'never gone there in the first place'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-browder-profile-2015-2|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed the Russian proprietary investments desk at [[Salomon Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shao|first=Maria|date=1 October 2009|title=Bill Browder: A Warning Against Investment in Russia|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/bill-browder-warning-against-investment-russia|publisher=GSB.Stanford.EU|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, when answering a question about the decision to renounce his U.S. citizenship, he cited "a legacy of bad feeling about the rule of law" as a result of his family having been "viciously persecuted" by U.S. authorities in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cooper.

===Hermitage Capital Management===
Browder and [[Edmond Safra]] (1932‚Äì1999) founded [[Hermitage Capital Management]] in 1996 for the purpose of investing initial [[Seed money|seed capital]] of $25 million in Russia during the period of the mass [[privatization]] after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. [[Beny Steinmetz]] was another of the original investors in Hermitage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-04-20/putins-hard-turn| title=Putin's Hard Turn| author=Joshua Yaffa| date=May 2015| work=Foreign Affairs| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian financial crisis of 1998]], Browder remained committed to Hermitage's original mission of investing in Russia, despite significant outflows from the fund. Hermitage became a prominent [[activist shareholder]] in the Russian gas giant [[Gazprom]], the large oil company [[Surgutneftegaz]], [[RAO UES]], [[Sberbank]], [[Sidanco]], [[VSMPO-AVISMA|Avisma]], and Volzhanka.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;"The Hermitage Fund: Media and Corporate Governance in Russia," Harvard Business School Case 703-010, 2002 (26)&lt;/ref&gt; Browder exposed management corruption and corporate malfeasance in these partly state-owned companies.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;"Gazprom and Hermitage Capital: Shareholder Activism in Russia", Stanford Graduate School of Business Case IB-36, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He has been quoted as saying: "You had to become a shareholder activist if you didn't want everything stolen from you".&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

In 1999, Avisma filed a RICO lawsuit against Browder and other Avisma investors including Kenneth Dart, alleging they illegally siphoned company assets into offshore accounts and then transferred the funds to U.S. accounts at [[Barclays]]. Browder and his co-defendants settled with Avisma in 2000; they sold their Avisma shares as part of the confidential settlement agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://100r.org/2014/05/russian-sanctions-highlight-role-of-western-enablers/| title=Russian Sanctions Highlight Role of Western Enablers| date=May 21, 2014| publisher=100 Reporters| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[HSBC]], a bank that serves as the trustee and manager of Hermitage Capital Management, announced that it would end the fund's operations in Russia. The decision was taken amid two legal cases against Browder: a libel court case in London and a trial ''in absentia'' for tax evasion in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henry Meyer &amp; Jason Corcoran|title=HSBC Shuts Russia's Hermitage as Browder Sued in London|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-26/hsbc-shutters-hermitage-fund-as-russia-chases-browder-in-courts.html|work=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=27 March 2013|date=26 March 2013|quote=HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) is closing Hermitage Capital Management Ltd.'s flagship Russia fund just as its co-founder, William Browder, is being sued for libel in London and tried in absentia for tax evasion in Moscow.

===Conflict with Russian government===
In 2005, after ten years of business deals in Russia, Browder was [[blacklist]]ed by the Russian government as a "threat to national security" and denied entry to the country. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that the Russian government blacklisted Browder because he interfered with the flow of money to "corrupt bureaucrats and their businessmen accomplices". Other experts on the activities of Western "investors" in Russia in the 1990s were more sympathetic to the Russian government's assessment, citing Browder's earlier settlement agreement with Avisma, which seemed to indicate a long-standing habit of siphoning off funds to offshore accounts. Browder had earlier supported Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=An enemy of the people: The sad fate of a loyal Putinista |url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=349002&amp;story_id=E1_VGGTGDT |quote=As the manager of a big Russian investment fund, Bill Browder has contributed to the circulation of the first kind of money‚Äîas well as making a packet for himself, and making his rich clients even richer.

As reported in 2008 by ''[[The New York Times]]'', "over the next two years several of his associates and lawyers, as well as their relatives, became victims of crimes, including severe beatings and robberies during which documents were taken".&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; In June 2007, dozens of police officers "swooped down on the Moscow offices of Hermitage and its law firm, confiscating documents and computers. When a member of the firm protested that the search was illegal, he was beaten by officers and hospitalized for two weeks, said the firm's head, [[Jamison Firestone|Jamison R. Firestone]]."&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Hermitage became "victim of what is known in Russia as 'corporate raiding': seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges". Three Hermitage holding companies were seized on what the company's lawyers insist were bogus charges.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

The raids in June 2007 allegedly enabled corrupt law enforcement officers to steal the corporate registration documents of three Hermitage holding companies. They allegedly perpetrated a fraud, claiming (and receiving) a rebate of $230 million in taxes paid by those companies to the Russian state in 2006.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Matthews |authorlink= |title=Where Vultures Prey |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/218291|quote=Retaliation came quickly.

As a result of the controversy related to his arrest and evidence of mistreatment and claimed abuse, his death aroused international coverage and outrage. Magnitsky's death was the catalyst for passage by the U.S. Congress, of the [[Magnitsky Act]], signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. The act directly targeted individuals involved in the Magnitsky affair by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system. The Russian government retaliated by prohibiting [[adoption]] of Russian children by American citizens, and prohibiting certain individuals from entering Russia.

In February 2013, Russian officials announced that Browder and Magnitsky would both be tried for evading $16.8 million in taxes. In March 2013, Russian authorities announced that they would be investigating Hermitage's acquisition of [[Gazprom]] shares worth $70 million. The investigation was to focus on whether Browder violated any Russian laws when Hermitage used Russian companies registered in the region of [[Kalmykia]] to buy shares. An investigation by the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights cleared Browder of the accusations of improprieties that surfaced at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights|title=Refusing impunity for the killers of Sergei Magnitsky|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/Communication/ajdoc24_2013.pdf|work=Parliamentary Assembly, Council of Europe|accessdate=10 August 2014|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905011145/http://www.assembly.coe.int/Communication/ajdoc24_2013.pdf|archive-date=2014-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, according to the Russian law, foreigners were barred from directly owning Gazprom shares.

=== 2017 testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee ===

On July 27, 2017, Browder testified to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee]] on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in regards to the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA) and [[Fusion GPS]]. The latter is the [[opposition research]] firm based in [[Washington D.C.]] that commissioned former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] staffer [[Christopher Steele]] to collect information on [[Donald Trump]]'s ties with Russia. The hearing was set up to examine the firm's separate work on a legal case involving the Magnitsky Act. He directly discussed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Browder testified that President Putin is "the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world", building a fortune by threatening Russian oligarchs and getting a 50% cut of their profits:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I estimate that he has accumulated $200 billion of ill-gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power. He keeps his money in the West and all of his money in the West is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation. Therefore, he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the Magnitsky sanctions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Browder concluded his statement by reviewing the circumstances that led to U.S. passage of the Magnitsky Act:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian operatives in Washington and how they use U.S. enablers to achieve major foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests. I also hope that this story and others like it may lead to a change in the FARA enforcement regime in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rosie Gray: "[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/ Bill Browder's Testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee]".

=== Book about experiences in Russia ===
In February 2015, Browder published a book about his career, ''[[Red Notice (book)|Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice]]'', focusing on his years spent in Russia and the Russian government's attacks on Hermitage Capital Management.

Browder attempted to resist subpoenas that would force him to reveal his sources for information he gave to federal prosecutors. The court ruled that Browder was not required to comply with a subpoena served in Aspen, Colorado, because he "does not live or conduct business transactions regularly in Aspen", but he was required to comply with a subpoena served in New York, where he had been discussing his new book on a television show. He was deposed in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/03/09/federal-judge-orders-browder-to-comply-with-subpoena-in-money-laundering-case/| title=Federal Judge Orders Browder to Comply with Suboena in Money-Laundering Case| author=Nicle Hong| date=March 9, 2015| publisher=The Wall Street Journal| access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://100r.org/media/2017/10/Browder-Deposition-April-15-2015.pdf| title=Videotaped Deposition of William F.

On July 16, 2018, during a joint press conference with President [[Donald Trump]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] stated that Browder had funneled $400 million dollars to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, an effort that involved members of the U.S. intelligence community who, Putin said, "accompanied and guided these transactions." The statement was made after Putin said he would allow special counsel [[Robert Mueller]]'s team to come to Russia for their investigation ‚Äì as long as there was a reciprocal arrangement for Russian intelligence to investigate in the U.S.

Putin: &lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder, in this particular case.  Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia and never paid any taxes neither in Russia or the United States and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent [a] huge amount of money, $400,000,000, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. (Later, the Russian Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office spokesman Alexander Kurennoy clarified that it was not $400 million, but rather $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia ready to send request to US over questionings in Browder case |url=http://tass.com/world/1013707 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=TASS |date=17 July 2018 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Well that‚Äôs their personal case.  It might have been legal, the contribution itself but the way the money was earned was illegal.  So we have solid reason to believe that some [US] intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions.  So we have an interest in questioning them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''[[PolitiFact|Politifact]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' rated Putin's claim about the funding false, noting that there is no evidence to substantiate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/07/16/the-facts-missing-from-trump-and-putins-news-conference/|title=Analysis {{!}} The facts missing from Trump and Putin‚Äôs news conference|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/vladimir-putin/putins-pants-fire-claim-about-400-million-donation/ Vladimir Putin's pants on fire claim abouy $400 million donation] Politifact&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/world/europe/putin-bill-browder-magnitsky-investor.html|title=Who Is Bill Browder, Kremlin Foe Singled Out in Putin‚Äôs Offer?|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Browder, in his own article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', called the accusation "so ludicrous and untrue that it falls into delusion."

The '''Bosavi languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of the [[Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea languages]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]].

The languages, which are closely related (though they may have only 10‚Äì15% of their vocabulary in common), are:
*Bosavi Watershed: [[Kaluli language|Kaluli]]‚Äì[[Sonia language|Sonia]], [[Aimele language|Aimele]] (Kware), [[Kasua language|Kasua]]

[[Dibiyaso language|Dibiyaso]] (Bainapi) is lexically similar, but this appears to be due to loans.  The nearly extinct [[Turumsa language]] was added by ''Ethnologue'' 16, though it has more vocabulary in common with the unclassified [[Doso language]].

'''Brazilians in Nigeria''' consist mostly of descendants of freed [[Afro-Brazilian]] slaves who left Brazil and settled in [[Nigeria]] as well as expatriates from Brazil.

Starting from the 1830s, many [[Emancipation|emancipated]] Africans who had been through [[Slavery in Brazil|forced labour]] and discrimination in Brazil began moving back to Lagos bringing along with them some cultural and social sensibilities adapted from their sojourn in Latin America. These emancipated Africans were often called 'Aguda' or 'Maro' and also included [[Emancipados|returnees]] from Cuba.

==History==
[[File:Negra da Bahia, 1885. Foto de Marc Ferrez.jpg|thumb|Bahia woman, 1885]]
{{Main article|Saro (Nigeria)}}
At the height of the [[Transatlantic slave trade]] in [[West Africa]], many prisoners of war or those kidnapped for sale in slave markets were sold to Europeans and transported across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=4}} Estimates of the number of slaves from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to Brazil totaled about 300,000 in the nineteenth century. The captives disembarked in Bahia before moving further south to work on plantations, assist tradesmen or hawk goods for white Brazilians. But as some gained [[manumission]], earned savings or got deported as a result of racism, waves of African migration back to the West African coast developed. By the middle nineteenth, an Afro-Brazilian community began to emerge along the West African coast, developed by descendants of slaves who had twice crossed the Atlantic, these Africans brought back Afro-Brazilian sensibilities in food, agriculture, architecture and religion.

The first recorded repatriation of African people from Brazil to what is now Nigeria was a government-lead deportation in 1835 in the aftermath of a Yoruba and Hausa led rebellion in the city of Salvador known as the [[Mal√™ Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueiredo|first=Eur√≠dice|year=2009|title=Os Brasileiros Retornados √Åfrica|url=http://www.uff.br/cadernosdeletrasuff/38/artigo3.pdf|journal=Di√°logos Interamericanos n¬∫ 38|volume=|pages=51‚Äì70|via=Cadernos de Letras da UFF|access-date=2016-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304193123/http://www.uff.br/cadernosdeletrasuff/38/artigo3.pdf#|archive-date=2017-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rebellion, the Brazilian government fearful of further insurrection allowed freed or manumitted Africans the option to return home or keep paying an exorbitant tax to the government.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=14}} A few Africans who were free and had saved some money were able to return to Africa as a result of the tough conditions, taxation, racism and homesickness. In 1851, 60 [[Gulf of Guinea|Mina]] Africans to put together $4,000 to charter a vehicle for Badagry.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=14}}

After slavery was abolished in Cuba and Brazil in 1886 and 1888 respectively, further migration to Lagos continued. Many of the returnees chose to return to Nigeria for cultural, missionary and economic reasons. Many of them descended from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. In [[Lagos]], they were given the watery terrains of Popo Aguda as their settlement. By the 1880s, they comprised about 9% of the population of Lagos. Towards the end of 1920, the migration stopped.

Though, coastal Lagos was the preferred destination, most of the returnees were descendants of groups such as Ijeshas, Oyos, Ijebu and Egba based in the interior. The Agudas were aware of their home cities but preferred to set up shop in Lagos because it was conducive for trade, they were warmly received in Badagry and also because of on-going wars in the interior. A ship with Agudas docking in Badagry can be welcomed by crowds of children hailing them as they disembark from the ship.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=20}} In some cases, the Oba gave them land to build a house and provided men to assist them in their transition to local life.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=20}} But [[Lagos]] was different from Bahia, the elder returnees were comfortable but many of the children were foreign to Lagos. They held on to elements of Bahia culture such as Catholicism and formed a close knit community within [[Lagos Island]]. Because of the retention of Catholicism and Western dressing, indigenous Africans called them "black whites" or Agudas.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=30}} Keen on acquiring wealth in Africa, some of the earliest Aguda's were morally ambivalent on issues such as slavery and became slave traders themselves,{{sfn|Otero|2002|p=179}}such as Francisco Felix de Sousa and Domingo Martinez.

===Settlement===
When Agudas arrived from Bahia and Pernambuco they took up residence on the Eastern parts of Lagos, in land provided by [[Idewu Ojulari|Oba Ojulari]].{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=67}} In 1852, this region was demarcated as the Brazilian quarter to be known later known as Popo Aguda. During this time, metropolitan Lagos followed the racial and cultural characteristics evident in the city. The Saros lived in Olowogbowo, a tract of land on the Western corner of Lagos Island, Europeans lived and traded along the long stretch of the Marina and Lagos indigenous Lagosians lived on the Northwestern areas of the island.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=42}} The westernmost corner of Brazilian quarter reached the easternmost parts of Olowogbowo at Tinubu Square while the center of the Brazilian area was Campos Square named after Cuban returnee, Hilario Campos. Other major streets include Bamgbose and Tokunboh. Within the quarters diasporic sensibilities was evident, the community lacked signs of ethnic grouping and fluidity was present in the religious practices of the residents.

Popo Aguda was also the commercial center of trade serving as a distribution center of imported goods.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=48}}

==Culture==
Returnees from Brazil and their present-day descendants were and are more commonly called "Agudas" (from {{lang|pt|agud√£o}}, a non-standard Portuguese word for cotton properly rendered as {{lang|pt|algod√£o}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/features/2016/10/nigeria-brazilian-heritage-threat-161024144110141.html|title=Is Nigeria's Brazilian heritage under threat?|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or "Maro". Most were Catholics but some worshiped African Orishas which they brought from Brazil. Some of the Agudas are also Muslims. Most of them still have [[Portuguese names]]. Some common Portuguese family names in Nigeria include Da Silveira, De Silva, De Souza, and Moreira. In the 1800s, the major distinguishing set of classification was by birth, Aguda's taken captive from West Africa who emigrated back to Lagos were called Papae or Mamae and those who were born in Brazil and then returned were called Yaya or Yayo.

The [[Lagos Treaty of Cession|British annexation of Lagos in 1861]] and the promotion of trade benefited the Brazilian community. Along with the Saros they became a rising bourgeois. They harbored western style of dressing, owned race horses and organized waltzes, square dances and musical soirees where Moli√®re was performed.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=34}} However, with time many began to embrace their heritage and when the children of the returnees were grown they came to embrace Lagos as their home. The annexation of Lagos that sprung up these wealthy class also came with the realisation that the colonists where not leaving soon and any hope of forming a political class was dim. The Brazilians began to cultivate relationships with the traditional authorities in Lagos while some renewed relationships with Africans in the hinterland by supplying them with weapons. Aguda's supplied weapons to the Ijeshas against Ibadan. Beginning in the 1880s, many began to change their names to African ones while the Aurora relief Society was formed to research

Aguda's cuisine in the early 1920s included food considered African in Bahia but considered different from those eaten by indigenes on the Island. They ate pir√£o de caranguejo during holidays and prepared {{lang|pt|[[Canjica (dish)|mungunz√°]]}}, {{lang|pt|mingau}} (porridge) and {{lang|pt|feij√£o-de-leite}} (coconut milk beans) as food staples.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=42}} In agriculture, the returnees also popularized the use of [[Cassava]] as a food crop.&lt;ref&gt;Faluyi p 11,12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguda's celebrated Easter with the coming out of Caretas or masked figures,{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=44}} burrinha at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=44}} and Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Our Lord of the Good End) associated with [[Obatala]] was celebrated during yuletide.

Popo Aguda was a close-knit community and residents were known for their thriftiness and a strong work ethic.{{sfn|Otero|2002|p=200}}

===Religion===
Majority of the Agudas were Catholics but the community had a significant number of Muslim families and those who still adhered to the traditional religion. Religious differences were not as important nor divisive as it was to indigenous Africans and they were comfortable marrying from either religions.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=30}} Prior to the construction of a pro-cathedral, mass was performed in a bamboo building on Broad St, the plot of land where St Mary Convent was later built on. The first priest was Padre Anthonio, he was in charge of the Catholic church before the coming of French missionaries. The practice of baptism was important to the local community and it was also a way to enter the Aguda community.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=30}}

A cathedral, the Holy Cross Pro-Cathedral was completed in 1881, financed by funds from the lay congregation, it was designed to be most significant structure in [[Lagos colony]] when completed.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=48}} Originally built with one tower, a few years later another tower was added with the structure forming a cruciform structure with two towers. The Church was built by Agudas but supervised by French missionaries. Among the builders were the quartet of Francisco Nobre (built of one the towers), Balthazar dos Reis, Jo√£o, da Costa and L√°zaro Borges da Silva (master bricklayer) along with their apprentices, these group also built the old Central Mosque,{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=74}} called Jamiu Central Mosque.

==Trade==
Trade between Lagos and Brazil rose in the 1860s and in 1869, Brazil was the third largest exporter to Lagos, very much behind Britain but ahead of France.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=18}} Returnees in Lagos dominated the trade with Brazil and sold cotton, traditional artifacts and kola-nuts to Africans in Bahia. However, this Transatlantic trade gradually declined and by the beginning of the Twentieth century it was virtually non existent.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=18}} They had pioneered trade with Brazil in the mid nineteenth century but by the 1880s, ruinous competitors and an economic downturn had forced many to abandon the export trade. Agriculture soon became an avenue to supplement shortfalls in economic activity. But before the downturn many traders had acquired wealth and became prominent families within the community in Lagos, patriarchs such as Angelo Campos, Esan da Rocha and Joaquim Branco (originally settled in Dahomey) were able to sponsor their children for further education in Bahia, Havana or Europe. In Bahia, Afro-Brazilians formed the bulk of skilled labor, Aguda returnees brought along trade skills mastered in Bahia and preferred to teach their children a trade or handicraft such as masonry, seamstress, tailoring. But some worked as clerks for the European trading companies. In 1897, of the 96 qualified Aguda artisans listed in a directory, 11 were bricklayers and builders, 6 were cabinet makers, 9 tailors, 21 carpenters, 17 clerks and 24 traders.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=74}} The leading dressmaker in Victorian Lagos was Yaya Clemencia Guinaries.

The Brazilians who engaged in trading of goods also had the benefit of using their connection to their home cities to bypass traditional channels of trade by opening direct routes from Lagos to the interior and ignoring the traditional market cities and middlemen. Apart from trading of goods, investment in properties was also common among the wealthier families.

==Architecture==
[[File:Salvador-CCBY10.jpg|thumb|Baroque style, Bahia]]
Brazilian architecture in Nigeria is a legacy of the thousands of freed slaves who returned to Nigeria in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/26/garden/in-nigeria-touches-of-brazilian-style.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm IN NIGERIA, TOUCHES OF BRAZILIAN STYLE]", ''The New York Times'', 26 March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Trained as carpenters, cabinetmakers, masons and bricklayers in Brazil, the ex-slaves were notably technically skilled [[artisan]]s and were known for their exuberant and individualistic style on doorways, brightly painted facades and chunky concrete columns which are rooted in the baroque styles popular in Brazil in the 18th century.

In early 1800s Lagos, the dominant architectural style was mud houses and houses with stilt using thatched leaves as roofing; these houses were usually divided into compartments to hold the extended family. The residence of the Oba and chiefs were much bigger, they had large courtyards, pillars and arches, a mixture of European and indigenous styles. The European influence took root during the reign of Oba Akinsemoyin who invited Portuguese slavers to Lagos,{{sfn|Otero|2002|p=179}}and the slavers in return renovated his palace using imported bricks for the structure and roofing slates from Portugal. In the 1830s, the migration of emancipated returnees began to change the architectural style. Influenced by the symmetrical plans of the Brazilian colonial house,{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=73}} they introduced a new architectural style to Lagos that was soon embraced by wealthy traders. The Brazilian style of architecture became dominant in Lagos Island by the end of the 19th century. The structure are one storey houses built for middle class residents and others were two or three storeys stuccoed buildings(sobrados) built for wealthier clients. The detached storey buildings conferred prestige on the owner. They were built with shuttered windows,{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=73}} had spaces between the top of the wall and the roof and with a compound. A ground floor usually opens to the street and was sometimes used as a storage, store or housing the helps. The houses were built for a nuclear family in contrast to the extended family structure of early Yoruba architecture.

These style was prominent in old Lagos during the late nineteenth and twentieth century but as the city grew, many of the houses have been remodeled or demolished for bigger houses.{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=6}}

===Historical buildings===
*Hephzhi bar house. This house was completed in 1924, it was the residence of P.H. Williams, a Lagos merchant whose parents traveled back to Africa from Trinidad when he was a young boy. The house is a three storey building designed by [[Herbert Macaulay]]. The front door opens to a large passage that will lead guests to the living room, two adjoining bedrooms were at the sides. A wooden staircase goes upstairs with the same pattern like the floor below but with smaller passages and rooms. The windows are large and are located at both sides of the structure and also at the back of the building.{{sfn|Cunha|Verger|1995|p=30}}

[[File:Parada de Contempla√ß√£o.jpg|thumb|Afro-Brazilian Catholic Church in Bahia]]
*Holy Cross Cathedral. This was the first Catholic Church and the first brick church built in Lagos, construction started in 1878 and it was finally completed in 1880.{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=206}} The appearance of the structure is cruciform with aisle naves, transepts and two towers. Though the Brazilian workers preferred a baroque style, the French missionaries who supervised construction imposed a Gothic style that was used.{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=207}} After many years, the two towers were demolished and the Eastern end was enlarged.
*Water House. This house was built by Joao Esan da Rocha and then expanded by his son, Candido. It was called the water house because Joao Esan dug a well at the backyard which was used to sell pipe water to Lagosians.{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=250}} He wanted the house built in a style similar to the house he lived in Bahia after he gained manumission{{sfn|Alonge|1994|p=250}} The house is Brazilian baroque and was originally built for a nuclear family but structural extensions included in the 1960s accommodated more family members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14578">'''Brown''' or '''brown people''' is a [[race (human categorization)|racial]] and [[ethnic group|ethnic]] term. Like [[black people]] and [[white people]], it is a [[color terminology for race|metaphor for race]] based solely on [[human skin color]]. In [[racialism (racial categorization)|racialist]] ideas, the color brown and the term ''brown people'' were used to describe a series of hypothesized racial groups that included North Africans, The Horn Of Africans, South Asians, Central Asians, Southeast Asians, Eskimos, Native Americans &amp; Latin Americans.&lt;ref name="Stoddard"&gt;[[Lothrop Stoddard]], ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], brown people is a term for ''[[pardo]]''.

== Racialist models ==
{{See also|Race (historical definitions)|Scientific racism|Color terminology for race}}
In the 18th and 19th century, [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialist]] written works proposed geographically based "scientific" differences among "the races." Many of these racial models assigned colors to the groups described, and some included a "brown race" as in the following:

* Early German anthropologist [[Johann Blumenbach]] extended Linnaeus' four-color race model by adding the brown race, "[[Malay race]]", which included both the Malay division of Austronesian ([[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Pattani]], [[Sumatra]], [[Madagascar]], [[Formosa]]ns, etc.) and [[Polynesians]] and [[Melanesians]] of [[Pacific Islands]], as well as [[Papuans]] and [[Aborigines of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Staging Tourism: Bodies on Display from Waikiki to Sea World|author=Jane Desmond|year=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-14376-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethiopia and the Origin of Civilization: A Critical Review of the Evidence of Archaeology,...|author=John G. Jackson|pages=|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=The Blyden Society|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1775, "John Hunter of Edinburg included under the label light brown, Southern Europeans, Sicilians, Abyssinians, the Spanish, Persians, Turks and Laplanders, and under the label brown, Tartars, Africans on the Mediterranean and the Chinese."&lt;ref name=Bernasconi&gt;Bernasconi, Robert. &lt;u&gt;Race&lt;/u&gt; Blackwell Publishing: Boston, 2001.  {{ISBN|0-631-20783-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy]]'s five-race scheme differed from Blumenbach's by including [[Ethiopia]]ns in the brown race, as well as Oceanic peoples. [[Louis Figuier]] adopted and adapted d'Omalius d'Halloy's classification and also included [[Egyptians]] in the brown race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Equality of the Human Races|author=Joseph-Ant√©nor Firmin and Antenor Firmin|others=Asselin Charles (translator) and Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban (contributor)|year=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-07102-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1915, Donald Mackenzie conceived a "''Mediterranean or Brown race, the eastern branch of which reaches to India and the western to the [[British Isles]]&lt;!--p.7--&gt;... [and includes] [[predynastic Egypt]]ians... [and some populations of] [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic man]]&lt;!--p.15--&gt;''"&lt;!--p.7--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Donald A. &lt;u&gt;Myths of Babylonia and Assyria&lt;/u&gt; Montana:Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-7643-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stoddard race map 1920.jpg|thumb|Global racial map by [[eugenicist]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] in ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'', 1920.]]
* [[Eugenicist]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] in his ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' (1920) mapped a "brown race" as native to [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Austronesia]] ([[Malay race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.understandingrace.org/history/science/early_class.html|title=Early Classification of Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=Understanding Race.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Stoddard's "brown" is one of five "primary races", contrasting with "white", "black", "yellow" and "Amerindian".&lt;ref name="Stoddard"/&gt;
* Due to what he considered the relatively close physical relationship between many populations "from the Red Sea as far as India, including [[Semitic people|Semites]] as well as [[Hamitic|Hamites]]", [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] conceived the Brown Race as a natural extension of [[Giuseppe Sergi]]'s earlier [[Mediterranean race]] concept. In this popular conception, the Brown Race consisted of a joint "Mediterranean-Hamite-Semite" grouping of ancestrally related peoples, into which Elliot Smith included the Proto-Egyptians.&lt;ref name=Keane&gt;{{cite book|last=A. H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin|first=A. C. Haddon|title=Man: Past and Present|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521234107|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These and other racialist theories have been dismissed scientifically. As a 2012 human biology textbook observes, "These claims of race-based taxonomy, including Coon's claims for homo-sapienation, have been discredited by paleontological and genomic research showing the antiquity of modern human origins, as well as the essential genomic African nature of all living human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 9780123838827 | last = Cameron | first = Noel |author2=Barry Bogin | title = Human Growth and Development | date = 2012-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subdivisions ===
In the 19th century, the notion of a single "brown people" was sometimes superseded by multiple "brown peoples."  Cust mentions Grammar in 1852 denying that there was one single "brown race", but in fact several races speaking distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies|author=Robert Needham Cust|year=1878|publisher=Tr√ºbner &amp; co.|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1858 ''Cyclopaedia of India and of eastern and southern Asia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Asiatica, Comprising Indian Subcontinent, Eastern and Southern Asia|author=Edward Balfour|year=1976|publisher=Cosmo Publications|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Keane was dividing the "brown people" into quaternion: a western branch that he termed the Malay, a north-western group that he termed the Micronesian, and the peoples of the eastern archipelagos that he termed the Maori and the Polynesian.

== Ethnic and racial identifier ==
The appellation "brown people" has been applied in the 20th and 21st centuries to several groups. Edward Telles, a sociologist of race and ethnicity, and Jack Forbes&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt; both argue that this classification is biologically invalid. However, as Telles notes, it is still of sociological significance.  Irrespective of the actual biological differences amongst humans, and of the actual complexities of [[human skin color]]ation, people nonetheless self-identify as "brown" and identify other groups of people as "brown", using characteristics that include skin color, hair strength, language, and culture, in order to classify them.

Forbes remarks upon a process of "lumping", whereby characteristics other than skin color, such as hair color or curliness, act as "triggers" for color categories "even when it may not be appropriate."&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telles"&gt;{{cite book|pages=81‚Äì84|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|author=Edward Eric Telles|chapter=Racial Classification|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity in South Africa ===
{{Main|Coloureds}}
In 1950s (and later) [[South Africa]] the "brown people" were the [[Coloureds]], referring to those born of multiracial sexual unions out of wedlock. They were distinct from the [[Basters|Reheboth Basters]] inhabiting [[Namibia]], who were primarily of [[Khoisan]] and [[Europe]]an parentage. The [[Afrikaans]] terms, which incorporate many subtleties of heritage, political agenda, and identity, are "[[wikt:bruin|bruin]]" ("brown"), "[[wikt:bruines|bruines]]" ("browns"), and "[[wikt:brynmense|bruinmense]]" ("brown people"). Some South Africans prefer the appellation "bruinmense" to "Colored".&lt;ref name=Adhikari&gt;{{cite book|title=Not White Enough, Not Black Enough: Racial Identity in the South African Colored Community|author=Mohamed Adhikari|pages=26,163‚Äì169|year=2005|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0-89680-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in South Africa|author=Gerald L. Stone|chapter=The lexicon and sociolinguistic codes of the working-class Afrikaans-speaking Cape Peninsula colored community|editor=Rajend Mesthrie|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53383-X|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African [[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]] was one example of a characteristic other than skin color being used as a determiner. The pencil test, which distinguished either "black" from "Colored" or "Colored" from "white", relied upon curliness and strength of hair (i.e. whether it was capable of retaining a pencil under its own strength) rather than upon any color factor at all.  The pencil test could "trump skin color".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twilight People: From Mississippi to South Africa and Back|author=David Houze|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24398-6|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making and Unmaking of Whiteness|author=Birgit Brander Rasmussen|year=2001|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2740-6|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Biko]], in his trial in 1976, rejected the appellation "brown people" when it was put to him incorrectly by Judge Boshoff:&lt;ref name=Oakes&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Groups and Identities: developing the legacy of Henri Tajfe|editor=W. P. (William Peter) Robinson and Henri Tajfel|author=Penelope Oakes|chapter=The Categorization Process: Cognition and the Group in the Social Psychology of Stereotyping|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7506-3083-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Boshoff''': But now why do you refer to you people as blacks?  Why not brown people?  I mean you people are more brown than black.
:'''Biko''': In the same way as I think white people are more pink and yellow and pale than white.
:'''Boshoff''': Quite ... but now why do you not use the word brown then?
:'''Biko''': No, I think really, historically, we have been defined as black people, and when we reject the term non-white and take upon ourselves the right to call ourselves what we think we are, we have got available in front of us a whole number of alternatives ... and we choose this one precisely because we feel it is most accommodating.

Penelope Oakes&lt;ref name=Oakes /&gt; characterizes Biko's argument as picking "black" over "brown" because for Biko it is "the most valid, meaningful and appropriate representation, ''even though'' in an individualistic decontextualized sense it might appear wrong" (Oakes' emphasis).

This contrasts with Piet Uithalder, fictional protagonist of the satirical column "Straatpraatjes" (whose actual author was never revealed but who is believed to have been Abdullah Abdurahman)  that appeared in the Dutch-Afrikaans section of the newspaper ''APO'' between May 1909 and February 1922.  Uithalder would self-identify as a Colored person, with the column targeted at a Colored readership, introducing himself as "een van de ras" ("a member of the race") and characterizing himself as a "bruine mens".&lt;ref name=Adhikari /&gt;

=== Pardos in Brazil ===
{{Main|Pardo Brazilians}}

In popular use, Brazilians also use a category of ''[[wikt:moreno|moreno]]'' m. {{IPA|[moÀà…æenu]}}, ''[[wikt:morena|morena]]'' f. {{IPA|[moÀà…æen…ê]}}, lit. '[[wikt:swarthy|swarthy]]', from ''[[wikt:mouro|mouro]]'', Portuguese for '[[Moors|Moor]]', which were perceived as people with darker phenotypes than Indigenous Europeans, so a ''moreno'' or ''morena'' is a person with a "Moorish" phenotype), which is extremely ambiguous, as it can mean "dark-haired people", but is also used as a euphemism for ''pardo'', and even "Black". In a 1995 survey, 32% of the population self-identified as ''moreno'', with a further 6% self-identifying as ''moreno claro'' ("light moreno"). 7% self-identified as "pardo".&lt;ref name="Telles" /&gt;

A comprehensive study presented by the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research found that on average, 'white' Brazilians have &gt;70% European genomic ancestry, whereas 'black' Brazilians have 37.1% European genomic ancestry. It concluded that "The high ancestral variability observed in Whites and Blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes. Thus, the only possible basis to deal with genetic variation in Brazilians is not by considering them as members of color groups, but on a person-by-person basis, as 190 million human beings,with singular genome and life histories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-879X2009005000026&amp;script=sci_arttext#Abstract |title=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research&amp;nbsp;‚Äì DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians |publisher=Scielo.br |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7540">'''CEC European Managers''' (also called "European confederation of executives &amp; managers staff") is a European organisation that promotes and defends the interest of managers in Europe towards the European institutions.

Through its national member organisations and professional federations it represents around 1 million managers in Europe.

CEC European Managers is one of the six cross-industry European social partners recognised by the European Commission and takes part in the European Social Dialogue.

CEC European Managers'office is based in the European quarter of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cec-managers.org/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

== CEC history ==

Managers were among the first to understand the importance of organizing themselves on an international level.
In 1951 the French, German and Italian executive federations formed the CIC (International Confederation of Managers). In order to participate more actively in the European social dialogue and to be able to have a political influence on the unification process, this international federation founded the European one in 1989.

CEC European Managers now unites around 1 million executives, managers and professionals in Europe, through its national organisations and European federations.
Since the late 1980s, CEC European Managers has been making its genuine and positive contribution as a social partner to the European integration.

Since the [[Maastricht Treaty]], CEC has become an interlocutor for the [[European Commission]] and is consulted on new legislative initiatives.

Since July 1999 CEC European Managers is part of the employee delegation in the negotiations under the social protocol representing the interests of its members in these negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cec-managers.org/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
According to CEC European Managers, their mission can be described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cec-managers.org/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

- to strive for European integration;
- to contribute to find a balance between the economic performance of enterprises and income and social protection for the workforce. We raise awareness about the fact that managers and workers need different degrees of security and flexibility;
- to express and defend the needs and opinions of European managers on current topics such as sustainable development, environmental protection, active ageing, energy self-sufficiency, lifelong learning, active ageing, equal opportunities or diversity.
- to provide relevant knowledge to managers and policy makers at the cutting edge of leadership and policy research. We take a holistic approach integrating public and private management principles as well as different research traditions;
- to contribute to strengthen the quality of European management practices by providing best practices and raising awareness;
- to contribute to the debate on the future of public policies from a managerial point of view

==Managers in Europe and in the World==
Though legally considered as employees, managers are expected to take over management‚Äôs responsibility for the workers and for the development of the company.
Managers assume essential duties which involve responsibilities, competences and professionalism in the management and implementation of corporate and institutional objectives. Leaders of this type share common sociological characteristics and interests. This is why the European Parliament expressly supported managers‚Äô entitlement to a separate and independent representation not only on national but also on European level. This group of employees is steadily increasing with the continuing development of information and communications technologies and of new forms of labour organisation.

The '''Charan''' are a [[Caste system in India|caste]] living in the [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]] states of India.

== Social structure ==
Charans are similar to [[Rajput]]s and follow same style of living. In ancient and medieval times Charans were treated as Gods where as the Rajputs were the kings. Many deities were born into Charans such as Avad, Karni and the famous Khodiyar. For centuries they are well known for their excellence in bravery and for deep literary sense. The Charans are also known as Deviputras ( sons of Godesses).Members of the caste are considered to be divine by a large section of society. Women of the caste are adored as mother goddesses by other major communities of this region, including [[Rajput]]s.&lt;ref name="Shah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah |first1=A.

A Charan will consider all the other Charans as equal even if they do not know each other and have radically different economic or geographic status.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomson, G. R.|title=Charans of Gujarat: Caste Identity, Music and Cultural Change|journal= Ethnomusicology| volume=35| issue=3| pages=381‚Äì391|year=1991|doi=10.2307/851968|jstor=851968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anil Chandra Banerjee, a professor of history, has said that {{quote|In them we have a combination of the traditional characteristics of the Brahmin and the Kshatriyas. Like the Brahmins, they adopted literary pursuits and accepted gifts. Like the Rajput, they worshipped Shakti, drank liquor, took meat and engaged in military activities. They stood at the front gate of the fort to receive the first blow of the sword.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Banerjee |first=Anil Chandra.|title=Aspects of Rajput State and Society |pages=124‚Äì125 |year=1983|oclc = 12236372}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Banerjee's opinion is shared by another historian, G. N. Sharma, who said that {{quote|Charans exercise great respectability and influence in Rajasthan. The speciality of the caste is that it combines in its character the characteristics of Rajputs and Brahmans in an adequate manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sharma |first=G.

=== Food and drink ===
Their eating and drinking habits resemble those of the Rajputs. Charans used to enjoy consumption of [[opium]] and drinking of liquor, practices which are also popular among the Rajputs of this region.&lt;ref name="khushwantsingh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=We Indians|publisher=Orient Paperbacks |location=Delhi |year=1982 |oclc=10710940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charans do not eat the flesh of cows, and hold those who do in utter disregard. Cows are respected like mothers. A husband and wife will not drink milk from the same cow, as drinking milk from one mother (cow) symbolises that those who do so should be considered as siblings. Before Indian independence in 1947, a sacrifice of a male buffalo constituted a major part of the celebration of [[Navratri]].&lt;ref name="harlan"&gt;{{cite book | author = Harlan L |title =Goddesses' Henchmen - Gender in Hero Worship |publisher = Oxford University Press |place = USA |pages =258| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such celebrations quite often used to be presided over by Charan woman.&lt;ref name=Matanamadh&gt;{{cite web

'''Corruption in Afghanistan''' is a widespread and growing problem in Afghan society. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 177th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In opinion surveys of Afghans," noted the Asia Foundation in a 2012 report, "corruption is consistently singled out as a problem."&lt;ref name="asia"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Growing Challenge of Corruption in Afghanistan |publisher=Asia Foundation |url=https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/FNLcorruptionchapterOccasionalPaperJuly30.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the recent major corruption cases was the 2010‚Äì13 [[New Kabul Bank|Kabul Bank]] financial scandal involving [[Mahmood Karzai]] and others close to President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The Kabul Bank scandal, crisis, investigation and trial involved [[Sherkhan Farnood]], [[Khalilullah Fruzi]], [[Mohammed Fahim]], and other insiders who were allegedly spending the bank's US$1 billion for their  personal lavish living style as well as lending money under the table to family, friends, and those close to President Hamid Karzai and Mahmood Karzai.&lt;ref name="Filkins"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/world/asia/03kabul.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Depositors Panic Over Bank Crisis in Afghanistan|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2010-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-03}} {{cite news|url=http://www.uspolicyinabigworld.com/2012/06/12/how-they-robbed-kabul-bank/|title=How They Robbed Kabul Bank|last=Huffman|first=Michael|newspaper=|date=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, the government only recovered $180 million of the $980 million fraudulent loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/10/01/problems-recovery-kabul-bank-loans-delawari |title=Problems in recovery of Kabul Bank loans: Delawari |editor=Weda Barak |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[United Nations|U.N.]] survey listed corruption and insecurity as the two issues of greatest concern to Afghans as of 2012. The ''[[New York Times]]'' has written that in Afghanistan, "corruption can no longer be described as a cancer on the system: It is the system."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The U.S. Agency for International Development stated in 2009 that corruption in Afghanistan had "become pervasive, entrenched, systemic, and by all accounts now unprecedented in scale and reach."&lt;ref name="progr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2015/03/17/108613/tackling-corruption-in-afghanistan-its-now-or-never/|title=Tackling Corruption in Afghanistan: It‚Äôs Now or Never|date=Mar 17, 2015|publisher=[[Center for American Progress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 survey by the [[Asia Foundation]], Afghans said corruption was their "third biggest problem (21%) after insecurity (35%) and unemployment (23%)." In 2010 and 2011, they said corruption was their second most important reason for feeling pessimistic about Afghanistan (16% in 2011 and 27% in 2010). In 2011, they identified administrative corruption as the government's second most important failure (25%). This marked an improvement over 2010, when the figure was 30%.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

In Afghanistan today, corruption most often takes the form of demanding and offering bribes, both in the private and public sectors and on large and small scales. There are also many other major forms of corruption, including [[nepotism]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and illegal land transfers. The US [[Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction]] (SIGAR) has estimated that over half of the nation's annual customs revenue is lost to graft.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

In a 2015 article, Parag R. Dharmavarapu noted that while Afghanistan‚Äôs [[GDP]] had quintupled since 2002, the society remained riddled with corruption. "What is extremely disconcerting about corruption in Afghanistan," wrote Dharmavarapu, "is not simply the number or value of bribes that take place; instead, it is the endemic nature of corruption within the Afghan government". Routinely, noted Dharmavarapu, "police officers extort goods from shopkeepers, levy taxes on vehicles at highway checkpoints, and impose fines on individuals unable to produce proper identification documents." Some police officers "turn a blind eye to or even collude with criminals and insurgents," while mid- to high-level police officials "collaborate with criminals in smuggling, kidnapping for ransom and other illegal activities, collecting thousands of dollars in the process." Top police officials "have siphoned millions of dollars from international donors to their own pockets." The most common types of corruption in Afghanistan, according to Dharmavarapu, are:
* Petty bribery ‚Äì Asking for small gifts (baksheesh) in exchange for special treatment or favors
* Position buying ‚Äì Awarding opportunities in the police force, judiciary or civil service based on bribes as opposed to merit
* Nepotism/clientelism ‚Äì Awarding positions based on personal relationship/kinship networks rather than merit
* Offering and asking for preferential treatment ‚Äì This includes giving bribes to expedite the processing of business documents or access to government-owned land
* Grand corruption ‚Äì Corruption that involves political elites on a large scale
* National police and law enforcement graft&lt;ref name=stud&gt;{{cite web |last=Dharmavarapu |first=Parag R. |title=Corruption and Graft in Post-Conflict Afghanistan |work=Student Pulse |url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/1057/4/corruption-and-graft-in-post-conflict-afghanistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOOAC), corruption is rampant in the north of the country, particularly, [[Balkh Province]] which borders neighboring [[Uzbekistan]], a country with similar corruption problems.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results|title=2012 Corruption Perceptions Index -- Results|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the worst manifestations of graft is illegal [[land grabbing]]. Shamsullah Javed, HOOAC head for the northern zone, in an exclusive interview with [[Pajhwok Afghan News]], explained that "in Balkh, there are three kinds of encroachment on land: One government department seizing the property of another, [[Afghan National Security Forces|security forces]] occupying government land and individuals taking unlawful possession of people's land." He revealed that 52 out of 60 housing schemes in Balkh were executed illegally. "Government servants, from top to bottom, are involved in the scourge ... Some people, whose interests are hurt by investigations into corruption cases, are creating problems for us," Javed said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/10/13/corruption-rampant-balkh-hooac |title=Corruption rampant in Balkh: HOOAC |editor=Zabihullah Ihsas |newspaper=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |date=October 13, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist [[Sibel Edmonds]] has undertaken efforts as a journalist and whistleblower to raise awareness about corruption in Afghanistan and waste, fraud and abuse involving billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers' money lost to corruption and corrupt officials in Afghanistan following the U.S. intervention.

"The great challenge to Afghanistan's future isn't the Taliban, or the Pakistani safe havens or even an incipiently hostile Pakistan," Gen. [[John R. Allen]] told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee in 2014. "The existential threat to the long-term viability of modern Afghanistan is corruption." He stated that the insurgency, criminal patronage networks, and drug traffickers had formed "an unholy alliance".&lt;ref name=wat&gt;{{cite web |last=Swarts |first=Philip |title=Afghanistan corruption still severe problem, U.S. watchdog says |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=May 14, 2014 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/14/afghanistan-corruption-still-severe-problem-us-wat/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Center for American Progress]] has attributed corruption in Afghanistan to decades of conflict that have prevented the formation of effective state institutions and civil society groups, to laws and regulations that are poorly enforced, to anti-corruption agencies that often contradict one another and lack resources, and to the fact that soldiers and police are often illiterate and public employees often underpaid and undertrained. Decades of constant warfare, moreover, allow public officials to fill their private accounts with government funds. Also, tribal and ethnic traditions encourage people to use their positions to benefit relatives.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt; Afghanistan's official institutions are riddled with incompetence, compelling rural folk to "rely on networks of regional and local power-holders to maintain order and provide basic services."&lt;ref name=stud/&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]], Afghan traditions of patronage have resulted in a constant tampering of merit-based appointments to public positions, presidential staff, member in Parliament, military commanders, and any position relating to political influence‚Äîall of which has resulted in massive corruption, which has been exacerbated by massive foreign assistance and a narcotics trade so large that it has warped the Afghan economy.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

After the U.S. overthrew the [[Taliban]] in 2001, corruption, which had been common in pre-Taliban Afghanistan, once again became a major feature of Afghan life, spreading to virtually every branch of the government and even to regional localities.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt; A broad network of political elites tied to President [[Hamid Karzai]] positioned themselves as middlemen between Western officials and donors, on the one hand, and ordinary Afghans, on the other, using these positions to divert billions of dollars in foreign aid and investment to their private accounts and those of their allies. This resulted in several high-profile scandals, notably the Kabul Bank crisis in which revelations were made that the largest financial institution in the country had been operating as a [[Ponzi scheme]] at the benefit of the elite few tied to Karzai.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt;

A February 2014 [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report charged the U.S. government with upholding a government that is enveloped in corruption in Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion through its support for warlords, its reliance on private trucking contracts, and its provision of billions of aid dollars. Initially, the U.S. supported existing patronage networks and gave some warlords government positions. This legitimization of warlords allowed them to begin using their official power to embezzle public resources. Also, because large amounts of official resources were diverted to the post-war rebuilding effort, many government workers found themselves severely underpaid and felt obliged to take bribes in order to survive.&lt;ref name=stud/&gt;

"Corruption directly threatens the viability and legitimacy of the Afghan state," said the Pentagon report, which stated that American forces found themselves engulfed in regional warlord corruption and protection rackets. According to report, the nation lacked any pre-existing resources to combat corruption, owing in part to late intelligence of Afghan corruption, a lack of physical security, and a lack of the international community's will to address the issues at hand. The report stated that after the 2001 invasion the U.S. had "empowered" warlords by putting them into government posts, which they were able to exploit to appropriate government resources and form corruption networks. Karzai was dependent on these warlords, who were essential to both business and politics in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Capaccio |first=Tony |title=Afghanistan Corruption Fostered by U.S., Pentagon Finds |publisher=Bloomberg |date=Apr 30, 2014 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-29/afghanistan-corruption-fostered-by-u-s-pentagon-found}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Asia Foundation]] stated in 2012 that the widespread corruption in Afghanistan is not culturally ingrained in the Afghan people, noting that the average Afghan consider current levels of corruption as much greater than in decades past, and believe that corruption was worse under Hamid Karzai, who was acting president and then president between 2001 and 2010, than under the five previous regimes.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt; One reason why some Afghans liked, and still like, the Taliban, despite its violence and brutality, was that it promised a relief from the graft and injustice practiced by [[mujahideen]] warlords.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;  The Asia Foundation added that the perceived root of corruption in the nation had changed during the previous five years. Earlier, most Afghans believed that corruption was due to low salaries of civil servants, whereas currently it is attributed to a lack of sanctions and a lack of competent law enforcement.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt;

==Attitudes toward corruption==
On the one hand, Afghans criticize corruption; on the other hand, they increasingly accept patronage and bribery as inevitable and even legitimate parts of daily life. A [[United Nations|UN]] study found that in 2012, 68% of Afghans found it acceptable for civil servants to bolster their salary by charging bribes to service users. This represented an increase from 42% in 2009. Also, 67% found it acceptable for at least some civil servants to be hired because of family ties and friendship networks. (This rose from 42% in 2009.)&lt;ref name=unod&gt;{{cite web |title=Corruption in Afghanistan |publisher=UNODC |url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/frontpage/Corruption_in_Afghanistan_FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asia Foundation's 2011 survey "shows that while Afghans associate democracy with general freedom, they do not associate it with less corruption, more rights, laws, and more inclusive government." On the contrary, they feel that democracy and the free market result in chaos and higher risk for ordinary Afghans while the already-powerful are provided with additional opportunities. The feeling of injustice that results from widespread corruption reportedly strengthens support for terrorists.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt;

==Forms of corruption==
Afghans have identified over 70 types of corruption that affect them personally, "ranging from public administration and elected bodies to private sector, international aid, and the Taliban." Afghans identify corruption mostly with government institutions but have experienced it in many sectors.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt;

===Bribery===
Bribes must be paid in Afghanistan to secure most public services.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt; A UN study shows that the completion of public services is reliant almost solely on bribes paid and has resulted in a severe hampering of economic growth.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt; Petty bribery has been the leading cause of distress among the average citizens of Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=sandi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/may/31/afghan-police-corruption-beat/|title=Corruption enemy No. 1 for Afghan police|first=Gretel C.|last=Kovach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is generally only the high-level corruption cases that are reported in major media.&lt;ref name=redtape&gt;{{cite web |last=Sieff |first=Kevin |title=To cut Afghan red tape, bribing is the norm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=Feb 17, 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/to-cut-afghan-red-tape-bribing-is-the-norm/2013/02/17/93fc708e-6eff-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors, teachers, judges, and customs officials are the most likely public employees to receive bribes. The average bribe to prosecutors and judges is over US$300. Bribes to other officials are somewhat lower. In 85% of cases, bribes are directly or indirectly requested by public officials; in 13% of cases, they are offered spontaneously by citizens. Some officials request bribes through intermediaries.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt; According to the U.N., 50 percent of Afghans paid bribes in 2012; in some parts of the country, the figure was as high as 70 percent. Half of Afghans had bribed teachers, with similar numbers paying bribes to customs officials, judges, and prosecutors. A somewhat smaller number had bribed land registry officials and provincial officers.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt; The bribing of judges declined significantly between 2009 and 2012. The percentage of persons paying bribes to teachers climbed from 16% in 2009 to 51% in 2012.  Doctors, nurses, and paramedics account for 15 to 20% of bribes.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt;

In 2013, 43% of Afghans viewed civil servants and bureaucrats as corrupt, while 58% said they paid a bribe to Registry and Permit Services, 44% to Tax Revenue and 40% to Land Services. In 2012, half of Afghans bribed customs officials. The bribing of customs and tax and revenue officers rose between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt; In 52% of Afghan households, at least one member has applied for a public sector job, and 45% paid bribes to help secure the jobs.&lt;ref name=stud /&gt;

While almost 30% of Afghans paid bribes to secure private-sector services in 2012, 50% did so to secure public-sector services. Public-sector bribery is more prevalent in western and northeastern Afghanistan and less in the southern and central regions.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt;

By far the most common motive for bribery is the desire to facilitate or hasten the delivery of a public service (59.4%). Other motives include the desire to reduce the cost of a procedure (10.6%), to avoid paying a fine (13.3%), and to receive improved treatment (6.7%). Most cases, states a 2012 UN report, involve bribes for better or faster services, while other bribes are made to influence court cases and legal decisions, thus undermining the rule of law. It was reported that 24% of bribes offered to the police were for the express purpose of releasing imprisoned suspects or to avoid imprisonment altogether.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt;

According to a UN report, administrative bribery places the greatest economic hardship on regular Afghan citizens and their families.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt;

===Education system===
The chief form of corruption in the education sector involves so-called "[[No-show job|ghost teachers]]" and double-registered teachers. Anything involving paperwork in the educational system requires small bribes.&lt;ref name=asia /&gt;

A ''SIGAR'' report stated that senior officials at the Ministry of Education had intentionally falsified data on the number of schools and teachers in the nation in order to over-bill international aid providers. As a result, millions of US taxpayer dollars have been used to pay for nonexistent schools and teachers, and enriching the dishonest education officials in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=perils&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perils of corruption in Afghanistan |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=Jun 24, 2015 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/perils-corruption-afghanistan-150623074926689.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2012 article in ''Gulf Today'' explored the fact that in many Afghan schools there are many no-show teachers, teachers who know nothing about their subjects, and teachers who cannot even read or write. Only 20% of funds budgeted for teachers' salaries in one province went to actual teachers; the rest went to local security or education officials who receive the "ghost teacher's" salary in their place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammad Hassan: Millions spent on no-show teachers in Afghanistan |work=[[Gulf Today]] |date=Feb 28, 2012 |url=http://gulftoday.ae/portal/fc061a1c-2df1-48b2-8943-b338c0f33d97.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft in customs system===
A December 2014 report focused on graft within the customs system. Although many experts identified such graft as a primary cause of the government's shortfall of revenue goals the previous year, it was noted that little had been done thus far to address the problem. Customs agents were identified as the most glaring offenders, with the report noting that they in most circumstances appointed by ministers with the express understanding that financial kickbacks are to be given for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mohseni |first=Geeti |title=Experts Say Customs Agents Are Main Source of Corruption |newspaper=[[Tolo News]] |date=Dec 17, 2014 |url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/17509-experts-say-customs-agents-are-main-source-of-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash smuggling===
The ''Washington Post'' reported in December 2012 that the US had provided the Afghan government with bulk currency counters at airports to help prevent cash smuggling. In response, the Afghan government provided a way for VIPs to bypass the machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Karen |title=U.S. finds Afghan anti-corruption effort 'deeply troubling' |work=Washington Post |date=Dec 11, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-finds-afghan-anti-corruption-efforts-deeply-troubling/2012/12/11/e0c57b80-43b3-11e2-8061-253bccfc7532_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepotism and patronage===
Outside observers have noted that the Afghan people view what Westerners consider "favoritism" or "nepotism" as the right thing to do, since they believe themselves to be taking care of their extended family. "You take care of your own. Period. It just happens that when you do that with public funds and positions, people tend to get a little persnickety about it. While admitting that they would do the exact same thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corruption! Its How We Roll! |work=Marketing Time |url=https://markingtimelivingwar.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/corruption-its-how-we-roll/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asia Foundation describes the central route of growing corruption in Afghanistan as the strength of patronage politics in the country. While patronage is a centuries-long Afghan tradition, it is now an integral part of the society, and its entanglement with criminal activities is a growing concern. Because of patronage, people without connections have great difficulty rising within the Afghan government. While corrupt officials enjoy impunity, honest officials are often denied access to powerful positions.&lt;ref name=asia /&gt;

===Judicial corruption===
According to surveys by both Transparency International and the U.N., Afghans consider the judiciary their society's most corrupt segment.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt;

Judicial corruption is said to be an endemic problem in the country that affects every level of the legal system. "From granting judicial access and selecting the deposition of cases to extorting money from defendants for favorable decisions, corrupt justices are able to line their pockets with hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes." Judges are subject to the influence of warlords, terrorists, and others; most judges are appointed as the result of "under-the-table deals," and are largely unqualified by all legal standards. Interviews carried out in 2013 with people who had lost lawsuits indicated that the winning party had bribed the court. Judges and prosecutors are believed to accept bribes to bar a case from going to court, making evidence and witnesses vanish from court evidence. There is no oversight of courts by other government branches and no transparency in Supreme Court decisions.&lt;ref name=stud/&gt;

====Zahoruddin case====
In December 2012, a senior judge named Zahoruddin was convicted of seeking to extort bribes from Dewa, a 22-year-old freelance journalist, who had filed for divorce. After she had refused to bribe him, he offered to marry her in exchange for granting the divorce. Dewa secretly recorded the entire conversation, and sent the tape to the Supreme Court. After a case was brought against Zahoruddin, she received a death threat from him. His conviction was described by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a rare victory in the struggle against corruption in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No Love Lost: Afghan Woman Exposes Corrupt Judge's Unusual Offer |publisher=Radio Free Europe |date=Dec 8, 2015 |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-corruption-marriage-proposal-judge-recording/24805874.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ishaqza case====
In 2014, a leading opium trafficker, Haji Lal Jan Ishaqzai, was arrested in Afghanistan by the Counter Narcotics Police, but he soon was freed in exchange for bribes. It was almost a week until the Afghan counternarcotics authorities in Kabulwas informed that Ishaqzai was freed, reported the ''New York Times''. He fled to [[Pakistan]] where he was beyond the scope of Afghan or American law enforcement. Several judicial officials were arrested, and some sources said that the Supreme Court was directly involved in letting Ishaqzai go, but it was unclear who exactly was responsible for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Joseph |title=Bribery Frees a Drug Kingpin in Afghanistan, Where Cash Often Overrules Justice |work=New York Times |date=Dec 31, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/asia/bribes-free-drug-kingpin-in-afghanistan-where-cash-often-overrules-justice.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption at traffic stops===
Corruption in Afghanistan's traffic department, according to a February 2013 article in the ''Washington Post'', is among the worst of the nation's fledging bureaucracies. Vehicle registration requires 27 separate signatures. A new driver's license calls for "about a dozen stamps from ministries, agencies and banks." These requirements have led to the formation of a black market that involves the bribing of public officials in order to expedite traffic documents. "It's corruption in $30 or $40 bites‚Äîfar from the millions allegedly stolen here every year," stated the ''Post''. However, these bribes have warped the perception Afghans hold on their nation's institutions. The ''Post'' quoted an official who earns $10,000 annually on such corruption, who stated that the corrupt system is disadvantageous for everyone, including many of those involved in the scheme. The department's red tape has earned it the reputation as the most exploitive one in the government, stated the Post.&lt;ref name=redtape /&gt;

A May 2014 article about corruption at traffic stops, told the story of U.S. Army Col. John Graham, deputy leader of [[NATO]]'s Regional Command-Capital, who was asked by Lt. Col. Farhad Safi, an "idealistic, young police commander in charge of a 'ring of steel' of traffic checkpoints cordoning central Kabul against car bombers and suicide attacks," to help arrange for security cameras and thus prevent bribery at those checkpoints.&lt;ref name=sandi /&gt;

===Illegal land transfers===
One form of corruption that has come to the fore since 2001 is the confiscation of land. In 2003, slum dwellings in the Sherpoor neighborhood of Kabul were destroyed and replaced by residences for cabinet members. Similar actions have followed. Land has been illegally distributed by the executive to political elites in order to win their allegiance. More than 80% of new land in Kabul was distributed under the auspices of Afghan elites and high officials. Ex-warlords have made money illicitly in a range of fields and then laundered it by purchasing real estate.&lt;ref name=asia /&gt;

===Physical infrastructure===
Corruption is common in the physical infrastructure sector, and involves criminal patronage networks. The construction business involves hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bribes that benefit a massive network.&lt;ref name=asia /&gt;

===Police===
The Afghan National Police (ANP) are considered notoriously corrupt. The Ministry of the Interior has been criticized for "failing to properly account for billions of dollars allocated for police salaries via a U.N.-administered trust fund." Corruption robs police officers of up to half of their salaries, which makes them more likely to solicit bribes. A 2012 Asia Foundation survey found that over half of Afghans who had dealt with an ANP officer during the previous year had been forced to pay a bribe.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt;

Beginning in 2009, policemen in parts of Afghanistan began to be paid through their cell phones, which prevented their superiors from skimming off part of their wages. According to ''MIT Technology Review'', the bribes had been so immense that on their first pay period on the phone system, the police officers believed they had received a pay raise, when in fact they were simply receiving their full pay without any administrative bribes or extortion taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427267/cashing-out-of-corruption/|title=Cashing Out of Corruption|first=Jessica|last=Leber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters reported in August 2011 that "an expanding dossier of unresolved police violence and corruption cases ... have alienated Afghans," and that this called into question the feasibility of rebuilding the civic institutions of the war-torn nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harooni |first=Mirwais |title=Billions spent on Afghan police but brutality, corruption prevail |publisher=Reuters |date=Aug 24, 2011 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-police-crime-idUSTRE77N10U20110824#hGzDRWghi03l3VFF.97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fox News]] reported in October 2014 that Afghan officials may have systematically stolen $300 million from a UNDP trust fund used to pay police officers in Afghanistan and that European Union donors had withheld about $100 million in contributions to the fund owing to concerns about the fund's management. The UNDP itself stated that it was not the agency's responsibility to address this corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russell |first=George |title=UN agency blamed after hundreds of millions diverted from Afghan fund |publisher=Fox News |date=Oct 16, 2014 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/10/16/un-agency-blamed-after-hundreds-millions-diverted-from-afghan-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some police officers, according to a 2015 report, have informed the Taliban of impending operations, presumably in exchange for bribes.&lt;ref name=stud /&gt;

===Military===
The Afghan National Army is considered more professional than the ANP but also experiences a significant misallocation of resources and immense levels of bribery solicitation. In a 2013 Transparency International survey, one-fifth of Afghans said they considered the military corrupt.&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported in March 2012 that Afghan defense officials were impeding a probe into whether Afghan Air Force members were trafficking in opium and weapons and that an Afghan officer who had killed eight members of the US military in 2011 may have been involved in trafficking. For example, investigators were only given limited access to military personnel with any evidence to report, and were denied access to areas of the airport where smuggling was still suspected to be underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenberg |first=Mathew |title=Officials Hinder Inquiry Into Afghan Air Force on Smuggling, Two Americans Say |work=New York Times |date=Mar 9, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/world/asia/afghanis-are-hindering-smuggling-inquiry-2-americans-say.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of corruption, according to a 2014 report, the Department of Defense had lost account of over 200,000 weapons allotted to the ANSF and ANP. Those weapons, as well as ammunition, had reportedly been sold by police and security officers to the Taliban.&lt;ref name=stud /&gt;

In early 2015, the oversight committee for Ministry of Defence contracts uncovered a kickback scheme involving payment by the ministry of over $200 million to fuel contractors. After an investigation, the contracts were cancelled and senior ministry officials fired.&lt;ref name=perils /&gt;

In May 2015, ''Newsweek'' reported that Taliban insurgents were buying U.S.-supplied weapons from Afghan forces. The Pentagon "lost track of many of the 465,000 light weapons the U.S. supplied to Afghan security forces."&lt;ref name=armenm&gt;{{cite web |last=Broder |first=Jonathan |title=Arming the Enemy in Afghanistan |work=Newsweek |date=May 18, 2015 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/arming-enemy-afghanistan-332840.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Karzai==
Haroun Mir of Afghanistan's Center for Research and Policy Studies (ACRPS) and Business Integrity Network Afghanistan (BINA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bina.af/|title=BINA - Business Integrity Network Afghanistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted in June 2015 that Hamid Karzai, Acting President of Afghanistan from 2001 to 2004 and President from 2004 to 2014, had been widely accused of perpetuating and initiating the corrupt economic system of the country through  a patronage system that resembled a [[mafia]]. As a result, corruption is now considered an ingrained and accepted facet of Afghan culture, and is no longer seen as a taboo.&lt;ref name=perils /&gt;

In a December 2012 speech, Karzai blamed corruption in Afghanistan on the countries that fund his government. "Corruption in Afghanistan is a reality, a bitter reality," Karzai said. "The part of this corruption that is in our offices is a small part: that is bribes. The other part of corruption, the large part, is hundreds of millions dollars that are not ours. We shouldn't blame ourselves for that. That part is from others and imposed on us." The ''Army Times'', reporting on the speech, noted that Karzai had aligned himself with populist stances against his own foreign allies, placing blame of the nation's problems on outsiders rather than his own government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Karzai: Foreigners to blame for corruption |work=Army Times |date=Dec 22, 2012 |url=http://archive.armytimes.com/article/20121222/NEWS/212220308/Karzai-Foreigners-to-blame-for-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2013, Frank Vogl, author of ''Waging War on Corruption'', called the Karzai government "a cesspool of corruption" in which tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer money had been looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vogl |first=Frank |title=Afghan corruption imperils future success: Column|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=Feb 10, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/02/10/afghan-corruption-imperils-future-success-column/1907287/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported on April 30, 2013, that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] had funneled tens of millions of dollars in discreet payments to Karzai "in suitcases, backpacks and shopping bags." Former CIA official Reuel Gerecht said that Karzai likely has a patronage system bolstered by a cash scheme, since it would not be maintainable without support from the Pashtuns. Vincent Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism chief, said that given Karzai's poor relations with the US, the money is not being used in an efficient manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA Cash to Karzai Said to Fit Afghan Patronage System|newspaper=Bloomberg L.P. |date=Apr 19, 2013 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-30/cia-cash-to-karzai-said-to-fit-afghan-patronage-system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Joel Brinkley wrote in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' that Karzai's government was attempting to levy a 1,000 USD customs fee on every U.S. vehicle operating in a non-combat role in and out of the country, and that Afghan troops had been blocking roads in expectation of payment. Brinkley, as well as other experts, have criticized Karzai's methods of extorting American personnel and investors while accepting their patronage and protection, since most of the military equipment in the nation serves to protect his government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brinkley |first=Joel |title=The last straw in Afghanistan |work=Baltimore Sun |date=Jul 31, 2013 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-brinkley-afghanistan-20130731-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, ''Philanthropy Daily'' noted that American journalist [[Sarah Chayes]], who in 2002 founded a charity called Afghans for Civil Society in collaboration with Karzai's brother Qayum, had been so disturbed by how much of her charity went to payoffs and bribes to shadowy figures that she left the charity in 2005, thereafter becoming an advisor on Afghan corruption to Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral [[Mike Mullen]]. Chayes was especially critical of corruption at the top levels of the Afghan government and Karzai family, which was known to US officials but ignored by them due to their focus of finalizing military campaigns rather than cleaning up the corrupt ring ruling the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Rick |title=Delivering Humanitarian Aid and Fighting Corruption: Not an Either-Or Proposition |work=Nonprofit Quarterly |date=Jul 8, 2015 |url=http://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/07/08/delivering-humanitarian-aid-and-fighting-corruption-not-an-either-or-proposition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to write a 2015 book, ''Thieves of State'', about official corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Tim |title=Sarah Chayes: on living in Afghanistan and sleeping with a Kalashnikov |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=Mar 15, 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/sarah-chayes-thieves-of-state-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of corruption==
SIGAR has called corruption a major impediment to the process of stabilizing and reconstructing Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=perils /&gt; "Corruption is now widely acknowledged as having a significant impact on state building, development, and private sector growth in policy documents," stated the Asia Foundation in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The growing challenge of corruption in afghanistan |publisher=Asia Foundation |url=https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/FNLcorruptionchapterOccasionalPaperJuly30.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gen. [[John R. Allen]], who at the time was in charge of international forces in Afghanistan, told President Obama that corruption is the greatest strategic and existential threat to the fledgling Afghan nation. Widespread corruption aids the insurgency because widens the gap between citizens and the ruling elite, an [[Integrity Watch Afghanistan|Integrity Watch]] official said in 2013, adding that the international community has not "lived up to its international commitment ... to address corruption."&lt;ref name=sandi /&gt; A January 2014 report by Reuters stated that thousands of homeless Afghans were suffering because  of corruption. "The task-force meant to respond to emergencies has failed to distribute supplies and, in some provinces, money to transport it has gone missing," said the report. "Elsewhere, warehouses have been emptied without Kabul's knowledge." One U.N. Official described the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation as a "black hole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands of Afghans face cold, hungry winter as aid goes missing |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=Jan 17, 2014 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-17/news/sns-rt-us-afghanistan-displaced-20140117_1_afghans-herat-foreign-aid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 Pentagon study said that "corruption directly threatens the viability and legitimacy of the Afghan state," because it "alienates key elements of the population, discredits the government and security forces, undermines international support, subverts state functions and rule of law, robs the state of revenue and creates barriers to economic growth."&lt;ref name=sandi /&gt; In February 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote, "corruption alienates key elements of the population, discredits the government and security forces, undermines international support, subverts state functions and rule of law, robs the state of revenue, and creates barriers to economic growth." Corruption impacts the Afghan economy, national security, police ineffectiveness, and public faith in government institutions.&lt;ref name=stud /&gt;

In a March 2015 article, Mary Beth Goodman and Trevor Sutton described corruption as the second most important threat to Afghanistan‚Äôs "long-term security and economic development," the foremost threat being "the Taliban insurgency in the country‚Äôs South and East." These two threats, they explained, are connected, government graft having caused "deep frustration with the Western-backed regime in Kabul and undermined the integrity of the Afghan administration." Also, corruption has severely debilitated the nation's military and police and interrupted the supply of government services, foreign aid, and investment to those who need it, thus fueling the insurgency.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt;

"Throughout the past 13 years," wrote Haroun Mir on June 24, 2015, "high levels of corruption and bad governance have seriously thwarted the international community's efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Millions of dollars that were allocated for the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan were misused or wasted." Mir cited in particular "the disappearance of $1 billion in the 2010 Kabul Bank scandal, in which a cohort of unscrupulous businessmen and politicians carried out a Ponzi scheme in the largest private Afghan bank."&lt;ref name=perils /&gt;

===Afghan anti-corruption organizations===
The Afghan government formed the High Office for Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOOAC). One source notes, however, that "in reality, the Afghans that currently run the country do not want to see the pipeline of money that flows from the donor nations to their Swiss or Dubai bank accounts interrupted. So this 'high office' really is not doing much to fix the corrupt situation in Kabul."

Although the HOOAC purportedly has three basic functions, namely "prevention, investigation and enforcement," it has no legal authority to perform investigations. Individual governmental departments are supposed to refer corruption cases to the Attorney General's Office (AGO) for investigation, whereupon the HOOAC is supposed to engage in follow-up work. One challenge to its work is that "only 9% of Afghan homes own a computer and only one third of citizens understand basic governmental administrative procedures, making reporting bribes exceptionally difficult." The HOOAC "lacks the requisite infrastructure to properly process the current levels of complaints. A study found that it "was greatly understaffed, lacked experienced employees, suffered from in inadequate operational capacity and failed to meet international standards of independence from the rest of government as an oversight institution." Because of the corruption of the judiciary itself, many corruption cases are not properly adjudicated.&lt;ref name=stud /&gt;

Other local initiatives are Management Systems International (MSI) and Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA), a civil society organization. Former president Karzai appointed a childhood friend, Izzatullah Wassifif, as head of the Afghan anti-corruption agency. In 2007 it was revealed that he had spent 3¬Ω years in a U.S. prison for drug trafficking. "Almost no one is more corrupt than President Karzai," states one source. "Although he will make passionate speeches about how corruption needs to be eliminated he continues to be the most corrupt official in Afghanistan. In addition, he condemns U.S. efforts to reduce corruption as an attempt to meddle in Afghan sovereign affairs. On the rare occasion that an Afghan official does try to fight corruption he will find himself quickly dismissed."&lt;ref name=awar&gt;{{cite web |title=Corruption in Afghanistan |work=Afghan War News |url=http://www.afghanwarnews.info/corruption.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==
There have been many anti-corruption initiatives in Afghanistan, but the level of success has been uneven and unremarkable. Efforts have been made, for instance, to improve budget transparency. Formerly, the Ministry of Finance drafted the budget on its own; that is no longer the case, but more local involvement is necessary.&lt;ref name=asia /&gt;

In 2008, Afghanistan ratified the U.N. Convention against Corruption, and Karzai established the High Office for Oversight and Anti-Corruption, or HOO.&lt;ref name=progr /&gt;

According to a UN report, Afghanistan "made some tangible progress in reducing the level of corruption in the public sector" between 2009 and 2012. In 2009, 59% had to pay at least one bribe to a public official; in 2012, that figure had dropped to 50%. Bribes to police officers dropped from 52% to 42% during the same period. At the same time, however, the frequency of bribery climbed from 4.7 to 5.6 bribes per bribe-payer and the average bribe rose from US$158 to US$214.&lt;ref name=unod /&gt;

August 2011 reports stated that the U.S. military, after spending a year investigating trucking contracts, had "moved to stem the flow of contract money to Afghan insurgents, awarding at least 20 companies new contracts worth about $1 billion for military supply transport and suspending seven current contractors it found lacking in 'integrity and business ethics.'" A senior military officer said, "I think we‚Äôve finally got our arms around this thing." Rep. [[John F. Tierney]] of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee expressed concern that the contracts lacked transparency and accountability ensuring any U.S. dollars are not being syphoned to corrupt officials, insurgents, the Taliban, drug traffickers, or anyone else considered the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Karen |title=U.S. military awards contracts in Afghanistan to get money away from insurgents |work=Washington Post  |date=Aug 15, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-military-awards-contracts-in-afghanistan-to-get-money-away-from-insurgents/2011/08/15/gIQArLL4HJ_print.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged progress was purportedly the work of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force Shafafiyat, created by Gen. [[David Petraeus]] and headed by Brig. Gen. [[H. R. McMaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boot |first=Max |title=Afghan Anti-Corruption Plan Succeeds |work=[[Commentary Magazine]] |date=Aug 16, 2011 |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/middle-east/afghanistan-corruption-contractors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 ''SIGAR'' report accused Afghanistan's Attorney General's Office of lacking "the political will to prosecute high-level, corrupt officials" and said that an "atmosphere of paranoia prevails" in the country. The report cited prosecutors' slowness to deal with the Kabul Bank scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghan prosecutors faulted lax corruption efforts |work=Washington Times |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/2/afghan-prosecutors-faulted-lax-corruption-efforts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firing of Faqiryar===
In a 2010 article in the ''New York Times'', in which he referred to Afghanistan as "Corrupt-istan," [[Dexter Filkins]] cited the case of Fazel Ahmad Faqiryar, who had been fired as deputy attorney general for attempting to prosecute senior members of Karzai‚Äôs cabinet. Faqiryar criticized the Afghan legal system by stating that the laws of the country are meant only for the lower classes. Filkins described Faqiryar's ouster as exemplary of the lawlessness and lack of any rule of law that permeates Karzai's government, and the rest of Afghanistan's regional governments. Filkins quoted Afghan criticism of the US for working with Afghan officials known to be corrupt, and said that US commanders fear "that taking down the biggest Afghan politicians could open a vacuum of authority ... that the Taliban could take advantage of." Filkins also noted that the firing of Faqiryar had made him a respected national icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Filkins |first=Dexter |title=Inside Corrupt-istan, a Loss of Faith in Leaders |work=New York Times |date=Sep 4, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/weekinreview/05filkins.html?_r=1&amp;hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yaffali case===
In December 2011, Karzai demanded that the occupying coalition provide evidence against the Afghan Army‚Äôs former surgeon general, Gen. Ahmad Zia Yaftali, whom it wanted to prosecute. NATO had in fact provided evidence a year earlier that Yaftali had stolen medical drugs from Afghanistan's largest military hospital, which he was in charge of, totaling in the millions of dollars. It was noted that Afghan soldiers regularly died from minor infections at the hospital due to a lack of medicine, and their inability to pay bribes to the hospital's medical staff. Brig. Gen. McMaster, who ran the US inquiry, was outraged at Karzai's move, the Yaftali investigation having been a major part of the anti-corruption effort. "Now it appeared as if an officer who was accused of letting his own soldiers die so he could enrich himself would never be tried."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intractable Afghan Graft Hampering U.S. Strategy |work=New York Times |date=Mar 7, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/world/asia/corruption-remains-intractable-in-afghanistan-under-karzai-government.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting corruption under Ghani===
Both President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, who took office in 2014, "made anticorruption efforts a key component of their presidential campaigns."&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

In December 2014, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani dismissed the heads of the attorney's office, the oil, power, and customs departments and the director of education in Herat province. Ghani said that all of the officials except the chief attorney would be charged with corruption. These were the first major changes Ghani had made in a local administration since assuming power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghan President Dismisses Officials In Western Province |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=Dec 28, 2014 |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-herat-ghani-visit-dismissals-corruption/26765556.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a scheme by local contractors to overcharge the Afghan government and U.S. taxpayers was revealed in January 2015, President Ghani fired the contractors without hesitation, voided the contract and launched an investigation. This was described as "a total 180-degree turn from the way it was under Karzai."&lt;ref name=armenm/&gt;

In December 2014, Transparency International offered six recommendations to combat Afghan corruption. They included: Promote clean leadership in key institutions; Make the judiciary independent; Establish a best practice right to information regime; Establish an independent anti-corruption agency; Make asset declaration mandatory for all those who hold power; and Procurement transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Challenging Corruption in Afghanistan |publisher=Transparency International |url=https://blog.transparency.org/2014/12/01/challenging-corruption-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Until now," wrote Haroun Mir in 2015, "the Afghan government and the donor community have tried hard to curb corruption in the public sector. However, while politicians and public sector officials often benefit from corruption, the main perpetrator is the private sector that bribes them." In Afghanistan, "corruption at its highest level takes place because of collusion between political appointees and contractors from the business sector."&lt;ref name=perils /&gt;

===U.S. anti-corruption efforts===
Task Force Shafafiyat (or Task Force Transparency), more officially known as Combined Joint Inter-Agency Task Force ‚Äì Shafafiyat, was established by General Petreaus to combat corruption.&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

The Anti-Corruption Coordination Group was set up by the U.S. Embassy to develop strategies for reducing corruption.&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

In 2010, Petreaus founded Task Force 2010 "to try to follow the money trail in an effort to ensure that money is spent properly. " It later relocated from Afghanistan to a Qatar air base.&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

The Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) "is supposed to conduct audits of reconstruction projects and attempt to recover any US taxpayer funds." Originally ineffective, owing to "shoddy record keeping and poorly maintained databases," it has since improved in efficiency, becoming "a true 'watchdog'" that provides excellent reports.&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

The [[International Contract Corruption Task Force]] (ICCTF) is an interagency organization formed in 2006 with the help of the [[FBI]] to help battle the "immense" level of crime among U.S. contracting officials. Its members include the FBI, [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service|DCIS]], [[Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction|SIGAR]], [[Major Procurement Fraud Unit|MPFU]], [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]], and the IG offices of State and [[USAID]].&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

The Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC), founded in 2009, combats illicit financial networks and provides other US agencies with financial expertise and intelligence.&lt;ref name=awar /&gt;

A July 2012 report on ''NPR'' stated that while "U.S. officials consider widespread corruption one of the main barriers to a stable Afghanistan," [[Seth Jones (political scientist)|Seth Jones]], a former advisor to the U.S. command in Afghanistan, stated that "when it came to specific, concrete, sustained efforts to target and reduce corruption within the Afghan government," U.S. officials did not have the necessary resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bowman |first=Tom |title=U.S. Wages Sisyphean War Against Afghan Corruption |work=NPR |date=Jul 31, 2012 |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/07/31/157656330/u-s-wages-sisyphean-war-against-afghan-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Mary Beth Goodman and Trevor Sutton called on the U.S. to help Afghanistan increase accountability and transparency and lower corruption and graft. While eliminating corruption in Afghanistan is no simple task, Goodman and Sutton stated in March 2015 "it could be significantly reduced, and even modest improvements in public accountability will substantially enhance the legitimacy of the new government."&lt;ref name=progr/&gt;

===SIGAR reports===
John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said in 2013 that US government bureaucrats had ordered him to cease from publishing damning audits that noted a myriad of corruption cases in Afghanistan, preferring instead to keep them guarded from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gaskell |first=Stephanie |title=Watchdog: They want to silence me |work=Politico |date=May 8, 2013 |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/watchdog-says-government-tried-to-silence-him-091110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Times'' reported in September 2013 that a U.S. government public-health program in Afghanistan might have wasted $190 million owing to a "high risk of waste, fraud and abuse,"  and that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was still providing "millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in direct assistance with little assurance" that those funds were being spent properly. The Times cited a SIGAR report stating that "USAID has ignored repeated warnings about waste" at the Afghan Ministry of Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Golden Hammer: IG says U.S. aid dollars unaccounted for in Afghan health program |work=Washington Times |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/ig-us-aid-funds-unaccounted-afghan-health-program/?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR), told a meeting at the Middle East Institute that corruption was the "big issue" in Afghanistan and that the US wasn't doing enough to combat it. He said commanders in the field had told him "corruption is more serious in Afghanistan than the insurgency" and explained that "the patronage system and the failure to prosecute people guilty of gross fraud and abuse is undermining the Afghan economy and putting future development efforts at risk."&lt;ref name=wat /&gt;

An October 2014 report by SIGAR noted that the US Army was ignoring "multiple calls for it to stop doing business with Afghans who are known to support the country‚Äôs insurgency." SIGAR noted that U.S. reconstruction projects had "helped Afghans grow large quantities of opium-poppy plants. SIGAR head John F. Sopko said he was "troubled by the fact that our government can and does use classified information to arrest, detain, and even kill individuals linked to the insurgency in Afghanistan, but apparently refuses to use the same classified information to deny those same individuals their right to obtain contracts with the U.S. government." The report stated that "U.S. government contractors tied to the insurgency have even gained access to coalition facilities and bases, despite being made aware of these vulnerabilities by SIGAR." For example, in 2013 "one contractor clearly identified as providing explosives to the Afghan insurgency was permitted access to a Coalition-controlled facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kredo |first=Adam |title=U.S. Refuses to Stop Giving Contracts to Backers of Afghan Insurgency |work=Free Beacon |date=Oct 30, 2014 |url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/u-s-refuses-to-stop-giving-contracts-to-afghan-insurgency-backers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific cases==

===Kabul Bank===
The [[New Kabul Bank|Kabul Bank]], established in 2004 by Khalilullah Ferozi and Sherkhan Farnood, was Afghanistan's first private bank. From the beginning, it was criticized as resembling a [[Ponzi scheme]]. It lent money to the nation's elite, who did not repay the loans.&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;{{cite web |last=Mashal |first=Mujib |title=Afghan Businessman Convicted in Kabul Bank Fraud Is Still Free to Make Money |work=New York Times |date=Nov 4, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/asia/afghan-businessman-convicted-in-kabul-bank-fraud-is-still-free-to-make-money.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial ''The Guardian'' accused Ferozi of causing the most damage to Afghanistan besides the Taliban.&lt;ref name=feroz&gt;{{cite web |last=Boone |first=Jon |title=The financial scandal that broke Afghanistan‚Äôs Kabul bank |work=The Guardian |date=Jun 16, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/kabul-bank-afghanistan-financial-scandal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferozi and Farnood curried favor with President Karzai's family, whereupon the Afghan government put Kabul Bank in charge of the payroll accounts for all of the nation's civil servants, soldiers, and police officers. One of Karzai's brothers, Mahmoud Karzai, became the bank's third-biggest shareholder. The bank put $4 million into Karzai's 2009 re-election campaign, and in return got 430,000 government accounts.&lt;ref name=feroz/&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', Ferozi and Farnood drained "the savings of thousands of depositors totalling $579m (¬£359m) in a binge of insider lending by the bank's politically powerful shareholders. Because there was never any obligation to pay any interest on these 'loans', the total unaccounted sum is $910m. In a country where GDP is just $12bn, that is an extraordinary figure." The scandal destroyed confidence in the public banking system, and dried up many foreign-aid payments.&lt;ref name=feroz /&gt;

The amount spent by the government to bail out the bank totaled between 5% and 6% of Afghanistan‚Äôs entire GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wendle |first=John |title=The Bank Bust That Nearly Took Down Afghanistan |work=Time |date=Nov 30, 2012 |url=http://world.time.com/2012/11/30/the-bank-bust-that-nearly-took-down-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, it was reported that Ferozi, who was supposed to be serving a term in [[Pulicharkhi jail|Pul-i-Charkhi prison]] for his role in defrauding the Kabul Bank of nearly $1 billion, had signed a new contract with the Afghan government for a massive real-estate development in Kabul called Smart City. He was now serving his sentence at night, reflecting an apparent unwillingness on the part of the Afghan government to address corruption at the highest level. International donors and the [[International Monetary Fund]] had made Ferozi's prosecution a mandatory condition for further aid to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

One Western official stated that the prison arrangement with Ferozi and the government's new business involvement with him sent a message that embezzlement on a grand enough scale will result in no incarceration. Yama Torabi, a member of Afghanistan's anti-corruption committee, said that these developments perpetuated a culture of [[kleptocracy]] and signaled that any official can loot the Afghan budget, while anyone can invest with no questions asked.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

===Raheen case===
A 2013 report by the ''Daily Beast'' stated that Mahkdoom Raheen, formerly a democracy-supporting professor who became Minister of Information and Culture under Karzai, a close friend, had engaged in massive corruption. After Indian philanthropist Madanjeet Singh donated $1 million to rehabilitate Kabul‚Äôs Cultural Heritage Center and train art preservationists, Raheen embezzled nearly all of Singh‚Äôs donation, depositing it in a personal account that was not discovered until after Raheen's 2006 resignation from the ministry after allegations of "corruption, nepotism, mismanagement, and promoting Iranian cultural interests in Afghanistan." Despite the allegations, Karzai named Raheen ambassador to India. Observers criticized the comfort leaders hold for corruption culture within the government. After Karzai's 2009 re-election, Raheen was once again named Minister of Information and Culture. A former senior culture ministry official, Zia Bumia, questioned how grand corruption is by ministers connected to warlords and drug lords when an academic is embezzling funds. In 2013, he was charged with involvement in illegally appropriating at least 59 cultural and historical artifacts but told the ''Daily Beast'' that he had been cleared of the charge. He was also accused of helping Ahmad Shah Sultani, a reputed art trafficker, found a Kabul museum that is suspected of being a front for illegally acquired cultural artifacts to traffic on the black market, at the benefit of Sultani and Raheen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghanistan‚Äôs Million Dollar Minister |work=Daily Beast |date=Sep 8, 2013 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/08/afghanistan-s-million-dollar-minister.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zakhilwal case===
It was reported in August 2012 that Finance Minister Hazarat Omar Zakhilwal, who had been lauded for his integrity, had embezzled over $1 million and deposited it in Canadian bank accounts. Afghanistan's High Office of Oversight and Anti-corruption chief, Dr. Azizullah Ludin, said he would investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghan finance minister faces corruption investigation |publisher=Reuters |date=Aug 2, 2012 |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-corruption-idINDEE87106520120802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the ''Daily Beast'' reported on a session of the Afghan Parliament at which Zakhilwal, who was being impeached for corruption, charged several M.P.s with corruption. Haji Zaher Qadeer was accused of smuggling $269 million worth of flour from Pakistan; Haji Hamid Lalai had sought official processing for almost 2000 illegal vehicles; other M.P.s were charged with smuggling oil tankers and alcohol, with pressuring Zakhilwal to hire their relatives as customs officials, and with exercising undue influence on supply contracts. In the end, Zakhilwal kept his position. The story noted that international aid and military organizations encourage corruption by giving contracts to businesses illegally owned by MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghanistan's Cycle of Corruption |work=Daily Beast |date=May 16, 2013 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/16/afghanistan-s-cycle-of-corruption.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kos resignation===
In October 2015, Drago Kos, Afghanistan's chief international corruption watchdog, resigned, complaining that the government's corruption efforts were not serious. "With the exception of some sporadic activities, in one year since the new president and the C.E.O. took positions, I could not see any systemic action against endemic corruption in the country," said Kos, a member of the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. Kos stated that there was never any political support at any point in his efforts and cited a lack of will to combat corruption.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

===Kam Air===
On January 30, 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that a move by the US military to blacklist an Afghan airline, [[Kam Air]], because of accusations of drug smuggling had caused diplomatic pressure with a Karzai spokesman, [[Aimal Faizi]], demanding evidence of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rubin |first=Alisa J |title=Afghans Bristle at U.S. Ban on Airline |work=New York Times |date=Jan 30, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/world/asia/afghanistan-bristles-at-us-ban-on-kam-air-airline.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defaka''' is an [[endangered language|endangered]] and divergent [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] language of uncertain classification. It is spoken in the [[Bonny, Rivers|Bonny LGA]] of [[Rivers State]]. The low number of Defaka speakers, coupled with the fact that other languages dominate the region where Defaka is spoken, edges the language near extinction on a year-to-year basis. It is generally classified in an [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] branch of the [[Niger‚ÄìCongo]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/afn|title=Did you know Defaka is severely endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ijoid proposal is problematic. Blench (2012) notes that "Defaka has numerous external cognates and might be an isolate or independent branch of Niger‚ÄìCongo which has come under ·ªäj·ªç influence."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf Niger-Congo: an alternative view]&lt;/ref&gt;

==People==
Ethnically, the [[Defaka people]] are distinct from the [[Nkoroo]], but they have assimilated to Nkoroo culture to such a degree that their language seems to be the only sign of a distinct Defaka identity. Use of the Defaka language however is quickly receding in favour of the language of the Nkoroo. Nowadays, most Defaka speakers are elderly people, and even among these, Defaka is rarely spoken &amp;mdash; the total number of Defaka speakers is at most 200 nowadays (SIL/Ethnologue 15th ed.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://defaka.rutgers.edu/people.html|title=Documenting Defaka &amp; Nkoroo|website=defaka.rutgers.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease in use of Defaka is stronger in Nkoroo town than in the Iwoma area. Since the language communities between Defaka and Nkoroo are so intertwined, it is hard to determine which language influences the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All children grow up speaking [[Nkoroo language|Nkoroo]] (an [[Ijo languages|Ijo language]]) as a first language. The next most used language among the Defaka is [[Igbo language|Igbo]], owing to the political influence of the [[Opobo]] since the days of the [[Oil Rivers Trade]]. Igbo has been a language of instruction in many schools in the region and still functions as a regional [[lingua franca|trade language]].

==Classification==
The Defaka language shows many lexical similarities with Ij·ªç, some shared regular sound correspondences and some typological similarities with proto-·ªäj·ªç. For example, both languages have a [[subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb]] basic word order, which is otherwise extremely rare in the [[Niger‚ÄìCongo language family]], being found only in the [[Mande languages|Mande]] and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]] branches.
* a ebere koÃò a okuna …ì√°√°ma &amp;nbsp; (the dog &lt;small&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/small&gt; the fowl kill:&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;) &amp;nbsp; ''The dog killed the fowl'' (Defaka)
* obiri …ì√© oÃò…ì√≥Ãòk≈çÃò …ì√© …ì√°mÃÑ &amp;nbsp; (dog the fowl the kill:&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;) &amp;nbsp; ''The dog killed the fowl'' (·ªäj·ªç, Kala…ìar·ªã dialect)
Also, Defaka has a [[grammatical gender|sex-gender]] system distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and neuter 3rd-person singular pronouns; this is once again a rarity among south-central Niger‚ÄìCongo languages other than ·ªäjoid and Defaka.
*√° t√≥…ìo 'her head'
*o to…ìo 'his head'
*y√© t√≥…ìo 'its head'
While some of the lexical and maybe typological similarities can be attributed to borrowing (as Defaka has been in close contact with Ij·ªç for more than 300 years), the sound correspondences point to a (somewhat distant) genealogical relationship.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Phonology==
Nearly all Defaka are bilingual in Nk·ªçr·ªç·ªç, and the phonology appears to be the same as that language.

===Tone===
Defaka has two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], {{sm|high}} and {{sm|low}}. On long vowels and diphthongs, as well as disyllabic words, {{sm|high‚Äìlow}} and {{sm|low‚Äìhigh}} [[contour tone|contours]] occur. In addition, there is a [[downstep]] that may appear between high tones, and which is the remnant of an elided low tone. However, Shryock et al. were not able to measure significant differences in the pitch traces of {{sm|high‚Äìlow}}, {{sm|low‚Äìlow}}, and {{sm|high}}‚Äìdownstep‚Äì{{sm|high}}, all of which have a falling pitch, suggesting that there may be fewer distinctive [[word tone]]s than the combinations of syllable tones would suggest. However, these all clearly contrast with level-pitched {{sm|high‚Äìhigh}} and rising-pitched {{sm|low‚Äìhigh}}.

===Vowels===
The Ijoid [[vowel harmony]] has collapsed in Defaka, as it has in Nk·ªçr·ªç·ªç. There are seven oral vowels, {{IPA|/i …™ e a …î o u/}}, though {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/…î/}} are uncommon. There are five nasal vowels, {{IPA|/ƒ© ·∫Ω √£ √µ ≈©/}}. All may occur long. Long vowels are at least twice as long as short vowels.

Most voiceless [[obstruent]]s are [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]]. However, {{IPA|/kÕ°p/}} has a slightly negative [[voice onset time]]. That is, voicing commences somewhat before the consonant is released, as in English "voiced" stops such as ''b.'' This is typical of labial-velar stops. {{IPA|/…°Õ°b/}}, on the other hand, is fully voiced, as are the other voiced obstruents. Shryock et al. analyse the prenasalised stops {{IPA|[mb nd ≈ã…° ≈ã…°Õ°b]}} as [[consonant cluster]]s with {{IPA|/m/}}. {{IPA|[dÕ° í]}} varies with {{IPA|[z]}}, with some speakers using one, some the other, and some either, depending on the word.

{{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} may be nasalised before nasal vowels.

The velar plosives {{IPA|/k/}} &amp; {{IPA|/…°/}} may be [[Lenition|lenited]] to {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/…£/}} between vowels.

The tap {{IPA|/…æ/}} is pronounced as an approximant, {{IPA|[…π]}}, by some speakers. It only occurs between vowels and at the ends of words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">The '''Dinka alphabet''' is used by South Sudanese [[Dinka people|Dinka]] people. The written [[Dinka language]] is based on the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]], but with some added letters adapted from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. The current orthography is derived from the alphabet developed for the southern Sudanese languages at the [[Rejaf]] language conference in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/dinka.php |title=Dinka language, alphabet and pronunciation |publisher=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, several attempts at adapting the Arabic and Latin scripts to the Dinka language were made, but neither effort was met with large success. Christian missionaries were essential to the development of what became the Dinka alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~agamlong/language/index.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605120554/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~agamlong/language/index.en.html |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Federal Home Loan Bank Board Building 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board Building]], which houses the main office of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, D.C.]]

The '''Federal Bureau of Prisons''' ('''BOP''') is a United States federal [[law enforcement agency]]. A subdivision of the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the BOP is responsible for the administration of the federal prison system. The system handles inmates who have violated, or are accused of violating, [[federal law]]. The BOP also holds inmates who have committed felonies in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The BOP is also responsible for carrying out all judicially ordered [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal executions]] (other than those [[Capital punishment by the United States military|carried out under military law]]) in the United States.

Currently, the Bureau of Prisons is headed by Hugh Hurwitz, who is the current acting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bop.gov/resources/news/20180518_director_resigns.jsp|title=BOP: New Director Sworn In|website=www.bop.gov|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark S. Inch]] held the post from September 2017 until May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-hugh-hurwitz-acting-director-federal-bureau-prisons|title=Attorney General Sessions Announces Hugh Hurwitz as the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Federal Prison System existed for more than 30 years before the BOP was established. Although its wardens functioned almost autonomously, the Superintendent of Prisons, a Department of Justice official in Washington, was nominally in charge of federal prisons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=John W.|title=The Federal Bureau of Prisons: Its Mission, Its History, and Its Partnership with Probation and Pretrial Services|journal=Federal Probation|year=1997|volume=61|page=53|issn=0014-9128|oclc=2062391}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the passage of the "Three Prisons Act' in 1891, which authorized the federal government's first three penitentiaries: [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|USP Leavenworth]], [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|USP Atlanta]], and [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|USP McNeil Island]] with limited supervision by the [[United States Department of Justice]] afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Mary|title=The U.S. Federal Prison System|year=2002|isbn=978-0761923046|page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfFZNOH-rGkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1907, prison matters were handled by the Justice Department's [[General Agent]]. The General Agent was responsible for Justice Department accounts, oversight of internal operations, and certain criminal investigations, as well as prison operations. In 1907, the General Agent's office was abolished, and its functions were distributed among three new offices: the Division of Accounts (which evolved into the Justice Management Division); the Office of the Chief Examiner (which later evolved by 1908, into the Bureau of Investigation, and later by the early 1920s into the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]); and the Office of the Superintendent of Prisons and Prisoners, later called the Superintendent of Prisons (which then evolved by 1930 into the Bureau of Prisons).

[[File:FCIMilan.jpg|thumb|The exterior of [[Federal Correctional Institution, Milan]]]]
Pursuant to {{USStatute|71|218|46|325|1930|05|14}}, the Bureau of Prisons was established by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (which itself was created in 1870, to be headed by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], whose office was first established in the first [[Cabinet of the United States|Presidential Cabinet]] under [[George Washington|President Washington]] and created in 1789, along with the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretaries of State]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury]] and [[United States Secretary of War|War]]). The new Prison Bureau was now under the Administration of the 31st President [[Herbert Hoover]], (1874‚Äì1964), and was charged with the "management and regulation of all Federal penal and correctional institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory Authority to Contract With the  Private Sector for Secure Facilities |url=http://www.justice.gov/olc/quinlan.15.htm |publisher=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=November 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908064315/http://www.justice.gov/olc/quinlan.15.htm |archivedate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This responsibility covered the administration of the 11 federal prisons in operation at the time. By the end of the year 1930, the system had already expanded to 14 institutions with 13,000 inmates. By a decade later in 1940, the federal prison system had 24 institutions with 24,360 incarcerated.

The state of Alaska assumed jurisdiction over its corrections on January 3, 1959, using the [[Alaska Department of Corrections]]. Prior to statehood, the BOP had correctional jurisdiction over Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.correct.state.ak.us/institutions/lemon-creek-history History of Lemon Creek Correctional Center]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6dkEt8IHZ?url=http://www.correct.state.ak.us/institutions/lemon-creek-history Archive]). [[Alaska Department of Corrections]]. Retrieved on December 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Sentencing Reform Act of 1984]] and subsequent legislation which pushed for longer sentences, less judicial discretion, and more harsh sentences for drug-related offenses, the federal inmate population doubled in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. The population increase has decelerated since the early 2000s but the federal inmate population continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delgado|first1=Marlo|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons|url=http://www.jaildata.com/article/federal-bureau-of-prisons/ |website=JailData.com|accessdate=September 13, 2016|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997]] transferred responsibility for adult felons convicted of violating District of Columbia laws to the BOP.

==Administration and employees==
In August 2017, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] named retired Maj. Gen. Mark S. Inch as the BOP's new director.&lt;ref name=inchana;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-announces-general-mark-s-inch-new-federal-bureau-prisons|title=Attorney General Jeff Sessions Announces General Mark S.

As of 2015, 63% of BOP employees are white, 22% are black, 12% are Hispanic, 2% are Asian and 1% identify as another race. 73% are male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_staff_ethnicity_race.jsp|title=Staff Statistics |date=October 29, 2016|website=Federal Bureau of Prisons|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All BOP employees undergo 200 hours of formal training in their first year of employment. Employees must also complete additional 120 hours of training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World-class correctional instruction|url=https://www.bop.gov/about/facilities/training_centers.jsp|website=Federal Bureau of Prisons: About Our Facilities|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is roughly one corrections officer for every 10 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Steve | last=Reilly | title=Prison violence rises as budgets slashed | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/30/prison-riots-and-killings-rising-states-slash-budgets-guards/545299002/| newspaper=USA Today | pages= 1A, 2A | date=May 6, 2018 | accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BOP has five security levels. Federal Prison Camps (FPCs), the BOP minimum-security facilities, feature a lack of or a limited amount of perimeter fencing, and a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio. Low-security Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs) have double-fenced perimeters, and inmates live in mostly cubicle or dormitory housing. Medium-security FCIs and some United States Penitentiaries (USPs) are classified to hold medium-security inmates. The medium facilities have strengthened perimeters, which often consist of double fences with electronic detection systems. Medium-security facilities mostly have cell housing. Most U.S. Penitentiaries are classified as high-security facilities. The perimeters, highly secured, often have reinforced fences or walls. Federal Correctional Complexes (FCCs) are co-locations of BOP facilities with different security levels and/or genders.&lt;ref name="BOPtypes"&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/index.jsp Prison Types &amp; General Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915081357/http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/index.jsp |date=September 15, 2012 }}."

Twenty-eight BOP institutions hold female inmates.

{{Asof|2010}} about 15% of the inmates under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Prisons are in facilities operated by third parties. Most of them are in facilities operated by private companies. Others are in facilities operated by local and state governments. Some are in Residential Reentry Centers (RRC) (AKA: Community Corrections Centers) operated by private companies. The bureau uses contract facilities to manage its own prison population. The bureau stated that contract facilities are "especially useful" for housing low-security, specialized groups of people, such as sentenced criminal aliens.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923084742/http://www.bop.gov/DataSource/execute/dsFacilityAddressLoc?start=y&amp;facilityCode=RIV CI Rivers Contact Information]."

===Female inmates===
{{see also|Incarceration of women in the United States}}
As of 2015, 27 BOP facilities house women. The BOP has a Mothers and Infants Nurturing Together (MINT) program for women who enter the BOP as inmates while pregnant. The BOP pays for [[abortion]] only if it is life-threatening for the woman, but it may allow for abortions in non-life-threatening cases if non-BOP funds are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/inmates/custody_and_care/female_offenders.jsp Female offenders]."

With the 2014 repurposing of [[FCI Danbury]] for men, female inmates in the Northeast no longer had a prison in their region, and the imbalance of female inmates in regards to their locations in the BOP increased.&lt;ref name=Aronsetalp67/&gt;

In 2017, four senators of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], including [[Kamala Harris]], introduced a bill explicitly requiring tampons and pads to be free of cost for female prisoners. In August of that year, the BOP introduced a memorandum requiring free tampons and pads. The previous 1996 memorandum stated "products for female hygiene needs shall be available" without requiring them to be free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tolan, Casey|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/11/tampon-inmate-bureau-of-prison-woman-incarcerated-kamala-harris/|title=Bureau of Prisons requires free tampons for female inmates, following Harris bill |publisher=''[[Mercury News]]''|date=August 11, 2017|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2010}} typically juveniles sent into BOP custody are between 17 and 20, must have been under 18 at the time of the offense and had been convicted of sex-related offenses. This is because the most severe crimes committed on [[Indian Reservations]] are usually taken to federal court. According to the BOP, most of the juveniles it receives had committed violent crimes and had "an unfavorable history of responding to interventions and preventive measures in the community." As of that year most federal juvenile inmates were from [[Arizona]], [[Montana]], [[South Dakota]], and the District of Columbia (in no particular order).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100330080633/http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/juveniles.jsp Juveniles in the Bureau]". Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on January 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BOP contracts with facilities that house [[juvenile delinquency in the United States|juvenile offenders]]. Title 18 U.S.C. 5039 specifies that "No juvenile committed, whether pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense, to the custody of the Attorney General may be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional institution in which he has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges." The definition includes secure facilities and community-based correctional facilities. Federally sentenced juveniles may be moved into federal adult facilities at certain points; juveniles sentenced as adults are moved into adult facilities when they turn 18. Juveniles sentenced as juveniles are moved into adult facilities when they turn 21.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/locations/cc/ccc_faqs.jsp Community Corrections FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202204923/http://www.bop.gov/locations/cc/ccc_faqs.jsp |date=December 2, 2010 }}."

===Overpopulation and responses===
Parole was abolished for federal inmates in 1987 and inmates must serve at least 85% of their original sentence before being considered for good-behavior release.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In addition, the extremely strict sentencing guidelines present today were adopted in response to rising crime rates in the 1980s and early 1990s, especially for drug-related offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons - Statistics|url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp|website=Federal Bureau of Prisons |publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=La Vigne |first1=Nancy|last2=Samuels|first2=Julie|title=The Growth &amp; Increasing Cost of the Federal Prison System: Drivers and Potential Solutions |url=http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412693-The-Growth-amp-Increasing-Cost-of-the-Federal-Prison-System-Drivers-and-Potential-Solutions.PDF|website=urban.org|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; US violent crime has dropped since then, but some analysts and activists believe that other factors played a much more significant part in falling crime rates.  In addition, they hold that strict federal sentencing guidelines have led to overcrowding and needlessly incarcerated thousands of non-violent drug offenders who would be better served by drug treatment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwartzapfel|first1=Beth|title=Federal Prisons Could Release 1,000 Times More Drug Offenders Than Obama Did |url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/07/23/federal-prisons-could-release-1-000-times-more-drug-offenders-than-obama-did |website=The Marshall Project|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yearly increases in the federal inmate population have raised concerns from criminal justice experts and even among DOJ officials themselves. Michael Horowitz, the DOJ Inspector General, wrote a memorandum concerning this issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, despite a slight decrease in the total number of federal inmates in fiscal year (FY) 2014, the Department projects that the costs of the federal prison system will continue to increase in the years ahead, consuming a large share of the Department‚Äôs budget.

Second, federal prisons remain significantly overcrowded and therefore face a number of important safety and security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Obama's Prison Crisis|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/11/17/a-crisis-at-the-bureau-of-prisons-persists-says-doj-watchdog|website=The Marshall Project|accessdate=2 November 2015|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Fernando Affonso Collor de Mello''' ({{IPA-pt|fe ÅÀàn…êÃÉdu aÀàf√µsu Ààk…îlo Å d íi Ààm…õlu}}; born August 12, 1949) is a Brazilian politician who served as the [[President of Brazil|32nd President of Brazil]] from 1990 to 1992, when he resigned in a failed attempt to stop his [[impeachment]] trial by the [[Brazilian Senate]]. Collor was the first President directly elected by the people after the end of the [[Brazilian military government]]. He became the youngest president in Brazilian history, taking office at the age of 40. After he resigned from the presidency, the impeachment trial on charges of [[corruption]] continued. Collor was found guilty by the Senate and disqualified from holding elected office for eight years (1992‚Äì2000). He was later acquitted of ordinary criminal charges in his judicial trial before Brazil's [[Supreme Federal Court]], for lack of valid evidence.

Fernando Collor was born into a political family. He is the son of the former Senator {{ILL|Arnon Affonso de Farias Mello|pt}} and Leda Collor (daughter of former Labour Minister [[Lindolfo Collor]], led by his father, former governor of [[Alagoas]] and proprietor of the Arnon de Mello Organization, the branch of [[Rede Globo]] in the state.
"Collor" is a Portuguese adaptation of the [[German language|German]] surname Koehler, from his maternal grandfather Lindolfo Leopoldo Boeckel Collor.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Collor has served as Senator for [[Alagoas]] since February 2007. He first won election in [[Brazilian general elections, 2006|2006]] and was reelected in [[Brazilian general elections, 2014|2014]].

==Early career==
Collor became president of Brazilian football club [[Centro Sportivo Alagoano]] (CSA) in 1976. After entering politics, he was successively named mayor of [[Alagoas]]' capital [[Macei√≥]] in 1979 ([[National Renewal Alliance Party]]), elected a federal deputy ([[Democratic Social Party]]) in 1982, and eventually elected governor of the small Northeastern state of [[Alagoas]] ([[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]]) in 1986.

During his term as governor, he attracted publicity by allegedly fighting high salaries for public servants, whom he labeled ''maraj√°s'' (''[[maharaja]]s'')&lt;ref name=maharaj&gt;{{cite book|last=Solingen|first=Etel|year=1998|title=Regional Orders at Century's Dawn|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; (likening them to the former princes of India who received a stipend from the government as compensation for relinquishing their lands). How well his policies reduced public expense is disputed, but the political position certainly made him popular in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bezerra|first=Ada Kesea Guedes|last2=Silva|first2=F√°bio Ronaldo|url=http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/silva-fabio-marketing-politico-imagem.pdf|format=PDF|title=O marketing pol√≠tico e a import√¢ncia da imagem-marca em campanhas eleitorais majorit√°rias|website=Biblioteca On-line de Ci√™ncias da Comunica√ß√£o|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped boost his political career, with the help of television appearances in nationwide broadcasts (quite unusual for a governor from such a small state).

==Presidency (1990-1992) ==

[[File:Fernando Collor fala aos ministros e l√≠deres do governo.jpg|thumb|left|President Fernando Collor during a meeting with ministers and government leaders at the [[Planalto Palace]], 1990.]]
In 1989 Collor defeated [[Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva]] in a controversial two-round presidential race with 35 million votes. 
In December 1989, days prior to the second round, businessman [[Ab√≠lio Diniz]] was the victim of a sensational political kidnapping. The act is recognized as an attempt to sabotage Lula's chances of victory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=17142|title=Um alerta|first=Marilena|last=Chau√≠|work=Carta Maior|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151852/http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=17142 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by associating the kidnapping with the left wing. At the time, Brazilian law barred any party from addressing the media on the days prior to election day. Lula's party thus had no opportunity to clarify the accusations that the party (PT) was involved in the kidnapping. Collor won in the state of S√£o Paulo against many prominent political figures.{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/dhbb/verbetes_htm/1418_1.asp|title=29 de Setembro de 1992: o impeachment do Collor|trans-title=September 29, 1992: the impeachment of Collor|first=Fernando|last=Lattman-Weltman

The very day he took office, Collor launched the ''[[Plano Collor]]'' (''Collor Plan''), implemented by his finance minister [[Z√©lia Cardoso de Mello]] (not related to Collor). The plan attempted to reduce the [[money supply]] by forcibly converting large portions of consumer bank accounts into non-cashable government [[bond (finance)|bonds]], while at the same time increasing the printing of money bills, a counterbalancing measure to combat [[hyper-inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociedadedigital.com.br/artigo.php?artigo=114&amp;item=4|title=A Hist√≥ria do Plano Collor|trans-title=The History of the Collor Plan|work=sociedadedigital.com.br|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128004504/http://sociedadedigital.com.br/artigo.php?artigo=114&amp;item=4|archivedate=November 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free trade, privatization and state reforms===
[[File:Fernando Collor acena para a popula√ß√£o.jpg|thumb|right|Collor waves to the people.]]
[[File:Fernando Collor no Pal√°cio do Planalto.jpg|thumb|right|President Collor speaking at the Planalto presidential palace, 1991.]]
Under Z√©lia's tenure, Brazil had a period of major changes, featuring what [[ISTO√â]] magazine called an "unprecedented" "revolution"&lt;ref name="istoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/economia/20061025/zelia-esta-voltando/14858|title=Z√©lia est√° voltando|trans-title=Z√©lia is returning|date=October 25, 2006|work=ISTO√â Dinheiro|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many levels of public administration: "privatization, opening its market to free trade, encouraging industrial modernization, temporary control of the hyper-inflation and public debt reduction."&lt;ref name="scielo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-71402005000200001&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=Revista Brasileira de Economia ‚Äì Os efeitos da privatiza√ß√£o sobre o desempenho econ√¥mico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas|work=scielo.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the month before Collor took power, hyperinflation was 90 percent per month and climbng. All accounts over 50,000 Cruzeiros (about US$500 at that time), were frozen for several weeks. He also proposed freezes in wages and prices, as well as major cuts in government spending. The measures were received unenthusiastically by the people, though many felt that radical measures were necessary to kill the hyperinflation. Within a few months, however, inflation resumed, eventually reaching rates of 10 percent a month.

During the course of his government, Collor was accused of condoning an [[influence peddling]] scheme. The accusations weighed on the government and led Collor and his team to an institutional crisis leading to a loss of credibility that reached the finance minister, Z√©lia.&lt;ref name="istoe"/&gt;

This political crisis had negative consequences on his ability to carry out his policies and reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unopec.com.br/revistaintellectus/_Arquivos/Jan_Jul_04/PDF/Artigo_Rangel.pdf|title=unopec.com.br|work=unopec.com.br|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326111734/http://www.unopec.com.br/revistaintellectus/_Arquivos/Jan_Jul_04/PDF/Artigo_Rangel.pdf|archivedate=March 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Plano Collor]] I'', under Z√©lia would be renewed with the implementation of the ''Plano Collor II''; the government's loss of prestige would make that follow-up plan short-lived and largely ineffective.&lt;ref name="scielo"/&gt; The failure of Z√©lia and Plano Collor I led to their substitution by Marc√≠lio Marques Moreira and his Plano Collor II. Moreira's plan tried to correct some aspects of the first plan, but it was too late. Collor's administration was paralyzed by the fast deterioration of his image, through a succession of corruption accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal-rp.com.br/bibliotecavirtual/projetosdepesquisa/0153.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201034008/http://www.portal-rp.com.br/bibliotecavirtual/projetosdepesquisa/0153.pdf |date=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Plano Collor, yearly inflation was at first reduced from 30,000 percent in 1990 (Collor's first year in government) to 400 percent in 1991, but then climbed back up to 1,020 percent in 1992 (when he left office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/brazilinfl.htm|title=The Hyperinflation in Brazil, 1980‚Äì1994|work=sjsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation continued to rise to 2,294 percent in 1994 (two years after he left office).&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0009&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Z√©lia acknowledged later that the Plano Collor didn't end inflation, she also stated: "It is also possible to see with clarity that, under very difficult conditions, we promoted the balancing of the [[national debt]] ‚Äì and that, together with the commercial opening, it created the basis for the implementation of the [[Plano Real]]."&lt;ref name="istoe"/&gt;

Part of Collor's more conservative program was followed by his successors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2006/06/060626_lulafhcpimenta.shtml|last=Pimenta|first=Angela|title=Lula segue pol√≠tica econ√¥mica de FHC, diz diretor do FMI|work=BBC Brasil|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=June 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Itamar Franco, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and Lula da Silva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:tLeC1PlPDSsJ:netx.u-paris10.fr/actuelmarx/cm5/com/MI5_Eco_Novelli.doc A CONTINUIDADE DA POL√çTICA MACROECON√îMICA ENTRE O GOVERNO CARDOSO E O GOVERNO LULA: UMA ABORDAGEM S√ìCIO-POL√çTICA]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collor's administration privatized 15 different companies (including [[Acesita]]), and began the process of privatization for others, such as [[Embraer]], [[Telebr√°s]] and [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]].&lt;ref name="scielo"/&gt; Some members of Collor's government were also part of the later Cardoso administration in different or similar functions:

[[Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira]], a minister in the previous [[Jos√© Sarney|Sarney]] and the following Fernando Henrique Cardoso administrations, stated that "Collor changed the political agenda in the country, because he implemented brave and very necessary reforms, and he pursued [[fiscal adjustment]]s. Although other attempts had been made since 1987, it was during Collor's administration that old [[Statism|statist]] ideas were confronted and combated (...) by a brave agenda of economic reforms geared towards [[free trade]] and [[privatization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Silvando da Silva do Nascimento, Rangel.

According to Philippe Faucher, professor of political science at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/cdas/members/faucher/|title=Philippe Faucher|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115160833/http://www.mcgill.ca/cdas/members/faucher/ |publisher=McGill University |archivedate=January 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the combination of the political crisis and the hyperinflation continued to reduce Collor's credibility and in that political vacuum an impeachment process took place, precipitated by Pedro Collor's (Fernando Collor's brother) accusations and other social and political sectors which thought they would be harmed by his policies.&lt;ref name="scielo"/&gt;

===Awards===
In 1991, [[UNICEF]] chose three health programs: community agents, lay midwives and eradication of measles as the best in the world. These programs were promoted during Collor's administration. Until 1989, the Brazilian [[vaccination]] record, was considered the worst in [[South America]]. During Collor's administration, Brazil's vaccination program won a [[United Nations]] prize, as the best in South America. Collor's project ''Minha Gente'' (''My People'') won the UN award ''Project Model for the Humanity'' in 1993.

[[File:Fernando Collor deixa a presid√™ncia.jpg|thumb|left|Impeachment: Fernando Collor leaves [[Planalto Palace]] for the last time as president, 2 October 1992.]]

In May 1992, Fernando Collor's brother [[Pedro Collor]] accused him of condoning an [[influence peddling]] scheme run by his campaign treasurer, [[Paulo C√©sar Farias]]. The Federal Police and the Federal Prosecution Service opened an investigation. On July 1, 1992, a Joint Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, composed of Senators and members of the Chamber of Deputies, formed in Congress to investigate the accusation and review the evidence uncovered by police and federal prosecutors. Senator {{Interlanguage link multi|Amir Lando|pt}} was chosen as the rapporteur of the Commission of Inquiry, chaired by Congressman {{Interlanguage link multi|Benito Gama|pt}}. Farias, Pedro Collor, government officials and others were subpoenaed and gave [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s before it. Some weeks later, with the investigation progressing and under fire, Collor asked on national television for the people's support in going out in the street and protesting against "coup" forces. On August 11, 1992, thousands of students organized by the National Student Union ([[Uni√£o Nacional dos Estudantes]] ‚Äì UNE), protested on the street against Collor. Their faces, often painted in a mixture of the colors of the flag and protest-black, lead to them being called "''Caras-pintadas''" ("''Painted Faces''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rezende|first=Tatiana Matos|url=http://www.une.org.br/home3/movimento_estudantil/movimento_estudantil_2007/m_9920.html|title=UNE 70 Anos: "Fora Collor: o grito da juventude cara-pintada"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903131454/http://www.une.org.br/home3/movimento_estudantil/movimento_estudantil_2007/m_9920.html |archivedate=September 3, 2007|publisher=Uni√£o Nacional dos Estudantes|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1992, the final congressional inquiry was approved 16-5. The report concluded that there was proof that Fernando Collor had had personal expenses paid for by money raised by [[Paulo C√©sar Farias]] through his [[influence peddling]] scheme.

As a result, a petition to the Chamber of Deputies by citizens [[Barbosa Lima Sobrinho]] and Marcelo Laven√®re Machado, respectively the then President of the Brazilian Press Association and the then-president of the [[Brazilian Bar Association]] formally accused Collor of ''crimes of responsibility'' (the Brazilian equivalent of "high crimes and misdemeanors", such as abuse of power) warranting removal from office per the constitutional and legal norms for impeachment. In Brazil, a formal petition for impeachment of the President must be submitted by one or more private citizens, not by corporations or public institutions.

The formal petition, submitted on September 1, 1992, began impeachment proceedings. The Chamber of Deputies set up a special committee on September 3, 1992 to study the impeachment petition. On September 24, 1992, the committee voted (32 votes in favour, one vote against, one abstention) to approve the impeachment petition and recommend that the full [[Chamber of Deputies]] accept the charges of impeachment. Under the [[Constitution of Brazil]], the impeachment process required two thirds of the Chamber of Deputies to vote to allow the charges of impeachment to be escalated to the Senate. On September 29, 1992, Collor was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, with more than two thirds of its members concurring. In the decisive roll call vote, 441 deputies voted for and 38 deputies voted against the admission of the charges of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Lattman-Weltman, Fernando.

[[File:Fernandocollor2006.jpg|thumb|Collor campaigning for [[Brazilian Senate|Senate]] in [[Macei√≥]], 2006.]]
September 30, 1992, the accusation was formally sent from the Chamber of Deputies to the Senate, and proceedings for impeachment began in the upper house. The Senate formed a committee to examine the case file and determine whether all legal formalities had been followed. The Committee issued its report, recognizing that the charges of impeachment had been presented in accordance with the Constitution and the laws, and proposed that the Senate organize itself into a court of impeachment to conduct the trial of the president. October 1, 1992, this report was presented on the floor of the Senate, and the full Senate voted to accept it and to proceed. That day the then-president of the Federal Supreme Court, Justice {{ILL|Sydney Sanches|pt}}, was notified of the opening of the trial process in the Senate, and began to preside over the process. On October 2, 1992, Collor received a formal summons from the Brazilian Senate notifying him that the Senate had accepted the report, and that he was now a defendant in an impeachment trial. Per the [[Constitution of Brazil]], upon receipt of that writ of summons, Collor's presidential powers were suspended for 180 days, and vice president [[Itamar Franco]] became acting president. The Senate also sent an official communication to the office of the vice-president to formally acquaint him of the suspension of the President, and to give him notice that he was now the acting president.

By the end of December, it was obvious that Collor would be convicted and removed from office by the Senate. In hopes of staving this off, Collor resigned on December 29, 1992 on the last day of the proceedings. Collor's resignation letter was read by his attorney in the floor of the Senate, and the impeachment trial was adjourned so that the Congress could meet in joint session, first to take formal notice of the resignation and proclaim the office of President vacant, and then to swear in Franco as president.

However, the Senate resumed sitting as a court of impeachment with the president of the Supreme Court presiding. Collor's attorneys argued that with Collor's resignation, the impeachment trial could not proceed and should close without ruling on the merits. The attorneys arguing for Collor's removal, however, argued that the trial should continue, to determining whether or not the defendant should face the constitutional penalty of suspension of political rights for eight years. The Senate voted to continue the trial. It ruled that, although the possible penalty of removal from office had been rendered moot, the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was still relevant because a conviction on charges of impeachment would carry with it a disqualification from holding public office for eight years. The Senate found that, since the trial had already begun, the defendant could not use his right to resign the presidency as a means to avoid a ruling.

[[File:FHC, Collor e Sarney.jpg|thumb|left|The former presidents Fernando Collor (center), [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (left), and [[Jos√© Sarney]] (right), 2008.]]
Later, in the early hours of December 30, 1992, by the required two-thirds majority, the Senate found the former president guilty of the charges of impeachment. Of the 81 members of the Senate, 79 took part in the final vote: 76 Senators voted to convict the former president, and 3 voted to acquit. The penalty of removal from office was not imposed as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction the Senate barred Collor from holding public office for eight years. After the vote, the Senate issued a formal written opinion summarizing the conclusions and orders resulting from the judgement, as required by [[Brazilian law]]. The Senate's formal written sentence on the impeachment trial, containing its conviction of the former president and disqualification from public office for eight years, signed by the president of the Supreme Court and by the Senators on December 30, 1992, was published in the ''Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o'' (the Brazilian Federal Government's [[public journal|official journal]]) on December 31, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov.br/visualiza/index.jsp?data=31/12/1992&amp;jornal=1&amp;pagina=338&amp;totalArquivos=660 Imprensa Nacional ‚Äì Visualiza√ß√£o dos Jornais Oficiais]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In.gov.br (December 31, 1992). Retrieved on August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Collor challenged before the [[Brazilian Supreme Court]] the Senate's decision to continue the trial after his resignation but the Supreme Court ruled the Senate's action valid.

In 1994, the Supreme Court tried the ordinary criminal charges stemming from the Farias corruption affair; the ordinary criminal accusation was presented by the Brazilian federal prosecution service (''Minist√©rio P√∫blico Federal''). The Supreme Court had original jurisdiction under the Brazilian Constitution because Collor was one of the defendants and the charges mentioned crimes committed by a President while in office. If found guilty of the charges, the former President would face a jail sentence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2006/mat/2006/10/01/285924531.asp|title=Fernando Collor √© eleito senador por Alagoas|date=October 1, 2006|publisher=Grupo Globo|work=O Globo}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Collor was found not guilty. The Federal Supreme Court threw out the corruption charges against him on a [[technicality]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; citing a lack of evidence linking Collor to Farias' influence-peddling scheme. A key piece of evidence, Paulo C√©sar Farias' personal computer, was ruled inadmissible as it had been obtained during an illegal police search conducted without a [[search warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/sf/noticia/senamidia/principaisJornais/verNoticia1.asp?ud=20060418&amp;datNoticia=20060418&amp;codNoticia=183629&amp;nomeOrgao=&amp;nomeJornal=O+Globo&amp;codOrgao=2729|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119014848/http://www.senado.gov.br/sf/noticia/senamidia/principaisJornais/verNoticia1.asp?ud=20060418&amp;datNoticia=20060418&amp;codNoticia=183629&amp;nomeOrgao=&amp;nomeJornal=O+Globo&amp;codOrgao=2729

Evidence that was only obtained because of the illegally obtained information was also struck from the record.

After his acquittal in the criminal trial, Collor again attempted to void the suspension of his political rights imposed by the Senate, without success, as the Supreme Court ruled that the judicial trial of the ordinary criminal charges and the political trial of the charges of impeachment were independent spheres. Collor thus only regained his political rights in 2000, after the expiration of the eight year disqualification imposed by the Brazilian Senate.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Collor's version of the impeachment===
For several years after his removal from office, Collor maintained a website which has since been taken offline. In discussing the events surrounding the corruption charges, the former website stated: "After two and half years of the most intense investigation in Brazilian history, the Supreme Court of Brazil declared him innocent of all charges. Today he is the only politician in Brazil to have an officially clear record validated by an investigation by all interests and sectors of the opposition government. Furthermore, President Fernando Collor signed the initial document authorizing the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collor.com/didyouknow.asp Did You Know?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221170156/http://www.collor.com/didyouknow.asp |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Plen√°rio do Congresso (20688904098).jpg|thumb|Senator Collor speaks at the [[Brazilian Senate]] in August 2015.]]
In 2000, Collor joined the [[Brazilian Labour Renewal Party]] (PRTB) and ran for [[mayor of S√£o Paulo]]. His candidacy was declared invalid by the electoral authorities, as his political rights were still suspended by the filing deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Percival Albano Nogueira Junior, Jos√©. [http://jus2.uol.com.br/pecas/texto.asp?id=344 Senten√ßa de indeferimento do registro da candidatura de Fernando Collor √† Prefeitura de S√£o Paulo]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Jus Navigandi. August 4, 2000. Retrieved on August 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, with [[political rights]] restored, he ran for Governor of [[Alagoas]], but lost to incumbent Governor {{Interlanguage link multi|Ronaldo Lessa|pt}}, who was seeking reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|author=Simas Filho, M√°rio|url=http://istoe.com.br/4924_ELLE+VOLTOU/|title=Elle Voltou|work=ISTO√â |date=September 13, 2006|accessdate=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Collor was elected to the [[Federal Senate]] representing his state of [[Alagoas]], with 44.03% of the vote, running again against Lessa. The following year he abandoned PRTB and switched to the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u84430.shtml|title=Ap√≥s 14 anos de sua ren√∫ncia, Collor volta a Bras√≠lia como senador|work=Folha de S.Paulo|date=October 10, 2006|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Collor has been, since March 2009, Chairman of the Senate Infrastructure Commission. Collor ran again for Governor of Alagoas in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/05/10/fernando-collor-confirma-pre-candidatura-ao-governo-de-alagoas-916540689.asp|title=Fernando Collor confirma pr√©-candidatura ao governo de Alagoas|work=O Globo|publisher=Grupo Globo |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he lost the race, finishing a narrow third after Lessa and incumbent [[Teotonio Vilela Filho]], thus eliminated from the runoff. This was Collor's second electoral loss.

In 2014, Collor was re-elected to the Senate with 55% of the vote.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/al/alagoas/eleicoes/2014/noticia/2014/10/fernando-collor-ptb-e-reeleito-senador-pelo-estado-de-alagoas.html|title=Fernando Collor, PTB, √© reeleito senador pelo estado de Alagoas|publisher=Grupo Globo|work=G1|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2015, Collor was charged by the [[Prosecutor General of Brazil]] with corruption, as a development of [[Operation Car Wash]] ({{lang-pt|Opera√ß√£o Lava Jato}}). Details of the charge were kept under wraps so as not to jeopardize the investigation.&lt;ref name=nyt2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/08/20/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-corruption.html|title=Brazil House Leader, Ex-President Hit With Corruption Charges|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 21, 2015|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016 Collor abandoned PTB and joined the [[Christian Labour Party]] (PTC), a small christian democratic party which had no representatives in the Congress at the time. Collor also voted to impeach Rousseff as Senator.

In August 2017, Collor was accused by the Brazil's [[Supreme Federal Court]] of receiving around US$9 million in bribes between 2010 and 2014 from [[Petrobras]] subsidiary BR Distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Five Eyes''', often abbreviated as '''FVEY''', is an [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries are parties to the multilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]], a treaty for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]].&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://cdfai.org.previewmysite.com/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=2 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105224/http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=[[United States Department of the Navy]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201113535/http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=1 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to the post‚Äì[[World War II]] period, when the [[Atlantic Charter]] was issued by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the [[Cold War]], the [[ECHELON]] surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]], although it is now used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asser|first=Martin|title=Echelon: Big brother without a cause?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/820758.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=6 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the [[European Parliament]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[United States Congress]]. As part of efforts in the ongoing [[War on Terror]] since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the [[World Wide Web]]. The former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] described the Five Eyes as a "[[Supranational union|supra-national]] intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries".&lt;ref name="ndr" /&gt; Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on surveillance of citizens.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;

In spite of continued controversy over its methods, the Five Eyes relationship remains one of the most comprehensive known espionage alliances in history.&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Nick|title=Experts say US spy alliance will survive Snowden|url=https://news.yahoo.com/experts-us-spy-alliance-survive-snowden-104228309.html|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins (1940s‚Äì1950s) ===
[[File:UKUSA1.jpg|thumb|border|The cover page of the first version of the secret [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1946, which was disclosed to the public in 2011.]]
The origins of the Five Eyes alliance can be traced back to the [[Atlantic Charter]], which was issued in August 1941 to lay out the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] goals for the [[post-war]] world. On 17 May 1943, the British‚ÄìU.S. Communication Intelligence Agreement, also known as the [[BRUSA Agreement]], was signed by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States|U.S.]] governments to facilitate co-operation between the [[US War Department|U.S. War Department]] and the British [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]]. On 5 March 1946, the [[secret treaty]] was formalized as the [[UKUSA Agreement]], which forms the basis for all [[signal intelligence]] cooperation between the NSA and the GCHQ to this day.&lt;ref name=guardian5eye&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Paul|title=History of 5-Eyes ‚Äì explainer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/history-of-5-eyes-explainer|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=norton5&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the treaty was extended to include Canada, followed by Norway (1952), Denmark (1954), [[West Germany]] (1955), Australia (1956), and New Zealand (1956).&lt;ref name=norton5 /&gt; These countries participated in the alliance as "third parties". By 1955, the formal status of the remaining Five Eyes countries was officially acknowledged in a newer version of the UKUSA Agreement that contained the following statement:

{{quote|At this time only [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] will be regarded as UKUSA-collaborating [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref name=norton5 /&gt;}}

The "Five Eyes" term has its origins as a shorthand for a "AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY" ([[AUSCANNZUKUS]]) classification level.&lt;ref name="fiveeyes2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=James |title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community |url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204055230/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-04 |publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]] |date=December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold War (1950s‚Äì1990s) ===
During the [[Cold War]], the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the [[Soviet Union]], the People's Republic of China, and several eastern European countries (known as Exotics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldrich|first=Richard|title=Allied code-breakers co-operate ‚Äì but not always| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/24/intelligence-sharing-codebreakers-agreement-ukusa| work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of several decades, the [[ECHELON]] surveillance network was developed to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies.&lt;ref name="bbcechelon1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], Australian and New Zealand operators in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region worked directly to support the United States, while GCHQ operators stationed in the (then) British colony of [[Hong Kong]] were tasked with monitoring [[North Vietnam]]ese air defence networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=GCHQ by Richard Aldrich, Securing the State by David Omand|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/19/gchq-intelligence-richard-aldrich|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=19 June 2010|quote=The US was especially keen on GCHQ's station in Hong Kong, particularly during the Vietnam war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|title=Inside Echelon|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/6/6929/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Falklands War]], the British received intelligence data from its FVEY allies such as Australia, as well as from third parties such as Norway and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Jones|title=How France helped us win Falklands war|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1387576/How-France-helped-us-win-Falklands-war-by-John-Nott.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=13 Mar 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ausasis"&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Milliken|title=Canberra spy link to MI6 alleged|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/canberra-spy-link-to-mi6-alleged-1395867.html|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norsk lyttestasjon viktig brikke i Falklandskrigen |url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |date=21 May 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629035444/http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |archivedate=29 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Gulf War]], a technician of the ASIS was used by SIS to bug [[Kuwait]]i government offices.&lt;ref name="ausasis"/&gt;

=== ECHELON network disclosures (1988‚Äì2000) ===
By the end of the 20th century, the [[ECHELON]] surveillance network had evolved into a global system capable of sweeping up massive amounts of private and commercial communications, including telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic. This was done through the interception of communication bearers such as satellite transmission and [[public switched telephone network]]s.&lt;ref name = EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=11 July 2001 |format=pdf ‚Äì 194 pages |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Eyes has two types of information collection methods: the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program and the [[Upstream collection]] system. The PRISM program gathers user information from technology firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, while the Upstream system gathers information directly from the communications of civilians via fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988, Duncan Campbell revealed in the ''New Statesman'' the existence of ECHELON, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence [Sigint]. The story, 'Somebody's listening,' detailed how the eavesdropping operations were not only being employed in the interests of 'national security,' but were regularly abused for corporate espionage in the service of US business interests. The piece passed largely unnoticed outside of journalism circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan|title=duncancampbell.org|url=http://www.duncancampbell.org/content/echelon|website=Duncan Campbell.org|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, a detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in a book titled "''[[Nicky Hager#Secret Power|Secret Power ‚Äì New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network]]''", which was cited by the [[European Parliament]] in a 1998 report titled "An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control" (PE 168.184).&lt;ref name=politicaleu&gt;{{cite web|title=An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/dg4/stoa/en/publi/166499/execsum.htm|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990417064814/http://www.europarl.eu.int/dg4/stoa/en/publi/166499/execsum.htm|archivedate=17 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2000, the Parliament called for a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] on the Five Eyes and their ECHELON surveillance network, which, if passed, would have called for the "complete dismantling of ECHELON".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Parliament resolution on Echelon |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B5-2000-0290&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=16 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later, the [[Temporary Committee on ECHELON]] was set up by the [[European Parliament]] to investigate the ECHELON surveillance network. However, according to a number of European politicians such as [[Esko Sepp√§nen]] of Finland, these investigations were hindered by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Echelon and the European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00b51db9d2/Parliament-in-the-past.html|publisher=[[European Parliament]] |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[legislator]]s warned that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor [[U.S. citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McKay |first=Niall |title=Lawmakers Raise Questions About International Spy Network |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/articles/27network.html#1 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=27 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2001, the U.S. government cancelled all meetings with the [[Temporary Committee on ECHELON]].&lt;ref name=heiseeche&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|title=Echelon Chronology|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/7/7795/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[BBC]] report in May 2001, "the US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists".&lt;ref name="bbcechelon1" /&gt;

In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.

As a result of Snowden's disclosures, the FVEY alliance has become the subject of a growing amount of controversy in parts of the world:
*{{flag|Canada}}: In late 2013, Canadian federal judge [[Richard Mosley]] strongly rebuked the CSIS for outsourcing its surveillance of Canadians to overseas partner agencies.

*{{flag|New Zealand}}: In 2014, the NZSIS and the GCSB of New Zealand were asked by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] to clarify if they had received any monetary contributions from members of the FVEY alliance.

Since the addition of two members in 1956, the specific Five Eyes consist of Australia (accepted 1956), Canada (accepted 1948), New Zealand (accepted 1956), the United Kingdom (co-creator 1946), and the United States (co-creator 1946).&lt;ref name=bbc5l&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelion|first=Leo|title=NSA-GCHQ Snowden leaks: A glossary of the key terms|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25085592|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cphpost&gt;{{cite web|last=Cremer|first=Justin|title=Denmark is one of the NSA's '9-Eyes'|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark-is-one-of-the-nsas-9-eyes.7611.html|work=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is a group of nations termed '3rd Party Partners', which share their intelligence with the 5 Eyes.

While the Five Eyes is a very specific agreement with specific operations amongst the five nations, other non-FVEY sharing agreements have been set up independently and for specific purposes. For example, according to [[Edward Snowden]], the NSA has a "massive body" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate that is responsible for partnering with foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden Interview: The NSA and Its Willing Helpers|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Six Eyes
According to the [[news magazine]] ''[[L'Obs]]'', in 2009, the United States proposed to [[France]] to join the Five Eyes, that would then have become the "Six Eyes". [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] however made the requirement to be granted the same status as other allies, including the signing of a "no-spy agreement". This requirement was approved by the director of the NSA, but not by the director of the CIA, and furthermore not by President [[Barack Obama]], resulting in a refusal from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20150625.OBS1569/exclusif-comment-la-france-ecoute-aussi-le-monde.html|title=EXCLUSIF.

Freemasonry has been present in Venezuela since 1824 and has included a number of prominent politicians.

The '''Gran Logia de la Republica de Venezuela''' or ''[[Grand Lodge]] of the republic of [[Venezuela]]'' founded in 1824, is based in [[Caracas]]. 
It claims 121 Lodges as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granlogia.org.ve/logias.html Respetables Logias de Nuestra Jurisdici√≥n 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a member of the Confederaci√≥n Mas√≥nica Interamericana and the Confederaci√≥n Mas√≥nica Bolivariana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granlogia.org.ve/ History page of the Gran Logia de la Rep√∫blica de Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the split between Colombia and Venezuela the Grand Lodge was refounded for Venezuela in 1838. Its first Grand Master was Diego Bautista Urbaneja Sturdy, who had been Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granlogia.org.ve/masoneriadevenezuela.html History page of the Gran Logia de la Rep√∫blica de Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="699">'''Gibbet Island''' is an [[List of islands of Bermuda|island]] of [[Bermuda]]. It is located at the mouth of Flatt's Inlet which leads to Harrington Sound. Its name arises from the fact that runaway slaves were [[gibbet]]ted, or hung here as punishment. Flatt's inlet was not a major shipping route so the reason for hanging the slaves here was not for the benefit of incoming vessels but instead because locals didn't want to have hangings on the mainland due to superstition.

'''Greek Muslims''', also known as '''Greek-speaking Muslims''',&lt;ref name = Mackridge1987/&gt;&lt;ref name = Philliou/&gt;&lt;ref name = Baltsiotis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Koukoudis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Beckingham/&gt;&lt;ref name = Werner/&gt; are [[Muslim]]s of [[Greeks|Greek]] ethnic origin whose adoption of Islam (and often the Turkish language and identity) dates to the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in the southern [[Balkans]]. They consist primarily of the descendants of the elite Ottoman [[Janissary]] corps and Ottoman-era converts to Islam from [[Greek Macedonia]] (e.g., [[Vallahades]]), [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Muslims]]), northeastern Anatolia and the [[Pontic Alps]] ([[Pontic Greeks]]). They are currently found mainly in western Turkey (particularly the regions of [[Izmir]], [[Bursa]], and [[Edirne]]) and northeastern [[Turkey]] (particularly in the regions of [[Trabzon]], [[G√ºm√º≈ühane]], [[Sivas]], [[Erzincan]], [[Erzurum]], and [[Kars]] (see also [[Caucasus Greeks]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Kars Oblast]] and [[Islam in Georgia]]).

Despite their ethnic Greek origin, the contemporary Grecophone Muslims of Turkey regarding their identity have been steadily assimilated into the Turkish-speaking (and in the northeast [[Laz language|Laz-speaking]]) Muslim population. Apart from their elders, sizable numbers, even the young within these Grecophone Muslim communities have retained a knowledge of Greek and or its dialects such as [[Cretan Greek]] and [[Pontic Greek]],&lt;ref name = Mackridge1987&gt;Mackridge, Peter (1987). "[https://www.academia.edu/2070228/Greek-speaking_Moslems_of_north-east_Turkey_prolegomena_to_a_study_of_the_Ophitic_sub-dialect_of_Pontic Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey: prolegomena to a study of the Ophitic sub-dialect of Pontic.]" ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies''. '''11'''. (1): 117.&lt;/ref&gt; though very few are likely to call themselves ''Greek Muslims''. This is due to gradual assimilation into Turkish society, as well as the close association of Greece and Greeks with [[Orthodox Christianity]] and their perceived status as a historic, military threat to the [[Turkish Republic]]. In Greece, Greek-speaking Muslims are not usually considered as forming part of the Greek nation.&lt;ref name = Mackridge&gt;Mackridge, Peter (2010). ''Language and national identity in Greece, 1766-1976''. Oxford University Press. p. 65. "Greek-speaking Muslims have not usually been considered as belonging to the Greek nation. Some communities of Greek-speaking Muslims lived in Macedonia. Muslims, most of them native speakers of Greek, formed a slight majority of the population of Crete in the early nineteenth century. The vast majority of these were descended from Christians who had voluntarily converted to Islam in the period following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1669."&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Ottoman period (particularly following the Greco-Turkish war of 1897&amp;ndash;98) several communities of Grecophone Muslims from Crete and southern Greece were also relocated to [[Libya]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]], where in towns like [[al-Hamidiyah]] some of the older generation continue to speak Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, S., ''Language and Nationalism in Europe'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-823671-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Greek Orthodoxy]] has been associated with being [[Romios]], i.e. [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Islam]] with being [[Turkish people|Turkish]], despite ethnic or linguistic references.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Marshall (2009). ''The Venture of Islam, Volume 3: The Gunpower Empires and Modern Times''. University of Chicago Press. Chicago. pp.  262-263. "Islam, to be sure, remained, but chiefly as woven into the character of the Turkish folk. On this level, even Kemal, unbeliever as he was, was loyal to the Muslim community as such. Kemal would not let a Muslim-born girl be married to an infidel. Especially in the early years (as was illustrated in the transfer of populations with Greece) being a Turk was still defined more by religion than by language: Greek-speaking Muslims were Turks (and indeed they wrote their Greek with the Turkish letters) and Turkish-speaking Christians were Greeks (they wrote their Turkish with Greek letters). Though language was the ultimate criterion of the community, the folk-religion was so important that it might outweigh even language in determining basic cultural allegiance, within a local context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Greek speaking Muslims in Greece left for Turkey during the [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|1920s population exchanges]] under the [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]] (sometimes in return for Turkish-speaking Christians such as the [[Karamanlides]]).&lt;ref name = Poulton2000/&gt; Due to the historical role of the ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' system, religion and not ethnicity or language was the main factor used during the exchange of populations.&lt;ref name = Poulton2000/&gt; All Muslims who departed Greece were seen as "Turks", whereas all Orthodox people leaving Turkey were considered "Greeks", regardless of ethnicity or language.&lt;ref name = Poulton2000&gt;Poulton, Hugh (2000). "The Muslim experience in the Balkan states, 1919‚Äê1991." ''Nationalities Papers''. '''28'''. (1): 46. "In these exchanges, due to the influence of the ''millet'' system (see below), religion not ethnicity or language was the key factor, with all the Muslims expelled from Greece seen as "Turks," and all the Orthodox people expelled from Turkey seen as "Greeks" regardless of mother tongue or ethnicity."&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was made for Muslims ([[Pomaks]] and [[Western Thrace Turks]]) in [[East Macedonia and Thrace]], [[Northern Greece]], who are officially recognized as a religious, but ''controversially'' not as an ethnic minority by the Greek Government.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Poulton, 'The Balkans: minorities and states in conflict', Minority Rights Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, where most Greek-speaking Muslims live, there are various groups of Grecophone Muslims, some autochthonous, some from parts of present-day Greece and Cyprus who migrated to Turkey under the population exchanges or immigration.

==Reasons for conversion to Islam==
As a rule the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require the [[Greeks]] or any non-Islamic group to become [[Muslim]]s and in fact discouraged it because the [[dhimmi]] paid more in tax through the [[jizya]] and could be exploited through acts like the [[dev≈üirme]] (blood tax) which was one of the organized practices by which the Ottomans took boys from their Christian families, who were later converted to Islam with the aim of selecting and training the ablest of them for leading positions in the Ottoman society. However a large number of Greeks and Slavs became fake Muslims or fake Turks in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule. Conversion to Islam is quick and in the Ottoman Empire there were few documents showing who was or was not Muslim, the only requirements were knowing Turkish, saying you were Muslim and possibly getting circumcised. Greek has a specific word for becoming Muslim called "œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫Œµœçœâ" and the Slavic languages have turƒçiti, these practices of fake conversion were common and are a reason so many people in the Balkans have Turkish last names with endings like -oglu. As stated one of the main reason to convert were to avoid paying the [[jizya]] a (~ 20%) tax compared to the [[zakat]] which was a (~ 3%) tax. Another benefit converts received was that they could no longer be discriminated against in court as the Ottoman Empire had 2 separate court systems in which the Islamic court superseded the non-Islamic court and because non-Muslims were not allowed to be present in the Islamic court that basically resulted in an non-Islamic minority losing in court every time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1387&amp;Itemid=90 Crypto-Christians of the Trabzon Region of Pontos]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion allowed those to take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the [[millet system]], which was closely linked to [[Islam]]ic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their [[confessional community|confessional communities]]), rather than to their ethnic origins.&lt;ref name = "Ortayli 2006 89-8"&gt;Ortaylƒ±, ƒ∞lber.

Frucht, {{ISBN|1576078000}}, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt; Another major reason for converting to Islam was the well-organized taxation system based on religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire]]&lt;/ref&gt; Major taxes were the [[Defter]] and [[ƒ∞spen√ße]] and the more severe [[hara√ß]] whereby a document was issued which stated that "the holder of this certificate is able to keep his head on the shoulders since he paid the ŒßŒ±œÅŒ¨œÑœÉŒπ tax for this year..."

He sent sacks of heads and ears to the sultan in Constantinople and cargoes of Greek slaves to Egypt. |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enslaved Greeks were subsequently transferred to [[Egypt]] where they were sold as slaves. Several decades later in 1843, the English traveler and writer [[Sir John Gardner Wilkinson]] described the state of enslaved Greeks who had converted to Islam in Egypt:

==Greek Muslims of Pontus and the Caucasus==
{{see also|Pontic Greek#Ophitic}}
Muslims of [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] origins, speakers of [[Pontic Greek]] (named Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒØŒπŒ∫Œ± ''Rom√©ika'', not Œ†ŒøŒΩœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ ''Pontiak√°'' as it is in [[Greece]]), is spoken by sizable numbers along communities spread out near the southern Black Sea coast. Grecophone Pontian Muslims are found within [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]] province and inhabit the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Mackridge. ''Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey''. 1987. p. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;√ñzkan, Hakan (2013). "The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims in the villages of Be≈ük√∂y in the province of present-day Trabzon." ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies''. '''37'''. (1): 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Pontic is spoken in the town of [[Tonya, Turkey|Tonya]] and in 6 villages of Tonya district. It is spoken in 6 villages of the municipal entity of Be≈ük√∂y in the central and [[K√∂pr√ºba≈üƒ±, Trabzon|K√∂pr√ºba≈üƒ±]] districts of [[S√ºrmene]]. Grecophone Muslims are also located in 9 villages of the Galyana valley in [[Ma√ßka]] district. They were resettled there in former abandoned Greek Orthodox Pontian dwellings from the area of Be≈ük√∂y after a devastating flood in 1929. The largest cluster of Pontian speakers is found in the Of valley. There are 23 Grecophone Muslim villages in [[√áaykara]] district,&lt;ref name="Hakan. 2013. p. 131"/&gt; though due to migration these numbers have fluctuated and according to native speakers of the area there were around 70 Grecophone Muslim villages in [[√áaykara]] district.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;Schreiber, Laurentia (2015).''[https://www.academia.edu/19378744/Assessing_sociolinguistic_vitality_an_attitudinal_study_of_Rumca_Romeyka_ Assessing sociolinguistic vitality: an attitudinal study of Rumca (Romeyka)]''. (Thesis). Free University of Berlin. p. 12. "Moreover, in comparison with the number of inhabitants of Romeyka-speaking villages, the number of speakers must have been considerably higher (√ñzkan 2013). The number of speakers was estimated by respondents of the present study as between 1,000 and 5,000 speakers. They report, however, that the number of Rumca-speaking villages has decreased due to migration (7).(7) Trabzon‚Äôda ban k√∂ylerinde konu≈üuluyor.

It was also spoken in the other villages but it has been forgotten. √áaykara has 120 villages. Rumca is more or less spoken in 70 of 120 villages.""; p.55. "Besides Turkish national identity, Rumca speakers have a strong Muslim identity (Bortone 2009, Ozkan 2013) functioning as a dissolution of the split between Rumca and Turkish identity by emphasising common religious identity. Furthermore, the Muslim faith is used as a strong indicator of Turkishness. Emphasis on Turkish and Muslim identity entails at the same time rejection of any Rumca ethnic identity (Bortone 2009, Ozkan 2013) in relation to Greece, which is still considered an enemy country (Sitaridou 2013). Denial of any links to Greece goes so far that some female respondents from G2 even hesitated to mention the word Rum or Greek. On the one hand, respondents are aware of the Greek origin of Rumca and may even recognize shared cultural elements. Due to the lack of a distinct ethnic identity, Rumca speakers have no political identity and do not strive to gain national acknowledgement (Sitaridou 2013, Bortone 2009, Macktidge 1987)."&lt;/ref&gt; 12 Grecophone Muslim villages are also located in the [[Dernekpazarƒ±]] district.&lt;ref name="Hakan. 2013. p. 131"/&gt; Over the years, heavy emigration from the Trabzon region to other parts of Turkey to places such as [[Istanbul]], [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]], [[Zonguldak]], [[Bursa]] and [[Adapazarƒ±]] has occurred.&lt;ref name="Hakan. 2013. p. 131"&gt;Hakan. ''The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims''. 2013. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; While emigration to places outside Turkey has also transpired when people left for Germany as invited workers during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hakan. 2013. p. 131"/&gt; Sizable numbers of Grecophone Muslims in Pontus have retained knowledge and or are fluent in Greek and it is a [[mother tongue]] for many and even the young.&lt;ref name="Mackridge. 1987. p. 117"&gt;Mackridge. ''Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey''. 1987. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Males are usually bilingual in both Turkish and Pontic Greek, while there are many women who are monolingual only in Pontic Greek.&lt;ref name="Mackridge. 1987. p. 117"/&gt; Grecophone Muslim Pontians can also be found in other settlements such as [[Rize]] (with a large concentration in [[ƒ∞kizdere]] district), [[Erzincan]], [[G√ºm√º≈ühane]], parts of [[Erzerum]] province, and the former [[Russian Empire]]'s province of [[Kars Oblast]] (see [[Caucasus Greeks]]) and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (see [[Islam in Georgia]]).

"lack of any apparent sense of identity other than Turkish".&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, their communities are sometimes referred to as ''Rum'', although as with the word ''Yunan'' meaning Greek in Turkish or ''Greek'' in the English language, the term ''Rum'' is perceived within Turkey to be associated with Greece and or Christianity and they refuse to be identified as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bortone, Pietro (2009). "Greek with no models, history or standard: Muslim Pontic Greek." In Silk, Michael &amp; Alexandra Georgakopoulou (eds.). ''Standard languages and language standards: Greek, past and present''. Ashgate Publishing.  p. 68-69. "Muslim Pontic Greek speakers, on the other hand, did not regard themselves as in any way Greek. They therefore had no contact with Greeks from Greece, and no exposure to the language of Greece. To this day, they have never seen Modern Greek literature, have never heard Biblical Greek, have never studied classical Greek, have never learnt any Standard Greek (not even the Greek alphabet), have not heard Greek radio or TV, nor any form of the Greek language other than their own ‚Äî and have not been touched by the strict Greek policies of language standardization, archaization and purism. In other words, their Greek has had no external models for centuries. Furthermore, it is not written, printed, or broadcast. So it has no recorded local tradition and therefore no internal models to refer back to either.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakan. ''The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims''. 2013. p. 137-138. "Trabzon is well known for its staunch nationalists. Be≈ük√∂y is no exception to this rule. Because of the danger of being perceived as Greeks (''Rum'') clinging to their language and culture, or even worse as Pontians who seek ‚Äòtheir lost kingdom of Pontus‚Äô (which is an obscure accusation voiced by Turkish nationalists), it comes as no surprise that MP-speaking people are particularly sensitive to questions of identity. It has to be clarified at this point that the English term ‚ÄòGreek‚Äô is not identical to the Turkish ''Rum'', which means Greek-speaking people of Turkey. Nobody in Be≈ük√∂y would identify themselves as ''Yunan'', which denotes everything Greek coming from Greece (T. ''Yunanistan''). However, as ''Rum'' is perceived in Turkey as linked in some way to Greece or the Orthodox Church, the Greek-speaking Muslims cannot easily present their language as their own, as other minorities in the Black Sea region such as the Laz do. In addition to the reasons stated above, many of the MP-speakers of Be≈ük√∂y strive to be the best Turks and the most pious Muslims. I had no encounter with MP-speakers without the issue of identity being brought up in connection with their language. After a while the MP-speakers themselves would begin to say something on this very sensitive topic. Precisely because of the omnipresence and importance of this issue I cannot leave it uncommented in this introduction. Nevertheless, I did not question people systematically with the use of prepared questionnaires about their identity, their attitude vis-√†-vis the language, i.e. if they like speaking it, if they want to pass it on to their children consciously, if they encountered difficulties because they speak MP, if they consider themselves of Turkish or Greek descent, if they can be Turks and Greeks at the same time, and how they regard Greece and the Pontians who live there. Appropriate answers to these very important sociolinguistic questions can only be found through extensive fieldwork that is endorsed by the Turkish authorities and a dedicated analysis of the data in a sizeable article or even a monograph. Nevertheless, I would like to dwell on some general tendencies that I have observed on the basis of the testimonies of my informants on their attitudes to language and identity. Of course I do not claim that these views are representative of MP-speakers in general, but they reflect the overwhelming impression I had during fieldwork in the region. Therefore I deem it necessary and valuable to give a voice to their opinions here. Many of the MP-speakers I met deny the Greekness of their language, although they know at least that many words in Standard Modern Greek (SMG) are identical to the ones in MP. As a linguist I was often asked to join them in their view in favour of the distinctness of their language.

Condividendo la sorte dei cristiani turcofoni venuti dall‚ÄôAsia minore, i quali mutavano la struttura socio-culturale della Grecia, i musulmani grecofoni hanno dovuto lasciare le loro case, con la conseguenza che ancora fino a pochi anni fa in alcune citt√† della costa anatolica (√áe≈üme, Izmir, Antalya) era possibile sentir conversare certe persone anziane, apparentemente "turche", in dialetto greco-cretese."&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their resettlement to Turkey, deteriorating communal relations between Cretan Greek Christians and Grecophone Cretan Muslims had made the latter identify with Ottoman and later Turkish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tsitselikis, Konstantinos (2012).

"In the same period, there was a search for common standards to govern  state-citizen relations based on principles akin to the Greek national ideology. Thus the Muslims found themselves more in the position of a being a national minority group rather than a ''millet''. The following example is evocative. After long discussions, the Cretan Assembly adopted the proposal to abolish soldiers‚Äô cap visors especially for Muslim soldiers. Eleftherios Venizelos, a fervent supporter of upgrading Muslims‚Äô institutional status, voted against this proposal because he believed that by adopting this measure the Assembly "would widen instead of fill the breach between Christians and Muslims, which is national rather than religious". As Greek Christians gradually began to envisage joining the  Greek Kingdom through symbolic recognition of national ties to the  ‚Äòmother country‚Äô, the Muslim communities reacted and contemplated  their alternative ‚Äòmother nation‚Äô or ‚Äòmother state‚Äô, namely Turkishness and the Empire. Indicatively, Muslim deputies complained vigorously about a Declaration made by the plenary of the Cretan Assembly which stated that they body's works would be undertaken ‚Äòin the name of the King of Greece‚Äô. The transformation of a ''millet'' into a nation, a process which unfolded in response to both internal dynamics and outside pressures, was well underway."&lt;/ref&gt; Some Grecophone Muslims of Crete also composed literature for their community in the Greek language such as songs and wrote it in the Arabic alphabet,&lt;ref name = Kotzageorgis/&gt; although little of it has been studied.&lt;ref name = Dedes&gt;Dedes, Yorgos (2010).

"The second reason my services as an interpreter were not needed was that the current inhabitants of the village which had been vacated by apparently Turkish-speaking Christians en route to Kavala, were descended from Greek-speaking Muslims that had left Crete in a later stage of the same population exchange. It was not infrequent for members of these groups, settled predominantly along coastal Anatolia and the Marmara Sea littoral in Turkey, to be unaware that the language they were speaking was Greek. Again, it was not illegal for them to be speaking Greek publicly in Turkey, but it undermined the principle that Turks speak Turkish, just like Frenchmen speak French and Russians speak Russian."&lt;/ref&gt; They often name the language as Cretan (''Kritika'' ({{lang|el|ŒöœÅŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨}}) or ''Girit√ße'') instead of Greek. The Grecophone Cretan Muslims are Sunnis of the (Hanafi) rite with a highly influential [[Bektashi]] minority that helped shape the [[folk Islam]] and [[religious tolerance]] of the entire community. Significant numbers of Cretan Muslims were re-settled in other Ottoman controlled areas around the eastern Mediterranean by the Ottomans following the establishment of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] in 1898.  Most ended up in coastal Syria and Lebanon, particularly the town of [[Al-Hamidiyah]], in Syria, (named after the Ottoman sultan who settled them there), and Tripoli in Lebanon where many continue to speak Greek as their mother tongue.  Others were resettled in [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] especially in the east side cities like [[Susa, Libya|Susa]] and [[Benghazi]], where they are distinguishable by their Greek surnames. Many of the older members of this community still speak Cretan Greek in their homes.&lt;ref name = Kappler/&gt; A small community of Grecophone Cretan Muslims still resides in Greece in the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese Islands]] of Rhodes and Kos.&lt;ref name = Comerford/&gt; These communities were formed prior to the area becoming part of Greece in 1948 when their ancestors migrated there from Crete and are integrated into the local Muslim population as Turks today.&lt;ref name = Comerford&gt;Comerford, Patrick (2000).

As yet, the Greek state did not include the Dodecannese, and many of the Muslims from Crete moved to Kos and Rhodes, began to integrate with the local Muslim population. When the Dodecannese were incorporated in the Greek state in 1948, the Turks of Kos and Rhodes found once again that they were citizens of Greece. On many occasions I have passed the dilapidated refugee village of ''Kritika'' ('the Cretans') on the coast road out of Rhodes town on the way to the airport; in the town itself, it is easy to pick out Turkish names on the marquees of sandal-makers, or on the names of kafenia and kebab stands. In Kos, the domestic architecture of the bi-ethnic village of Platani can be strongly reminiscent of rural styles in provincial Crete."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gruber, Christiane J., &amp; Frederick Stephen Colby (eds). ''The Prophet's ascension: cross-cultural encounters with the Islamic mi'rƒÅj tales''. Indiana University Press. p.297. "The element that makes this text a ''unicum'' is that it is written in Greek script. In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak‚Äîor even know‚Äîthe official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''frangochiotika''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''karamanlidika''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''tourkogianniotika'', ''tourkokretika''). Our case is much stranger, since it is a quite early example for that kind of literature and because it is largely concerned with religious themes."; p. 306. The audience for the Greek ''Mi'rƒÅjnƒÅma'' was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called ''Tourkogianniotes'' (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith. Given their low level of literacy, one important way that they could learn about their faith was to listen to religiously edifying texts such as the Greek ''Mi'rƒÅjnƒÅma''.&lt;/ref&gt; The community now is fully integrated into Turkish culture.{{verify source|date=February 2015}} Those Muslims from [[Epirus]] of mainly Albanian rather than Greek convert origin are usually described as [[Cham Albanians]].

Although the Vallahades had retained much of their Greek culture and language, unlike most Muslim converts from [[Greek Macedonia]] and elsewhere in the southern Balkans who generally adopted the Turkish language and identity. In contrast, most Grecophone Muslims from Epirus, Thrace, and other parts of Macedonia who converted to Islam in the earlier Ottoman period, generally also adopted Turkish and more speedily and thoroughly assimilated into the Ottoman ruling elite. According to Todor Simovski's assessment (1972), in 1912 in the region of Macedonia in Greece there were 13,753 Muslim Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_zeaeTOz6YC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=muslim-greeks+macedonia&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1V_kpw_mBVBLVBR64xuBjBHHTpgA Who are the Macedonians?] by Hugh Poulton. Published 2000, Indiana University Press; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, the [[Vallahades]] were considered by other Greeks to have become ''Turkish'' and were not exempt from the 1922-1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which was based on religious affiliation (Christian Orthodox and Muslim) rather than language and ethnicity. The Vallahades were resettled in western Asia Minor, in such towns as Kumburgaz, [[B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece]], and [[√áatalca]] or in villages like [[Honaz]] near Denizli.&lt;ref name = Koukoudis/&gt; Many Vallahades still continue to speak the Greek language, which they call ''Rome√Øka''&lt;ref name = Koukoudis&gt;Koukoudis, Asterios (2003). ''The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora''. Zitros. p. 198. "In the mid-seventeenth century, the inhabitants of many of the villages in the upper Aliakmon valley-in the areas of Grevena, Anaselitsa or Voio, and Kastoria‚Äî gradually converted to Islam. Among them were a number of Kupatshari, who continued to speak Greek, however, and to observe many of their old Christian customs. The Islamicised Greek-speaking inhabitants of these areas came to be better known as "Valaades". They were also called "Foutsides", while to the Vlachs of the Grevena area they were also known as "''VlƒÉh√∫tsi''". According to Greek statistics, in 1923 Anavrytia (Vrastino), Kastro, Kyrakali, and Pigadtisa were inhabited exclusively by Moslems (i.e Valaades), while Elatos (Dovrani), Doxaros (Boura), Kalamitsi, Felli, and Melissi (Plessia) were inhabited by Moslem Valaades and Christian Kupatshari. There were also Valaades living in Grevena, as also in other villages to the north and east of the town. It should be noted that the term "Valaades" refers to Greek-speaking Moslems not only of the Grevena area but also of Anaselitsa. In 1924, despite even their own objections, the last of the Valaades being Moslems, were forced to leave Greece under the terms of the compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey. Until then they had been almost entirely Greek-speakers. Many of the descendants of the Valaades of Anaseltisa, now scattered through Turkey and particularly Eastern Thrace (in such towns as Kumburgaz, B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, and √áatalca), still speak Greek dialect of Western Macedonia, which, significantly, they themselves call ''Rome√Øka'' "the language of the Romii". It is worth noting the recent research carried out by Kemal Yal√ßin, which puts a human face on the fate of 120 or so families from Anavryta and Kastro, who were involved in the exchange of populations. They set sail from Thessaloniki for Izmir, and from there settled en bloc in the village of Honaz near Denizli."&lt;/ref&gt; and have become completely assimilated into the Turkish Muslim mainstream as Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Kappler. ''I musulmani grecofoni''. 1996. p. 86. "Accenni alla loro religiosit√† popolare mistiforme "completano" questo quadro, ridotto, sulla trasmissione culturale di un popolo illetterato ormai scornparso: emigrati in Asia minore dalla fine del secolo scorso, e ancora soggetti allo scambio delle popolazioni del 1923, i "Vallahades", o meglio i loro discendenti, sono ormai pienamente assimilati agli ambienti turchi di Turchia."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek Cypriot Muslims==
{{main article|Linobamvaki}}
In 1878 the Muslim inhabitants of [[Cyprus]] (constituting about 1/3 of the island's population, which then numbered 40,000 inhabitants) were classified as being either Turkish or "neo-Muslim." The latter were of Greek origin, Islamised but speaking Greek, and similar in character to the local Christians. The last of such groups was reported to arrive at [[Antalya]] in 1936. These communities are thought to have abandoned Greek in the course of integration.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Alford Andrews, ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, {{ISBN|3-89500-297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, there were still four Greek speaking Muslim settlements in Cyprus: Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni that identified themselves as Turks.&lt;ref name = Beckingham&gt;Beckingham, Charles Fraser (1957). "The Turks of Cyprus." ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland''. '''87'''. (2): 170-171. "While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni. This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as matter of national pride. It has been suggested that these Greek-speaking Muslims are descended from Turkish- speaking immigrants who have retained their faith but abandoned their language because of the greater flexibility and commercial usefulness of Greek. It is open to the objection that these villages are situated in the remoter parts of the island, in the western mountains and in the Carpass peninsula, where most of the inhabitants are poor farmers whose commercial dealings are very limited. Moreover, if Greek had gradually replaced Turkish in these villages, one would have expected this to happen in isolated places, where a Turkish settlement is surrounded by Greek villages rather than where there are a number of Turkish villages close together as there are in the Carpass. Yet Ayios Simeon (F I), Ayios Andronikos (F I), and Galinoporni (F I) are all Greek-speaking, while the neighbouring village of Korovia (F I) is Turkish-speaking. It is more likely that these people are descended from Cypriots converted to Islam after 1571, who changed their religion but kept their language. This was the view of Menardos (1905, p. 415) and it is supported by the analogous case of Crete. There it is well known that many Cretans were converted to Islam, and there is ample evidence that Greek was almost the only language spoken by either community in the Cretan villages. Pashley (1837, vol. I, p. 8) ‚Äòsoon found that the whole rural population of Crete understands ''only'' Greek. The Agh√°s, who live in the principal towns, also know Turkish; although, even with them, Greek is essentially the mother-tongue.‚Äô"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimea==
In the Middle Ages the Greek population of [[Crimea]] traditionally adhered to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], even despite undergoing linguistic assimilation by the local [[Crimean Tatars]]. In 1777‚Äì1778, when [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia conquered the peninsula from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the local Orthodox population was forcibly deported and settled north of the [[Azov Sea]]. In order to avoid deportation, some Greeks chose to convert to Islam. [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]-speaking Muslims of the village of Kermenchik (renamed to Vysokoe in 1945) kept their Greek identity and were practising Christianity in secret for a while. In the nineteenth century the lower half of Kermenchik was populated with Christian Greeks from Turkey, whereas the upper remained Muslim. By the time of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist deportation of 1944, the Muslims of Kermenchik had already been identified as Crimean Tatars, and were forcibly expelled to Central Asia together with the rest of Crimea's ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krimoved.ru/region1.html The Russian World: Kermenchik - Crimea's Lonely Spot?] by I.Kovalenko&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanon and Syria==

Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies. February 2010. Retrieved 8-5-2015. p. 13. "The number of Cretan Turks in Lebanon is not known precisely, but their number is estimated to be around 10,000. Those people call themselves Turks, but they are aware that they are of Cretan origin, so they call themselves "muhacirler" (immigrants)."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike neighbouring communities, they are [[monogamy|monogamous]] and consider divorce a disgrace. Until the [[Lebanese Civil War]], their community was close-knit and entirely [[endogamy|endogamous]]. However many of them left Lebanon during the 15 years of the war.&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt;

''Arabic as a minority language''. Walter de Gruyter. p. 358. "Greek speaking Cretan Muslims".&lt;/ref&gt; constitute 60% of [[Al Hamidiyah]]'s population. The percentage may be higher but is not conclusive because of hybrid relationship in families. The community is very much concerned with maintaining its culture. The knowledge of the spoken Greek language is remarkably good and their contact with their historical homeland has been possible by means of satellite television and relatives. They are also known to be monogamous.&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt; Today, Grecophone Hamidiyah residents identify themselves as Cretan Muslims, while some others as Cretan Turks.&lt;ref&gt;''The forgotten Turks''.2010. p.14. "The locals of Hamidiye do not describe themselves as Cretan Turks, but as Cretan Muslims or Ottomans. Some of the better educated locals in Tripoli have researched their roots and define themselves as Cretan Turks."&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, many Grecophone Muslims from both [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation. The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility, and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece.&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], after the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] victory over the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Romanus IV]], many [[Byzantine Greeks]] were taken as slaves to Central Asia.

He was a grandson of [[Alexios Alexis]] (1692 - 1786) and a great-grandson of the nobleman Misser Alexis (1637 - ?).  Ismail Selim was born Emmanouil (Greek: ŒïŒºŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖŒÆŒª Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ) around 1809 in a village near [[Psychro]], located at the [[Lasithi Plateau]] on the island of Crete.

Emmanouil's natural father was the Reverend [[Nicholas Alexios Alexis]] who died in the epidemic of plague in 1818. Emmanouil and his younger brothers [[Antonios Papadakis]] (Greek: ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒπŒøœÇ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ (1810-1878) and Andreas were captured by the Ottoman forces under Hassan Pasha who seized the plateau and were sold as slaves.

Starting about 1130 John and his father, who was a brother of Emperor [[John II Komnenos]] ("John the Beautiful"), plotted to overthrow his uncle the emperor. They made various plans and alliances with the [[Danishmend]] leader and other Turks who held parts of Asia Minor. In 1138 John and his father had a reconciliation with the Emperor, and received a full pardon. In 1139 John accompanied the emperor on his campaign in Asia Minor. In 1140 at the siege of [[Neocaesarea]] he defected. As [[John Julius Norwich]] puts it, he did so by "embracing simultaneously the creed of Islam and the daughter of the Seljuk Sultan [[Mesud I]]." John Komnenos' by-name, Tzelepes, is believed to be a Greek rendering of the Turkish honorific √áelebi, a term indicating noble birth or "gentlemanly conduct". The Ottoman Sultans claimed descent from John Komnenos.
* [[K√∂se Mihal]] (Turkish for "Michael the Beardless"; 13th century ‚Äì c. 1340) accompanied [[Osman I]] in his ascent to power as an Emir and founder of the Ottoman Empire. He is considered to be the first significant Byzantine renegade and convert to Islam to enter Ottoman service.  He was also known as 'Gazi Mihal' and 'Abdullah Mihal Gazi'.  K√∂se Mihal, was the Byzantine governor of Chirmenkia (Harmankaya, today Harmank√∂y) and was ethnically Greek. His original name was "Michael Cosses". The castle of Harmankaya (also known as Belekoma Castle) was in the foothills of the [[Uludaƒü Mountains]] in [[Bilecik]] Turkey.  Mihal also eventually gained control of [[Lefke]], Meceke and [[Akhisar]].

* [[Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá]] - Mahmud Pasha or Mahmud-pa≈°a Anƒëeloviƒá (1420‚Äì1474), also known simply as Adni, was Serbian-born, of [[Byzantine]] noble descent ([[Angeloi]]) who became an Ottoman general and statesman, after being abducted as a child by the Sultan. As Veli Mahmud Pa≈üa he was Grand Vizier in 1456‚Äì1468 and again in 1472‚Äì1474. A capable military commander, throughout his tenure he led armies or accompanied [[Mehmed II]] on his own campaigns.
* [[Mesih Pasha]] (Mesih Pa≈üa or Misac Pasha) (died November 1501) was an Ottoman statesman of Byzantine Greek origin, being a nephew of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]. He served as [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy]] and was grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire from 1499 to 1501.  Mesih and his elder brother, Khass Murad, were captured during the fall of Constantinople and raised as pages under the auspices of Mehmed II. Mesih was approximately ten years old at the time he was taken into palace service.
* [[Mimar Sinan]] (1489‚Äì1588) - Ottoman architect - his origins are possibly Greek. There is not a single document in Ottoman archives which state whether Sinan was Armenian, Albanian, Turk or Greek, only "Orthodox Christian". Those who suggest that he could be Armenian do this with the mere fact that the largest Christian community living at the vicinity of [[Kayseri]] were Armenians, but there was also a considerably large Greek population (e.g. the father of Greek-American film director [[Elia Kazan]]) in Kayseri. Actually, in Ottoman records, Sinan's father is named "Hristo", which suggests Greek ancesty, and which is probably why [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] states that he was of Greek origin.
* [[Mehmed Saqizli]] ({{lang-tr|Sakƒ±zlƒ± Mehmed Pa≈üa}}, literally, Mehmed Pasha of [[Chios]]) (died 1649), (r.1631-49) was [[Dey]] and [[Pasha]] of [[Tripoli]]s.

'''Green For All''' is an organization whose stated goal is to build a green economy while simultaneously lifting citizens out of poverty. It is a DC-based group that brings unions and environmentalists together to push for anti-poverty measures and a clean-energy economy. Green For All was co-founded by [[Van Jones]], former head of the [[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]] and [[Majora Carter]] former head of [[Sustainable South Bronx]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/nyregion/thecity/14majo.html|title=The Green Power Broker|last=Holloway|first=Marguerite|date=2008-12-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially launched in September 2007 at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;http://earth911.com/news/2007/09/26/green-for-all-launches-at-the-clinton-global-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Steelworkers]] (USW), the [[Sierra Club]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC), Green For All and the [[Blue Green Alliance]], a partnership of the USW and Sierra Club, have launched the national [[Green job|Green Jobs]] for America campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluegreenalliance.org/site/c.enKIITNpEiG/b.3227091/k.E4AB/Blue_Green_Alliance.htm Blue Green Alliance | The Blue Green Alliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Green For All was co-founded by [[Van Jones]] and [[Majora Carter]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after the two had become increasingly concerned with issues of poverty and crime, as well as the lack of a solid infrastructure for [[green-collar worker|"green" jobs]]. Rather than approach each issue separately, Jones decided to combine the two in a more unified vision and business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Walsh| first = Bryan| title = Bring Eco-Power to the People| publisher = [[Time Magazine|Time]]| date=  2007-11-21| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1686811,00.html| accessdate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization launched in September 2007 at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]], when Jones appeared to announce Green for All's commitment to securing one billion dollars by 2012 to create "green pathways out of poverty" for 250,000 people in the [[United States]]. Jones also added that the [[Ella Baker Center]] would continue to run a "Green-Collar Jobs Campaign" regionally and statewide in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Patel| first = Ami| title = Green For All has Launched!| publisher = It's Getting Hot in Here | date=  2007-10-01| url = http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/2007/10/01/green-for-all-has-launched/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major component of the Green For All movement is job security: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can't take a building you want to weatherize, put it on a ship to China and then have them do it and send it back. So we are going to have to put people to work in this country ‚Äî [[weatherization|weatherizing]] millions of buildings, putting up solar panels, constructing wind farms. Those green-collar jobs can provide a pathway out of poverty for someone who has not gone to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Friedman| first = Thomas L.| title = The Green-Collar Solution| publisher = [[New York Times]]| date=  2007-10-17| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/opinion/17friedman.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin| accessdate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a March 26, 2008 press release from [[United Press International]] (UPI), the green-collar job sector is growing in the United States, and could include more than 14 million workers by 2017. Although it is difficult to pin down what constitutes a green-collar job, the [[American Solar Energy Society]] said there are around 8.5 million U.S. jobs that involve Earth-friendly enterprises and renewable energy sources. This figure could grow by 5 million in the next 10 years according to Jerome Ringo of the [[Apollo Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Business/2008/03/26/upi_newstrack_business/3955/&lt;/ref&gt;

Green For All and other green-energy businesses have been receiving increased press by major publications such as the [[New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Greenhouse| first = Steven| title = Millions of Jobs of a Different Collar| publisher = [[New York Times]]| date=  2008-03-26| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/businessspecial2/26collar.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp| accessdate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USA Today]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bello| first = Marisol| title = Cities cultivate 2 types of green| publisher = [[USA Today]]| date=  2007-12-12| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2007-12-12-green-jobs_N.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business Week]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Scanlon| first = Jessie| title = America's Green Policy Vacuum| publisher = [[Business Week]]| date=  2008-02-11| url = http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/feb2008/id20080211_334519.htm?chan=innovation_innovation+%2B+design_top+stories| accessdate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Nation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Jeremy Brecher|Brecher]]| first = Jeremy, Tim Costello, and Brendan Smith| title = How Green is Your Collar| publisher = [[The Nation]]| date=  2008-03-26| url = http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080407/brecher_et_al| accessdate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the growth potential cited by UPI is picking up steam in the public sector as well.

In an interview on [[CNN]] on 21 April 2016, hours after the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s death, Van Jones revealed on CNN that Prince had secretly contributed to the funding of Green for All.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/culture/how-prince-helped-millions-and-very-few-people-knew|title=How Prince Transformed People's Lives Beyond His Music|last=Rosenmann|first=Jessie|date=2016-04-22|publisher=[[AlterNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Green Jobs Act of 2007==
Green for All was a major proponent of the Green Jobs Act of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2847|title=H.R. 2847 - 110th Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=congress.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Jobs Act, which was inserted into the general 2007 Energy Bill (it is listed as Title X), was passed by both the House and the [[United States Senate]]. The Green Jobs Act directs $125 million annually for greening the nation's workforce, including job training for 35,000 people every year. It also authorizes $25 million each year to fund programs like the Oakland Green Jobs Corps.&lt;ref&gt;"About Green for All," Green for All &lt;http://greenforall.org/our-story/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Hands up, don't shoot'''", or simply "'''hands up'''", is a slogan and gesture that originated after the August 9, 2014 [[shooting of Michael Brown]]. The slogan was adopted at protests against police violence. Witness reports differed as to what Brown was doing with his hands when he was shot to death, with some claiming he had his hands in the air. A [[United States Department of Justice]] investigation found this claim was not consistent with the physical and forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="Department of Justice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Justice Investigation regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf|website=Justice.gov|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and Backstory ==
{{main article|Ferguson unrest}}
On Saturday, August 9, 2014, Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson were walking together in Ferguson, Missouri, after Brown robbed a convenience store. They were stopped by Officer Darren Wilson. There is still no clear report of exactly what conspired between this point of the incident and when Brown was shot because of slight inconsistencies in the witnesses stories. Wilson claimed that Brown reached into his police SUV for the officer‚Äôs gun, but prosecutors were neither able to confirm nor disprove this.&lt;ref&gt;United States, Congress, ‚ÄúDepartment of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson.‚Äù ''Department of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson'', Department of Justice, 2015, pp. 6‚Äì8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the altercation near the vehicle, the official incident report says that Brown ran away from the vehicle. Then, Brown turned back around and started moving back toward the officer. Officer Wilson claimed he feared for the safety of his life, and that is when he  [[Shooting of Michael Brown|shot and killed Michael Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie, Campbell Robertson, Erik Eckholm, and Ricard A.

November 25, 2014. Accessed: August 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

One recurring feature in Dorian Johnson's eyewitness account of the incident is that Michael Brown put his hands in the air during the encounter with Officer Wilson. A typical recollection by Dorian Johnson was phrased as "[Michael Brown] turned around, and he put his hands in the air, and he started to get down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/michael-brown-shooting-police-delay-public-id-of-officer-who-shot-teen-1.2734144|title=Michael Brown shooting: Police delay public ID of officer who shot teen|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=August 1, 2016|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the killing of Michael Brown, Johnson told [[MSNBC]] that Brown said, "I don‚Äôt have a gun, stop shooting!"&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Trymaine.

In addition to Johnson, several witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown described him as having his hands up during the encounter.

The hands-up pose had been widely adopted by protesters throughout the weekend. The gesture was often paired with the phrase "Don't shoot me" or "Don't shoot us." During the demonstrations on Monday, the media first documented the posture and the phrase being combined into the slogan "Hands Up, Don't Shoot."&lt;ref name="Day3"/&gt; 

Brown‚Äôs death took place after the deaths of Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, and Trayvon Martin. In the wake of Trayvon Martin‚Äôs death, the BlackLivesMatter movement exploded in mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Darran. ‚ÄúTrayvon Martin‚Äôs Death Sparked a Movement That Lives on Five Years Later.‚Äù ''New York Amsterdam News'', vol. 108, no. 16, 20 Apr. 2017, pp. 37‚Äì39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the movement's website, it ‚Äúbegan as a call to action in response to state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;''Black Lives Matter | What We Believe''. 8 Nov. 2018, blacklivesmatter.com/about/what-we-believe/.

&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment forward, it was an ongoing protest that was only amplified by the deaths of Michael Brown and the others. Many Black Lives Matter activists traveled to Ferguson in Protest of Brown‚Äôs death. These activists claim that social media has exploded the conversation about these movements, and police brutality in general. The ‚ÄúHands up, don‚Äôt shoot!‚Äù slogan/gesture was adopted and is still used by BlackLivesMatter activists because of the synonymous origins and causes of both movements.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, Josh. ‚ÄúHow Michael Brown's Death, Two Years Ago, Pushed #BlackLivesMatter into a Movement.‚Äù ''USA Today'', 8 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
By Tuesday, August 13, "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" had become a defining slogan of the protests in Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Lauren. "[https://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5998591/hands-up-dont-shoot-photos-ferguson-michael-brown Hands up, don't shoot: The images that define Ferguson's protests]", [[Vox (website)|Vox]]. August 13, 2014. Accessed: August 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The hands up gesture used widely by black males when dealing with Ferguson police was transformed into a weapon of protest. [[Reverend Al Sharpton|Al Sharpton]] encouraged demonstrators to use the gesture by saying, "If you're angry, throw your arms up. If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Matt.

Accessed: August 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase took off more than a year ago, becoming a rallying cry for protesters and others trying to draw attention to the killing of Brown and other African Americans by police officers. In November 2014, some members of the St. Louis Rams ran out on the field during pregame introductions with their hands raised above their heads, an action repeated by four members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the House floor in December 2014.

The hybrid slogan "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" quickly spread beyond the Ferguson protests. It was often said in solidarity with the protesters in Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;Alund, Natalie Neysa.

"Those words, which rose to the public consciousness following the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, rang hollow with federal investigators." (Politico, Glass) The growing of a movement and it's ability to encompass the attention of the masses is one that has to be consistently and accurately reported on. The growing of the "Hands up, Don't Shoot" movement occurred during a pivotal time in our nation's history of police brutality and the oppression of specifically African American men. 
===Black Lives Matter===
Though the [[Black Lives Matter]] activist movement began in response to the death of [[Trayvon Martin]] two years earlier, it staged its first in-person national protest in the form of a "Black Lives Matter Freedom Ride" to Ferguson, Missouri three weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown. One of the rallying cries at [[Ferguson unrest|those protests]] was "Hands Up, Don't Shoot".&lt;ref name=herbert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruffin|first1=Herbert|title=Black Lives Matter: The Growth of a New Social Justice Movement|url=http://www.blackpast.org/perspectives/black-lives-matter-growth-new-social-justice-movement|publisher=blackpast.org|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests, along with the dying words of [[Eric Garner]] ("I can't breathe"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Protesting racial injustice while white|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/11/protesting-racial-injustice-while-white|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2015|issn=0190-8286|first=Abby|last=Phillip}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "No justice, no peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tamir Rice and the Meaning of "No Justice ‚Äì No Peace"|url=http://www.blackagendareport.com/tamir_rice_no_justice_no_peace|website=Black Agenda Report|accessdate=November 18, 2015|first=Glen|last=Ford|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2014, several players on the [[Los Angeles Rams]], (Then St. Louis Rams), ([[Tavon Austin]], [[Stedman Bailey]], [[Kenny Britt]], [[Jared Cook]] and [[Chris Givens]])&lt;ref name=Woody&gt;{{cite journal|title=NFL Won't Discipline Rams Players for 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' Gesture|journal=Time|date=December 1, 2014|url=http://time.com/3613211/rams-ferguson-nfl-gesture-fine/|accessdate=December 2, 2014|first1=Christopher|last1=Woody|first2=Molly|last2=Geary}}&lt;/ref&gt; entered the field during a [[National Football League|NFL]] game making the gesture.

The St. Louis Police Officers Association said the act was "way out-of-bounds" and the organization "is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory".&lt;ref name=Alter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alter|first1=Charlotte|title=St. Louis Cops Condemn Rams' 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' Gesture|journal=Time|date=December 1, 2014|url=http://time.com/3611556/st-louis-cops-rams-hands-up-dont-shoot-nfl-ferguson/|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bump&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|title=Rep.

On December 13, 2014 after a story about the ongoing protest, three members of the ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'' panel held up their hands while a fourth held up a sheet of paper reading "I can't breathe", a reference to the [[death of Eric Garner]]. "Our hearts are with [the protesters]" was stated, but "hands up, don't shoot" was not said during the broadcast. The gesture attracted criticism because it appeared on a non-opinion-based program.&lt;ref name=cnnunderfire&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Jackson|title=CNN Hosts Under Fire For Putting 'Hands Up' On Air, Critics Claim Bias|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/cnn-hands-up-host-under-fire-critics-claim-bias_n_6327546.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate= December 17, 2014|ref=cnnunderfire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daye Jack also confirmed this theory and said he wrote this song after the Ferguson killing, being extremely angry and confused.&lt;ref&gt;https://genius.com/8114548&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanye West references this gesture in his song "Feedback" from his 2016 release ''The Life of Pablo'' with the lines "Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us. Hands up, hands up then the cops shot us."&lt;ref&gt;https://genius.com/8663087&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{main article|Shooting of Michael Brown#Investigations into the shooting}}
In response to the death of Michael Brown, the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division#Organization|Criminal Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]], the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri|United States Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of Missouri]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] opened an investigation into whether or not Officer Wilson violated federal laws.

==== Investigation====
On March 4, 2015, the Department of Justice released their report of the investigation. This report found that physical and forensic evidence contradicted witnesses who claimed that Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. It also stated that witnesses whose testimony aligned with the physical and forensic evidence never "perceived Brown to be attempting to surrender at any point when Wilson fired upon him." The report concluded there was no justification for a federal prosecution of Officer Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/05/politics/ferguson-report-hands-up-michael-brown-darren-wilson/index.html|title=What the Department of Justice Ferguson report says about 'Hands up, don't shoot'|first=Jeremy|last=Diamond|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf|title=Department of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the report, many pundits began to refer to the "Hands up, Don't Shoot" slogan as "a lie" or "based on a lie".&lt;ref&gt;Capehart, Jonathan.

==Outcome==
===Darren Wilson===
The Grand Jury found Officer Darren Wilson not guilty in the shooting of Michael Brown after the long awaited investigation. This investigation came to an end in March, authenticated that Wilson involvement in this incident had been cleared of any legal or civil rights violations. This initiated an outrage amongst many citizens in the Ferguson community, which is what sparked this Hands Up Don't Shoot movement to begin. After this investigation came to a close, Darren Wilson was no longer a police officer for the Ferguson Police Department, and has moved away to a closely guarded residence which remains unknown. Given that this shooting has brought on a lot of animosity towards Wilson from people around the world, he did have supporters that saved up $500,000 to help pay for his protection and his legal defense team. &lt;ref&gt;Worland, Justin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson a Year After Michael Brown‚Äîand What Hasn‚Äôt.‚Äù Time.Com, Aug. 2015, p.

===Ferguson Police Department===
Since the Ferguson shooting where a police officer struck the young man, Michael Brown, there have been changes made in the Ferguson Police Department. Many officers have resigned following the shooting, including the Ferguson Chief of Police, Thomas Jackson, and also the officer who shot Michael Brown, Darren Wilson &lt;ref&gt;Worland, Justin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson a Year After Michael Brown‚Äîand What Hasn‚Äôt.‚Äù Time.Com, Aug. 2015, p.

This shooting has directed a great amount of attention to this community and the Ferguson Police Department, and in retrospect many officers have fell off the radar. Other changes have been put into affect as well, which include an increase in minority officers, and the use of body camera's when conducting a search &lt;ref&gt;Gretel Kauffman Staff. ‚ÄúTwo Years after Michael Brown Shooting: What‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson?‚Äù Christian Science Monitor, 9 Aug. 2016, p.

&lt;/ref&gt;. What led these changes was an investigation performed by the Justice Department. In the investigation, which was published March 2015, they found "a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct" and this conduct includes an immoderate amount of tickets and fine that were disproportionally given to the black residents of Ferguson &lt;ref&gt;Gretel Kauffman Staff. ‚ÄúTwo Years after Michael Brown Shooting: What‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson?‚Äù Christian Science Monitor, 9 Aug. 2016, p.

&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, a reform was put out that enforced changes to the conduct of searches, arrests, and general police interactions with citizens &lt;ref&gt;Gretel Kauffman Staff. ‚ÄúTwo Years after Michael Brown Shooting: What‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson?‚Äù Christian Science Monitor, 9 Aug. 2016, p.

. Now officers are to wear body cameras while on duty, and minorities from the Ferguson Community are stepping up as police officers to strengthen the interactions between the police and the residents of Ferguson.

"'''Hated in the Nation'''" is the sixth and final episode of the third series of British science fiction [[anthology series]] ''[[Black Mirror]]''. Written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by [[James Hawes]], it premiered on [[Netflix]] on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Mirror Series 3 Will Premiere Sooner Than We'd Thought|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/black-mirror-season-3-will-premiere-sooner-than-wed-tho-1784411507|website=Gizmodo|language=en-US|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest episode in the series at 89 minutes.

The episode is a [[Mystery film|murder mystery]], and follows Detective Karin Parke ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) and her new partner Blue Coulson ([[Faye Marsay]]) who, together with the help of [[National Crime Agency]] officer Shaun Li ([[Benedict Wong]]), try to solve the inexplicable deaths of people who were all the target of [[social media]].

The episode was critically acclaimed.

==Plot==
[[Detective Chief Inspector]] Karin Parke ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) has been summoned to a hearing. She begins speaking about Jo Powers ([[Elizabeth Berrington]]), a journalist subjected to online death threats after publicly lambasting a [[Disability rights movement|disability activist]]'s recent [[self-immolation]]. Powers returns home to the delivery of a cake reading "Fucking bitch", and sees [[death threat]]s and hate messages directed at her on social media; she is later found dead, and her husband injured.

Parke investigates the death, with Trainee [[Detective Constable]] Blue Coulson ([[Faye Marsay]]) as her shadow, and Nick Shelton ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]) also working on the case. The death is assumed to be murder by her husband, but he claims that Powers cut her own throat with a wine bottle, injuring him as he tried to stop her. Parke and Coulson visit the sender of the cake, Liza Bahar ([[Vinette Robinson]]), who had crowdfunded the money for it, and posted a message online reading "#DeathTo Jo Powers".

The following day, a rapper named Tusk ([[Charles Babalola]]), who had also become a target of online hate for insulting a young fan, has a seizure; he is hospitalised and sedated. When Tusk is put in an [[MRI]] machine, a metal object in his brain is pulled out of his head by magnetism, killing him instantly. The object is identified as an Autonomous [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Drone]] Insect, or "ADI" ‚Äì artificial substitute bees developed by a company called Granular to counteract a sudden [[colony collapse disorder]] in the bee population. Parke and Coulson visit Granular's headquarters, where project leader Rasmus ([[Jonas Karlsson]]) finds that an ADI was locally hacked near Powers' house on the night she was killed.

A [[National Crime Agency]] (NCA) officer, Shaun Li ([[Benedict Wong]]), is also assigned to the case. Coulson realises that Tusk and Powers were both targeted with a social media [[hashtag]], "#DeathTo". The tweets originating the hashtag had a video called "Game of Consequences" attached which explains that each day, the person that is subject of the most "#DeathTo" tweets will be killed. Clara Meades ([[Holli Dempsey]]), who posted a photo where she pretended to urinate on a war memorial, is currently mentioned in the most tweets; the team take her to a safe house. Rasmus attempts to catch the hackers, but fails, and a swarm of ADIs invade the safe house through keyholes, windows and other small gaps. Though Parke and Blue attempt to hide from them with Meades, she is killed by ADIs entering through an air duct.

Noticing that the ADIs attacked Meades but not herself or Parke, Coulson realises that they use a [[facial recognition system]]; Li admits that the ADIs are used for government surveillance. The news begins to report on the #DeathTo hashtag, which is rapidly growing in use. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Tom Pickering ([[Ben Miles]]) is the current target. Meanwhile, Parke interviews Tess Wallander ([[Georgina Rich]]), a former Granular employee who attempted suicide after receiving online hate, but was saved by her flatmate and work colleague Garrett Scholes ([[Duncan Pow]]).

Coulson and Li's analysis of the compromised ADIs reveal a digital manifesto written by Scholes, which is about forcing people to face consequences without hiding behind online anonymity. Coulson traces the location where a [[selfie]] in the document was taken; the police raid this location, yielding a disk drive. As Rasmus is preparing to use this to deactivate the ADI system, Coulson discovers the drive contains a list of hundreds of thousands of [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI) numbers, which can be connected to the owners' details via the government's monitoring system. They realise the list is of those who used the #DeathTo hashtag, and Parke concludes that Scholes' true plan was to use the ADIs to kill these people. However, Li ignores this and activates Rasmus' code; the system appears to be deactivated for a moment, but then the ADIs come back online and are seen targeting Bahar and Shelton, who had used the hashtag. All 387,036 people on the list are killed by the ADIs.

At the hearing, Parke explains that Blue Coulson has gone missing, presumed to have committed suicide; however, Parke later receives a text from her reading "Got him". Scholes had fled abroad and changed his appearance, but Coulson has managed to locate him. The episode ends with Coulson following Scholes down an alley in an unnamed foreign country.

As of series 4, "Hated in the Nation" is the longest episode of ''Black Mirror'' at 89 minutes.&lt;ref name=collider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/black-mirror-season-3-review/|title=‚ÄòBlack Mirror‚Äô Season 3 Review: The Future Is Slightly Sunnier on Netflix|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in October 2016, Brooker revealed that there were characters in the episode who could recur in the series in the future.&lt;ref name=recurring&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-interview-release-date-joe-wright-nosedive-shut-up-and-dance-a7372841.html|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker interview: 'I'm loathe to say this is the worst year ever because the next is coming'|date=21 October 2016|work=The Independent|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brooker, the episode was inspired by "[[Scandinavian noir|Scandi-Noir]] thrillers like the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'' and ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/09/black-mirror-netflix |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=9 September 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |title=Black Mirror creator breaks silence on series 3 episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is also partly inspired by [[Jon Ronson]]'s book ''[[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]]'' (2015), about [[online shaming]] and its historical antecedents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/black-mirror-postmortem-interview-season-3|title=Black Mirror postmortem: Showrunner talks series 3 twists|date=21 October 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a public backlash after Brooker wrote "[[Lee Harvey Oswald]], [[John Hinckley Jr]] ‚Äì where are you now that we need you?" in a satirical 2004 article about [[George W.

When asked whether "policing [[Twitter]] is the answer" to the issues in the episode, Brooker answers "I don‚Äôt know the answer!", and comments that "I think that social media is an amazing invention and really I suspect what needs to happen is that we just as a species get better at dealing with it" and "People should be more accountable for what they say. It‚Äôs just difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved."&lt;ref name="debrief"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedebrief.co.uk/things-to-do/tv-and-film/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-san-junipero/|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker: 'I Feel Sorry For Millennials.

===References to earlier episodes===
In the opening flashback sequence, Karin Parke sits down in her living room to watch the news. Scrolling below the feature about the chancellor, the news ticker clearly reads: "US military announces MASS project". This is in reference to the previous episode "[[Men Against Fire]]" where the MASS project was the featured technology for the episode. This may indicate that at the time of the flashback sequence, the events of Men Against Fire hadn't yet occurred. Later on, another news ticker displays "[[ECHR]] rules 'cookies' have human rights" which is a reference to the technology seen in the "[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]" episode.

When DCI Parke asks Blue Coulson why she left forensics, she reveals that she was the one who cracked Iain Rannoch's "souvenir folder" containing all the pictures and videos that had been taken by his girlfriend Victoria Skillane of the torture and murder of six-year-old Jemima Sykes. Iain Rannoch committed suicide while in custody, but the series 2 episode "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]" covers Victoria's punishment.

In the ending scenes, when Garrett Scholes is watching the news, the headline ticker includes "Shou Saito announces immersive new gaming system." This is a reference to the previous episode "[[Playtest (Black Mirror)|Playtest]]" and indicates that the tests of Shou Saito have concluded and his new game is available to the world. Also included is "Skillane appeal thrown out of court", another reference to "White Bear".

==Critical reception==

The episode was acclaimed by critics, who praised its writing, use of [[Twitter]], themes, acting, and final twist.

Suchandrika Chakrabarti of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' acclaimed the episode, giving it a perfect 5 rating and calling it "a huge achievement", stating "it's an illuminating, compelling watch, as ''Black Mirror'' does what it does best: telling us about human nature through the technology we wish for, but don't deserve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/hatedin-thenation-black-mirror-season3-9064021|title=Hated in the Nation review: Black Mirror's finale creates a future London where everything's the same, but feels eerily different|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Digital Spy]]'' also gave a very enthusiastic review, considering the episode "a great example of how the show at its best can merge its heady high-concepts with more traditional storytelling to effectively hold that black mirror up to our own society". They highly praised the "once downbeat and low-key, and yet expansively devastating" climax, and called the episode "a feature length story that's captivating throughout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/black-mirror/news/a811894/black-mirror-season-3-hated-in-the-nation-review/|title=Black Mirror season 3 'Hated in the Nation' review: a blockbuster with a sting in its tail|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=23 October 2016|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Chitwood of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' noted that the episode was the "most thematically relevant... of this new batch, with a direct connection to the ugly side of social media and its lack of consequences."&lt;ref name=collider/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' called the episode "an inspired, frost-fringed police procedural" and gave it a rating of four out of five. Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B+, stating "''Black Mirror'' ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller". He criticized the length of the episode, despite recognizing that "at least the story has enough complications that it never felt empty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/black-mirror-ends-its-season-solid-unremarkable-th-244826|title=Black Mirror ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller|publisher=[[The A.V.

'''Hutsuls''' ({{lang-uk|–≥—É—Ü—É–ª–∏}}, ''hutsuly''; {{lang-pl|Hucu≈Ç}}, plural ''Huculi, Hucu≈Çowie''; {{lang-ro|hu»õul}}, plural ''hu»õuli'') is an [[ethnic group]]  spanning parts of western [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]] (i.e. parts of [[Bukovina]] and [[Maramure≈ü]]).

While they often have been officially designated as a subgroup of [[Ukrainians]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ua-reporter.com/novosti/20556/ –ù–∞ –ó–∞–∫–∞—Ä–ø–∞—Ç—Ç—ñ –†–∞—Ö—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–¥–∞ —Ä–∞–¥–∞ –∑–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É–ª–∞—Å—è –∑ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–æ–º –¥–æ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ —Ç–∞ –ì–µ–Ω–ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ —Ä—ñ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å–Ω–æ—ó —Ä–∞–¥–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –≤–∏–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ "—Ä—É—Å–∏–Ω" - UA-REPORTER]&lt;/ref&gt;, however Hutsuls mostly regard themselves as a part of a broader [[Rusyn people|Rusyn]] ethnicity, alongside two other groups from the cross-border region of [[Transcarpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]: the [[Boykos]] and [[Lemkos]].&lt;ref name=EOU&gt;Encyclopedia of Ukraine: [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\H\U\Hutsuls.htm Hutsuls]{{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;Richard T.Schaefer (ed.), 2008, ''Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1'', SAGE Publications, p. 1341. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt; James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas &amp; Nicholas Charles Pappas, 1994, ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'', Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 109‚Äì110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There are different versions for the origins of the name ''Hutsul''. An explanation is that it comes from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word for "outlaw" (cf. Rom. ''ho»õ''‚Äî"thief", ''ho»õul''‚Äî"the thief"). Other explanations place their origins in the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''kochul''‚Äî"wanderer", "migrant"‚Äîin reference to their semi-[[nomad]]ic lifestyle, to the name of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribe of the [[Oghuz Turks|Uzy]], and even to the name of the [[Great Moravia|Moravian]] Grand Duke Hetsyla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosivart.com/eng/index.cfm/do/hutsulshchyna.name-origin/ |title=Hutsulshchyna: The Name and Origin |accessdate=2008-07-23 |publisher=KosivArt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these are obsolete and non-academic assertions. No valid theories have been proposed yet. The name is mostly an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]], used by neighbouring groups and not Hutsuls themselves, although some have embraced it.

==History and origins==
[[Image:Huculi 1902.png|thumb|left|Painting of a Hutsul man and woman in 1902 by [[Seweryn Obst]]]] 
Hutsuls inhabit areas situated between the south-east of those inhabited by the [[Boyko]]s, down to the northern part of the Romanian segment of the Carpathians.

Several hypotheses account for the origin of the Hutsuls. According to Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, "hu»õuli" or "hu»õani" are denationalized Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Iorga, Rom√¢nismul in trecutul Bucovinei, BUCURESTI, 1938, pag.1&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions show that Hutsuls descend from the [[White Croats]], a Slavic tribe that inhabited the area from the 4th until the 12th century, or from the Slavic tribe of the [[Ulichs]], who had to leave their previous homes near the [[Southern Bug]] river under pressure from the [[Pechenegs]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Language==
Hutsul is usually considered to be a dialect of Western Ukrainian with some Polish influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Youth organizations of Prykarpattia initiate giving regional status to Hutsul dialect |url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-158390.html |publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brama.com/travel/clark/4kosmach.html |title=Kosmach |accessdate=2008-07-23 |last=Clark |first=Kathy and Bill |date=1997-07-12 |work=Kathy and Bill Clark's Ukrainian Vacation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/galychyna/hutsuls_people.html |title=The Hutsuls People |accessdate=2008-07-23 |publisher=Ensemble "Halychyna"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522110424/http://www.geocities.com/galychyna/hutsuls_people.html|archivedate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |title=Hutsul region |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/H/U/Hutsulregion.htm |accessdate=2008-07-23 |year=1989 |volume=2 |editor=Volodymyr Kubijovyc |publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://membres.lycos.fr/bucovine/page3.html |title=Hutsules |accessdate=2008-07-23 |language=French |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521105810/http://membres.lycos.fr/bucovine/page3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the joining of [[Transcarpathian Ukraine|Transcarpathia]] by [[Soviet Union]] compulsory education has been conducted only in standardized literary Ukrainian. In recent years there have been grassroots efforts to keep the traditional Hutsul dialect alive.

==Way of life and culture==
[[Image:Kosiv Dress.jpg|thumb|Hutsul wedding dress, [[bead embroidery]]]]
Traditional Hutsul culture is often represented by the colorful and intricate craftsmanship of their clothing, sculpture, architecture, woodworking, metalworking (especially in [[brass]]), rug weaving, pottery, and egg decorating (''see [[pysanka]]''). Along with other Hutsul traditions, as well as their songs and dances, this culture is often celebrated and highlighted by the different countries that Hutsuls inhabit.

Ukrainian Hutsul culture bears a resemblance to neighboring cultures of western and southwestern Ukraine,&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/D/R/Dress.htm|title=Dress|publisher=encyclopediaofukraine.com|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.com.ua/ukrainian_folk_costume.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227124605/http://www.nat.com.ua/ukrainian_folk_costume.html |archivedate=2007-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[Lemkos]] and [[Boykos]]. These groups also share similarities with other Slavic highlander peoples, such as the [[Gorals]] in [[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pgsa.org/Towns/Gorale.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities have also been noted with some [[Vlach]] cultures such as the [[Moravian Wallachia]]ns in the [[Czech Republic]], as well as some cultures in [[Culture of Romania|Romania]].&lt;ref name="swipnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/roland/ukrainiantribes.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010629062908/http://home.swipnet.se/roland/ukrainiantribes.html |archive-date=2001-06-29 |dead-url=yes |title=Ukrainian Tribal Divisions and Ethnographic Groups |accessdate=2014-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hutsuls belong to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (disambiguation)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]].

Hutsul society was traditionally based on [[forestry]] and logging, as well as cattle and sheep breeding; the Hutsuls are credited with having created the breed of horse known as the [[Hucul pony]]. One of the main attributes of Hutsul males is their [[Bartok (axe)|bartok]], a small head axe on a long handle. They use unique musical instruments, including the "[[trembita]]" ''(tr√¢mbi≈£a)'', a type of [[alpenhorn]], as well multiple varieties of the [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]], or ''[[sopilka]]'', that are used to create unique folk melodies and rhythms. Also frequently used are the [[bagpipe]] (''duda''), the [[Jew's harp]] (''drymba''), and the hammered dulcimer (''[[tsymbaly]]'').

The Hutsuls served as an inspiration for many writers, such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Lesya Ukrainka]], [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]], [[Vasyl Stefanyk]], [[Marko Cheremshyna]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] and Stanis≈Çaw Vincenz, and painters such as [[Kazimierz Sichulski]] and [[Teodor Axentowicz]]‚Äîfamous for his portraits and subtle scenes of Hutsul life‚Äîand [[Halyna Zubchenko]]. [[Sergei Parajanov]]'s 1965 film ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' (''–¢—ñ–Ω—ñ –∑–∞–±—É—Ç–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∫—ñ–≤''), which is based on the book by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, portrays scenes of traditional Hutsul life.

Every summer, the village of Sheshory in [[Ukraine]] hosts a three-day international festival of folk music and art. Two Hutsul-related museums are located in [[Kolomyia]], Ukraine: the Pysanky museum and the Museum of Hutsul and [[Pokuttya]] Folk Art. Traditional Hutsul sounds and moves were effectively used by the Ukrainian winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Eurovision song contest]], [[Ruslana Lyzhychko]].

The Romanian Hutsuls have a Festival of Hutsuls at the [[Moldova-Suli»õa]] village
in [[Suceava]] county.

The '''Ilocanos''' ({{lang-ilo|Tattao nga Iloko/Ilokano}}), '''Ilokanos''', or '''Iloko''' people are the third largest [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Filipino ethnolinguistic group]] that mostly reside within the [[Ilocos Region]] in the northwestern seaboard of [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''Ilokano'' originates from ''Iloko'' (archaic form, ''Yloco''), the conjugation of ''i-'' (meaning "of") and ''look'' (meaning "bay"), which means "from the bay" in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]]. Aside from being referred to as Ilocano, they are also identified as Samtoy, a [[portmanteau]] of the Ilocano phrase ''sao mi ditoy'' meaning "our language here" (''sao mi'' - "our language"; ''ditoy'' - "here").

== Ethnic homeland ==
{{Main|Ilocandia}}Ilocandia is the term given to the traditional homeland of the Ilocano people. From the original western strip of Northern Luzon, Ilocandia has spread throughout the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]], [[Cagayan Valley]] and some parts of [[Central Luzon]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Ilocanos emigrating.jpg|thumb|Ilocano people emigrating to the Cagayan Valley, c. 1920.]]
Ilocanos number about 9,136,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  A few Ilocanos living in the Cordilleras have some [[Cordillerano]] blood.

=== Language ===
Most Ilocanos speak [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], which is part of the Northern Philippine subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family of languages. They also speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and [[English language|English]] as second languages.

=== Religion ===

Most Ilocanos are [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholics]], while a significant number{{Quantify|date=August 2008}}  belong to the [[Aglipayan Church]], which originated in [[Ilocos Norte]].&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435900392.html "Ilokanos."] Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of World Cultures.

==== Pre-Hispanic Beliefs and Traditions====

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, Ilocanos were [[animists]] who believed in spirits called ''anito'' who were either bad or good, male or female. These anito ruled over all aspects of the universe. For example, Litao were anitos of water, Kaib√°an, also called Kanib√°an were anitos of the undergrowth in a forest, and Mangmangkik were anitos of trees.  The Mangamangkik were often feared for causing sickness when a fellow tree was cut down. To appease the mangmangkik before cutting down a tree, the following chant was made:  

{|
|
:''Bari Bari.''
:''Dikat agunget pari.''
:''Ta pumukan kami.''
:''Iti pabakirda kadakami.''
|}

This chant calls on the Mangmangkik and beseeches them not to curse the people cutting the tree down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Florentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=85-88 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar chants and phrases are uttered to appease the Kaib√°an when hot cooking water is thrown out into the yard for disposal. The Kaib√°an can be befriended, giving luck and blessing to the person. Likewise, if a Kaib√°an is angered, illness and in some cases death would plague the person's health and family.

Other ways anitos were respected and appeased were through offerings and sacrifices to idols on platforms called a ''simbaan'' or designated caves where the anito frequents. These offerings, called '[[Atang]]', consisted of various foodstuffs and sweets, as well as cigars and [[paan]]. Atang is also offered to the deceased during prayers for the dead or on [[All Soul's Day]].

Another practice which survived well into the 19th century was 'sibr√≥ng'. Associated with human sacrifice and headhunting, sibr√≥ng was a prevalent practice in the Ilocos region. The person who carried out the executions was called the 'mannibr√≥ng'; this term now means 'thief' in modern Ilocano. Before the death of a community leader or a member of the [[Principal√≠a]], the dying person would lift his hand raised with a certain number of fingers. The number of fingers raised would be the indicator of how many people would have to be killed in order to accompany the dying to the afterlife. In other cases, the people chosen by the mannibr√≥ng would have their fingers cut off instead of being executed. S√≠brong can also refer to the practice of placing a human head in the foundations of the building to protect the structure from damage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor Apostol |first=Virgil |date=2010 |title=Way of the Ancient Healer: Sacred Teachings from the Philippine Ancestral Traditions |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hMzzcDB0OTIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=panagtutuyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLvPmE0pvZAhUp94MKHeVSD9sQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=100-101 |isbn= 978-155-643-941-4|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Florentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=131 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mythological Heroes ====

In Ilocano mythology, [[Angalo]] was a mythical creation giant who was also the first man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=C. Mateo |first=Grace Estela |date=2004 |title=A History of Ilocos: The Regionalization of Spanish Colonialism |publisher=University of Hawaii|page="40"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his actions, he shaped the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon]] mountain range, formed the oceans and its saltiness, and put up the [[sky]], [[moon]], [[sun]] and [[stars]]. The Banaoang Gap, in [[Santa, Ilocos Sur]] was said to be created by Angalo when he kicked the mountain range while sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Y.

=== Diaspora ===
Many Filipino Americans are of Ilocano descent. They make up 85% of the Filipino population in Hawai'i.

==History==

===Classical period===

From 300‚Äì200 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nydegger |first1=William F |last2=Nydegger |first2=Corinne|date=1966 |title=Tarong an Ilocos Barrio in the Philippines  |url= |location= |publisher= |page=2 |isbn= 052-000-157-5|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a migration of [[Austronesian]] speaking people from the island of [[Borneo]] arrived on the shores of northwest [[Luzon]].
They were the most recent of the three waves of migration to the Philippines known as the Malay.  Before the arrival of these people, the inhabitants of northwest Luzon were a different [[Austronesian]] speaking people called the proto-Malay group whom consist of the modern [[Tinguian]], [[Isneg]], [[Kalinga people|Kalinga]], [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]], [[Igorot people#The Bontoc|Bontoc]] and other tribes collectively known today as the [[Igorot]]. Prior to the arrival of the Igorot were the people known today as the [[Aeta]] or Negritos.

Over time, the Malay people intermarried with the proto-Malay and or Aeta people, and it is their descendants who lived along the coasts of Northwestern Luzon that the Spanish first came in contact with and called Ilocanos.  

====Social structure====

While Spain applied the term barangay to the settlements in the Ilocos region upon contact, the Ilocano people called their towns, ''√≠li'',  and a smaller group of houses, ''pur√≥k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=52 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These residents of the √≠li were organized in a class society.  At the top of the class system was a chief or ''agt√∫ray'' or ''√°ri'' and his family. The √°ri earned his position due to strength, wealth and or wisdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=C. Mateo |first=Grace Estela |date=2004 |title=A History of Ilocos: The Regionalization of Spanish Colonialism |publisher=University of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position could also be inherited and usually reserved for a male, however, in the event that no male heir was available a strong female heir was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=55 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the heir was found to be weak by the √≠li than another √°ri family would be put in place and the former √°ri family could fall down in class. Together with a community of elders called ''am√°en'' or ''panglak√°yen √≠li'', the ari administered justice and governed the daily lives of the ili and led his people to war if necessary.

Below the √°ri were the wealthy ''babakn√°ng'', or [[timawa]] in Tagalog, of who could easily move into the position of √°ri. Their wealth was maintained by their control of trade with primarily the Chinese, Japanese, Igorots, and the Tagalogs. Goods often traded were rice, cotton, gold, wax, iron, glass beads, honey, and stoneware jars called ''burn√°y''.  

Below the babakn√°ng were the ''kailianes'', a class that helped the √°ri in sailing, working his fields, and preparing for celebrations. In exchange, the kailianes were given gifts directly from the √°ri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=56 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''katalonan'' were below the babaknang and the kailianes and they were tenant farmers who consisted of the majority of the population in an ili. They largely practiced wet-rice agriculture which included rice and taro as well as dry agriculture that included cotton. 

At the bottom of the pre-colonial Ilocano society were the ''ub√≠ng'' and below them the ''tag√°bu'', also called "ad√≠pen". The ub√≠ng were servants while the tag√°bu were slaves.  The tag√°bu acquired their status through unresolved debt, insulting a member of the babakn√°ng or √°ri,  by being prisoners of war, or even inherting the debt of their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=56-57 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appearances====
[[File:Ilocos Indians.jpg|thumb|left|An Ilocano woman and man wearing ''katukong'' and ''annang√°'', circa 1820s.]]
Both Ilocano men and women grew their hair long, but tied it up in different ways.  Some women twisted their hair to create a bun, while some men twisted their hair and hid it under a [[turban]] like wrapping called a ''bangal'' or ''potong''. The patterns and colors of the bangal had many meanings. For example, red potong indicated that the wearer had killed, while a striped pattern indicated that the wearer killed at least seven people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forentino de los Reyes |first=Isabelo |date=1890 |title=History of Ilocos |url= |location= |publisher= |page=114-115 |isbn= 978-971-542-729-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the bangal, farmers and fishermen also wore a gourd hat called a ''kattukong'' on sunny or rainy days. The kattukong was made from a hollowed and dried [[calabash]] gourd or ''tab√∫ngaw'' in Ilocano with a woven interior made of [[anahaw]], [[nipa palm|nipa]], [[bamboo]], and/or [[rattan]]. Also often worn during rainy days was a [[cape]] called a ''annang√°'' which was often made of [[nipa palm]] leaves.

===Spanish Era to the Philippine Republic===
====Juan de Salcedo====
The Spanish conquistador [[Juan de Salcedo]] explored the northern regions of the Philippines in 1571, where he traveled to the Ilocos region (among other places), pacifying the North, and establishing several Spanish municipalities, including [[Vigan|Villa Fernandina known as Vigan City in the present time]] and [[Tagudin]].

====War with Zambales and Pangasinan====
In 1660, Andres Malong, a chief of [[San Carlos, Pangasinan]] or Binalatongan as it was called than, allied with the people of [[Zambales]] in an effort to throw out the Spanish and plunder those who opposed them.  Malong was once employed by the Spanish to help pacify and conquer non-Christian towns and villages in Pangasinan, however, as Malong conquered others, he realized he could also overcome the outnumbered Spanish. 

With his Zambales allies, Malong crowned himself the king of Pangasinan and sent out letters to all the chiefs of the [[Ilocos Region]], [[Pampanga]] and [[Cagayan Valley]] and demanded that they too align and recognize Malong as their king and kill any Spaniards among them.  If they did not, Malong warned that he would invade and punish them for not joining his cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helen Blair |first=Emma| last2 =Alexander Robertson| first2 = James|date=1906 |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493‚Äì1898 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/50111/50111-h/50111-h.htm |location=Cleveland, Ohio |publisher= The Arthur H. Clark Comopany|page=169-181 |isbn= 9332857164 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike [[Pangasinan]] and the [[Zambales]], The [[Ilocos]] at the time was a region that the Spanish invested its soldiers and missionaries in and routinely secured. Towns such as [[Vigan, Ilocos Sur]] and [[Tagudin, Ilocos Sur]] were quickly conquered with Spanish [[encomiendas]], fortifications and Catholic churches quickly established to subdue the Ilocano people into the [[Spanish Empire]]. The Spanish were swift in this process to stake their claim on the region's gold trade with the [[Igorots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A. Newson |first=Linda|date=2009 |title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines |url=|location=Honolulu, HI|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|page=188-189 |isbn=9715506364 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They sought to protect this trade from [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] pirates and different European powers such as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[English people|English]]. Considering this relatively recent history with the Spanish and primarily under the influence of Catholic missionaries, many of the Ilocano chiefs rejected Andres Malong's offer. 

[[File:Mercaders Ilocanos (Ilocano Merchants).jpg|thumb|Ilocano merchants in the mid-19th century.]]
In response to their rejection, Malong sent a Zambales chief named Don Pedro Gumapos, who had recently conquered the Pampanga region with 6,000 men, to invade the Ilocos as well as Cagayan regions. Gumapos and his men were met with only 1,500 loyalist Ilocanos under the command of the Spanish [[alcalde]] mayor of the region and even missionaries. As such, the Zambales and Pangasinese army quickly defeated them and marched as far north as [[Vigan, Ilocos Sur]] where they pillaged and burned the Spanish stronghold and nearby villages. With many of the Spanish missionaries and authorities in the Ilocos evacuated and in retreat, Malong than asked Gumapos to assist him in Pangasinan, where the Spanish were beginning to advance on him. As Gumapos and his troops traveled back down through [[Narvacan, Ilocos Sur]], they continued to raid Ilocano towns and villages for supplies and spoils. Ultimately, the people of Narvacan responded in guerrilla tactics aided by their [[Tinguian]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helen Blair |first=Emma| last2 =Alexander Robertson| first2 = James|date=1906 |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493‚Äì1898 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/50111/50111-h/50111-h.htm |location=Cleveland, Ohio |publisher= The Arthur H. Clark Comopany|page=199-200 |isbn= 9332857164 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This retaliation by the Ilocano people was devastating and caused more fatalities on Gumapos' army than with the Ilocano forces led by the Spanish.

As the invading army headed south they sacked and burned the coastal towns of [[Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur]], [[San Esteban, Ilocos Sur]], [[Santiago, Ilocos Sur]] and [[Candon, Ilocos Sur]]. When they finally approached [[Santa Cruz, Ilocos Sur]], Gumapos encountered a Spanish led army who had just finished reconquering Pangasinan and captured Andres Malong. Despite learning of Malong's defeat, Gumapos led his army to battle. Gumapos and his army were defeated after two large battles. After being captured, Gumapos was sent back to [[Vigan, Ilocos Sur]] where he was executed by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=M. Cortes |first=Rosario|date=1974 |title=Pangasinan 1572-1800 |url=|location=Quezon City, Philippines|publisher= University of Philippines Press|page=164-165 |isbn=9789711004583 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ilocos Region would not see another revolt against the Spanish until 1762.

====Silang Revolt====

===Present===
The mounting population pressure due to the substantial population density during the mid-19th century caused the migration of the Ilocanos out of their historic homeland. By 1903, more than 290,000 Ilocanos migrated to [[Central Luzon]], [[Cagayan Valley]], and [[Metro Manila]]. More than 180,000 moved to [[Pangasinan]], [[Tarlac]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]. Almost 50,000 moved to Cagayan Valley; half of them resided in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]]. Around 47,000 lived in [[Zambales]] and the [[Sultan Kudarat]] more than 11,000.

The Ilocano diaspora continued in 1906 when Ilocanos started to migrate to [[Hawaii]] and [[California]]. Ilocanos composed the largest number of expatriates in the [[United States]], though most are bilingual with Tagalog.  There is a significant Ilocano community in [[Hawai'i]], in which they make up more than 85% of the [[Filipino American|Filipino]] population there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cps//fil-community.html Uhm Center For Philippine Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809094700/http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/fil-community.html |date=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later migrations brought Ilocanos to the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordilleras]], [[Mindoro]], [[Palawan]], and Mindanao provinces of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[North Cotabato]], and [[South Cotabato]].

===Food===
[[Image:Pinakbet3.jpg|thumb|[[Pinakbet]], one of the staples of the Ilocano diet.]]
Ilocanos boast of a somewhat healthy diet heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, but are particularly fond of dishes flavored with [http://editthis.info/wiki/Bagoong]''[[bagoong]]'', fermented fish that is often used instead of salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with ''bagoong monamon'' (fermented anchovy paste) to produce ''[[pinakbet]]''. Local specialties include the "abuos," soft white larvae of ants, and "jumping salad" or tiny, live shrimp with ''[[calamondin|kalamansi]]'' juice.  Another food that is popular for many Ilocanos is the Moringa or "Malunggay".  It is a good condiment for meat soup(e.g. tinola)  or it can be mixed with the famous "dinengdeng", a  soup made of mainly vegetables with prawns "alamang". Most households grow this tree in their backyards and usually offered free for all the neighbors who may want them. Many Ilocanos from Hawai'i are fond of eating them. The Ilocano people are also known to be the first ethnic group in the Philippines to eat the larvae and eggs of ''abuos'' (weaver ants). The practice has since been infused as well with other ethnic groups in northern Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6txMKRYsg8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
One of the most well-known Ilocano literary works written in Iloco is the ''[[Biag ni Lam-ang]]'' (''The Life of Lam-Ang''), an [[epic poem]] about the fantastic life and escapades of an Ilocano hero named Lam-ang. "Biag ni Lam-ang" is a testament in the Ilocano literature. The Ilocano writer Elizabeth Medina is probably the most remarkable living Ilocano writer in the Spanish language.

The '''Kuy''' ({{lang-th|‡∏Å‡∏π‡∏¢}}) are an indigenous [[ethnic group]] of mainland [[Southeast Asia]]. The native lands of the Kuy range from the southern [[Khorat Plateau]] in [[Isan|northeast Thailand]] east to the banks of the [[Mekong River]] in southern [[Laos]] and south to north central [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=SEAsianPeoples&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kuy People of Laos|publisher=Southeast Asian Peoples Research Center|accessdate=October 8, 2013|url=http://www.researchseap.org/kuy-laos.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuy are an ethnic minority in all three countries, where they live as [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|"hill tribes"]] or [[Montagnard (Cambodia)|Montagnards]]. Their language is classified as a [[Katuic languages|Katuic language]] of the [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] language family and, as such, is related to the [[Khmer language]] of Cambodia. The Thais, Lao, and Khmer traditionally recognize the Kuy as the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and refer to them as ''Khmer boran'' (Khmer), meaning "ancient Khmer" or ''Khamen pa dong'' ({{lang-th|‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏°‡∏£‡∏õ‡πà‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏á}}; {{rtgs|''Khamen pa dong''}}, "jungle Khmer people"). The word ''kuy'' in the [[Kuy language]] means "people" or "human being"; alternate English spellings include Kui, Kuoy and Kuay, while forms similar to "Suay" or "Suei" are derived from the Thai/Lao [[wikt:exonym|exonyms]] meaning "those who pay tribute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Somsonge|first1=Burusphat|title=The Functions of k å î in Oral Kui Narrative|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies Journal|date=1990|volume=18-19|page=223|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/somsonge1989-1990functions.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuy are known as skilled [[mahout]]s, or elephant trainers, and many Kuy villages are employed in finding, taming, and selling elephants.&lt;ref name=Pongsak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pongsak|first1=Nakprada|title=The "Elephants Return to Homeland" Project Management for Provincial Economic Development in Surin Province|url=http://www.stabundamrong.go.th/web/train/train_9.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=The Government of Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
The Kuy are found in a region of mainland Southeast Asia roughly between the [[Dangrek Mountains]] and the [[Mun River]], straddling the borders where Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet.&lt;ref name=SocAdj&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pothisan|first1=Wilart|last2=Nantajak|first2=Art|last3=Rittidet|first3=Prasopsuk|last4=Saenyabud|first4=Budsakorn|title=The Social Adjustment of the Kuy People to a Multicultural Context in Southern Isan, Thailand|journal=Journal of Social Sciences|date=2008|volume=4|issue=4|pages=343‚Äì346|url=http://thescipub.com/PDF/jssp.2008.343.346.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2015|issn=1549-3652|doi=10.3844/jssp.2008.343.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority, over 80 percent, live in Thailand in the provinces of [[Surin Province|Surin]], [[Buriram Province|Buriram]], [[Sisaket Province|Sisaket]], and [[Ubon Ratchathani Province|Ubon Ratchathani]]. From Ubon Ratchathani, their range continues over the Lao border where another 43,000 live in [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet]], [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] and [[Champasak Province|Champasak]] provinces along both banks of the Mekong. Across the Cambodian border, approximately 38,000 Kuy live in mainly in [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]], [[Steung Treng Province|Steung Treng]] and northern [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]] with a small population in [[Kratie Province|Kratie]].&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kdt Kuy (Kuay)] at [[Ethnologue]] (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cambodia and Laos, Kuy are considered a "hill tribe" and, especially in Laos, many live in more isolated areas in separate villages and have not integrated into mainstream society. In Cambodia, where significant numbers of Kuy also live among the Khmer, they are considered a [[Khmer Loeu]] group while in Laos there are counted among the [[Lao Theung]] ("midland Lao"). In Thailand, most Kuy are more socially integrated and often live in mixed villages alongside the [[Northern Khmer people|Northern Khmer]].

== Culture ==
Traditional Kuy culture is similar to other Mon-Khmer minority groups of Southeast Asia. Historically, they were subsistence farmers and supplemented this by weaving, raising livestock, and fishing. During times of drought or when the soil lost its fertility, whole villages relocated to more favorable land. Veneration of spirits, known by the Lao term ''satsana phi'', was the primary religious or cosmological belief. In addition to ancestor spirits, Kuy believe in other nature spirits including that of the [[monitor lizard]] (''takuat'') which they believe to be symbol of fertility. The Kuy perform ceremonies to propitiate the ''takuat'' spirit and ask for fertility from nature. They would also take the tail of the lizard to use in divination ceremonies. Those of ill health would perform a ceremony called ''kael mo'' for healing.&lt;ref name=SocAdj /&gt; Those Kuy who raise and train elephants venerate their own set of spirits related to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srichandrakumara|last2=Giles|first2=Francis|title=Adversaria of Elephant Hunting, (together with an account of all the rites, observances and acts of worship to be performed in connection therewith, as well as notes on vocabularies of spirit language, fake or taboo language and elephant command words)|journal=Journal of the Siam Society 1921&amp;ndash;1930|date=1930|issue=23|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1921/JSS_023_2c_PhyaIndraMontri_AdversariaOfElephantHunting.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kuy, however are influenced by the dominant culture of the country in which they live. Most Kuy in Thailand, for example, where 20th century [[Thaification]] policies outlawed spirit worship, have adopted the local form of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and use [[Isan language|Isan Thai]] as an alternate first language.&lt;ref name=SocAdj /&gt; Seventy-four percent of the Kuy in Cambodia are no longer fluent in Kuy, having adopted Khmer for daily use,&lt;ref name=ethno /&gt; and many have all but integrated into Khmer society although a significant portion still participate in traditional Kuy spiritual activities alongside Khmer Buddhism.

Women have an esteemed position in Kui society ensuring community cohesion and spiritual beliefs, apart from their central role in subsistence food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous women and development-induced violence in Southeast Asia |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/EMRIP/StudyAccessToJustice/AIPP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
As with other aspects of Kuy culture, language use varies based on country of residence. The Kuy in Thailand have been subject to [[Thaification]] policies in the past and, while maintaining positive views about their native language ([[Kuy language|Kuy]]), most often use the local [[Isan language|Lao dialect]]. Thai Kuy are also fluent in [[Thai language|Central Thai]] and 40 percent also use [[Northern Khmer language|Northern Khmer]]. In Laos, which has the largest population of Kuy monolinguals, approximately 80 percent speak only Kuy. The remaining Kuy of Laos also use [[Lao language|Lao]]. Only 26 percent of the Kuy in Cambodia reported being able to communicate in the Kuy language with the remainder speaking only Khmer.&lt;ref name=ethno /&gt; The Kuy language has no alphabet of its own. Kuy is written in [[Thai script]] in Thailand, [[Khmer script]] in Cambodia, and [[Lao script]] in Laos.

The Kuy language belongs to the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, within which several more closely related languages, including [[Bru language|Brao/Bru]], [[Ta-Oi language|Ta-Oi]], and Kuy, among others, make up the [[Katuic languages|Katuic]] subgroup. Kuy accounts for the largest group of Katuic speakers with a recent estimates placing their numbers at 800,000, double the more conservative traditionally accepted estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, P. (2005). ''[https://www.academia.edu/1540083/The_Katuic_Languages_classification_reconstruction_and_comparative_lexicon The Katuic languages: classification, reconstruction and comparative lexicon]''. LINCOM studies in Asian linguistics, 58. Munich: Lincom Europa. {{ISBN|3-89586-802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separated by distance, geographical features and political borders, Kuy speakers' speech has evolved into several marked, but mutually intelligible, [[dialects]]. In Thailand, two major dialects have been recognized, each of which can be further divided into sub-dialects.&lt;ref name=VdHaak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der haak|first1=F|last2=Woykos|first2=B|title=Kui dialect Survey in Surin and Sisaket|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies Journal|date=1988|volume=16-17|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/vanderhaak1987-1988kui.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodian Kuy has been described as having four distinct dialects,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, N., &amp; Markowski, L. (2005). [http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/901 ''A rapid appraisal survey of Kuy dialects spoken in Cambodia'']. SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; while the political situation in Laos has made study of Kuy dialects there difficult.

===Subgroups===
Research of the late-19th to early-20th century reported that the Kuy of the time were "vaguely aware" of different clans or tribes within Kuy society, but even by that time consciousness of these divisions was waning.&lt;ref name=VdHaak /&gt; A 1988 study found that modern Kuy were no longer conscious of any clan or tribal affiliation and, among themselves, only recognized differences in dialect and national origin.&lt;ref name=VdHaak /&gt; One exception were the approximately 200&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nyl Nyeu] at [[Ethnologue]] (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kuy Nheu'' (''…≤…ô''), found in the [[Mueang Sisaket District|Sisaket]], [[Phrai Bueng District|Phrai Bueng]] and [[Rasi Salai District|Rasi Salai]] districts of Srisaket, who were "very conscious of the fact that they were different from all other Kui".&lt;ref name=VdHaak /&gt;

===Kuy in Cambodia===
The Kuy people are actively engaged in efforts to preserve [[Prey Lang]] forest in Cambodia.&lt;ref name ="survival"&gt;{{cite news

Organisations including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Cultural Survival]] have documented how Kuy people have faced [[development aggression]] and been forcefully evicted from their homes due to economic land concessions.&lt;ref name ="survival"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eviction and resistance in Cambodia: Hong‚Äôs story |date=6 June 2012 |url=http://ciyamedia.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/eviction-and-resistance-in-cambodia-hongs-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media  |year=2013 |title= The Other Cambodia: Indigenous People's Land and Rights |medium=video |language=Khmer |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2AsLch2yGA |accessdate= 9 November 2013 |location=Cambodia |publisher=NGO Forum on Cambodia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "spirit forest" is an integral part of Kuy culture, however spirit forests are increasingly impacted by [[mining]] interests as Cambodia develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mining in Cambodia: Community Contradictions |date=December 16, 2011|publisher=Oxfam |url=http://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2011/12/16/mining-in-cambodia-community-contradictions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Kuy people are [[artisans]] with unique [[basket]] and [[textile]] [[weaving]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Latin''' (Latin: {{lang|la|lingua latƒ´na}}, {{IPA-la|Ààl…™≈ã…° ∑a laÀàtiÀêna|IPA}}) is a [[classical language]] belonging to the [[Italic languages|Italic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] is derived from the [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]] and [[Greek alphabet]]s, and ultimately from the [[Phoenician alphabet]].

Latin was originally spoken in the area surrounding [[Rome]], known as [[Latium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to Latin studies |first=John Edwin |last=Sandys |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1910 |pages=811‚Äì812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the power of the [[Roman Republic]], it became the dominant language, initially in Italy and subsequently throughout the western [[Roman Empire]]. [[Vulgar Latin]] developed into the [[Romance languages]], such as [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|Latin]], [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]], and [[List of English words of French origin|French]] have contributed many words to the [[English language]]. In particular, Latin and [[Ancient Greek]] roots are used in [[theology]], [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names|biology]], science, [[List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes|medicine]], and law.

By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), [[Old Latin]] had been [[standard language|standardised]] into [[Classical Latin]]. [[Vulgar Latin]] was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and the works of comic playwrights like [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1900|pp=1‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Late Latin]] is the written language from the 3rd century, and [[Medieval Latin]] the language used from the 9th century to the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] which used [[Renaissance Latin]]. Later, Early Modern Latin and [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] evolved. Latin was used as the language of international communication, scholarship, and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by [[vernacular]]s. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] remains the official language of the [[Holy See]] and the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]].

Latin is taught in primary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Dead Language That's Very Much Alive |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/nyregion/07latin.html |first=Winnie |last=Hu |journal=New York Times |date=6 October 2008 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The New case for Latin |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,90457,00.html |first=Mike |last=Eskenazi |journal=TIME |date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin is a highly [[fusional language|inflected language]], with three distinct [[grammatical gender|genders]], seven [[grammatical case|noun cases]], five declensions, four [[grammatical conjugation|verb conjugations]], four verb principal parts, six [[grammatical tense|tenses]], three [[grammatical person|persons]], three [[grammatical mood|moods]], two [[voice (grammar)|voices]], two [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] and two [[grammatical number|numbers]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Latin}}
[[File:Linguistic Landscape of Central Italy.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The linguistic landscape of Central Italy at the beginning of Roman expansion]]

A number of historical phases of the language have been recognized, each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary, usage, spelling, morphology, and syntax. There are no hard and fast rules of classification; different scholars emphasize different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names.

In addition to the historical phases, [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] refers to the styles used by the writers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as by Protestant scholars from [[Late Antiquity]] onward.

After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476, and Germanic kingdoms took its place, the [[Germanic people]] adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Old Latin===
{{Main|Old Latin}}
The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, which was spoken from the [[Roman Kingdom]] to the later part of the [[Roman Republic]] period. It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] was devised from the [[Etruscan alphabet]]. The writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a [[boustrophedon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|1996|pp=533‚Äì4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Collier's Encyclopedia: With Bibliography and Index|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H9xLAQAAMAAJ|publisher = Collier|date = 1958-01-01|language = en|page = 412|quote = In Italy, all alphabets were originally written from right to left; the oldest Latin inscription, which appears on the lapis niger of the seventh century BC, is in bustrophedon, but all other early Latin inscriptions run from right to left.}}&lt;/ref&gt; script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Sacks |year=2003 |title=Language Visible: Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z |location=London |publisher= Broadway Books |page=80|isbn=0-7679-1172-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Latin===
{{Main|Classical Latin}}
During the late republic and into the first years of the empire, a new Classical Latin arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other [[literate]] men, who wrote the great works of [[classical literature]], which were taught in [[grammar]] and [[rhetoric]] schools. Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such [[Roman school|schools]], which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=3|title=From Latin to modern French with especial consideration of Anglo-Norman; phonology and morphology|first=Mildred K |last=Pope|authorlink=Mildred Pope|location=Manchester|publisher=Manchester university press|series=Publications of the University of Manchester, no. 229. French series, no. 6| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Source book of the history of education for the Greek and Roman period|first=Paul|last=Monroe|location=London, New York|publisher=[[Macmillan &amp; Co.]]|year=1902|pages=346‚Äì352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulgar Latin===
{{Main|Vulgar Latin|Late Latin}}

Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of [[Plautus]], which contain snippets of everyday speech, indicates that a spoken language, Vulgar Latin (termed {{lang|la|sermo vulgi}}, "the speech of the masses", by [[Cicero]]), existed concurrently with literate Classical Latin. The informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herman|Wright|2000|pp=17‚Äì18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically. On the contrary, romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herman|Wright|2000|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[decline of the Roman Empire]] meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin, a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time. It was more in line with everyday speech, not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Despite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian (Roman Catholic) culture. It was not until the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish conquest of Spain]] in 711 cut off communications between the major Romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pei |first1=Mario |last2=Gaeng |first2=Paul A. |title=The story of Latin and the Romance languages |edition=1st |year=1976 |pages=76‚Äì81 |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-013312-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become [[Romanian language|Romanian]] diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely cut off from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire.

One key marker of whether a given Romance feature was found in Vulgar Latin is to compare it with its parallel in Classical Latin. If it was not preferred in Classical Latin, then it most likely came from the undocumented contemporaneous Vulgar Latin. For example, the Romance for "horse" (Italian {{lang|it|cavallo}}, French {{lang|fr|cheval}}, Spanish {{lang|es|caballo}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|cavalo}} and Romanian {{lang|ro|cal}}) came from Latin {{lang|la|caballus}}. However, Classical Latin used {{lang|la|equus}}. Therefore {{lang|la|caballus}} was most likely the spoken form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herman|Wright|2000|pp=1‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulgar Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest, when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear. They were, throughout the period, confined to everyday speech, as Medieval Latin was used for writing.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Medieval Latin===
{{Main|Medieval Latin}}
[[File:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|The Latin Malmesbury [[Bible]] from 1407.]]
Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its allies.

Without the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity, medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin ''sum'' and ''eram'' are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses. Medieval Latin might use ''fui'' and ''fueram'' instead.&lt;ref name=thorley13-15&gt;{{cite book|pages=13‚Äì15|title=Documents in medieval Latin|first=Moe|last=Elabani|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1998|isbn=0-472-08567-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular. Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.&lt;ref name=thorley13-15/&gt;

===Renaissance Latin===
{{Main|Renaissance Latin}}
[[File:Incunabula distribution by language.png|thumb|Most 15th-century printed books ([[incunabula]]) were in Latin, with the [[vernacular language]]s playing only a secondary role.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |work= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Renaissance]] briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanists]]. Often led by members of the clergy, they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature. They strove to preserve what they could and restore Latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts. By no later than the 15th century they had replaced Medieval Latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities, who attempted, by scholarship, to discover what the classical language had been.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===New Latin===
{{main|New Latin}}
During the Early Modern Age, Latin still was the most important language of culture in Europe. Therefore, until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin. Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in [[French language|French]] and later just native or other languages.

===Contemporary Latin===
{{Main|Contemporary Latin}}

[[File:Wallsend platfom 2 02.jpg|thumb|The signs at [[Wallsend Metro station]] are in [[English language|English]] and Latin as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the [[Roman Empire]].]]

The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the [[Catholic Church]]. Latin remains the language of the [[Roman Rite]]; the [[Tridentine Mass]] is celebrated in Latin. Although the [[Mass of Paul VI]] is usually celebrated in the local [[vernacular language]], it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the [[Holy See]], the primary language of its [[public journal]], the {{lang|la|[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]}}, and the working language of the [[Roman Rota]]. [[Vatican City]] is also home to the world's only [[automatic teller machine]] that gives instructions in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Malcolm |title=Pope's Latinist pronounces death of a language |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1540843/Popes-Latinist-pronounces-death-of-a-language.html |journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 January 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2009 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[pontifical university|pontifical universities]] postgraduate courses of [[Canon law]] are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language.

In the [[Anglican Church]], after the publication of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' of 1559, a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use at universities such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and the leading "public schools" ([[United Kingdom|English]] private academies), where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Latin1560/BCP_Latin1560.htm |title=Liber Precum Publicarum, The Book of Common Prayer in Latin (1560). Society of Archbishop Justus, resources, Book of Common Prayer, Latin, 1560. Retrieved 22 May 2012 |publisher=Justus.anglican.org |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been several Latin translations since. Most recently, a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Latin1979/Latin_1979.htm |title=Society of Archbishop Justus, resources, Book of Common Prayer, Latin, 1979. Retrieved 22 May 2012 |publisher=Justus.anglican.org |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Former logo of the European Council and Council of the European Union (2009).svg|thumb|right|The polyglot [[European Union]] has adopted Latin names in the logos of some of its institutions for the sake of linguistic compromise, an "ecumenical nationalism" common to most of the continent and as a sign of the continent's heritage (such as the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]]: {{lang|la|Consilium}})]]

[[Switzerland]] has adopted the country's Latin short name {{lang|la|Helvetia}} on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's [[Languages of Switzerland|four official languages]]. For a similar reason, it adopted the international vehicle and internet code ''CH'', which stands for {{lang|la|Conf≈ìderatio Helvetica}}, the country's full Latin name.

[[Canada]]'s motto {{lang|la|A mari usque ad mare}} ("from sea to sea") and most [[list of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial mottos]] are also in Latin. The [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Canadian Victoria Cross]] is modelled after the British [[Victoria Cross]] which has the inscription "For Valour". Because Canada is officially bilingual, the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin {{lang|la|Pro Valore}}.

Several [[list of U.S. state and territory mottos|states of the United States have Latin mottos]]: such as [[Connecticut]]'s motto {{lang|la|Qui transtulit sustinet}} ("He who transplanted sustains"); [[Kansas]]'s {{lang|la|[[Per aspera ad astra|Ad astra per aspera]]}} ("To the stars through hardships"); [[Michigan]]'s {{lang|la|Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice}} ("If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you"); [[Missouri]]'s {{lang|la|[[Salus populi suprema lex esto]]}} ("The health of the people should be the highest law"); [[North Carolina]]'s {{lang|la|[[Esse Quam Videri|Esse quam videri]]}} ("To be rather than to seem"); [[Virginia]]'s {{lang|la|[[Sic semper tyrannis]]}} ("Thus always to tyrants"); and [[West Virginia]]'s {{lang|la|[[Montani Semper Liberi|Montani semper liberi]]}} ("Mountaineers are always free").

Many military organizations today have Latin mottos, such as {{lang|la|[[Semper Paratus|Semper paratus]]}} ("always ready"), the motto of the [[United States Coast Guard]]; {{lang|la|[[Semper Fidelis|Semper fidelis]]}} ("always faithful"), the motto of the [[United States Marine Corps]]; and {{lang|la|[[Per ardua ad astra]]}} ("Through adversity/struggle to the stars"), the motto of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).

Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example [[Harvard University]]'s motto is {{lang|la|[[Veritas]]}} ("truth"). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue. [[Hampden-Sydney College]] has ''Huc venite iuvenes ut exeatis viri'' ("Come here as boys so you may leave as men") as its motto, as the continued instruction of Latin is seen as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education. Latin is taught at many high schools, especially in Europe and the Americas. It is most common in British [[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] and [[grammar school]]s, the Italian {{lang|it|[[liceo classico]]}} and {{lang|it|[[liceo scientifico]]}}, the German {{lang|de|Humanistisches [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]}} and the Dutch {{lang|nl|[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]}}. In the [[United States]], it is taught at [[Baltimore City College]], [[Boston Latin Academy]], [[Boston Latin School]], [[Brooklyn Latin School]], [[Pope John Paul II High School (Tennessee)|Pope John Paul II High School]], [[Central High School of Philadelphia]], [[English High School of Boston]], [[Norwell High School (Massachusetts)]], [[Oak Hall School]], and many other public and private schools.

Some films of ancient settings, such as ''[[Sebastiane]]'' and ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', have been made with dialogue in Latin for the sake of realism. Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/[[television]] series as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' ("[[Jughead (Lost)|Jughead]]"). Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin. There are also [[list of songs with Latin lyrics|songs written with Latin lyrics]]. The libretto for the opera-oratorio {{lang|la|[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]}} by [[Igor Stravinsky]] is in Latin.

Occasionally, some media outlets, targeting enthusiasts, broadcast in Latin. Notable examples include [[Radio Bremen]] in [[Germany]], [[YLE]] radio in [[Finland]], and Vatican Radio &amp; Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiobremen.de/nachrichten/latein/ |title=Latein: Nuntii Latini mensis lunii 2010: Lateinischer Monats r√ºckblick |publisher=Radio Bremen |language=Latin |accessdate=16 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618130408/http://www.radiobremen.de/nachrichten/latein/ |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6079852.stm |title=Finland makes Latin the King|last=Dymond|first=Jonny|date=24 October 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yle.fi/radio1/tiede/nuntii_latini/ |title=Nuntii Latini |publisher=YLE Radio 1 |language=Latin |accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts. The [[Latin Wikipedia]] has more than 100,000 articles written in Latin.

==Legacy==
The language has been passed down through various forms.

===Inscriptions===
Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the {{lang|la|[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]}} (CIL). Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the [[provenance]] and relevant information. The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of [[epigraphy]]. About 270,000 inscriptions are known.

===Literature===
[[File:Commentarii de Bello Gallico.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|[[Julius Caesar]]'s {{lang|la|[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]}} is one of the most famous classical Latin texts of the Golden Age of Latin. The unvarnished, journalistic style of this [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] general has long been taught as a model of the urbane Latin officially spoken and written in the [[floruit]] of the [[Roman Republic]].]]
The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in [[philology]]. They are in part the subject matter of the field of [[classics]]. Their works were published in [[manuscript]] form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the [[Loeb Classical Library]], published by [[Harvard University Press]], or the [[Oxford Classical Texts]], published by [[Oxford University Press]].

[[Latin translations of modern literature]] such as ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''[[Paddington Bear]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Asterix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Walter the Farting Dog]]'', {{lang|fr|[[The Little Prince|Le Petit Prince]]}}, ''[[Max and Moritz]]'', ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'', ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'', and a book of fairy tales, "{{lang|la|fabulae mirabiles}}", are intended to garner popular interest in the language. Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as [[Meissner's Latin Phrasebook]].

===Influence on present-day languages===
The [[Latin influence in English]] has been significant at all stages of its insular development. In the [[Middle Ages]], borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in the 6th century or indirectly after the [[Norman Conquest]], through the [[Anglo-Norman language]]. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed "[[inkhorn term]]s", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink. Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten, but some useful ones survived, such as 'imbibe' and 'extrapolate'. Many of the most common [[polysyllabic]] English words are of Latin origin through the medium of [[Old French]]. Romance words make respectively 59%, 20% and 14% of [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] vocabularies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkenstaedt |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter Wolff |title=Ordered Profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon |publisher=C. Winter |year=1973 |isbn=3-533-02253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uwe P√∂rksen, German Academy for Language and Literature‚Äôs Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, G√∂ttingen 2008, pp. 121-130)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/475024/Van_der_Sijs_Loanwords_in_the_World's_Languages.pdf|title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook |page=[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 370] |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included.

The influence of Roman governance and [[Roman technology]] on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, [[Linnaean taxonomy|the Linnaean system]] of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by [[Pliny the Elder]]. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as [[Galen]], established that today's [[medical terminology]] would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on [[scientific terminology]] as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long [[list of Latin legal terms]].

A few [[international auxiliary language]]s have been heavily influenced by Latin. [[Interlingua]] is sometimes considered a simplified, modern version of the language.{{Dubious|date=January 2017}} [[Latino sine Flexione]], popular in the early 20th century, is Latin with its inflections stripped away, among other grammatical changes.

One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin (comparing [[phonology]], [[inflection]], [[discourse]], [[syntax]], [[vocabulary]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) indicated the following percentages (the higher the percentage, the greater the distance from Latin): [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] 8%, [[Italian language|Italian]] 12%, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 20%, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 23.5%, [[Occitan language|Occitan]] 25%, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] 31%, and [[French language|French]] 44%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Story of Language |last=Pei |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Pei |year=1949 |isbn=03-9700-400-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

Throughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles. [[Instruction in Latin]] is an essential aspect. In today's world, a large number of Latin students in the US learn from ''Wheelock's Latin: The Classic Introductory Latin Course, Based on Ancient Authors''. This book, first published in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelockslatin.com/ | title=The Official Wheelock's Latin Series Website | first=Richard A. | last=LaFleur | year=2011 | publisher=The Official Wheelock's Latin Series Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Frederic M. Wheelock]], who received a PhD from Harvard University. ''Wheelock's Latin'' has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses.

The [[Living Latin]] movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available at the Vatican and at some institutions in the US, such as the [[University of Kentucky]] and [[Iowa State University]]. The British [[Cambridge University Press]] is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the [[Cambridge Latin Course]] series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell &amp; Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called [[Minimus]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Classical Association]] encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants. The [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgescp.com/ |title=University of Cambridge School Classics Project ‚Äì Latin Course |publisher=Cambridgescp.com |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Open University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a297.htm |title=Open University Undergraduate Course ‚Äì Reading classical Latin |publisher=.open.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of prestigious independent schools, for example [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], [[Merchant Taylor‚Äôs School]], Via Facilis and [[Rugby School|Rugby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinprogramme.co.uk/ |title=The Latin Programme ‚Äì Via Facilis |publisher=Thelatinprogramme.co.uk |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a London-based charity, run Latin courses. In the [[United States]] and in [[Canada]], the [[American Classical League]] supports every effort to further the study of classics. Its subsidiaries include the [[National Junior Classical League]] (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the [[National Senior Classical League]], which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college. The league also sponsors the [[National Latin Exam]]. Classicist [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] wrote in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.&lt;ref name="timesonline train the brain"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2006/07/does_latin_trai.html | title=Does Latin "train the brain"? | work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]] | date=10 July 2006 | accessdate=20 December 2011 | author=Beard, Mary | quote=No, you learn Latin because of what was written in it ‚Äì and because of the sexual side of life direct access that Latin gives you to a literary tradition that lies at the very heart (not just at the root) of Western culture. | authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114185439/http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2006/07/does_latin_trai.html | archivedate=14 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between [[letter case|uppercase and lowercase]], and the letters {{angbr|J U W}} did not exist. In place of {{angbr|J U}}, {{angbr|I V}} were used, respectively; {{angbr|I V}} represented both vowels and consonants. Most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase, as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article.

The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts, however, normally use {{angbr|i u}} in place of Classical-era {{angbr|i v}}. Some systems use {{angbr|j v}} for the consonant sounds {{IPA|/j w/}} except in the combinations {{angbr|gu su qu}} for which {{angbr|v}} is never used.

Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below:

In Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as [[Gemination|long]] consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants. Thus the ''nn'' in Classical Latin {{lang|la|annus}}, year, (and in Italian {{lang|it|anno}}) is pronounced as a doubled {{IPA|/nn/}} as in English ''unnamed''. (In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or [[morpheme]]s, as in that example.)

===Vowels===

|}

In Classical Latin, {{angbr|U}} did not exist as a letter distinct from V; the written form {{angbr|V}} was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. {{angbr|Y}} was adopted to represent [[upsilon]] in loanwords from Greek, but it was pronounced like {{angbr|u}} and {{angbr|i}} by some speakers. It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning, such as sylva and ·ΩïŒªŒ∑.

Classical Latin distinguished between [[vowel length|long and short vowels]]. Then, long vowels, except for {{angbr|I}}, were frequently marked using the [[apex (diacritic)|apex]], which was sometimes similar to an [[acute accent]] {{angbr|√Å √â √ì VÃÅ √ù}}. Long {{IPA|/iÀê/}} was written using a taller version of {{angbr|I}}, called {{lang|la|i longa}} "long I": {{angbr|Íüæ}}. In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] {{angbr|ƒÅ ƒì ƒ´ ≈ç ≈´}}, and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a [[breve]]: {{angbr|ƒÉ ƒï ƒ≠ ≈è ≈≠}}.

Long vowels in Classical Latin were pronounced with a different quality from short vowels and also were longer. The difference is described in table below:

|}

A vowel letter followed by {{angbr|m}} at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by {{angbr|n}} before {{angbr|s}} or {{angbr|f}}, represented a long [[nasal vowel]], as in ''monstrum'' {{IPA|/m√µÀêstr≈©Àê/}}.

====Diphthongs====
Classical Latin had several [[diphthong]]s. The two most common were {{angbr|ae au}}. {{angbr|oe}} was fairly rare, and {{angbr|ui eu ei}} were very rare, at least in native Latin words.&lt;ref name="classical diphthongs"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2004|pp=60‚Äì63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been debate over whether {{angbr|ui}} is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin, due to its rarity, absence in works of Roman grammarians, and the roots of Classical Latin words (i.e. {{lang|la|hui ce}} to {{lang|la|huic}}, {{lang|la|quoi}} to {{lang|la|cui}}, etc.) not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if {{angbr|ui}} were to be considered a diphthong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=282713|title=The Diphthong -ui in Latin|last=Husband|first=Richard|date=1910}}{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs. {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}} also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in {{lang|la|aƒìnus}} {{IPA|[aÀàeÀê.n äs]}} "of bronze" and {{lang|la|coƒìpit}} {{IPA|[k…îÀàeÀê.p…™t]}} "began", and {{angbr|au ui eu ei ou}} represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels {{IPA|/j w/}}, in {{lang|la|cavƒì}} {{IPA|[Ààka.weÀê]}} "beware!", {{lang|la|cuius}} {{IPA|[Ààk äj.j äs]}} "whose", {{lang|la|monuƒ´}} {{IPA|[Ààm…în. ä.iÀê]}} "I warned", {{lang|la|solvƒ´}} {{IPA|[Ààs…î…´.wiÀê]}} "I released", {{lang|la|dƒìlƒìvƒ´}} {{IPA|[deÀêÀàleÀê.wiÀê]}} "I destroyed", {{lang|la|eius}} {{IPA|[Àà…õj.j äs]}} "his", and {{lang|la|novus}} {{IPA|[Ààn…î.w äs]}} "new".

Old Latin had more diphthongs, but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin. The Old Latin diphthong {{angbr|ai}} and the sequence {{angbr|ƒÅƒ´}} became Classical {{angbr|ae}}. Old Latin {{angbr|oi}} and {{angbr|ou}} changed to Classical {{angbr|≈´}}, except in a few words whose {{angbr|oi}} became Classical {{angbr|oe}}. These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root: for instance, Classical {{lang|la|poena}} "punishment" and {{lang|la|p≈´nƒ´re}} "to punish".&lt;ref name="classical diphthongs" /&gt; Early Old Latin {{angbr|ei}} usually changed to Classical {{angbr|ƒ´}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2004|pp=53‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, {{angbr|ae au oe}} merged with {{angbr|e ≈ç ƒì}}. A similar pronunciation also existed during the Classical Latin period for less-educated speakers.&lt;ref name="classical diphthongs" /&gt;

==Orthography==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
[[File:Duenos inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Duenos Inscription]], from the 6th century BC, is one of the earliest known [[Old Latin]] texts.]]

Latin was written in the Latin alphabet, derived from the [[Old Italic script]], which was in turn drawn from the [[Greek alphabet]] and ultimately the [[Phoenician alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diringer|1996|pp=451, 493, 530}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic, and many Slavic languages ([[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the [[Austronesian languages]], many [[Turkic languages]], and most languages in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Oceania]], making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system.

The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diringer|1996|p=536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ''G'' was added to represent {{IPA|/…°/}}, which had previously been spelled ''C'', and ''Z'' ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no [[voiced alveolar fricative]].&lt;ref name=D538&gt;{{Harvnb|Diringer|1996|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters ''Y'' and ''Z'' were later added to represent Greek letters, [[upsilon]] and [[zeta]] respectively, in Greek loanwords.&lt;ref name=D538/&gt;

''W'' was created in the 11th century from ''VV''. It represented {{IPA|/w/}} in Germanic languages, not Latin, which still uses ''V'' for the purpose. ''J'' was distinguished from the original ''I'' only during the late Middle Ages, as was the letter ''U'' from ''V''.&lt;ref name=D538/&gt; Although some Latin dictionaries use ''J'', it is rarely used for Latin text, as it was not used in classical times, but many other languages use it.

Classical Latin did not contain sentence [[punctuation]], letter case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diringer|1996|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[interword spacing]], but [[apex (diacritic)|apices]] were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the [[interpunct]] was used at times to separate words. The first line of Catullus 3, originally written as

: LVÃÅG√âTE√ìVENER√âSCVP√çDIN√âSQVE ("Mourn, O [[Venus (mythology)|Venuses]] and [[Cupid]]s")

or with interpunct as

: LVÃÅG√âTE¬∑√ì¬∑VENER√âS¬∑CVP√çDIN√âSQVE

would be rendered in a modern edition as

: Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque

or with macrons

: L≈´gƒìte, ≈ç Venerƒìs Cupƒ´dinƒìsque

or with apices

: L√∫g√©te, √≥ Vener√©s Cup√≠din√©sque.

[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|A replica of the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the [[Vindolanda tablets]], the oldest surviving handwritten documents in Britain.]]

The [[Roman cursive]] script is commonly found on the many [[wax tablet]]s excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Most notable is the fact that while most of the [[Vindolanda tablets]] show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era.

===Alternative scripts===
Occasionally, Latin has been written in other scripts:
* The [[Praeneste fibula]] is a 7th-century BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script.
* The rear panel of the early 8th-century [[Franks Casket]] has an inscription that switches from [[Old English]] in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Latin grammar|Latin syntax}}

Latin is a [[synthetic language|synthetic]], [[fusional language]] in the terminology of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, it is an inflected language, but typologists are apt to say "inflecting". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: ''am≈ç'', "I love," is produced from a semantic element, ''ama-'', "love," to which ''-≈ç'', a first person singular marker, is suffixed.

The grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers: the word is "inflected" to express different grammatical functions, but the semantic element usually does not change. (Inflection uses affixing and infixing. Affixing is prefixing and suffixing. Latin inflections are never prefixed.)

For example, ''amƒÅbit'', "he (or she or it) will love", is formed from the same stem, ''amƒÅ-'', to which a future tense marker, ''-bi-'', is suffixed, and a third person singular marker, ''-t'', is suffixed. There is an inherent ambiguity: ''-t'' may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. All natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another.

The inflections express [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical case|case]] in [[adjective]]s, [[noun]]s, and [[pronoun]]s, a process called ''[[declension]]''. Markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs, to denote [[grammatical person|person]], number, [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], a process called ''[[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]''. Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and interjections.

===Nouns===
{{Main|Latin declension}}

A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions, a group of nouns with similar inflected forms. The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun. The first declension, with a predominant ending letter of ''a'', is signified by the genitive singular ending of ''-ae''. The second declension, with a predominant ending letter of ''o'', is signified by the genitive singular ending of ''-i''. The third declension, with a predominant ending letter of ''i'', is signified by the genitive singular ending of ''-is''. The fourth declension, with a predominant ending letter of ''u'', is signified by the genitive singular ending of ''-≈´s''. The fifth declension, with a predominant ending letter of ''e'', is signified by the genitive singular ending of ''-ei''.

There are seven Latin noun cases, which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections. Thus, [[word order]] is not as important in Latin as it is in English, which is less inflected. The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary. The cases are as follows:

# '''[[Nominative case|Nominative]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] or a [[predicate nominative]]. The thing or person acting: the '''girl''' ran: '''''puella''' cucurrit,'' or ''cucurrit '''puella'''''
# '''[[Genitive case|Genitive]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object: "the horse of the man", or "the man's horse"; in both instances, the word ''man'' would be in the [[genitive case]] when it is translated into Latin. It also indicates the [[partitive]], in which the material is quantified: "a group of people"; "a number of gifts": ''people'' and ''gifts'' would be in the genitive case. Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives: The cup is full of '''wine'''. ''Poculum plƒìnum '''vƒ´nƒ´''' est.'' The master of the '''slave''' had beaten him. ''Dominus '''servƒ´''' eum verberƒÅverat.''
# '''[[Dative case|Dative]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence, with special verbs, with certain prepositions, and if it is used as agent, reference, or even possessor: The merchant hands the [[stola]] '''to the woman'''. ''MercƒÅtor '''fƒìminae''' stolam trƒÅdit.'')
# '''[[Accusative case|Accusative]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun is the direct object of the subject and as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which.: The man killed '''the boy'''. ''Vir '''puerum''' necƒÅvit.''
# '''[[Ablative case|Ablative]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source, cause, [[agent (grammar)|agent]] or [[instrumental case|instrument]] or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions; adverbial: You walked '''with the boy'''. ''Cum '''puer≈ç''' ambulƒÅvistƒ´.''
# '''[[Vocative case|Vocative]]''' ‚Äì used when the noun is used in a direct address. The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative, but exceptions include second-declension nouns ending in ''-us''. The ''-us'' becomes an ''-e'' in the vocative singular. If it ends in ''-ius'' (such as ''fƒ´lius''), the ending is just ''-ƒ´'' (''filƒ´''), as distinct from the nominative plural (''filiƒ´'') in the vocative singular: "'''Master'''!" shouted the slave. ''"'''Domine'''!" clƒÅmƒÅvit servus.''
# '''[[Locative case|Locative]]''' ‚Äì used to indicate a location (corresponding to the English "in" or "at"). It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns, such as the word ''domus'' (house). In the singular of the first and second declensions, its form coincides with the genitive (''Roma'' becomes ''Romae'', "in Rome"). In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions, it coincides with the ablative (''Athƒìnae'' becomes ''Athƒìnƒ´s'', "at Athens"). In the fourth-declension word ''domus'', the locative form, ''domƒ´'' ("at home") differs from the standard form of all other cases.

Latin lacks both definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]] so ''puer currit'' can mean either "the boy is running" or "a boy is running". Also, the sentence ''coquus in culina laborat'' could mean "the cook works in the kitchen" or "the cook is working in the kitchen."

===Adjectives===
{{Main|Latin declension}}

There are two types of regular Latin adjectives: first- and second- declension and third-declension. They are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first- and second-declension and third-declension nouns, respectively. Latin adjectives also have comparative (more --, ''-er'') and superlative (most --, ''est'') forms. There are also a number of Latin participles.

Latin numbers are sometimes declined. See ''Numbers'' below.

====First and second-declension adjectives====

First and second-declension adjectives are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms. For example, for ''mortuus, mortua, mortuum'' (dead), ''mortua'' is declined like a regular first-declension noun (such as ''puella'' (girl)), ''mortuus'' is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as ''dominus'' (lord, master)), and ''mortuum'' is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as ''auxilium'' (help)).

'''&lt;small&gt;First and second declension ''-er'' adjectives&lt;/small&gt;'''

Some first and second declension adjectives have an ''-er'' as the masculine nominative singular form and are declined like regular first- and second-declension adjectives. Some but not all adjectives keep the ''e'' for all of the forms.

====Third declension adjectives====

Third-declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns, with a few exceptions. In the plural nominative neuter, for example, the ending is ''-ia'' (''omnia'' (all, everything)), and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative neuter ending is ''-a'' or ''-ia'' (''capita'' (heads), ''animalia'' (animals)) They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular.

====Participles====
Latin participles, like English participles, are formed from a verb. There are a few main types of participles: Present Active Participles, Perfect Passive Participles, Future Active Participles, and Future Passive Participles.

===Prepositions===
Latin sometimes uses prepositions, depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used. Prepositions can take two cases for their object: the accusative ("apud puerum" (with the boy), with "puerum" being the accusative form of "puer", boy) and the ablative ("sine puero" (without the boy), "puero" being the ablative form of "puer", boy).

===Verbs===
{{Main|Latin conjugation}}

A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main [[Latin conjugation|conjugations]]. A conjugation is "a class of verbs with similar inflected forms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Conjugation | encyclopedia=Webster's II new college dictionary | location=Boston | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb's present stem. The present stem can be found by omitting the -''re'' (-''rƒ´'' in deponent verbs) ending from the present infinitive form. The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in ''-ƒÅ-re'' or ''-ƒÅ-ri'' (active and passive respectively): ''amƒÅre'', "to love," ''hortƒÅrƒ´'', "to exhort"; of the second conjugation by ''-ƒì-re'' or ''-ƒì-rƒ´'': ''monƒìre'', "to warn", ''verƒìrƒ´'', "to fear;" of the third conjugation by ''-ere'', ''-ƒ´'': ''d≈´cere'', "to lead," ''≈´tƒ´'', "to use"; of the fourth by ''-ƒ´-re'', ''-ƒ´-rƒ´'': ''audƒ´re'', "to hear," ''experƒ´rƒ´'', "to attempt".&lt;ref name="Wheelock 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Wheelock's Latin|last=Wheelock|first=Frederic M.|publisher=CollinsReference|edition=7th|location=New York|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular verbs may not follow the types or may be marked in a different way. The "endings" presented above are not the suffixed infinitive markers. The first letter in each case is the last of the stem so the conjugations are also called a-conjugation, e-conjugation and i-conjugation. The fused infinitive ending is -''re'' or -''rƒ´''. Third-conjugation stems end in a consonant: the consonant conjugation. Further, there is a subset of the third conjugation, the i-stems, which behave somewhat like the fourth conjugation, as they are both i-stems, one short and the other long.&lt;ref name="Wheelock 2011"/&gt; The stem categories descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages.

There are six general [[grammatical tense|tenses]] in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three [[grammatical mood|moods]] (indicative, imperative and subjunctive, in addition to the [[infinitive]], [[participle]], [[gerund]], [[gerundive]] and [[supine]]), three [[grammatical person|persons]] (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two [[grammatical voice|voices]] (active and passive) and three [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] ([[perfective and imperfective|perfective, imperfective]], and [[stative verb|stative]]). Verbs are described by four principal parts:

# The first principal part is the first-person singular, present tense, indicative mood, active voice form of the verb. If the verb is impersonal, the first principal part will be in the third-person singular.
# The second principal part is the present infinitive active.
# The third principal part is the first-person singular, perfect indicative active form. Like the first principal part, if the verb is impersonal, the third principal part will be in the third-person singular.
# The fourth principal part is the supine form, or alternatively, the nominative singular, perfect passive participle form of the verb. The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders (-''us ''for masculine, -''a'' for feminine and -''m'' for neuter) in the nominative singular. The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive. Most modern Latin dictionaries, if they show only one gender, tend to show the masculine; but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter, as it coincides with the supine. The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs, but strictly in Latin, they can be made passive if they are used impersonally, and the supine exists for such verbs.

There are six tenses in the Latin language. These are divided into two tense systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future tenses, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses. Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (''I, we'') and second (''you'') persons unless emphasis on the subject is desired.

The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses. For the future tense, the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations, and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations:

{| class="wikitable"
! Tense !! 1st-Person Singular !! 2nd-Person Singular !! 3rd-Person Singular !! 1st-Person Plural !! 2nd-Person Plural !! 3rd-Person Plural
|-
| Present || -≈ç/m || -s || -t || -mus || -tis || -nt
|-
| Future || -b≈ç, -am || -bis, -ƒìs || -bit, -et || -bimus, -ƒìmus || -bitis, -ƒìtis
| -bunt, -ent
|-
| Imperfect || -bam || -bƒÅs || -bat || -bƒÅmus || -bƒÅtis || -bant
|-
| Perfect || -ƒ´ || -istƒ´ || -it || -imus || -istis || -ƒìrunt
|-
| Future Perfect || -er≈ç || -eris || -erit || -erimus || -eritis || -erint
|-
| Pluperfect || -eram || -erƒÅs || -erat || -erƒÅmus || -erƒÅtis || -erant
|}
The future perfect endings are identical to the future forms of ''sum'' (with the exception of ''erint'') and that the pluperfect endings are identical to the imperfect forms of ''sum''.

====Deponent verbs====
Some Latin verbs are [[deponent verb|deponent]], causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: ''hortor, hortƒÅrƒ´, hortƒÅtus sum (to urge).

==Vocabulary==

As Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] words into their language, including ''persona'' "mask" and ''histrio'' "actor".&lt;ref name=H&amp;S13&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Schultz|1938|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from [[Oscan language|Oscan]], another Italic language.

After the [[History of Taranto|Fall of Tarentum]] (272 BC), the Romans began hellenizing, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as ''camera'' (vaulted roof), ''sumbolum'' (symbol), and ''balineum'' (bath).&lt;ref name=H&amp;S13/&gt; This hellenization led to the addition of "Y" and "Z" to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Sacks |year=2003 |title=Language Visible: Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z |location=London |publisher=Broadway Books |page=351 |isbn=0-7679-1172-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the Romans transplanted [[Greek art]], [[medicine]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]] to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece. Thus, many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words, as ''ars'' (craft) and œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑ (art).&lt;ref name=H&amp;S14&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Schultz|1938|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the Roman Empire's expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes, the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words, such as ''beber'' (beaver), of Germanic origin, and ''bracae'' (breeches), of Celtic origin.&lt;ref name=H&amp;S14/&gt; The specific dialects of Latin across Latin-speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions. The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages.

During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norberg |first=Dag |last2=Johnson |first2=Rand H, Translator |title=Manuel pratique de latin m√©di√©val |url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~johnsorh/MedievalLatin/Norberg/NORBINTR.html |chapter=Latin at the End of the Imperial Age |origyear=1980 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=20 May 2015 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including [[Old English]] and other [[Germanic languages]].

Over the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by [[affix]]ing or [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] meaningful [[segment (linguistics)|segments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenks|1911|pp=3, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the compound adjective, ''omnipotens'', "all-powerful," was produced from the adjectives ''omnis'', "all", and ''potens'', "powerful", by dropping the final ''s'' of ''omnis'' and concatenating. Often, the concatenation changed the part of speech, and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenks|1911|pp=35, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phrases==

The phrases are mentioned with [[Pitch accent|accents]] to show where stress is placed.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbe Vilborg ‚Äì ''Norstedts svensk-latinska ordbok'' ‚Äì Second edition, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin, most words are stressed at the second-last (penultimate) [[syllable]], called in Latin ''paenultima'' or ''syllaba paenultima''.&lt;ref name=LKHS&gt;[[Tore Janson]] ‚Äì ''Latin ‚Äì Kulturen, historien, spr√•ket'' ‚Äì First edition, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A few words are stressed at the third-last syllable, called in Latin ''antepaenultima'' or ''syllaba antepaenultima''.&lt;ref name=LKHS/&gt;

==Numbers==
{{further|Latin numerals (linguistics)}}
In ancient times, numbers in Latin were written only with letters. Today, the numbers can be written with the [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numbers]] as well as with [[Roman numerals]]. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 and every whole hundred from 200 to 900 are declined as nouns and adjectives, with some differences.

The numbers from 4 to 100 often do not change their endings.

==Example text==

''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also called ''De Bello Gallico'' (''The Gallic War''), written by [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], begins with the following passage:

{{quote|Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Hi omnes lingua, institutis, legibus inter se differunt. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae, propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important, proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt. Eorum una pars, quam Gallos obtinere dictum est, initium capit a flumine Rhodano, continetur Garumna flumine, Oceano, finibus Belgarum; attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum; vergit ad septentriones. Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur; pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni; spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem. Aquitania a Garumna flumine ad Pyrenaeos montes et eam partem Oceani quae est ad Hispaniam pertinet; spectat inter occasum solis et septentriones.}}

This is a '''list of organisations that claim to work in the field  of [[information and communication technologies for development]]''' (ICT4Dev). The sections below show two separate classifications:
*organisations founded specifically with the sole purpose of engaging in ICT4Dev activities (i.e. activities that benefit the poorest people in the world)
*commercial companies with ICT4Dev activities, which may be seen as marketing or [[corporate social responsibility]] exercises.

== Founded for ICT4Dev ==

=== Aptivate ===
{{main article|Aptivate}}

In 2003 Aptivate was founded as a nonprofit company limited by guarantee in Cambridge, UK, to solve the problems aid workers experienced accessing the internet in low bandwidth environments. (Its name at the time of incorporation was AidWorld; this changed in 2005).

Over subsequent years, Aptivate's technical work has expanded to include building web sites, integrating mobile data gathering systems, producing systems for data visualization, and developing the open-source monitoring and evaluation platform [http://kashana.org/ Kashana].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictworks.org/2015/06/26/why-me-technology-fails-too-complex-too-costly-too-siloed/&lt;/ref&gt; Aptivate has also expanded its work to include training in various technical subjects, consultancy, and authoring of related works.&lt;ref&gt;http://aptivate.org/work&lt;/ref&gt; Aptivate provided the lead authors on the World Bank Guide to Digital Citizen Engagement, to be published in Autumn 2015.

=== UN ICT Task Force ===
In 2001 the [[UN ICT Task Force|United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]] was formed to address a variety of ICT4Dev topics. The Task Force held semi-annual meetings focusing on specific themes, including a ''Global Forum on Internet Governance'' (UN headquarters in New York, March 2004); a ''Global Forum on an Enabling Environment'' (Berlin, November 2004); and a Global Forum on Harnessing the Potential of ICTs in Education (Dublin, April 2005). The UN ICT Task Force's mandate ended on December 31, 2005. A new group, called the 'Global Alliance for ICT and Development', was created to continue much of the work of the UN ICTTF.

In November 2002, [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] issued a call for [[Silicon Valley]] to create the computers and communications systems that would enable villages to leapfrog several generations of technology and enter the Information Age directly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kofi Annan]], ''[http://news.cnet.com/2010-1069-964507.html?tag=lh Perspective: Kofi Annan's IT challenge to Silicon Valley]'', [[News.com]], November 5, 2002. Retrieved August 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would provide the technical basis for WSIS ([[World Summit on the Information Society]]) discussions.

=== World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)===
{{main article|World Summit on the Information Society}}
This United Nations initiative held summits in Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005. After Tunis a Plan of Action is being followed, with a ten-year deadline ending in 2015. This parallels the timeframe for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Alliance for ICT and Development ===
{{main article|Global Alliance for ICT and Development}}
In 2006, at the end of his tenure, outgoing UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] launched the [[Global Alliance for ICT and Development]] (GAID).

It is described as a "multi-stakeholder forum" and a "cross-sectoral platform and forum that will bring together all stakeholders representing relevant constituencies". It includes a large number of persons from the fields of government, development cooperation, foreign policy, finance, the social sector (health, education), regulatory agencies, industry and workers' associations, producers and consumers of ICT, the media, non-governmental organisations, community social organisations, foundations, scientific, academic and ICT communities and "individuals providing advocacy and oversight on Information Society issues and implementing programs addressing the United Nations' MDGs [[Millennium Development Goals]]."

GAID is led by a steering committee, with Intel's [[Craig Barrett (businessman)|Craig Barrett]] as its chairman.

It has a Strategy Council, a set of high-level advisors, and a "champions' network". The Global Alliance for ICT and Development held its first meeting on June 19 and June 20, 2006 in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]].

GAID Global Forum 2010 was organized in partnership with the government of Abu Dhabi on December 5‚Äì6, 2010. The theme for 2010 forum was "ICT for MDGs: Moving from Advocacy to Action." It was attended by members from governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations. Archived videos from the forum are available on the GAID website  www.un-gaid.org or [http://www.un-gaid.org/Newsevents/Events/VenueandVisaDetailsforGAIDGlobalForum2010/GAIDGlobalForum2010PresentationandVideos/tabid/1449/Default.aspx GAID Global Forum 2010].

=== Asia Pacific Development Information Programme and International Open Source Network ===
The United Nations‚Äîthrough its various organisations such as the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Asia Pacific Development Information Programme]] (APDIP) ‚Äì has brought out a number of publications. Many are published with shareable content licenses. Specifically in the field of [[Free/Libre and Open Source Software]] (FLOSS), the [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN) has been an active player.

UNDP-APDIP publishes two series of e-primers, namely the e-Primers for the Information Economy, Society and Polity and the e-Primers on Free/Open Source Software. The former series details the concepts, issues and trends surrounding the information economy, society and polity. It intends to raise awareness and help policy makers and planners understand the relevance of information and communications technology (ICT) for development, by explaining technical jargon in simple terms. The latter series serves as an introduction to various aspects and dimensions of FLOSS, with country case-studies. It aims to raise awareness on FLOSS issues and support capacity building efforts.

=== The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) ===
The [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] is a Canadian governmental agency (crown corporation) that has a very broad programme which includes many small to mid-sized ICT4Dev projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/ict4d/ The ICT4Dev programme area] at the [[International Development Research Centre]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123211607/http://www.idrc.ca/ict4d/ |date=November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDRC is also one of the major sponsors of the telecentre.org movement.

=== The One Laptop per Child Project and 50x15===
[[Image:LaptopOLPC a.jpg|thumb|[[OLPC XO-1]] laptop.]]
{{main article|One Laptop per Child}}
[[OLPC]] is a high-profile project initiated by [[Nicholas Negroponte]]. Several large companies are members of the organisation including [[MIT]] and chip manufacturer [[AMD]]. It had a wide open source community. The aim is to produce laptops cheaply enough to provide them to every school child in the world. Through its bold and controversial aim, the project has generated much exposure for ICT4Dev in general.

The [[50x15 (AMD)|50x15]]-project is a similar worldwide project, offering low-cost computers from a variety of manufacturers.

=== Zidisha P2P Microfinance ===
{{main article|Zidisha}}
[[Zidisha]] is an online [[peer-to-peer lending]] platform that allows individuals in developing countries to raise [[microfinance]] loans from individuals worldwide.  Unlike earlier microfinancing websites such as [[Kiva]], Zidisha does not work through local intermediary organizations.  Instead, the individual borrowers themselves use the Zidisha website to create Facebook-style profiles and negotiate loans with individuals in the US and Europe.  Zidisha lenders and borrowers dialogue with each other directly in the loan profile pages and Zidisha forum.&lt;ref name="FAI-2011"&gt;[http://www.financialaccess.org/blog/2011/07/microfinance-without-mfi-zidisha-tests-boundaries-microlending-methodology "Microfinance without the MFI?

'''Louisa Morton Greene''' (n√©e Louisa Morton Willard; May 23, 1819 - March 5, 1900) was a 19th-century American reformer, writer, abolitionist, suffragist, women's rights worker, temperance worker, and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] relief worker,{{sfn|Herman|Tal|1984|p=121}} from [[Massachusetts]]. Though she had limited schooling, she was the first American woman to rebel against discrimination towards women in industry, refusing to accept a woman's pay rate after doing a man's job.{{sfn|Fisher|Laschever|1966|p=151}} Greene was also an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. She died in 1900.

==Early years and education==
Louisa Morton Willard was born in [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]], May 23, 1819. She is a descendant from sturdy New England ancestors. Her father, Henry Willard. blacksmith and farmer, removed from Vermont and settled in Ashburnham in the early years of the present century. Bereft of both parents in early childhood, she was deprived of schooling and thrown upon her own resources at the age of 13.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} 

==Career==
She obtained employment in a woolen factory in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], and worked for several years for the pittance of US$1.00 to $2.00 per week and board, working 14 hours a day. There, upon the heads of bobbins, she learned to write. Notwithstanding her long hours of labor, she found time for constant improvement by reading and study. Her habits of strict economy enabled her to save a portion of her wages, and at the age of 17 she had $150.00 in the bank. Then came her first revolt against the injustice shown to women in industrial pursuits. Gross discrimination in the matter of wages was made, simply on the ground of sex. Called upon at one time to take a man's place at a spindle, she performed her duties well and to the satisfaction of her employer. When pay-day came around and she demanded the same compensation that the man had been securing, her request was received with amazement. The plucky young girl stood her ground and refused to return to the spindle unless paid at the same rate as the man whose place she was filling. She was promptly dismissed from the factory, to be recalled a few weeks later at a higher rate of pay.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} 

In 1840, she taught school near [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. There, she formed the acquaintance of Jonas Greene, of [[Maine]], and they married in 1841. Mr. Greene subsequently became a prominent politician, representing his district in each branch of the State legislature for several successive terms. His success in life he ascribed largely to the cooperation and support of his wife. Removing with her husband to the then somewhat sparsely settled [[Oxford County, Maine]], a new and active life opened for her. While performing faithfully her duties, she found time to enter into the philanthropic and reform work of the times. Early becoming a convert to the [[Water cure (therapy)|Water cure]] system of treating the sick, she familiarized herself with it and soon developed a remarkable ability for the care and treatment of the sick. Physicians and medicines were unknown in her household, and her skill was in demand in the community.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}}  

In 1850, Greene began to espouse the anti-slavery cause. She and others gathered women together and organized anti-slavery societies. Literature was distributed, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' was read, and she wrote many articles for the local papers. During the [[American Civil War]], Greene's patriotic labors were untiring. When hospital supplies were needed, she collected, prepared and forwarded them. Greene's newspaper contributions for years covered a wide range of subjects. She was an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. In 1869, she removed with her family to [[Manassas, Virginia]], where her husband died in 1873. With advancing years, Greene withdrew from active philanthropic work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} She died March 5, 1900.&lt;ref name="findagrave.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisa Morton Willard Greene (1819 - 1900) - Find A Grave Memorial|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68311615|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Macushi''' ({{lang-pt|Macuxi}}I)  are an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] living in the borderlands of southern [[Guyana]], northern [[Brazil]] in the state of [[Roraima]], and in an eastern part of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Name==
The Macushi are also known as the Macusi, Macussi, Makushi, Makusi, Makuxi, Teueia, and Teweya people.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Language==
Macushi people speak the [[Macushi language]], a Macushi-Kapon language, which is part of the [[Carib language family]]. Some in Brazil also speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], while some in Venezuela speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and some in Guyana speak [[English language|English]]. The Macushi language is written in the [[Latin script]], and the [[New Testament]] was translated into the language in 1996.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;
* http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Macushi_words

==Housing and lifestyle==
They live in villages linked together by tracks and paths, with houses built round a central courtyard. When married, the Macushi couple lives in the wife's family's village and the father-in-law is of great importance in Macushi kinship.

==History and Culture==
Macushi [[oral history]] describes them as descendants of the sun's children, who created fire, as well as diseases, and they also believe they discovered ''Washac√°'', the [[Tree of Life]]. The Macushi believe in the life principle ‚Äì ''stkaton'' ‚Äì and they believe it comes from the sun.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Cuthbert Cary-Elwes]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] settled among the Macushi of the [[Rupununi]] Region (Guyana) in 1909, learned the language and stayed with them for more than 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyanajesuits.org/mission/Kurukabaru%20and%20Lethem/interior/interior.php "The Interior."] ''The Jesuits in Guyana.'' Retrieved 30 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, non-native people occupied Macushi territory, establishing mission villages and farms and forcing Macushi people to relocate.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

The Brazilian Government have set up schools, as well as hospitals for the Macushi and since 2005 they are campaigning for land rights to be recognized throughout Brazil. Some individuals from the Macushi tribe are very well educated. In the trial for the land rights, [[Jo√™nia Wapixana|Jo√™nia Batista de Carvalho]] Wapichna was the first lawyer with indigenous roots to give a speech in the STF (Superior Tribunal Federal).

[[Image:Makhila.JPG|150px|thumb|A '''Makila''', with a horn pommel, woven leather grip and [[nickel silver]] fittings]]
[[Image:Trefle makhila.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Decorative shoe and ferrule for traction at the base]]
The '''makila ''' (sometimes spelled ''makhila'') is a traditional [[Basque people|Basque]] [[walking stick]], and is notable as both a practical tool and a cultural symbol of authority and strength.

==Etymology==

"Makila" in [[Euskara]] (Basque language) literally can mean "stick", "walking cane", "rod", "club", or "[[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]".  The word is derived from the Latin ''bacillum'' ("little staff").  "Makila" itself carries certain connotations, for instance in the verb form, ''makilatu'', meaning "to bludgeon", or the derived ''makila-ukaldi'', meaning "club-strike" or "mace-strike".  The term outside of [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]] has come to be associated with the unique walking stick carried by Basques.

==Appearance==
The makila walking stick consists of an engraved [[medlar]] wood shaft cut to a length to suit its owner, generally either hipbone or sternum-height, {{convert|1|to|1.4|m|ft}}. The bottom is often shod with steel or other metal and ends in a ferrule (blunt spike for traction).  The handle is also often covered with metal or woven leather to form a hand-grip, with a lanyard attached to the bottom of this grip.  The stick is capped with a flattened knob or pommel, made of horn, steel, or bronze.  The top portion consisting of the knob and hand-grip can be pulled off the top of the stick, revealing a hidden spike or blade, which effectively turns the stick into a short spear. The pommel's shape is said to resemble the beret worn by the basque shepherd.

Some makila are created for ceremonial purposes, often presented as gifts or awards to individuals.  They are decorated with elaborate engravings and their metal parts are made of silver or gold.  These are often 1.2&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft) long rather than a custom length.

==History and crafting==

The design of the makila is centuries old, and remains largely unchanged.  There is little information known on its exact origin, but it may possibly be related to medieval times, as a concealable derivative of a particular form of lance or hunting spear.

The manufacturing process is as rooted in tradition as the finished product, and can take years to complete.  It begins in spring, with the craftsman selecting a suitable branch from a [[medlar]] tree and carving a design into the living wood while it is still attached.  The branch is left alone until late fall, during which the wood heals and expands the design on its surface.  The craftsman must then return to where he found the tree and cut the branch down.  The bark is then stripped off and the shaft is straightened out using careful heating in a kiln.  After this, the stick must be dried by being stored for several years.  Once this has happened, the wood is stained using a secret method, and then fitted with the various metal bands and fittings.  The craftsman will sign his work with his family symbol or name, and also will engrave the handle or pommel with the recipients name, family crest or other text as requested.

==Use==
[[Image:Makila arme.jpg|upright=0.4|thumb|The makila's deadly secret: A hidden steel spike]]
The makila is a practical walking stick and a weapon for self-defense.  They were (and still are) carried by shepherds to help guide their flocks as well as defend against wolves and other wild predators.  They are carried by hunters and hikers in the Basque country as walking aids, and they are used in traditional folk dances.

The makila can be swung by the handle for fast, light strikes or used the opposite way to strike with the pommel as an effective bludgeon.  The concealed spike can be used to deadly effect either as a thrusting weapon, or thrown as a last resort.

The '''Malay''' or '''Malayan languages''' are a group of closely related languages spoken by [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and related peoples across [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Southern Thailand]], and the far southern parts of the [[Philippines]]. They have traditionally been classified as Malay, Para-Malay, and Aboriginal Malay, but this reflects geography and ethnicity rather than a proper linguistic classification. The Malayan languages are [[mutually intelligible]] to varying extents, though the distinction between language and dialect is unclear in many cases.

Para-Malay includes the Malayan languages of [[Sumatra]]. They are: [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Central Malay]] (Bengkulu), [[Pekal language|Pekal]], [[Musi language|Musi]] (Palembang), [[Negeri Sembilan Malay|Negeri Sembilan]] (Malaysia), and [[Duano language|Duano‚Äô]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnologue'' 16 also lists Col, Haji, Kaur, Kerinci, Kubu, Lubu'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginal Malay are the Malayan languages spoken by the [[Orang Asli]] ([[Proto-Malay]]) in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]]. They are [[Jakun language|Jakun]], [[Orang Kanaq language|Orang Kanaq]], [[Orang Seletar language|Orang Seletar]], and [[Temuan language|Temuan]].

The other Malayan languages, included in neither of these groups, are associated with the expansion of the Malays across the archipelago. They include [[Malay language|Malaccan Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Kedah Malay]], [[Brunei Malay|Kedayan/Brunei Malay]], [[Berau Malay]], [[Bangka Malay]], [[Jambi Malay]], [[Kutai Malay]], [[Orang Laut language|Loncong]], [[Pattani Malay]], and [[Banjar language|Banjarese]].

There are also several [[Malay-based creole languages]], such as [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Cocos Malay]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Sabah Malay]], which may be more or less distinct from standard (Malaccan) Malay.

== Usages ==
The extent to which Malay and related Malayan languages are used in the countries where it is spoken varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], and became the sole official language in [[West Malaysia]] in 1968, and in [[East Malaysia]] gradually from 1974. [[English language|English]] continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country's large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.

In Singapore, Malay was historically the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among people of different nationalities. Although this has largely given way to English, Malay still retains the status of national language and the [[national anthem]], [[Majulah Singapura]], is entirely in Malay. In addition, parade commands in the military, police and civil defence are given only in Malay.

Most residents of the five southernmost provinces of [[Thailand]] &amp;mdash; a region that, for the most part, used to be part of an ancient Malay kingdom called [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] &amp;mdash; speak a dialect of Malay called [[Yawi language|Yawi]] (not to be confused with Jawi), which is similar to Kelantanese Malay, but the language has no official status or recognition.

Owing to earlier contact with the [[Philippines]], Malay words &amp;mdash; such as ''dalam hati'' (sympathy), ''luwalhati'' (glory), ''tengah hari'' (midday), ''sedap'' (delicious) &amp;mdash;  have evolved and been integrated into [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and other [[languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].

By contrast, Indonesian has successfully become the ''lingua franca'' for its disparate islands and ethnic groups, in part because the colonial language, Dutch, is no longer commonly spoken. (In [[East Timor]], which was governed as a province of Indonesia from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian is widely spoken and recognized under its [[Constitution]] as a 'working language'.)

Besides [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]], which developed from the [[Malacca sultanate|Malaccan]]&lt;!--not Riau: "Riau Malay" is not the Malay native to Riau, but to Malacca--&gt; dialect, there are many Malay dialects spoken in Indonesia, it is divided into western and eastern groups. Western Malay varieties is predominantly spoken in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], which itself is divided into Bornean and Sumatran Malay, some of the most widely spoken Sumatran Malay varieties are [[Riau|Riau Malay]], [[Langkat]], [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] and [[Jambi Malay]]. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Kerinci people|Kerinci]] and [[Bengkulu]] are believed to be Sumatran Malay descendants. Meanwhile, [[Jakarta]] dialect (known as [[Betawi language|Betawi]]) also belongs to the western Malay group.

The eastern dialects are spoken in the easternmost part of the Indonesian archipelago and include: [[Manado]] dialect [[Manado Malay]] (in north [[Sulawesi]]) and [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], [[North Maluku]] and [[Papuan languages|Papua]] dialects.
 
The differences among both groups are quite observable. For example, the word 'kita' means "we, us" in western, but means "I, me" in Manado, whereas "we, us" in Manado is 'torang' and Ambon 'katong' (originally abbreviated from Malay 'kita orang' (means "we people"). Another difference is the lack of possessive pronouns (and suffixes) in eastern dialects. Manado uses the verb 'pe' and Ambon 'pu' (from Malay 'punya', meaning "to have") to mark possession. So "my name" and "our house" are translated in western Malay as 'namaku' and 'rumah kita' but 'kita pe nama' and 'torang pe rumah' in Manado and 'beta pu nama', 'katong pu rumah' in Ambon dialect.

The pronunciation may vary in western dialects, especially the pronunciation of words ending in the vowel 'a'. For example, Malaysian pronounce 'kita' (inclusive we, us, our) as /kit…ô/, Kelantan and Southern Thailand as /kit…î/, Riau as /kita/, Palembang as /kito/, Betawi and Perak as /kit…õ/.

Batavian and eastern dialects are sometimes regarded as Malay creole, because the speakers are not ethnically Malay.

'''[[Match fixing]] in [[Romania]]n [[Football (soccer)|football]]''' is called '''blat''' (plural '''blaturi''').

This term is specifically used in the football domestic competition called ''[[Liga I]]'' to explain a friendly agreement between two or more presidents of football clubs for fixing matches. Etymologically ''blat'' means "dough" and a term for designing clandestine travelling in a city bus (has no plural form).
So a ''blƒÉtar'' fixes matches and a ''blatist'' travels without a bus ticket.

==Origin==
Blats are more related to the period before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].
The Communist local and central administration had a decisive role in designating the teams who will play in the next season in the first division.
Hence presidents agreed to help each other to avoid relegation from the first division.
This informal and dirty association was called ''cooperativa'' (first used in 1992 by former international footballer and current football analyst [[Cornel Dinu]] from a term which designated the Communist system of agricultural common association) and was composed by 3 or maximum 5 influential presidents.
In 1995 [[Dumitru Dragomir]], a former president of [[Victoria Bucarest]] football team and the current long-serving president of the domestic league LPF &lt;!-- (himself a former member of the Communist secret police) Who is this "who"?--&gt;admitted during a televised debate to being formerly involved in such deals.

Blat is also used by a term of "reciprocity" where two football chiefs accept that each of their team to win their home match in a direct confrontation of domestic champion round.

==In the 1990s==
After Communism collapsed the phenomenon of Blat was related to the development of informal economy. The media raised awareness about such apparent dealings though thus far never leading to serious investigations for corruption.
Many football club owners, especially outside Bucharest, agreed to create an informal association between 3 or 5 owners with the aim of helping each other and involved other teams to join this "gang".
That method consist in letting each of the involved teams to win the home matches, accepting to lose the away matches.
The most prolific football club chief who was the creator of this cartel is [[Jean Padureanu]] (also known as ''The Lord''), president of [[Gloria Bistri≈£a]], also known in the Romanian media as the Father of Blaturi.
The list includes [[Gheorghe ≈ûtefan (politician)|Gheorghe ≈ûtefan]] (also known as ''Pinalti''), president of [[CeahlƒÉul Piatra Neam≈£]], and [[Romeo Pa≈ücu]] (also known as ''Breakdance''), president of [[FC Bra≈üov]].
Cornel Dinu also named DIVIZIA A as "championship of Jenel(Padureanu), Romel(Pascu)and Fanel(Stefan)" because these three chiefs had more influence in the decision of results.
During 1999 and 2001 the team of [[Rocar]] owned by former Securitate officer and [[Nicolae Ceau≈üescu|Ceau≈üescu]] bodyguard [[Gheorghe Netoiu|Gheorghe (Gigi) Netoiu]] was named as "champion of blaturi" in local media.{{[http://www.fixedmatch.info/ Fixed Matches]|date=February 2007}}.

The period between 1992 and 2002  has been described by some as the "blat" era of Romanian football. After this period the Liga 1 clubs saw some of the poorest results for Romanian teams in European Competitions.

==Press campaign for eradication==
During these years there was no punitive measure taken by central football authority organisms like FRF (the [[Romanian Football Federation]]) or LPF (the [[Romanian Professional Football League]]) to stop it.
After the Romanian football was ranked as the cheapest and one of the less spectacular championships in the world{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, new club owners took the decision to remove their clubs from such agreements with the potential of playing competitively again.
In 2003 after losing qualification for the second final football tournament, the president of the club [[FCM BacƒÉu]] [[Dumitru Sechelariu]] admitted on a live football talk show equally that he was strongly involved in fixed matches and that there was an association of two or three presidents who did the same, proposing to stop these practice.
This was a turning and a decisive point in the eradication of the ''blat'' policy.
After that, the number of fixed matches decreased and many domestic championship results were again the consequence of fair matches.
The press admitted that competitive run during the 2005-2006 European of Romanian teams was a normal consequence of eradication of ''blaturi'' due to a strong and long anti-''blat'' campaign.

'''Qiviuq''' [sg] or '''qiviut''' [pl] ({{IPAc-en|Àà|k|…™|v|i|…ô|t}} {{respell|KIV|ee-…ôt}}; [[Inuktitut syllabics]], ·ïø·ïï·êÖ·ñÖ; [[Inuinnaqtun]], '''qiviuq''';&lt;ref name=translate&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohokak|first=G.|author2=M. Kadlun |author3=B. Harnum |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary|publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inupiaq language|Inupiaq]] '''qiviu''' or '''qiviuq'''&lt;ref name="refSeiler"&gt;Wolf A. Seiler (2012), [http://www.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf I√±upiatun Eskimo Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes spelled '''qiveut''') is the inner [[wool]] of the [[muskox]]. In [[Inuktitut]] the same word can be used to refer to the [[down feather]]s of birds.&lt;ref name=livingdict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/term/viewTerm.jsp?term=69827131079|title=Qiviuq|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The muskox has a two-layered coat, and ''qiviut'' refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The muskox sheds this layer of wool each spring. Qiviut is plucked from the coat of the muskox during the [[Moulting|molt]] or gathered from objects the animals have brushed against; unlike sheep, the animals are not [[Sheep shearer|sheared]]. Much of the commercially available qiviut comes from [[Canada]], and is obtained from the pelts of muskoxen after hunts. In [[Alaska]], qiviut is obtained from farmed animals or gathered from the wild during the molt.

==Properties==
Qiviut is stronger and warmer than sheep's wool,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arcticqiviut.com/about-qiviut/ Qiviut.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and softer than [[cashmere wool]]. Wild muskoxen have qiviut fibers approximately 18 [[micrometre]]s in diameter. Females and young animals have slightly finer wool.&lt;ref&gt;"Fiber characteristics of qiviut and guard hair from wild muskoxen (''Ovibos moschatus''). Rowell et al. 2001, ''Journal of Animal Science,'' 79:1670-1674&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[sheep]]'s wool, it does not shrink in water at any temperature, but this means that it also is not useful for [[felt]]ing.

It is most commonly used for hats and scarves, and is among the softest wools. It is very expensive; a high quality knitted scarf can cost more than $300 U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qiviut.com/shop_scarves_stoles.cfm Scarves] at the Oomingmak Cooperative website&lt;/ref&gt; but will last over 20 years with good care.

==Production and processing==
[[File:Qiviut sweater front.JPG|thumb|Qiviut sweater worth about $900 Canadian]]
An adult muskox can produce {{convert|4|to|7|lb|spell=on|sigfig=1}} of qiviut a year. Qiviut is produced by the muskox's secondary hair follicles, which are not associated with sebaceous glands, and therefore is a much drier fiber than wool, having only about 7 percent oils. The hair follicle density is very high (approximately {{convert|42|mm2|in2|adj=pre|per|disp=sqbr}}) and qiviut is shed in a tightly synchronized spring molting period. The qiviut will loosen from the animal's skin and pull away slightly, creating a "spectacled" look around the eyes and becoming visible all over the body at the surface of the pelt. At this stage of the molt, the undercoat is a short but relatively uniform distance from the skin. This lends itself to combing the qiviut from the animal in a single large sheet. If not combed, the qiviut will begin to fall out in clumps or be rubbed off by the animal, and may be plucked off the ground or bushes, but qiviut collected this way is of lower quality and requires more cleaning.

At the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks#Research units|Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station]] (LARS), a modified [[bison]] crush is used to gently but firmly hold the muskoxen in place, and the pelt combed out using a long-toothed comb or hair pick. After the fleece is removed, it is cleaned by hand, removing vegetation and other foreign matter, and then dehaired. Dehairing is the removal of intermediate hairs (greater than {{convert|30|Œºm|mm in|lk=in}} in diameter). Dehairing is accomplished by [[carding]] as one would [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]]. Mechanical carding can cause breakage and weaken and roughen the qiviut. Because the pelt is combed rather than shaved, there are very few guard hairs using this method. Pelts from hunted animals are shaved, so the dehairing process in this case is more laborious. After dehairing, the qiviut may be cleaned again, if necessary.

The raw, cleaned qiviut is spun and then the yarn is washed. Natural qiviut is soft grayish brown in color, but it takes dye well and can be found for sale in myriad colors. Bleaching weakens the fiber, however, so many spinners and knitters recommend using only overdyed natural qiveut, which has darker, more subdued colors.&lt;ref&gt;"The Muskox: wooly and warm in a northern fiber industry." Deirdre Helfferich. 2007, [https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/bitstream/handle/11122/1631/Agro%2039-1.pdf?sequence=1 ''Agroborealis'' 39:1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestication]] of the muskox was begun with the Musk Ox Project, headed by John J. Teal, Jr with the first domestic muskox farm in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. The project continues at the muskox farm in [[Palmer, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.muskoxfarm.org/ Musk Ox Farm Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Oomingmak, the Musk Ox Producers' Cooperative, was formed in the late 1960s by indigenous women on [[Nunivak Island]], with the help of Dr. Teal and Mrs. L. Schell. It is a knitting cooperative that works with qiviut and is still in operation today.  The cooperative has its headquarters in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and is owned by approximately 200 native Alaskans from many remote villages in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qiviut.com/store/index.cfm?target=About Oomingmak Cooperative website]&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the cooperative comes from the [[Inuit languages|Inuit language]] word for muskox, ''umi≈ãmak'', "the animal with skin like a beard."

'''Shinaki''' is the name given to the people living in the Lower [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], [[Pakistan]].

[[Hunza Valley]] has generally three parts, namely "Lower Hunza", "Centre Hunza" and "Upper Hunza".  The lower part includes mainly four villages namely Hussainabad, Mayon, Khanabad and Nasirabad (old name Hini- in Shina and Hindi- in Brushiski).
Historically Shinakis are considered straightforward, brave and loyal. In older times, ''[[Mir (title)|Mir]]'' (The ruler of Hunza) had special army mostly consisted of Shinakis.

Shinakis were the last to convert into [[Ismaili | Ismaili Muslims]] (99% of Hunza's population is Ismaili).

Currently, Hunza Shinaki is composed of five villages: Nasirabad, Mayoon, Khanabad, Hussainabad and Khizerabad. Among these Nasirabad and Mayoon are old settlements, These two villages used to be the first bastions of defense of Hunza in old times. People from Nasirabad and Mayoon bore the brunt of wars and battles of Hunza with Sikhs, British and other forces in late 19th century. There is a gorge where people of Mayoon wiped out an army of 500 Sikhs in a single night. This area is famous as ‚ÄòSikh Mara Jung‚Äô. Colonel Durand got wounded from a gunshot reportedly fired from Mayoon Fort. Incessant engagement with outside threat kept Shinaki people in combative mood all the time. The modern stereotyping of Shinakis as straightforward and aggressive stems from the centuries-old tradition. Besides warfare, the region of Hunza Shinaki was famous for its simplicity. The King of Hunza had a special respect for lower Hunza. In the modern era people of these areas are well educated, simple, and financially strong, they contribute their knowledge, wisdom and skills not only in Hunza, but also in [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] (fifth newly established province of Pakistan).

==Australia==
{{Main|Telephone numbers in Australia}}

'''[[List of country calling codes|Country Code]]: +61'''&lt;br /&gt;

Telephone numbers in Australia consist of a single-digit area code (prefixed with a '0' when dialing within Australia) and eight-digit local numbers, the first four, five or six of which specify the exchange, and the remaining four, three or two a line at that exchange. (Most exchanges though have several exchange codes.) Within Australia, the area code is only required to call from one area code to another.

Australia is divided geographically into a small number of large area codes, some of which cover more than one state and territory. Prior to the introduction of eight-digit numbers in the early-to-mid-1990's, telephone numbers were seven digits in the major capital cities, with a double - digit area code, and six digits in other areas with a three - digit area code. There were more than sixty such codes by 1990, with numbers running out, thus spurring the reorganization.

Following reorganization of the numbering plan between 1994&lt;ref&gt;Austel: Australia's Telephone Number Plan p. 14
&lt;/ref&gt; and 1998, the following numbering ranges are now used:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''1'''||Domestic number nationwide, e.g. [[Australian_telephone_numbering_plan#Freecall.2C_local_and_premium-rate_numbers|1800]], [[Australian_telephone_numbering_plan#Freecall.2C_local_and_premium-rate_numbers|1900]], [[Australian_telephone_numbering_plan#Freecall.2C_local_and_premium-rate_numbers|1300]], data services
|-
|'''02'''||[[New South Wales]] and [[Australian Capital Territory]]
|-
|'''03'''||[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]
|-
|'''04'''||[[Mobile phone]] services (National numbers)
|-
|'''05'''||"[[Australian telephone numbering plan#Personal_numbers_.2805.29|Follow me]]" services (National numbers)
|-
|'''07'''||[[Queensland]]
|-
|'''08'''||[[Northern Territory]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] ''(including [[Christmas Island]] and [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]])''.
|}

National numbers have no geographic significance. Other numbers relate to a particular telephone service area.

However, allowances are made for regional variations; sometimes the codes do not strictly follow state borders. For example, [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]] uses the '''08''' area code, due to its closer proximity to [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] than the state capital [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] area's inclusion in the [[Time in Australia|Australian Central Standard Time]] zone. The previous area code for [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] was (080). Other examples include towns in Southern [[New South Wales]] close to the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] that use the '''03''' (Victoria and Tasmania) prefix, including: [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]], [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] and [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]]). Some parts of the Tweed Coast of New South Wales have an area code of 07 followed by a subscriber number of 55xx xxxx (and new numbers 56xx xxxx). This means it is the cost of a local call to phone the Gold Coast in neighbouring Queensland, since the metropolis covers both sides of the NSW/Qld border. It is also a local call to adjoining NSW 02 667x xxxx numbers from these areas, and other southern Gold Coast exchanges (07 prefix numbers must dial the 02 to access these).

Since 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and seven-digit local numbers, the first three of which generally specify the exchange and the final four a line at that exchange. The domestic long distance prefix is '0'.

The dialing plan used in NZ reflects the national structure implemented by the [[New Zealand Post Office]] prior to the [[privatisation]] of the telecommunications services (and the creation of the [[Telecom New Zealand]] corporation). Domestic phone numbers with a first digit in range 2-8 are generally managed by Telecom.  Phone numbers beginning with 9 are usually those from other companies, for example TelstraClear. These allocations were firm until April 2007, whereupon full number portability was introduced; numbers can now be moved between carriers. [http://www.telecom.co.nz/content/0,8748,205250-200447,00.html].  There are currently no regions issued numbers starting with 1 - except for the national emergency services access number, '111'.

There are five regional area codes in use for landline calls, For example, a domestic toll call destined for a South Island location requires the dial prefix '03', being domestic-long-distance + 3 for the South Island.

|}

Mobile phone numbers are prefixed with 02, followed by one digit and the subscriber's number, which is either six, seven or eight digits, dialled in full, e.g. 021 xxx xxx or 027 xxx xxxx. With the introduction of number portability the number prefix is no longer a sure indicator as to the terminating network, but the following table lists the "default" mobile numbering prefixes:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|'''028'''||[[CallPlus New Zealand|CallPlus]]
|-
|'''029'''||[[TelstraClear]]
|}

Free call services generally use the prefix 0800 (via Telecom NZ) or 0508 (via TelstraClear), while local rate (usually internet access numbers) have the prefix 08xx. Premium rate services use the code 0900 followed by five digits. Neither of these are accessible internationally.

The International dialing prefix is '00', though other prefixes are available (i.e. 0161, for discounted rates, or 0168, for access to USA 1800 numbers). 

To dial into New Zealand from overseas, the leading 0 should be dropped from all area codes. (For example, an 021 xxx xxxx number would be reached by dialing +64 21 xxx xxxx).

'''Thomas O. "Tom" Murton''' (March 15, 1928 &amp;ndash; October 10, 1990) was a [[penology|penologist]] best known for his wardenship of the prison farms of [[Arkansas]]. In 1969, he published an account of the endemic corruption there which created a national scandal, and which was popularized in a fictional version by the film ''[[Brubaker]]''.

== Personal life ==
Tom Murton was born in 1928. His parents were E.T. Murton and Bessie Glass Stevens. He was married to Margaret E. Conway and had four children, Marquita (Marquita Schendal), Teresa (Teresa Kress), Melanie (Melanie Sandstrom) and Mark Murton.

Murton died of cancer at the age of 62 on October 10, 1990, at a Veterans Affairs Hospital in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DA1F3DF93AA25753C1A966958260 Thomas Murton, 62, a Penologist Who Advocated Reforms, Is Dead] ''The New York Times'' obituary, October 19, 1990; accessed March 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents and the four children survived him.

== Education and penological views ==
Before his career as a penologist, Murton attained a bachelor's degree in [[animal husbandry]] from [[Oklahoma State University]] in 1950. He earned a degree in mathematics at Fairbanks, Alaska between 1957 and 1958 with benefits under the GI bill. He enrolled in the [[University of California]] (Berkeley) in 1964 and completed a Master of Arts Degree in criminology and satisfied residency requirements for a doctorate in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas O. Murton Has Been a Busy Man for All His 39 Years, Pine Bluff Commercial. January 2, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; After he was dismissed from the Arkansas correctional system in 1968, he completed a doctoral degree in criminology at the [[University of California]] (Berkeley).&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

According to his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Murton's ideas on prison reform included treating prisoners with respect, abolishing corporal punishment, providing better food and rooting out extortion and other rackets among the inmates. Vehemently opposed to the death penalty, he dismantled the electric chair at Cummins. He also opposed life sentences. "When you sentence a man to life in prison, with no chance of getting out, he's going to die one day at a time because he knows he's doomed to walk the halls of purgatory for as long as he's alive," he once told an interviewer.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Career ==
Murton had helped establish the correctional system of the new state of [[Alaska]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

He was teaching at [[Southern Illinois University]] when he was hired to reform the Arkansas prison system in 1968. He wrote about his experiences there (with co-author [[Joe Hyams]]) in ''Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas Prison Scandal,'' published in 1969 by [[Grove Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murton |first1=Tom|last2=Hyams|first2=Joe |title=Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas Prison Scandal|year=1969 |publisher=Grove Press|location=New York, U.S. |isbn=9780718101107}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to find work in the correctional industry after that, and believed he had been [[Blackball (blacklist)|blackballed]] for his work in Arkansas.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

From 1971 to 1979, he taught at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1980, he left teaching and returned to farming, raising wheat and ducks on his mother's farm in Deer Creek, [[Oklahoma]], the community where he died, ten years later.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

In 1976, he wrote his second book on penal reform, ''The Dilemma of Prison Reform,'' published by [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|oclc=1582756|title=Dilemma of prison reform|last=Murton|first=Thomas O,|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|date=August 1, 1976|ASIN= B01K3LPUKK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prison scandal ==
=== Hired to end corruption ===
In the 1960s, Arkansas maintained two large [[prison farm]]s: the [[Tucker State Prison Farm]] and [[Cummins Unit|Cummins State Prison Farm]]. The farms used over a thousand inmates as forced labor to produce profits which annually "averaged about $1,400,000 over the years...".&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844402,00.html "Hell In Arkansas"], ''TIME'', February 9, 1968, accessed September 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Arkansas inaugurated a new governor to follow [[Orval Faubus]], who had held that office for twelve years (six terms). State Governor [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] released a report on the state prison system which had been ordered and then suppressed by Faubus. The 67-page report detailed horrific conditions at the two state penal farms, including endemic sexual assault, electrical torture, flogging, beatings with [[blackjack (weapon)|blackjacks]] and hoses, extortion of money from other inmates by the armed prisoners who were working as "[[Trusty system (prison)|trusty]]" guards (due to the absence of a salaried guard force), open marketing of illegal drugs and alcohol, and a host of other malicious and criminal practices.&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt; Particularly ironic, as well as harsh, was the poor quality and quantity of food given to the prisoners‚Äîon a farm which marketed enough produce and dairy products to produce profits that were averaging{{clarify|over what period of time?|date=September 2018}} $1.4 million (US) in 1960s dollars (more than ${{Inflation|US|1400000|1967|r=-4|fmt=c}} in current dollars).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In his own later writings about Tucker, Murton noted the cruelty of the "trustees":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Discipline was routinely enforced by flogging, beating with clubs, inserting of needles under fingernails, crushing of testicles with pliers, and the last word in torture devices: the "[[Tucker telephone]]," an instrument used to send an electric current through genitals.&lt;ref name="TIME May5-1980"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948854,00.html "U.S. Prisons: Myth vs. Mayhem"]. ''TIME'', May 5, 1980 essay by Frank Trippett on prison reform, quoting Murton, accessed September 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, along with releasing the Faubus report, Rockefeller sought to reform the system by bringing in Murton, who had made his reputation by helping establish the [[Alaska]]n correctional system after that territory achieved statehood in 1959. Murton, then 31 years old, was chosen to be the first professional penologist the state of Arkansas had ever hired as a warden.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

In early February 1968, Murton ordered excavations on the grounds of the Cummins prison farm. Three bodies were uncovered before the excavation was halted, although 15 to 25 depressions were clearly visible. Murton's inmate informant told him that as many as 200 bodies had been buried there; also, the number of prisoners listed as "escapees" since 1915 was reported as "more than 200".&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt;

According to the informant, Reuben Johnson, most of the men had been killed after refusing extortion demands from the "trusty" guards. Their deaths were either falsely recorded as successful escapes, or recorded as deaths, but under false pretenses. Johnson, a lifer, gave details of murders and burials on the prison grounds dating back for decades, including a mass murder of about 20 inmates around Labor Day of 1940. Johnson was backed up by at least one other inmate, James Wilson. Wilson also asserted that returning escapees were routinely murdered.&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt;

=== Fired to end exposure ===
The Rockefeller administration, though not directly implicated in crimes which took place before 1967, was deeply embarrassed by the national attention drawn to the brutality Murton revealed. Claims were made that the bodies must have been from a nearby [[potters field]], a cemetery for the poor. However, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted in February 1968, the cemetery in question was over a mile away from where Murton found the bodies, at least one of which was positively identified as prisoner Joe Jackson, buried by Reuben Johnson on Christmas Eve, 1946.&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt;

The skeletons were turned over to another arm of state government, the [[UAMS Medical Center|University of Arkansas Medical Center]]. At the time, Governor Rockefeller stated his intention to withhold details of the investigation from the public until the Arkansas state police issued a report of their findings, incorporating the University's results. Rockefeller was quoted nationwide when he said that there could be no point in "washing dirty linen for weeks on end as each body is dug up".&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt;

Murton's agitation eventually disrupted the Rockefeller administration to the extent that not only was he fired two months after the bodies were exhumed, he was told he had twenty-four hours to get out of the state, or be arrested for grave-robbing‚Äîa charge with a sentence of twenty-one years, under Arkansas law at that time. He left.&lt;ref name="Mark Murton"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008MTVY A Real Story, Like "Walking Tall"] April 15, 2003 Amazon.Com review of ''Brubaker'' DVD by Mark D. Murton, accessed September 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TV archive"&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=444913 NBC Evening News for Tuesday, Mar 04, 1969 Vanderbilt Television News Archive] [[David Brinkley]] and Douglas Kiker reporting on interviews with Tom Murton and Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, summarized by Vanderbilt University Television News Archive, accessed September 13, 2006 (free archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

Murton was dismissed in early spring 1968, less than a year after his 1967 hire. Governor Rockefeller claimed that Murton's excavations had become a "sideshow".&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt; The governor halted the excavations after the first three bodies were found. The official report by the Rockefeller administration, written by the Arkansas state police, took the position that the bodies must have been from the paupers' cemetery&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;‚Äîalthough the cemetery was a mile away from where the bodies were located.&lt;ref name="TIME Feb9-1968"/&gt;

Murton's book about the scandalous conditions was released the next year, 1969, and the Redford movie was released eleven years later, in 1980 (see ''[[Brubaker]]'').

Murton's career as a correctional administrator was over. In 1982, Murton shared with students in a criminal justice graduate seminar course at the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] that he was "blackballed" by the "correctional community". To make a living, he started and maintained a duck farm north of Oklahoma City, where he lived until his death. Dr. William Parker, then department chair over the criminal justice program and subsequently the assistant dean, invited Murton to teach at the University of Central Oklahoma in the mid-1980s. He returned to academia for the next several years, including a short stint teaching criminology and corrections at [[Oklahoma State University]] in the mid-1980s. Murton continued to maintain his duck farm until his death in late 1990.

== Film ==
{{main|Brubaker}}
The book written by Murton and Hyams was published in 1969. In 1980, a fictionalized film treatment starring [[Robert Redford]] as "Warden Henry Brubaker" was released to wide acclaim, earning an Oscar nomination. Although the dramatic opening of the film, in which Brubaker impersonates an inmate in order to see the system literally "from inside" before taking up the warden's post, was a fabrication, much of the movie's drama was taken directly from the book.&lt;ref name="Mark Murton"/&gt;

The fabricated prisoner-impersonation device may have been inspired by [[Thomas Mott Osborne]], a former warden at [[Sing Sing]], who had had himself committed to [[Auburn Prison|Auburn Penitentiary]] in 1913 under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="Nellis"&gt;''The Prison Film,'' by Mike Nellis and Christopher Hale (London: 1982), at p. 12; accessed via [http://www.theprisonfilmproject.com/prisonfilmanalysis/filmlist/brubaker.htm The Prison Film Project] September 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Song ==
In 1968, the popular singer [[Bobby Darin]] wrote and recorded "[[Long line rider|Long Line Rider]]", a song which described the incident, on his album ''[[Bobby Darin Born Walden Robert Cassotto]]''. Some of its lyrics were: "There's a farm in Arkansas, got some secrets in its floor, in decay, in decay. You can tell where they're at, nothing grows, the ground is flat, where they lay, where they lay." It also includes the line "This kind of thing can't happen here, especially not in election year." Darin was due to perform the song on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', but when they ordered him to cut that particular line, rather than censor himself, he walked off the set.&lt;ref&gt;"That's All: Bobby Darin on Record, Stage and Screen" by Jeff Bleiel, Pg 197, Tiny Ripple Books 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==
"Prisons, mental hospitals, and other institutions are a thermometer that measures the sickness of the larger society. The treatment society affords its outcasts reveals the way in which its members view one another‚Äîand themselves."‚ÄîFrom the Preface of his book: ''Accomplices to the Crime'', 1969, Grove Press, Inc., New York.

'''Tsonga''' ({{IPAc-en|'|t|s|Q|N|g|@|,_|'|t|s|…îÀê|-}}) or '''Xitsonga''' ({{small|Tsonga:}} ''Xitsonga'') is a southern African [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Tsonga people]]. It is mutually intelligible with Tswa and Ronga, and the name "Tsonga" is often used as a cover term for all three, also sometimes referred to as Tswa-Ronga. The Xitsonga language has been standardized for both academic and home use, making it the base language for the Tsonga people. Like with many other languages, there are various dialects within the Tsonga language group.

== History ==
The Xitsonga language was studied in great detail by the Swiss missionary, [[Henri-Alexandre Junod]] between the year 1890 and 1920, who made the conclusion that the Xitsonga language (which he called the "Thonga language" at the time) began to develop in Mozambique even before the 1400s. In his own words, Junod states the following:&lt;ref&gt;Junod, Henry (1912, 1927), ''The Life of a South African Tribe: The Social Life'', Neuchatel: Imprimerie Attinger Freres, p.&amp;nbsp;32‚Äì33&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|My conclusion is then that the Thonga language was already-spoken by the primitive occupants of the country more than 500 years ago and that, together with a certain number of customs, it formed the great bond which bound the Thonga clans together in past centuries.}}

Further studies were carried out by Junod and other Swiss missionaries such as Henri Berthoud and Ernest Creux, who began to unify the language in order to have a standard way of writing and reading. "Shigwamba" was a term used by the missionaries in order to group the language under a unified identity, however the name was unfamiliar to many of the Tsonga people and had to be replaced with "Thonga/Tsonga". Harries makes reference to this:&lt;ref&gt;Harries, P. 1987, The Roots of Ethnicity: Discourse and the Politics of Language Construction in South-East Africa, University of the Witwatersrand. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|As the term Gwamba was unknown outside the Spelonken, Henri Berthoud recommended that the mission abandon the term and replace it with the widely accepted genericism, Tonga/Thonga.}}

Swiss missionaries engaged with the Tsonga people and used their assistance to translate the Bible from English and Sesotho into the Tsonga language. Paul Berthoud published the first book in 1883 which came as a result of the help he received from the translations by Mpapele (Mbizana) or Mandlati (Zambiki). The two men were active in teaching and translating the language to the missionaries since none of the missionaries were familiar with it and had to dedicate a lot of their time to learn. The language of the Tsonga people and the dialects were put into print and the first books were published. The language was later on finally registered as ‚ÄúXitsonga‚Äù within the Constitution of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and it was declared an official language. The standardization of the Xitsonga language as a result made it possible for the Tsonga people to develop a common way of speaking and writing.

== Etymology ==
The name "Tsonga" is the root of Xitsonga (culture, language or ways of the Tsonga), Mutsonga (a Tsonga person), Vatsonga (Tsonga people), etc. In the language of the Vatsonga themselves, the root never appears by itself. It is Tsonga for the ease and accessibility of the wider international community.

As for the origins of the name, there are three theories. The first states that Tsonga is another pronunciation for Dzonga, which means "South" and also the name of one of the dialects of Xitsonga. The second theory is that it is an alternate spelling of the old ancestral name of the [[Chopi people|Chopi]] and Tembe groups, Tonga/Thonga. The other Zulu explanation for the alternative spelling of "Thonga" is that the Tembe and Rhonga people, who were the first to arrive at the Delagoa Bay and around the Natal Bay, transitioned the Rhonga "Rh" into the Zulu form of "Th". An example is '''rhuma''' (Tsonga word for "send") becomes '''thuma''' (Zulu word for the same action). The third and most accepted is that it is another pronunciation for "Rhonga", the root for the word "vurhonga" for east or the direction where the sun rises. Vurhonga also means dawn in Xitsonga. Rhonga (commonly and wrongly spelt as Ronga) is one of the Tsonga languages. The physical evidence of most Tsonga people residing along the eastern coast of Africa in the south, extending inland in a westward direction, makes this explanation especially inviting.

Much of the history about the Tsonga people had been overlooked and thus a lot of the history speaks about the aftermath of the mfecane where the Nguni people overran a lot of the pre-existing African tribes of South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The 1800s was a period where a lot of the European writers were documenting a lot of the events that dominated in the Shaka Zulu era and the Tsonga history was largely overlooked in favor of Nguni conquests.

Tsonga people and languages are: Chopi, Gwamba, Ndau, Ronga, Tonga and Tswa.

Among these languages, three language groups can be identified. These are S50 (Tswa-Ronga group), S60 (Chope group), and Ndau language (S15), currently falling under the Shona group (S10). In total there are six recognised languages.

'''Chopi Group'''
# Chopi (Chope, Copi, Tshopi, Txopi) dialects are Copi, Khambani, Lambwe, Lenge (Lengue), Ndonge and Tonga.
# Tonga (Nyembane, Nyembani, Inhambane).

'''Ndau Group'''
# Ndau (Ndzawu, Njao, Sofala, South-East Shona) dialects are Changa (Shanga, Xanga), Danda, Dondo, Gova, Ndau, and

'''Tswa-Ronga Group'''
# Ronga (Rhonga) dialects are Kalanga, Konde, Putru, and Ssonge.
# Gwamba (Gwapa) dialects are Bila (Vila), Djonga (Dzonga, Jonga), Hlanganu (Langanu, Nhlanganu), Hlave (Mbayi, Nkuna, Pai), Kande, Khosa, Luleke, N'walungu (Ngwalungu), Nkuma, Songa, Valoyi, Xika, and Xonga.
# Tswa (Tshwa) dialects are Dzibi (Dzivi), Dzibi-Dzonga (Dzivi-Dzonga), Tshwa, Hlengwe (Lengwe, Lhenge), Khambani, Makwakwe-Khambani, Mandla, Ndxhonge, and Nhayi (Nyai, Nyayi).

Some dialects are subdialects but have been mentioned here for completeness. For example, Valoyi and Luleke comprise the N'walungu dialect. There is no Gwamba dialect as Gwamba is another name for Xitsonga itself. Formally Xitsonga has been called Gwamba. Tswa-Ronga dialects not considered part of the family include Pulana (Xipulana, Sepulane). What is commonly referred to as "Shangana/Changana" is not a recognized language in South Africa and is not a dialect that falls within the Xitsonga language group because its point of reference stems mainly from the use of the Nguni language and grammar. A dialect is when words all come from the same language group but are pronounced differently in speech and writing and therefore Nguni words cannot be used to impose an obscure view of dialects within the Xitsonga language group. Therefore, any reference to a Shangaan form of speech should be classified as a dialect belonging to the [[Lala language (South Africa)|Lala]], [[Nguni languages|Zunda]], and Ngoni language group.

There are only six (6) Thonga/Tsonga dialects which were identified by the dawn of the 1900s, which are named as xiRonga, xiHlanganu, xiBila, xiDjonga, xiN'walungu, xiHlengwe. All other variations within South Africa are sub-dialects of those identified. The dialects most spoken in the rural communities of Limpopo are the N'walungu, Bila, Hlengwe, and the Hlanganu dialects. The Xitsonga vocabulary and phonetic permutations are as well largely based on these dialects (compare with Junod 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;470-473)

For "language of", the various languages and dialects may use one or more of the prefixes: Bi-, Chi-, Ci-, Gi-, Ici-, Ki-, Ma-, Shee-, Shi-, Txi-, Va-, Wa-, and Xi-. For "people of", they use either "Ba-" or "Va-".

==Official status==
Tsonga is an official language in South Africa. It has been suggested to be made official in Zimbabwe according to the new constitution. All Tswa-Ronga languages are recognised in Mozambique. It is not official in Swaziland.

==Phonology==
Tsonga has a distinction between [[modal voice|modal]] and [[breathy voice]]d consonants: {{IPA|/b ±, bv ±, v ±, d ±, …ñ ê ±, d í ±, …° ±/}} vs {{IPA|/b, bv, v, d, …ñ ê, d í, …°/}} among the obstruents (the one exception being {{IPA|/…Æ/}}), and {{IPA|/mÃ§, nÃ§, ≈ãÃà, rÃ§, »∑Ãà, wÃ§/}} vs {{IPA|/m, n, ≈ã, r, j, w/}} among the sonorants (the one exception being {{IPA|/…≤/}}).

A number of Tsonga speakers may alternate affricate sounds from alveolar to retroflex; {{IPA|/ts, ts ∞, dz, dz ±, dz ± ∑/}} to {{IPA|/ à Ç,  à Ç ∞, …ñ ê, …ñ ê ±, …ñ ê ± ∑/}}. Many consonants can be prenasalised as well. Labiodental and dental nasal consonants only occur in various consonant compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analytical Tsonga Grammar|last=Baumbach|first=E. J. M.|publisher=Pretoria : University of South Africa|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some of the [[Nguni languages]], Tsonga has very few words with [[click consonant]]s, and these vary in place between [[dental click|dental]] and [[postalveolar click|postalveolar]]. Examples are: 
ngqondo (mind), gqoka (wear/dress), guqa (kneel), riqingo (phone), qiqi (earring), qamba (compose), Mugqivela (Saturday).

Tsonga also has "whistled" sibilants similar to [[Shona language|Shona]] "sw/sv", tsw/tsv", "dzw/dzv".

==Grammar==
The grammar is generally typical of Bantu languages with a [[SVO language|subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject]] order. The structure changes to subject‚Äîobject‚Äîverb when addressing another person:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tsonga
! English
|-
| Ndza ku rhandza
| I you love (I love you)
|-
| Wa ndzi rhandza
| You love me
|-
| Ha ku tiva
| We know you
|-
| Va ndzi tiva
| They know me
|}

===Tenses===

'''Present tense'''&lt;br /&gt;
The present tense is formed by simply using the personal pronoun along with the verb.&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi lava {{Not a typo|mali}} ‚Äì I want money,&lt;br /&gt;
Hi tirha siku hinkwaro ‚Äì We work all day,&lt;br /&gt;
Mi(u) lava mani? ‚Äì Who are you looking for?&lt;br /&gt;
U kota ku famba ‚Äì S/He knows how to walk.

'''Present progressive'''&lt;br /&gt;
Generally, to indicate ongoing actions in the present one takes the personal pronoun, drops the 'i' and adds 'a'.&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi nghena (e)ndlwini ‚Äì I am entering the house,&lt;br /&gt;
Ha tirha sweswi ‚Äì We are working right now,&lt;br /&gt;
Ma hemba ‚Äì You(pl.) are lying,&lt;br /&gt;
Wa hemba ‚Äì You(sing.) are lying,&lt;br /&gt;
Wa hemba ‚Äì S/He is lying,&lt;br /&gt;
With the plural 'va'(they) there is no difference. Thus 'va hemba' = they lie AND they are lying.

'''Past tense'''&lt;br /&gt;
This is for in one of three ways, depending on the word.&lt;br /&gt;
(i) Generally, one drops the 'a' from the verb and adds the prefix '-ile'  &lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi nghenile ndlwini ‚Äì I entered the house,&lt;br /&gt;
Hi tirhile siku hinkwaro ‚Äì We worked all day,&lt;br /&gt;
U hembile ‚Äì You lied,&lt;br /&gt;
U hembile ‚Äì S/He lied,&lt;br /&gt;
Va hembile ‚Äì They lied.

(ii) With verbs that end with -ala, in the past change to -ele or -ale.&lt;br /&gt;
ku rivala ‚Äì to forget,&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi rivele ‚Äì I Forgot, U rivele ‚Äì you forgot, Va rivele ‚Äì they forgot,&lt;br /&gt;
Ku nyamalala ‚Äì To disappear,&lt;br /&gt;
U nyamalarile ‚Äì S/he ‚Äì disappeared,&lt;br /&gt;
Words used to describe a state of being also use the past tense.&lt;br /&gt;
Ku karhala ‚Äì To be tired,&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi karhele ‚Äì I am tired, U karhele ‚Äì S/He is tired, Va karhele ‚Äì They are tired.

(iii) In many cases merely changing the last 'a' in the verb to an 'e' indicates past action.&lt;br /&gt;
Ku fika ‚Äì To arrive,&lt;br /&gt;
U fike tolo ‚Äì S/He arrived yesterday,&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi fike tolo ‚Äì I arrived yesterday,&lt;br /&gt;
Hi tirhe siku hinkwaro ‚Äì We worked all day,&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi nghene (e)ndlwini ‚Äì I entered the house.

'''Future tense'''&lt;br /&gt;
This is formed by the adding 'ta' in between the personal pronoun and the verb.&lt;br /&gt;
Ndzi ta nghena (e)ndlwini ‚Äì I will enter the house,&lt;br /&gt;
Hi ta tirha siku hinkwaro ‚Äì We will work all day,&lt;br /&gt;
Va ta tirha siku hinkwaro ‚Äì They will work all day,&lt;br /&gt;
Mi ta tirha siku hinkwaro ‚Äì You(pl.) will work all day.

===Noun classes===

|}

* In classes 9 and 10, ''yi'' is present when the noun stem has one syllable, and is absent otherwise.

===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns in Tsonga are very similar to those of many other Bantu languages, with a few variations.

These may be classified as [[Grammatical person|first person]] (the speaker), [[Grammatical person|second person]] (the one spoken to), and third person (the one spoken about). They are also classified by [[grammatical number]], i.e., singular and plural. There is no distinction between subject and object.

Each pronoun has a corresponding [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord or agreement morpheme]].{{clarify|date=April 2012}}

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Personal Pronouns
! !! 1st sg. !! 2nd sg. !! 3rd sg. !! 1st pl. !!  2nd pl. !! 3rd pl. 
|-
! Pronoun 
| mina       ||    wena  ||  yena ||   hina ||  n'wina ||  vona 
|-

("You see it‚Äîthe chicken.") || Yena u vona huku. ("He/she sees a chicken.")&lt;br&gt;Yena wa yi vona huku. ("He/she sees it‚Äîthe chicken.") || Hina hi vona huku. ("We see a chicken.")&lt;br&gt;Hina ha yi vona huku. ("We see it‚Äîthe chicken.") || N'wina mi vona huku. ("You see a chicken.")&lt;br&gt;N'wina ma yi vona huku. ("You see it‚Äîthe chicken.") || Vona va vona huku. ("They see a chicken.")&lt;br&gt;Vona va yi vona huku. ("They see it‚Äîthe chicken.") 
|-
|}

===Verbs===

All verbs have the prefix "ku" and end with an 'a' in the [[infinitive]], with a couple of exceptions.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tsonga
! English
|-
| ku chava
| To fear
|-
| ku tsaka
| To rejoice
|-
| ku rhandza
| to love
|}

The main exception to this is the verb "ku ri" ‚Äì "to say" It corresponds to "ti" in many other bantu languages. Examples of its usage include:&lt;br /&gt;
u ri yini? ‚Äì What do you say? (What are you saying?)&lt;br /&gt;
ndzi ri ka n'wina ‚Äì I say to you all.

In many instances the "ri" is often omitted and thus "ku" on its own can also mean "say".&lt;br /&gt;
Va ri ndza penga ‚Äì They say I'm crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
Va ri yini? ‚Äì What do they say? (What are they saying?)

===Proverbs===

Like many other languages, Xitsonga has many proverbs; these appear in different classes. They appear in a group of animals, trees and people.

==Vocabulary==
&lt;!--This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different sets of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc.--&gt;

Xitsonga, like many other African languages, have been influenced by various European colonial languages. Xitsonga includes words borrowed from English, [[Afrikaans]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Also, because of the influence of other more dominant neighbouring languages, Xitsonga has taken some words, especially click words, from isiZulu actually its (Nguni/ngoni).

Words borrowed from English
* Thelevhixini (Mavonakule) ‚Äì television
* Rhediyo (Xiyanimoya) ‚Äì Radio
* Xitulu ‚Äì chair (Stool)
* Wachi (Xikomba-nkarhi) ‚Äì watch (to tell time)
* Movha (Xipandza-mananga) ‚Äì car (automobile)
* Sokisi ‚Äì socks
* Nghilazi ‚Äì glass
* Tliloko ‚Äì clock(bell)
* Masipala ‚Äì municipal (plural: vamasipala)
* Makhiya/swikhiya (Xilotlela) ‚Äì keys

Words borrowed from Afrikaans
* lekere ‚Äì sweets (lekkers)
* fasitere ‚Äì window (venster)
* lepula ‚Äì spoon (lepel)
* kereke ‚Äì church (kerk)
* buruku ‚Äì trousers (broek)
* domu ‚Äì idiot (dom)
* tafula ‚Äì table (tafel)
* xipuku ‚Äì ghost (spook)

Words borrowed from isiZulu:
* riqingho ‚Äì phone
* ku qonda ‚Äì to head towards (not standard = ku kongoma)
* ku gcina ‚Äì to end (not standard = ku hetelela)
* ku zama ‚Äì to try (not standard = ku ringeta)

==Writing system==

===Xitsonga Latin Alphabet===
Xitsonga uses the [[Latin alphabet]]. However, certain sounds are spelled using a combination of letters, which either do not exist in [[Indo-European languages]], or may be meant to distinguish the language somewhat.

An example of this is the letter "x" taken from Portuguese orthography, which is pronounced {{ipa|/ É/}}. Therefore, the following words, [ Éu Éa], [ Éikolo], [ Éilo], are written in Tsonga as -xuxa, xikolo, and xilo.

Other spelling differences include the letter "c", which is pronounced {{ipa|/tÕ° É/}}. However, where the emphasis of a word is on the following vowel the letter is hardened by adding "h" this the Tsonga word -chava(fear)

A sound equivalent to the Welsh "ll" ({{ipa|/…¨/}}) is written "hl" in Tsonga, e.g. -hlangana(meet), -hlasela(attack), -hleka(laugh)

A whistling sound common in the language is written "sw" or "sv" in Zimbabwean chishona. This sound actually belongs to the "x-sw" class within the language. E.g.:
* sweswi (now)
* xilo(thing) ‚Äì swilo(things)
* xikolo(school) ‚Äì swikolo(schools)
* Xikwembu(God) ‚Äì swikwembu(gods)

Another whistling sound is spelled "dy" but has no English equivalent, the closest being the "dr" sound in the English word "drive"

Xitsonga has been standardised as a written language. However, there are many dialects within the language that may not pronounce words as written. For example, the Tsonga bible uses the word "byela"(tell), pronounced bwe-la, however a large group of speakers would say "dzvela" instead.

The [[Lord's Prayer]] as written in the Xitsonga Bible (Bibele)

&lt;poem&gt;
Tata wa hina la nge matilweni,
vito ra wena a ri hlawuriwe;
a ku te ku fuma ka wena;
ku rhandza ka wena a ku endliwe misaveni; 
tani hi loko ku endliwa matilweni;
u hi nyika namuntlha vuswa bya hina
bya siku rin'wana ni rin'wana;
u hi rivalela swidyoho swa hina,
tani hi loko na hina hi rivalela lava hi dyohelaka; 
u nga hi yisi emiringweni
kambe u hi ponisa eka Lowo biha,
hikuva ku fuma, ni matimba, ni ku twala i swa wena
hi masiku ni masiku. 
Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Xiyinhlanharhu xa Mipfawulo===
The ''sintu'' writing system, ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu/[[Litema|Ditema]] [[Ditema tsa Dinoko|tsa Dinoko]]'', also known technically in Xitsonga as ''Xiyinhlanharhu xa Mipfawulo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=IsiBheqe |publisher=isibheqe.org |date=2015-08-23 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for all Xitsonga varieties. 
The class 7/8 noun pairs above are represented as follows:

'''Turkmen''' ({{lang|tk|T√ºrkmen√ße, t√ºrkmen dili}}; {{lang|tk-Cyrl|–¢“Ø—Ä–∫–º–µ–Ω—á–µ, —Ç“Ø—Ä–∫–º–µ–Ω –¥–∏–ª–∏}} {{lang|tk-Arab|ÿ™€Üÿ±⁄©ŸÖŸÜ ÿØÔª¥Ôª†€å ,ÿ™€Üÿ±⁄©ŸÖŸÜ⁄ÜŸá}} {{IPA-tk|ty…ækment Ée, ty…ækmen dili|}}) is an official language of Turkmenistan. It is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken by 3.5 million people in [[Turkmenistan]] as well as by around 719,000 people in northeastern [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/country/IR/status&lt;/ref&gt;. The group known as "Iraqi Turkmen" are actually speakers of South Azeri and not all tribes that are called "Turkmen" in northeastern Iran are speakers of Turkmen; many are speakers of [[Khorasani Turkic language|Khorasani Turkic]]. and 1.5 million people in northwestern [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|tuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Turkmen is a member of the East Oghuz branch of the [[Turkic language|Turkic]] family of languages; its closest relatives being [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], with which it shares a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].

Turkmen has [[vowel harmony]], is [[agglutinative]], and has no grammatical gender. Word order is [[subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb]].

Written Turkmen today is based on the Teke (Tekke) dialect. The other dialects are Nohurly, √ùomud, √Ñnewli, Hasarly, Nerezim, G√∂kle≈à, Salyr, Saryk, √Ñrsary and √áowdur. The Russian dialect is Trukhmen. The Teke dialect is sometimes (especially in [[Afghanistan]]) referred to as "Chagatai", but like all Turkmen dialects it reflects only a limited influence from classical [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]].

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Turkmen alphabet}}

Officially, Turkmen is rendered in the ‚ÄúT√§ze Elipbi√Ω‚Äù, or ‚ÄúNew Alphabet‚Äù, which is based on the Latin alphabet. However, the old "Soviet" Cyrillic alphabet is still in wide use. Many political parties in opposition to the authoritarian rule of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] continued to use the Cyrillic alphabet on websites and publications, most likely to distance themselves from the alphabet that Niyazov created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=}}

Before 1929, Turkmen was written in an [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabet]]. In 1929‚Äì1938 a Latin alphabet replaced it, and then the Cyrillic alphabet was used from 1938 to 1991. In 1991, the current Latin alphabet was introduced, although the transition to it has been rather slow. It used to use some unusual letters, such as the pound, dollar, yen, and cent signs, but these were replaced by more conventional letter symbols.{{clarification|date=June 2017}}

== Sounds ==
The following phonemes are present in the Turkmen language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammatical sketch of Turkmen|last=Hoey|first=Elliott|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

=== Vowels ===
Turkmen contains both short and long vowels. Doubling the duration of sound for a short vowel is generally how its long vowel counterpart is pronounced. Turkmen employs vowel harmony, a principle that is common in fellow Turkic languages. Vowels and their sounds are as follows:

Note that s/—Å and z/–∑ represent {{IPA|[Œ∏]}} and {{IPA|[√∞]}}, not {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}}, a unique feature among the Turkic languages (cf. ''[[ceceo]]'' in some Spanish dialects).

=== Vowel harmony ===
Like other Turkic languages, Turkmen is characterized by [[vowel harmony]]. In general, words of native origin consist either entirely of front vowels (in√ße √ßekimli sesler) or entirely of back vowels (√Ωogyn √ßekimli sesler). Prefixes and suffixes reflect this harmony, taking different forms depending on the word to which they are attached.

The infinitive form of a verb determines whether it will follow a front vowel harmony or back vowel harmony. Words of foreign origin, mainly Russian, Persian, or Arabic, do not follow vowel harmony.

==Grammar ==

=== Verbs ===
[[Verbs]] are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for singular and plural number and first, second, and third persons. There are 11 verb tenses: &lt;!--oh my god. Can someone please expand this section to make a bit of sense out of those 11 tenses?--&gt;present comprehensive (long and short form), present perfect (regular and negative), future certain, future indefinite, conditional, past definite, obligatory, imperative, and intentional.

There are two types of verbs in Turkmen, distinguished by their infinitive forms: those ending in the suffix "-mak" and those ending in "-mek". -Mak verbs follow back vowel harmony, whereas -mek verbs follow front vowel harmony.

====Evidentiality====
Evidentiality of a reported event is determined by four markers, affixed to the finite verb, roughly:

*-dY (Direct Evidence)
*-(Y)p-dYr (Hearsay)
*-dYr-mY-n√§m (Indirect Evidence)
*-mY≈ü (Rumoured that)

Here ''Y'' represents the close vowel conforming to vowel harmony.
 
Some independent particles may be said to convey evidentiality: one such word is the particle ''eken''.

:'''1.''' Aman syrkawla-p-dyr.
 Aman become sick-EV-COP
            (I heard that) Aman is sick.(information is "hearsay")

::Compare 1 with 2.a and 2.b:

:'''2.a.''' Aman syrkawla-dy.
 Aman  become sick-3sPAST

:'''2.b.''' Aman syrkaw.
 Aman sick.
                 Aman is sick. (speaker has spoken with Aman)

:'''3.''' Maral A≈ügabat-dan    gel-ip-dir.
 &lt;nowiki&gt; Maral Ashgabat-ABL come-EV-COP
                (I heard that) Maral came from Ashgabat.
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

:'''4.'''   Ben sen-i≈à   k√∂ke-ler-i≈à-i        i√Ω-di.
 &lt;nowiki&gt; Ben you-GEN  cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC eat-3spast
      Ben ate your cookies.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::i. The speaker saw Ben eat the cookies (direct evidence).

::ii. Ben told the speaker that he ate the cookies.

:'''5.''' Ben sen-i≈à      k√∂ke-ler-i≈à-i                   i√Ω-ip-dir.
 &lt;nowiki&gt; Ben you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC eat-EV-COP
       Ben ate your cookies.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::i. The speaker heard from someone else that Ben ate the cookies (hearsay).

::ii. Generally, the speaker learned through means other than 4.i and 4.ii that Ben ate the cookies.

:'''6.a.''' Ben i√Ω-ip-dir-mik√§(n)    sen-i≈à      k√∂ke-ler-i≈à-i.
 &lt;nowiki&gt; Ben eat-EV-COP-EV you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC
         Ben ate your cookies, or more loosely: I wonder if Ben ate your cookies.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::i. The speaker saw evidence of the action, i.e. crumbs, and "made the connection." (informant's account)

::ii. The speaker "doesn't concretely know [Ben] ate them." (informant's account)

::iii. In the words of the informant: "I am questioning myself.  But it's not a question."

::iv. In other words: a deduction from indirect evidence, a suspicion

:'''6.b.''' Men (...) i√Ω-ip-dir-in-mik√§m?
 &lt;nowiki&gt;  I    (...)   eat-EV-1sPRES(?)-EV
           Did I eat something?&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::i. The speaker questions whether or not s/he has performed an action.

::ii. Evidence of the particular action may be direct, however the nature of its complement (i.e. an item of food) may be in doubt.

:'''7.'''   Ben i√Ω-en-mi≈ü        sen-i≈à      k√∂ke-ler-i≈à-i.
 &lt;nowiki&gt; Ben eat-PART be-RUM  you-GEN     cookie-PL-2sPOSS-ACC
       It is rumoured that Ben ate your cookies.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::i. The action has been passed on via several speakers, or gossiped, similar to in the English gloss.

*Note the postposed complement in 7.  A tree of 7 would look something like {(Ben [{(the one who ate [ti])} must be]) [your cookies]i } using different brackets only in order to make the nesting more obvious.
*In 6.a., the verb appears in the form i√Ω-ip-dir-min√§m.  I've analyzed the final two syllables as one evidential particle, glossed as EV.  This follows partly from the intuitions of the informant, and partly from the consistence: it always appears as -min√§m. Nonetheless, it could also be glossed as ...eat-EV-COP-INT-what..., something like, literally, Did Ben eat your cookies, or what?'

====Negation====
One way to express negation in Turkmen is with the [[predicative adjective]] √Ωok, which indicates absence.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

:Onu≈à ma≈üyny √Ωok.
:3sg  car-GEN  NEGV
:'He does not have a car.'

:√ñ√Ωde Amandan ba≈üga adam √Ωok.
:houseLOC  AmanINST  except  person  NEGV
:'There is no one but Aman in the house.'

The phonetically similar suffix -ok is another option: it attaches to the verb which it negates.  It comes after the stem and before the tense suffix.  -Ok does not modify its form due to vowel harmony.  In addition to -ok there is another suffix -me or -ma.  It appears -mV is used when dealing with one event, -ok for more habitual or lasting states:

:Men bilemok.  'I don't know.'
:Men bilemokdym.  'I didn't know (for a long time).'
:Men bilmedim.  'I didn't know (on one occasion).'

(These correspond to the positive forms 'Men bily√§rin', 'Men bily√§rdim', and 'Men bildim.')

:Ol ajyganok.
:3sg to hunger-GERUND-NEG
::Literally &lt;nowiki&gt;*'He is not hungering'; in grammatical English, 'He is not hungry.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;  (compare to d√§l construction below)

Speakers of Eastern dialects of Turkmen, influenced by Uzbek, are less likely to utilize the -ok suffix.

Yet another way of expressing negation is by the negative particle d√§l.

:Men ≈üu kitaby okamaly d√§l.
:1sg this book-ACC read-OBLIG NEG
:I do not have to read this book. or, I should not read this book.  (sentence was elicited for the latter meaning)

:Ol a√ß d√§l.
:3sg hungry NEG  (note the lack of copula)
:He is not hungry.

:Kofe gyzgyn bolup biler.
:The coffee might be hot.

:Kofe gyzgyn d√§l bolup biler.
:The coffee might not be hot.

:Kofe gyzgyn d√§lmi?
:Isn't the coffee hot?

There is not an equivalent in Turkmen to the English prefix 'un-'.  That is, one can't simply attach an affix to a verb to indicate the opposite action, as in wrap the present ‚Üí unwrap the present.

It appears that different tenses use different forms of negation, as in the following sentences:

:Men ylgamok.
:I am not running. (present)

:Men ylgamadym.
:I did not run.  (past)

:Men ylgajak d√§l.
:I will not run.  (definite future)

=== Suffixes ===
Suffixes, or "go≈üulmalar", form a very important part of Turkmen.  They can mark possession, or change a verb.

* To make a verb passive: -yl/-il; -ul/-√ºl; -l
* To make a verb reflexive: -yn/-in; -un/-√ºn; -n
* To make a verb reciprocal: -y≈ü/-i≈ü; -u≈ü/-√º≈ü; -≈ü
* To make a verb causative: -dyr/-dir; -dur/-d√ºr; -yr/-ir; -ur/-√ºr; -uz/-√ºz; -ar/-er; -der/-dar; -t

Suffixes reflect vowel harmony.

==Literature==
The leading Turkmen poet is [[Magtymguly Pyragy]], who wrote in the eighteenth century.  His language represents a transitional stage between [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and spoken Turkmen.

=="T√ºrkmeni≈à"==
Magtymguly's most famous poem among the 1.3 million Iranian Turkmen is "T√ºrkmeni≈à" (of the Turkmen).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magtymguly.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The poem concerns the geography of the Turkmen people, and it sings praise for their culture. The poem became a rallying cry for Turkmen independence during the Iranian Revolution. The poem can be read aloud or sung in groups. The Iranian Turkmen dialect is closer to Turkish, so they refer to the poet as "Mahtumkulu Firaki."

In between the Amu-Darya and the Caspian sea,
The wind of the Turkmen expands from the desert.
The bud of a flower- the blackness of my eye
From the dark mountains comes the flood of Turkmen.

The Almighty blessed this land. His shadow is present.
A sandstorm in its desert, a white camel,
Color upon color of blooming flowers on the green plains,
The Turkmen desert has drowned into basil.

Its beautiful woman will come out covered in green,
The smell of Amber will spread,
Bey,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bey]]&lt;/ref&gt; Honor, the White-bearded(elder) is the owner of the yurt,&lt;ref&gt;[[yurt]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The beautiful land of the Turkmen catches the colt.

He is the son of a brave man, his father is valiant,
G√∂rogly&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; is his brother, drunk is his head,
If the hunters chase him in the mountains and valleys,
The lion son of Turkmen cannot be caught alive 

Hearts, souls and the heads unite as one,
If it draws deep, the lands and rocks will melt
If the food is ready on one dinner table
It will raise the fate of the Turkmen

His soul will fly when on horseback,
The mountains will turn to lava upon his glance,
When the river flows, it brings honey, 
The dams will not hold the flood of Turkmen.

He will not despair, and will not lose on the battle day,
He will not be swayed by curses or the evil,
Will not separate from its nightingale and fade,
The Turkmen rose will forever blossom.

The clans are brothers, and the tribes are friends,
Their fates are tied, by the light of God
When the brave get on horses, it's for the battle,
The paths of the Turkmen lead to its enemies.

He will come out like drunk (fervent, mad), will not despair,
He will move mountains, his path will not be blocked,
My eyes will not gaze away, and the soul will not muse,
Magtymguly speaks the language of the Turkmen.}}

The '''Utsuls''' ([{{IPA|huÀ© tÕ°saÀênÀßÀ®}}]; {{zh|t=ÂõûËºù‰∫∫|s=ÂõûËæâ‰∫∫|p=Hu√≠huƒ´ r√©n|first=t}}) or '''Hainan [[Hui people|Hui]]''' ({{zh|links=no |c=Êµ∑ÂçóÂõûÊóè |p=H«éin√°n hu√≠z√∫|first=t}}), are a [[Chamic languages|Chamic]]-speaking ethnic group which lives on the island of [[Hainan]], and are considered one of the People's Republic of China's [[Unrecognized ethnic groups in China|unrecognized ethnic groups]]. They are found on the southernmost tip of Hainan near the city of [[Sanya]].

==History==
The Utsuls are thought to be descendants of [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] [[refugee]]s who fled their homeland of [[Champa]] in what is now modern central [[Vietnam]] to escape the [[History of the Cham‚ÄìVietnamese wars|Vietnamese invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOM8qF34s4YC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=cham+hainan#v=onepage&amp;q=cham%20hainan&amp;f=false|title=An ethnohistorical dictionary of China|author=James Stuart Olson|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|page=41|isbn=0-313-28853-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Vietnamese completed the conquest of Cham in 1471, sacking Vijaya, the last capital of the Cham kingdom, a Cham prince and some 1,000 followers moved to Hainan, where the [[Ming dynasty]] allowed them to set up a kingdom-in-exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzh1fQEEFPAC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=cham+hainan+prince#v=onepage&amp;q=cham%20hainan%20prince&amp;f=false|title=V·ªã√™t Nam: borderless histories|author=Nhung Tuyet Tran|year=2006|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|location=|page=104|isbn=0-299-21774-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Chinese accounts record Cham arriving on Hainan even earlier, from 986, shortly after the Vietnamese captured the earlier Cham capital of Indrapura in 982, while other Cham refugees settled in [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH0OAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=This+fall+of+the+capital+in+982+accounts+for+the+refugees+mentioned+in+the+Chinese+dynastic+records+of+986+(History+of+the+Song+Dynasty+(960-1279),+which+records+in+986+the+arrival+of+some+Cham+in+Hainan+from&amp;dq=This+fall+of+the+capital+in+982+accounts+for+the+refugees+mentioned+in+the+Chinese+dynastic+records+of+986+(History+of+the+Song+Dynasty+(960-1279),+which+records+in+986+the+arrival+of+some+Cham+in+Hainan+from|title=Chamic and beyond: studies in mainland Austronesian languages|author=Anthony Grant, Paul Sidwell, Australian National University.

While most of the Chams who fled [[Champa]] went to neighbouring [[Cambodia]], a small business class fled northwards. How they came to acquire the name Utsul is unknown.

==Identity==
Although they are culturally distinct from other [[Hui people]], the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] places them as members of Hui nationality because of their Islam religion. From reports by Hans St√ºbel, the German ethnographer who made contact with them in the 1930s, however, their language is completely unrelated to any other language spoken in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E_5nR0SoXoC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=hainan%20sanya&amp;f=false|title=The Languages of China|author=S. Robert Ramsey|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|page=168|isbn=0-691-06694-9|pages=|accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3,500 of them are speakers of the [[Tsat language]], which is one of the few [[Malayo-Polynesian]] languages that are [[tonal language|tonal]]. Whereas other [[Hui people]] are Muslims who do not have a mother tongue or traditional ethnic language distinct from the Sinitic dialects, the Utsuls do have their own language, which is regarded as separate and distinct from Sinitic dialects. As a result, their classification as Hui people is controversial.

===Genetics===
Dongna Li and Chuan-Chao Wang have typed paternal Y chromosome and maternal mitochondrial DNA markers in 102 Utsat people to gain a better understanding of the genetic history of this population. High frequencies of the Y chromosome haplogroup O1a*-M119 and mtDNA lineages D4, F2a, F1b, F1a1, B5a, M8a, M*, D5, and B4a exhibit a pattern similar to that seen in neighboring indigenous populations. Cluster analyses (principal component analyses and networks) of the Utsat, Cham, and other ethnic groups in East Asia indicate that the Utsat are much closer to the Hainan indigenous ethnic groups than to the Cham and other mainland southeast Asian populations. These findings suggest that the origins of the Utsat likely involved massive assimilation of indigenous ethnic groups. During the assimilation process, the language of Utsat has been structurally changed to a tonal language; their Islamic beliefs may have helped to keep their culture and self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;Li DN*, Wang CC*, Yang K, Qin ZD, Lu Y, Lin XJ, Li H, the Genographic Consortium. Substitution of Hainan indigenous genetic lineage in the Utsat people, exiles of the Champa kingdom. J Syst Evol. 2013, 51(3):287‚Äì294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family names===
Some common Utsul family names include Chen, Ha, Hai, Jiang, Li, Liu and Pu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Thurgood|author2=Ela Thurgood|author3=Li Fengxiang|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Hainan Cham: History, Contact, and Phonology|date=2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9781614516040|page=12|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in politics==
[[File:–®—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Nina Shtanski, Transnistrian Minister of Foreign Affairs]]
Although still a [[List of states with limited recognition|country with limited recognition internationally]], and although ''Freedom in the World 2012'' had described that "[w]omen are underrepresented in most positions of authority", the current [[Government of Transnistria|Transnistrian government]] includes 8 women and 6 men. Prime Minister of Transnistria (Tatiana Turanskaya) and 3 Deputy Prime Ministers out of 4 are also women (Natalia Nikiforova, [[Nina Shtanski]] and Maija Parnas). Women are widely presented in Presidential Administration of Transnistria: both the head of Administration (Nadezhda Baranova)&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/rukovoditel-administracii-prezidenta-pmr Official biography of the Head of Presidential Administration of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; and all the 5 presidential advisors (Alyona Klyus, Nadezhda Zablotskaya, Natalia Garbar, Anna Yanchuk and Galina Sandutsa)&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/sovetniki-prezidenta-pmr Advisors of the President of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; are women.

Women are somewhat underrepresented as heads of State Administrations of cities and districts (''[[raion]]s'') of Transnistria (only [[R√Æbni≈£a District|Rybnitsa district]] is headed by a woman), but are widely presented on posts of deputy heads of State Administrations.

== Human trafficking ==
Some women of Transnistria, including minors, have become victims of [[domestic violence]], [[human trafficking]], and [[prostitution]],&lt;ref name=FHO&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/transnistria Transnistria], Freedom in the World 2012, freedomhouse.org&lt;/ref&gt; which are three of the major problems in the country.&lt;ref name=HSJ/&gt; Most often, trafficked Transnistrian women and girls are brought to [[Turkey]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name=HSJ&gt;[http://www.operationspaix.net/DATA/DOCUMENT/5385~v~A_Human_Security_Perspective_on_Transnistria___Reassessing_the_Situation_Within_the_Black_Hole_of_Europe.pdf Trafficking in Persons], A HUMAN SECURITY PERSPECTIVE ON TRANSNISTRIA REASSESSING THE SITUATION WITHIN THE ‚ÄúBLACK HOLE OF EUROPE‚Äù, Revue de la S√©curit√© Humaine/ Human Security Journal ‚Äì Issue 3 ‚Äì February 2007, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project concepts ==

=== Youth Council of the SHANGHAI ORGANISATIONS COOPERATION ===

Youth Council of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] was founded at the initiative of the Youth Public Chamber and [[Russian Union of Youth]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dipinfo.ru/gklife/news/2008/10/1057 –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ú–∏—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–≤: —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ë–∂–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –®–û–° –≤–∞–∂–Ω—ã–π —à–∞–≥ –∫ —Å–±–ª–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—é. ‚Äî ¬´–î–ò–ü –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ¬ª, 10.10.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and with support of the [[Government of Russia|Russian Government]] in 2009.

=== SMS for Life ===

This program provides free sms-informing of young pregnant women about the pregnancy period. It is based on advice on healthy lifestyle for women in different periods of the pregnancy, legal advice for future mothers and advice on childcare during the first months of life. Medical recommendations were prepared by highly skilled experts of D.O.Ott scientific research institute of obstetrics and gynecology. National program ¬´SMS for life¬ª was approved by the participants of the First International Congress of perinatal medicine, which was held in Moscow 16.06.2011. Leading accoucheurs-gynecologists of the world highly appreciated efficiency of the program and recommended it to implementation at regional level.

=== The Youth City ===

The high cost and inaccessibility of residential property for citizens precisely is the most serious problem for young families in Russia today. One of the main reasons that causes high prices on residential property is corruption. The Supervisory Board that acts within the Program scope consists of representatives from the legislative and executive bodies of Russia and allows to remove corruption component out of the Program implementation.
The main goal of the Program is to construct small satellite towns where young families can  purchase their first homes at the lowest price possible as well as work in the emerging industries. The residents of these towns will be able to work without actually leaving the town because of construction of complex residential property as well as complete set of social and business infrastructure.

=== A.N. Tolstoy‚Äôs International Competition of the Children's and Youth Literature ===

The Youth Public Chamber holds annual competition of the children's and youth literature of a name of A.N.Tolstoy.
The competition is held jointly with the Union of Writers of Russia and urged to lift and strengthen prestige of scientific and art creativity in consciousness of the young reader in Russia and in the countries of near and far abroad, to tap new talents among writers, poets, the publicists writing in Russian. Beginning and skilled writers can participate in competition without age and place of residence restriction.
