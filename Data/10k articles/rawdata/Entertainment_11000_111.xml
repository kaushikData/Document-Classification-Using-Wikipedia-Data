'''''A Snow White Christmas''''' is a [[pantomime]] version of the fairytale ''[[Snow White]]'', with a book by [[Kris Lythgoe]] and a score consisting of a pastiche of well-known pop tunes. It was first produced in 2011 at the El Portal Theatre in [[North Hollywood, California]].  The music includes songs by [[Katy Perry]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Village People|The Village People]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Hall and Oats]], among others. Like other pantomime-style musicals, the show includes magic, dancing, singing, acting, audience interactivity and sing-a-long segments.&lt;ref name=Times1&gt;{{cite web|last=Boehm|first=Mike|title='A Snow White Christmas' puts Southern California imprint on British theater tradition|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/11/entertainment/la-et-cm-lythgoe-panto-snow-white-christmas-20121211|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acting''' is an activity in which a story is told by means of its [[Enactment (psychology)|enactment]] by an [[actor]] or actress who adopts a [[Character (arts)|character]]—in [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], [[radio]], or any other medium that makes use of the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] [[Mode (literature)|mode]].

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed [[imagination]], emotional facility, physical expressivity, [[vocal projection]], clarity of [[Speech communication|speech]], and the ability to interpret [[drama]]. Acting also demands an ability to employ [[dialect]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[improvisational theatre|improvisation]], observation and emulation, [[Mime artist|mime]], and [[stage combat]]. Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for [[camera]].

Most [[History of theatre|early sources]] in the [[Western culture|West]] that examine the [[art]] of acting ({{lang-grc-gre|ὑπόκρισις}}, ''hypokrisis'') discuss it as part of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Slater (1994, 257); ''hypokrisis'', which literally means "acting," was the word used in discussions of [[rhetoric]]al delivery.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of theatre}}

===The first actor===

One of the first known [[actor]]s is believed to have been an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] called [[Thespis]] of [[Icaria]]. Writing two centuries after the event, [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' ({{circa|335 BCE}}) suggests that Thespis stepped out of the [[dithyramb]]ic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and addressed it as a separate [[Character (arts)|character]]. Before Thespis, the chorus [[Narration|narrated]] (for example, "Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that"). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, "I am Dionysus, I did this"). To distinguish between these different [[Mode (literature)|modes]] of storytelling—enactment and narration—Aristotle uses the terms "[[mimesis]]" (via enactment) and "[[diegesis]]" (via narration). From Thespis' name derives the word "thespian".

==Professional and amateur acting==
{{Further information|Actor|Amateur theatre}}
A professional actor is someone who is paid to act. Professional actors sometimes undertake unpaid work for a variety of reasons, including educational purposes or for charity events. [[Amateur theatre|Amateur actors]] are those who do not receive payment for performances.

Not all people working as actors in [[film]], [[television]], or [[theatre]] are professionally trained. [[Bob Hoskins]], for example, had no formal training before becoming an actor.

==Training==
{{Further information|Drama school}}
[[File:Student's studio 1915.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the First Studio, with whom [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] began to develop his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of actor training, which forms the basis for most professional training in the [[Western culture|West]].]]
Conservatories and [[drama school]]s typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of [[theatre]]. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], which was developed and popularised in America as [[method acting]] by [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], and others.

Other approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by [[theatre practitioner]]s as diverse as [[Anne Bogart]], [[Jacques Lecoq]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], or [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]. Classes may also include [[psychotechnique]], [[mask]] work, [[physical theatre]], [[improvisation]], and acting for camera.

Regardless of a school's approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive [[Audition (performing arts)|auditions]]. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.

Increased training and exposure to [[public speaking]] allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed [[physiologically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zuardi|last2=Crippa|last3=Gorayeb|title=Human experimental anxiety: actual public speaking induces more intense physiological responses than simulated public speaking.|journal=Sci Elo Brazil|date=2012|volume=35|issue=3|pages=248–253|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462013000300248&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|accessdate=2017-03-13|doi=10.1590/1516-4446-2012-0930}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring a public speaker’s [[heart rate]] maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in [[Psychological stress|stress]] as the heart rate increases with anxiety . As actors increase performances, heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mesri|first1=Bita|last2=Niles|first2=Andrea|last3=Pittig|first3=Andre|last4=LeBeau|first4=Richard|last5=Haik|first5=Ethan|last6=Craske|first6=Michelle|title=Public speaking avoidance as a treatment moderator for social anxiety disorder.|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy &amp; Experimental Psychiatry|date=2017|volume=55|pages=66–72|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791616301045|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very important in training for actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gyurak|first1=Anett|last2=Gross|first2=James|last3=Etkin|first3=Amit|title=Explicit and Implicit Emotion Regulation: A Dual-Process Framework|date=2012|volume=3|issue=25|pages=400–412|pmc=3280343|pmid=21432682|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.544160|journal=Cogn Emot}}&lt;/ref&gt; By attending an institution with a specialization in acting, increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonia|first1=Lupien|last2=McEwen|first2=Bruce|last3=Gunnar|first3=Megan|last4=Hein|first4=Christine|title=Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=2009|pages=434–445|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v10/n6/abs/nrn2639.html|volume=10|doi=10.1038/nrn2639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvisation==
{{Further information|Improvisational theatre|Devised theatre}}
[[File:Taglia Cantoni, Fracasso - Gallica 2012 (adjusted).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[mask]]ed characters from the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', whose "''[[lazzi]]''" involved a significant degree of [[improvisation]].]]
Some classical forms of acting involve a substantial element of [[Improvisation|improvised]] performance. Most notable is its use by the troupes of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', a form of [[mask]]ed comedy that originated in Italy.

Improvisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright [[Maxim Gorky]] invited Stanislavski to join him in [[Capri]], where they discussed training and Stanislavski's emerging "grammar" of acting.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 203) and Magarshack (1950, 320).&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by a popular theatre performance in [[Naples]] that utilised the techniques of the ''commedia dell'arte'', Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the [[Medieval theatre|medieval strolling players]], in which a playwright and group of young actors would [[Devised theatre|devise]] new plays together by means of improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 203-204) and Magarshack (1950, 320-321).&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 204) and Magarshack (1950, 320-322, 332-333).&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski's use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students, [[Michael Chekhov]] and [[Maria Knebel]].

In the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by [[Joan Littlewood]] from the 1930s onwards and, later, by [[Keith Johnstone]] and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by [[Viola Spolin]], after working with [[Neva Boyd]] at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois (Spolin was Boyd's student from 1924 to 1927). Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor's performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontenous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker [[Mike Leigh]], in films such as ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]'' (1996), ''[[Vera Drake]]'' (2004), ''[[Another Year (film)|Another Year]]'' (2010), and ''[[Mr. Turner]]'' (2014).

Improvisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.

==Physiological effects==
Speaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin, Clevenger|first1=T|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and size of audience on heart-rate changes during short impromptu speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|accessdate=|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Baldwin, 1980 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lacey|title=Coronary vasoconstriction induced by mental stress (simulated public speaking|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|date=1995|volume=75|pages=503–505|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/s0002-9149(99)80590-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacey, 1995).

In a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors' heart rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konijin|title=What’s on between the actor and his audience? Empirical Analysis of emotion processes in the theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Konijin,1993). While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.

==Semiotics of acting==
[[File:Brehms Tierleben - allgemeine Kunde des Tierreichs (1911-1921) (20226745749).jpg|thumb|right|[[Antonin Artaud]] compared the effect of an actor's performance on an audience in his "[[Theatre of Cruelty]]" with the way in which a [[Snake charming|snake charmer]] affects snakes.]]
The [[semiotics]] of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]s. This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actor's performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.

Following the ideas proposed by the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] theorist [[Antonin Artaud]], however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs 'beneath' significance and meaning (which the semiotician [[Félix Guattari]] described as a process involving the transmission of "a-signifying signs"). In his ''[[The Theatre and its Double]]'' (1938), Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a [[Snake charming|snake charmer]] communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as "[[mimesis]]"—the same term that [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) used to describe the [[Mode (literature)|mode]] in which [[drama]] communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from "[[diegesis]]", or the way in which a [[Narration|narrator]] may describe it. These "vibrations" passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipiate into significant elements as such (that is, consciously perceived "meanings"), but rather may operate by means of the circulation of "[[Affect (philosophy)|affect]]s".

The approach to acting adopted by other [[theatre practitioners]] involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting. [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the "experiencing" of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama—a process that he calls establishing the "perspective of the role". The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[epic theatre]], in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the sociohistorical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices—a process that he describes as establishing the "[[Not / But|not/but]]" element in a performed physical "''[[gestus]]''" within context of the play's overal "''[[Fabel]]''". [[Eugenio Barba]] argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the [[theatre director|director]], who weaves the signifying elements of an actor's performance into the director's [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] "montage".

The theatre semiotician [[Patrice Pavis]], alluding to the contrast between [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski's 'system']] and Brecht's [[Demonstration (acting)|demonstrating]] performer—and, beyond that, to [[Denis Diderot]]'s foundational essay on the art of acting, ''[[Paradox of the Actor]]'' (c. 1770—78)—argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Acting was long seen in terms of the actor's sincerity or hypocrisy—should he believe in what he is saying and be moved by it, or should he distance himself and convey his role in a detached manner? The answer varies according to how one sees the effect to be produced in the audience and the social function of theatre.&lt;ref name=pavis7&gt;Pavis (1998, 7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elements of a semiotics of acting include the actor's gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event (or film, television programme, or radio broadcast, each of which involves different semiotic systems) considered as a whole.&lt;ref name="pavis7"/&gt; A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] and [[Code (semiotics)|codes]] by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance—including those approaches, such as Stanislvaski's or the closely related [[method acting]] developed in the United States, that offer themselves as "a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal."&lt;ref name=pavis7/&gt; Pavis goes on to argue that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any acting is based on a codified system (even if the audience does not see it as such) of behaviour and actions that are considered to be believable and realistic or artificial and theatrical. To advocate the natural, the spontaneous, and the instinctive is only to attempt to produce natural effects, governed by an [[Ideology|ideological]] code that determines, at a particular historical time, and for a given audience, what is natural and believable and what is [[Declamation|declamatory]] and theatrical.&lt;ref name=pavis7/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of [[Play (activity)|play]], which involve, in each specific experience, "[[Game|rules of the game]]."&lt;ref name=pavis8-9&gt;Pavis (1998, 8-9).&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect was first explored by [[Johan Huizinga]] (in ''[[Homo Ludens]]'', 1938) and [[Roger Caillois]] (in ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'', 1958).&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Caillois, for example, distinguishes four apects of play relevant to acting: ''[[mimesis]]'' ([[simulation]]), ''[[agon]]'' ([[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] or competition), ''[[Alea (Greek soldier)|alea]]'' ([[Indeterminism|chance]]), and ''illinx'' ([[vertigo]], or "vertiginous psychological situations" involving the spectator's [[Identification (literature)|identification]] or [[catharsis]]).&lt;ref name=pavis8-9/&gt; This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his ''Poetics'', in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of [[Child development|learning as children]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For it is an instinct of human beings, from childhood, to engage in [[mimesis]] (indeed, this distinguishes them from other animals: man is the most mimetic of all, and it is through mimesis that he develops his earliest understanding); and equally natural that everyone enjoys mimetic objects. (IV, 1448b)&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1995, 37).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This connection with play also informed the words used in English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages) for [[drama]]: the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''plèga'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time for a dramatic entertainment—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist", the person acting was known as a "player", and, when in the [[Elizabethan era]] specific buildings for acting were built, they was known as "play-houses" rather than "[[Theater (building)|theatres]]."&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious [[latin]]ism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resume and Auditioning ==
Actors and actresses need to make a resume &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyactor.com/acting-resume/|title=How To Make An Acting Resume That Works For You|work=Daily Actor|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they go to auditions, similarly to when people of other occupations go into an interview. The acting resume is very different from the normal resume, it has a lot less information on it with lists, instead of paragraphs and it should have the head shot &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/backstage-guides/everything-you-need-know-about-headshots/|title=Headshots: Everything You Need to Know|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the back.

Auditioning is the act of performing either a monologue &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/monologue|title=the definition of monologue|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sides &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youryoungactor.com/2009/12/04/what-are-the-sides-for-acting-auditions-acting-term-of-the-day/|title=What Are the Sides for Acting Auditions? (Showbiz Term of the Day)|website=www.youryoungactor.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the casting director either mails or emails to the actors right before your audition. Auditioning entails showing the skills the actors have to instantly turn into a completely different person within a two-minute frame period.  For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes or they can perform more than one monologue, each casting director can have different requirements for actors. For auditions, actors will have to go dressed similarly to the character they are auditioning for to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition, if the casting director chooses to put them forward into the process. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition last minute and will send them the sides either the morning of or the night before. Auditioning can be part of the stressful side to acting, especially if one is not trained to audition.

== Rehearsing ==
[[Rehearsal]] is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance, exploring the vicissitudes of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between [[Character (arts)|character]]s, testing specific actions in the scene, and finding means to convey a particular sense. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.

== Audience and the actor ==
A critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=D|last2=Brutten|first2=E|title=A palmar sweat investigation of the effect of audience variation upon stage fright|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|issue=30|pages=92–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Bode &amp; Brutten) and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=ELLY KONIJN|editor1-last=WILSON|editor1-first=GLENN|title=PSYCHOLOGY AND PERFORMING ARTS|date=1991|publisher=SWETS &amp; ZEITLINGER|location=AMSTERDAM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however what's interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance.  Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors (more so amateur ones), the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of "positive stress in challenging situations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard S. Lazarus|author2=Susan Folkman|title=stress, appraisial and coping|date=March 15, 1984|publisher=New York Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heart rate while acting ==
Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. Prior to a show one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase [[performance anxiety]] and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoshie|first1=M|title=Music performance anxiety in skilled pianists: effects of social-evaluative performance situation on subjective, autonomic, and electromyographic reactions|pmid=19701628|doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1979-y|volume=199|year=2009|journal=Exp Brain Res|pages=117–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;  After the show you will see a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done;&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Ruth|title=Matter Over Mind: A Randomised-Controlled Trial of Single-Session Biofeedback Training on Performance Anxiety and Heart Rate Variability in Musicians|journal=PLoS ONE|date=October 4, 2012|pages=e46597|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046597|accessdate=March 13, 2017|pmc=3464298|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046597|pmid=23056361|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinney|first1=Mark|title=The Effects of Audience Size on High and Low Speech-Anxious Subjects During an Actual Speaking Taks|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1983|volume=4|issue=1|pages=73–87|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0401_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen not only in actors but also with [[public speaking]] and [[musicians]].&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"/&gt;

=== Stress ===

There is a correlation between heart-rate and stress when actors' are performing in front of an audience. Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konijin|first1=Elly A.|title=What's On Between The Actor and His Audience|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study done in an American University looking at actors' stress by measuring heart-rate showed individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began for those actors opening. There are many [[Factor analysis|factors]] that can add to an actors' stress. For example, length of monologues, experience level,  and actions done on stage including moving the set. Throughout the performance heart-rate rises the most before an actor is speaking. The stress and thus heart-rate of the actor then drops significantly at the end of a monologue, big action scene, or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin and Clevenger Jr.|first1=Sandra F. and Theodore|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience On Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of getting stressed during the anticipation period for any big moment happening is applied throughout the performance. Stress, therefore, has a bigger impact on the actor's overall performance whether motivating or pressuring them to give a more proficient end performance.

Capt. '''Adam Henry Bogardus''', (1834–1913) world champion and United States champion trap shooter as well as the inventor of the first practical glass ball trap, was born in [[Berne, New York]]. There, in 1854, he married Cordelia Dearstyne. They moved to [[Elkhart, Illinois]] where he became the wing shot champion of the world. He is credited with romanticizing trap shooting. 

[[Trap shooting]] with live pigeons began in the U.S. around 1825, with the first recorded match balls containing feathers, then clay targets. Bogardus invented the first practical glass ball trap in 1877. Glass spheres, filled with feathers, were used as targets, much as clay pigeons are used today. They were called Bogardus balls. One feature of them was ridges which helped ensure that pellets would shatter the sphere, rather than glancing off.&lt;ref&gt;TV program "What the Victorians Did for Us", BBC, presented by Adam Hart-Davis, "Pleasure Seekers" episode.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1883 [[William Frank Carver]] defeated Bogardus 19 times in a series of 25 matches.

Bogardus and his sons went on to tour with [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West show]]. Captain Bogardus remained with the show for a year. 

Bogardus is in the National Trapshooting Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain A. H. Bogardus|url=http://www.traphof.org/People-Stories/captain-a-h-bogardus.html|website=Trapshooting Hall Of Fame|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1913 in Lincoln, Logan Co., Illinois and is buried in Elkhart, Illinois.

The '''Alabama Jazz [[Hall of fame|Hall of Fame]]''' ('''AJHF''') was founded in 1978, and opened a museum on September 18, 1993, with a mission "to foster, encourage, educate, and cultivate a general appreciation of the medium of jazz music as a legitimate, original and distinctive art form indigenous to America. Its mission is also to preserve a continued and sustained program of illuminating the contribution of the State of Alabama through its citizens, environment, demographics and lore, and perpetuating the heritage of jazz music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzhall.com/jazzhalloffame/history.htm History], official site&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]],  United States.

[[File:Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame Saturday Jazz Class 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Members of the AJHF free Saturday jazz class. ]]
The museum is located in Birmingham's historic [[Carver Theatre (Birmingham, Alabama)|Carver Theatre]], which is part of the [[Birmingham Civil Rights District]], along with the [[Birmingham Civil Rights Institute]], [[16th Street Baptist Church]] and [[Kelly Ingram Park]]. The museum contains more than {{convert|2200|sqft|m2}} of exhibits. The Jazz Hall of Fame also sponsors jazz performances around the city and brings jazz to many local students with school visits from musicians. It contains memorabilia such as paintings, quilts, instruments, and personal effects of such artists as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[W.C. Handy]], and offers a tour guided by Frank Adams.

==Free Saturday jazz classes==
Every Saturday morning since 1999, the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame has offered free jazz classes to any resident of the state of Alabama. Founded by Dr. Frank Adams, the classes are taught by local jazz band directors from area schools. In these classes, students learn to read and improvise jazz.  Graduates of the AJHF classes have received scholarships to prestigious jazz studies programs, such as the ones offered by the [[University of New Orleans]], the Manhattan School of Music and [[New School University]] in New York City.

==AJHF Annual Student Jazz Band Festival==
Every year, the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame invites middle school, high school and college jazz bands to perform in this annual three-day event. Bands are adjudicated by notable jazz authorities and awards for "Band of Distinction" and "Outstanding Soloist" are made in each of the categories: Middle School, High School, Junior College and College.

==Spin-offs from AJHoF educational programs==
There are a number of "spin-off" groups spawned by the educational programs at the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.  Among these is a group called the "Neo Jazz Collective."  A group of young students, exhibiting the skills they learned at the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, created this ensemble, with the intention of becoming a professional entity.  The group is directed by Lud Yisrael.  The group started their own school in Fairfield, Alabama, and is fast becoming a popular "Nu-Jazz" ensemble in the Birmingham area.  

==Annual "Taste of 4th Avenue" Jazz Festival==
During the fall of each year, the "[[Taste of 4th Avenue Jazz Festival]]" takes place, jointly sponsored by the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame and Urban Impact of Birmingham.

'''Anansi'''  ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː|n|s|i}} {{respell|ə|NAHN|see}}) is an [[Akan people|Akan]] folktale character. He often takes the shape of a spider and is considered to be the spirit of all knowledge of stories. He is also one of the most important characters of [[West African mythology|West African]] and [[Caribbean folklore]].

He is also known as '''Ananse''', '''Kwaku Ananse''', and '''Anancy'''. In the New World he is known as '''Nancy''', '''Aunt Nancy''' and '''Sis' Nancy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Courlander |first=Harold |date=1996 |title=A Treasury of African Folklore |url= |location=New York |publisher=Marlowe &amp; Company |page=136 |isbn=1-56924-816-8 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[spider]], but often acts and appears as a man.

The Anansi tales originated from the Akan people of present-day [[Ghana]]. The word Ananse is [[Akan language|Akan]] and means "spider". They later spread to [[Caribbean|West Indies]], [[Suriname]], [[Sierra Leone]] (where they were introduced by [[Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone|Jamaican Maroons]]) and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. On [[Curaçao]], [[Aruba]], and [[Bonaire]], he is known as  '''Kompa Nanzi''', and his wife as Shi Maria.

Anansi is depicted in many different ways. Sometimes he looks like an ordinary spider, sometimes he is a spider wearing clothes or with a human face and sometimes he looks much more like a human with spider elements, such as eight legs.

In the Caribbean, Anansi is often celebrated as a symbol of slave resistance and survival. Anansi is able to turn the tables on his powerful oppressors by using his cunning and trickery, a model of behaviour utilised by slaves to gain the upper hand within the confines of the plantation power structure. Anansi is also believed to have played a multifunctional role in the slaves' lives; as well as inspiring strategies of resistance, the tales enabled enslaved Africans to establish a sense of continuity with their African past and offered them the means to transform and assert their identity within the boundaries of captivity. As historian [[Lawrence W. Levine]] argues in ''Black Culture and Consciousness'', enslaved Africans in the New World devoted “the structure and message of their tales to the compulsions and needs of their present situation” (1977, 90).&lt;ref name="Zobel Marshall 2012"&gt;Zobel Marshall, Emily (2012) ''Anansi's Journey: A Story of Jamaican Cultural Resistance''. University of the West Indies Press: Kingston, Jamaica. {{ISBN|978-9766402617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of Anansi became such a prominent and familiar part of Ashanti oral culture that the word '''Anansesem'''—"spider tales"—came to embrace all kinds of fables. One of the few studies that examine the role of Anansi folktales among the Ashanti of Ghana is R.S. Rattray’s Akan-Ashanti Folk-Tales (1930). The tales in Rattray’s collection were recorded directly from Ashanti oral storytelling sessions and published in both English and Twi.&lt;ref name="Zobel Marshall 2012"/&gt; [[Peggy Appiah]], who collected Anansi tales in Ghana and published many books of his stories, wrote: "So well known is he that he has given his name to the whole rich tradition of tales on which so many Ghanaian children are brought up – anansesem – or spider tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Elsewhere they have other names, for instance '''Ananse-Tori''' in Suriname, '''Anansi''' in [[Guyana]], and '''Kuent'i Nanzi''' in [[Curaçao]].

For Africans in the diaspora, the Jamaican versions of these stories are the most well preserved, because Jamaica had the largest concentration of enslaved Asante in the Americas. All Anansi stories in Jamaica have a proverb at the end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anansistories.com/Traditional_Stories.html Traditional Anansi Stories.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the story "Anansi and Brah Dead", there is a proverb that suggests that even in times of slavery, Anansi was referred to by his Akan original name: '''Kwaku Anansi''' or simply as ''Kwaku'' interchangeably with ''Anansi''. The proverb is: "If yuh cyaan ketch Kwaku, yuh ketch him shut",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlj.gov.jm/?q=jamaican-proverbs#quaku "Jamaican Proverbs"], National Library of Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to when Brah Dead (brother death or drybones), a personification of Death, was chasing Anansi to kill him. 
Meaning: The target of revenge and destruction, even killing, will be anyone very close to the intended, such as loved ones and family members.

===Origin===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There is an Anansi story that explains the phenomenon of how his name became attached to the whole corpus of tales:

Once there were no stories in the world. The Sky-God, [[Nyame]], had them all. Anansi went to Nyame and asked how much they would cost to buy.

Nyame set a high price: Anansi must bring back Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, and the Mboro Hornets.

Anansi set about capturing these. First he went to where Python lived and debated out loud whether Python was really longer than the palm branch or not as his wife Aso says. Python overheard and, when Anansi explained the debate, agreed to lie along the palm branch. Because he cannot easily make himself completely straight a true impression of his actual length is difficult to obtain, so Python agreed to be tied to the branch. When he was completely tied, Anansi took him to Nyame.

To catch the leopard, Anansi dug a deep hole in the ground.  When the leopard fell in the hole Anansi offered to help him out with his webs.  Once the leopard was out of the hole he was bound in Anansi's webs and was carried away.

To catch the hornets, Anansi filled a [[calabash]] with water and poured some over a banana leaf he held over his head and some over the nest, calling out that it was raining. He suggested the hornets get into the empty calabash, and when they obliged, he quickly sealed the opening.

Anansi handed his captives over to Nyame. Nyame rewarded him by making him the god of all stories.

===Variants of this story===
There are many variants of this tale, both recorded from oral sources and published. Indeed, the number of children's illustrated book versions of this one tale demonstrates how successfully Anansi has made the transition into literature. The summary above is of an illustrated book version ''Anansi Does the Impossible, an Ashanti tale retold'' by [[Verna Aardema]] and illustrated by Lisa Desimini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A story, a story; let it come, let it go" and finishes traditionally with: "This is my story which I have related. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet, take some elsewhere, and let some come back to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Anansi and the dispersal of wisdom===
Another story tells of how Anansi once tried to hoard all of the world's [[wisdom]] in a pot (in some versions a [[calabash]]). Anansi was already very clever, but he decided to gather together all the wisdom he could find and keep it in a safe place.

With all the wisdom sealed in a pot, he was still concerned that it was not safe enough, so he secretly took the pot to a tall thorny tree in the forest (in some versions the [[Bombax|silk cotton]] tree). His young son, Ntikuma, saw him go and followed him at some distance to see what he was doing.

The pot was too big for Anansi to hold while he climbed the tree, so he tied it in front of him. Like this, the pot was in the way and Anansi kept slipping down, getting more and more frustrated and angry with each attempt.

Ntikuma laughed when he saw what Anansi was doing. "Why don't you tie the pot behind you, then you will be able to grip the tree?" he suggested.

Anansi was so annoyed by his failed attempts and the realization that his child was right that he let the pot slip. It smashed and all the wisdom fell out. Just at this moment, a storm arrived and the rain washed the wisdom into the stream. It was taken out to sea and spread all around the world so that there is now a little of it in everyone.

Though Anansi chased his son home through the rain, he was reconciled to the loss, for, he says: "What is the use of all that wisdom if a young child still needs to put you right?"&lt;ref&gt;One version is given in {{cite book

==Relationship between Anansi and Br'er Rabbit==
Anansi shares similarities with the trickster figure of [[Br'er Rabbit]], who originated from the folklore of the Bantu-speaking peoples of south and central Africa. Enslaved Africans brought the Br'er Rabbit tales to the New World, which, like the Anansi stories, depict a physically small and vulnerable creature using his cunning intelligence to prevail over larger animals. However, although Br'er Rabbit stories are told in the Caribbean, especially in the French-speaking islands (where he is named “Compair Lapin”), he is predominantly an African-American folk hero. The rabbit as a trickster is also in Akan versions as well and a Bantu origin doesn't have to be the main source, at least for the Caribbean where the Akan people are more dominant than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstories.org.uk/stories/story/73-why-anansi-has-eight-skinny-legs/english "Why Anansi Has Eight Skinny Legs"]. An Akan Story by Farida Salifu. Worldstories.&lt;/ref&gt; His tales entered the mainstream through the work of the American journalist [[Joel Chandler Harris]], who wrote several collections of [[Uncle Remus]] stories between 1870 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Zobel Marshall, Emily (2012), ''Anansi's Journey: A Story of Jamaican Resistance''. University of the West Indies Press: Kingston, Jamaica, {{ISBN|978-9766402617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the times Anansi himself was tricked was when he tried to fight a [[tar baby]] after trying to steal food, but became stuck to it instead. It is a tale well known from a version involving Br'er Rabbit, found in the Uncle Remus stories and adapted and used in the 1946 live-action/animated [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Song of the South]]''. These were derived from African-American [[Folklore|folktale]]s in the [[U.S. Southern States|Southern United States]], that had part of their origin in African folktales preserved in oral storytelling by African Americans.  Elements of the African Anansi tale were combined by African-American storytellers with elements from Native American tales, such as the [[Cherokee]] story of the "Tar Wolf",&lt;ref&gt;James Mooney, "Myths of the Cherokee", Dover 1995, pp. 271–273, 232–236, 450. Reprinted from a Government Printing Office publication of 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a similar theme, but often had a trickster rabbit as a [[protagonist]].  The Native American trickster rabbit appears to have resonated with African-American story-tellers and was adopted as a cognate of the Anansi character with which they were familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Jace Weaver, ''That the People Might Live: Native American Literatures and Native American Community'', Oxford University Press, November 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authorities state the widespread existence of similar stories of a rabbit and tar baby throughout indigenous Meso-American and South American cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Margery : "The Tar-Baby Motif", p. 9. In ''Latin American Indian Literatures Journal'', Vol. 6 (1990), pp. 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby represents a coming together of two separate folk traditions, American and African, which coincidentally shared a common theme.  Most of the other Br'er Rabbit stories originated with Cherokee or Algonquin myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chenocetah.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/cherokee-place-names-in-the-southeastern-us-5/ Cherokee Place Names in the Southeastern U.S., Part 6 « Chenocetah’s Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823025908/http://chenocetah.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/cherokee-place-names-in-the-southeastern-us-5/ |date=23 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the USA today, the stories of Br'er Rabbit exist alongside other stories of Aunt Nancy, and of Anansi himself, coming from both the times of slavery and also from the Caribbean and directly from Africa.

==Mythology==
In the Ashanti culture, Anansi is a mere folklore character, like [[Sasabonsam]]. Anansi is thus neither a deity nor worshiped as a god contrary to widespread erroneous information. Neither Ashanti oral tradition nor confirmed documentary evidence, list Anansi as a deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ephirim-Donkor |first1=Anthony |title=African Personality and Spirituality: The Role of Abosom and Human Essence |date=2015 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lonson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mythological figure, he is often depicted interacting with the Supreme Being and other deities who frequently, bestow him with temporary supernatural powers. For example, in some popular tales, transmitted through oral tradition, Anansi is temporarily bestowed with powers to bring rain or to have other duties performed for him. 

Anansi's family include his long-suffering wife Okonore Yaa; Ntikuma his firstborn son; Tikelenkelen, his big-headed son; Nankonhwea, his son with a spindly neck and spindly legs and Afudohwedohwe his pot-bellied son. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ananse - Ghana's Amazing Spider-Man |url=https://yen.com.gh/34207-feature-ananse-ghanas-amazing-spider-man.html#34207 |website=Yen Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern mythology, [[Efua Sutherland]] introduces Anansewa as the beautiful daughter of Anansi for whom he devises a crafty plot to find an appropriate suitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sutherland |first1=Efua |title=The Marriage of Anansewa; Edufa: Two Plays |date=1990 |publisher=Longman Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anansi is part of a lineage of heroes whose powers stem from an ancient amulet, which grants powers of [[illusion]] and the ability to adhere to any surface. He first appears in "Static in Africa", where Static visits Africa, and the two join forces to fight the villain Oseba the Leopard. Anansi returns in "Out of Africa", in which he comes to Dakota City where Static and Gear help him recover his amulet from Oseba, who is this time joined by Onini the Snake and Mmoboro the Wasp.
*Anansi the Spider narrated stories from African folklore on the [[PBS]] children's series ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He was voiced by [[Ossie Davis]]. These cartoon segments by [[Fred Garbers]] were introduced by [[Sonia Manzano]], who plays Maria on that show.

{{nihongo|'''Arale Norimaki'''|則巻アラレ|Norimaki Arare|lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' manga series, created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. She is a robot built by Senbei Norimaki who looks like a young girl. She is known for her naiveté, energetic personality, lack of common sense, and amazing strength. Senbei tries to convince the other citizens of Penguin Village that she is just a normal human girl, and it seems to work, despite her [[superhuman]] athletic ability. Among her strengths, she can use abilities that range from the terrain splitting {{nihongo|''Chikyūwari''|地球割り||"Earth Chop"}} to the beam-like {{nihongo|''N'chahō''|んちゃ砲||"N'cha Cannon"}}. However, she is [[nearsighted]] and needs to wear glasses.

==Creation and conception==
Toriyama claimed that when he told his editor, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], that he wanted to make a manga about a doctor, Torishima told him to add a robot.&lt;ref name="Arale"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |title=Dr. Slump |volume=9 |year=2006 |origyear=1982 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=978-1-4215-0633-3 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama originally wanted a very large robot, but as it would not fit in the panels, he instead made it small.&lt;ref name="Arale"/&gt; When his editor rejected that idea, he made the robot a girl knowing Torishima would find her "cute."&lt;ref name="Arale"/&gt; He also stated that Senbei was supposed to be the main character, but his editor told him to make it Arale instead, which Toriyama agrees turned out better.&lt;ref name="main character"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |title=Dr. Slump |volume= 16 |year=2008 |origyear=1984 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=978-1-4215-1060-6 |pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torishima later elaborated on this, saying that Arale was initially only a guest character for one chapter. However, because he really liked Toriyama's girl characters the editor wanted her to be the main character. The artist felt differently because ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' is aimed at boys. The two made a bet; Toriyama created a special issue with a female lead, and whoever's story took higher in the magazine's reader poll would win. Torishima won, but because he is stubborn, Toriyama refused to change the ''Dr. Slump'' name.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/10/15/kazuhiko-torishima-on-shaping-the-success-of-dragon-ball-and-the-origins-of-dragon-quest/#1b1b1ac8d9ab|title=Kazuhiko Torishima On Shaping The Success Of 'Dragon Ball' And The Origins Of 'Dragon Quest'|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2016-10-15|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toriyama purposefully gives his protagonists plain appearances as he prefers to focus on the story. He believes that having weak-looking characters turn out to actually be strong is more interesting; Arale and [[Goku|Son Goku]] are prime examples of this.&lt;ref name="SuperHistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=30th Anniversary DRAGON BALL 超史集 - SUPER HISTORY BOOK -|year=2016|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=88–93|language=Japanese |isbn=978-4-08-792505-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the names of many other characters, Arale is a pun on the name for a bite-sized rice cracker ([[Arare (food)|arare]]), and with the family name ("Norimaki Arale") it refers to a sort of arare wrapped with [[nori]] seaweed. Initially, her glasses were just a gag, with Toriyama wanting to remove them as they made her more difficult to draw.&lt;ref name="glasses"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |title=Dr. Slump |volume= 16 |year=2008 |origyear=1984 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=978-1-4215-1060-6 |pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they became a trademark of Arale's and readers who had to wear glasses wrote him saying that by Arale having them it made them feel better about themselves, so he ended up keeping them.&lt;ref name="glasses"/&gt; Arale is usually shown with purple hair, although it is dark brown in the 1997 anime.

==Appearances==
===In ''Dr. Slump''===
[[Image:Norimaki Arare.jpg|thumb|Arale Norimaki's appearance in the 1997 ''Doctor Slump'' anime.]]
Arale poses as Senbei's sister or daughter, depending on who Senbei is talking to. The Norimaki family only grows from there when Arale and Senbei discover an egg when traveling to the past. The egg hatches into a small winged creature that they nickname [[Gatchan]]. Then Senbei marries the girl of his dreams ([[Midori Yamabuki]]) and they have a son named [[Turbo Norimaki|Turbo]]. As if the house was not full enough, Gatchan inexplicably splits into two separate entities.

The ''Dr. Slump'' series is a self-proclaimed gag manga with no ongoing plot. The entire series is about Arale's humorous exploration of the dynamics of life and the adventures Senbei and his inventions send them on. Arale has unique phrases she often uses, such as {{nihongo|"N'cha"|んちゃ||a greeting she picked up from Senbei}}, {{nihongo|"Bye'cha"|バイちゃ||"goodbye"}}, {{nihongo|"Hoyoyo"|ほよよ}} to express bewilderment, and yelling {{nihongo|"Kiiin"|キーン}} when she runs with her hands out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-10-17|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Dr. Slump|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2013-10-17|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media===
Arale appears in Toriyama's ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'' when [[Goku|Son Goku]] chases [[General Blue]] all the way to Penguin Village, she then defeats Blue with one kick and one headbutt after he paralyzes Goku. She is also able to ride on the Kinto'un, which indicates her as being pure of heart. In the anime adaptations, Arale is first seen in a picture on the wall of the capsule house [[Bulma]] creates in ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]'' episode 2, again on the television that [[Kame-Sennin]] is watching in episode 16, and on a poster in [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Son Gohan's]] bedroom in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. She also appears in ''[[Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure|The Great Mystical Adventure]]'' film, and her face was shown in the [[Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan|eighth ''Dragon Ball Z'' movie]]. Arale has appeared twice in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', first making a brief cameo appearance in episode 43 and later playing a key role in episode 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toei Animation US Posts "Dragon Ball Super" Promo|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/05/15/toei-animation-us-posts-dragon-ball-super-promo|work=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=2016-05-15|accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barder|first1=Ollie|title=Arale From 'Dr. Slump' Is Coming Back To 'Dragon Ball Super'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/11/23/arale-from-dr-slump-is-coming-back-to-dragon-ball-super/#7803755f25d4|accessdate=2016-11-27|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arale is also a playable character in the crossover video games ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'' and ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', both for the [[Nintendo DS]], and ''[[J-Stars Victory Vs]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]]. She is also playable in several ''Dragon Ball'' video games, including ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3|Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!

==Reception==
In 1982, Arale came in 12th place in ''[[Animage]]''{{'}}s fourth annual [[Anime Grand Prix]] for Favorite Character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 第4回アニメグランプリ　［1982年6月号］| language = Japanese| publisher = [[Animage]]| url = http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1982.html| accessdate = 2015-11-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140116212422/http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1982.html| archivedate = 2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Kimlinger of [[Anime News Network]] wrote that among ''Dr. Slump''{{'}}s cast, Arale is the standout; "The way she laughs and runs and raises unwitting hell are all unforgettable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dr-slump/the-movies-films-1-5/sub.dvd/.77308|title=Dr. Slump: The Movies [Films 1-5]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-08-13|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her role in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' was praised by Sam Leach from ANN due to how she clashes with the protagonists Goku and Vegeta; the latter often breaking the fourth wall stating they cannot defeat a person from a gag series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-super/episode-69/.109467|title=Dragon Ball Super Episode 69|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2016-12-04|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 1987 who would win if Arale and Son Goku were to fight, Toriyama said Arale was stronger.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ドラゴンボール 冒険SPECIAL |journal=[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]] |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |date=1987-12-01| language =Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masashi Kishimoto]], creator of ''[[Naruto]]'', gained an interest in drawing during his childhood from drawing pictures of Arale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Naruto |volume= 7 |year=2005 |origyear=1984 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=978-1-59116-875-1 |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In 1985's ''[[My Lucky Stars]]'', [[Jackie Chan]]'s character appears in an Arale costume while working undercover in a theme park.

Japanese comedian [[Hōsei Yamasaki]] dressed up as Arale, doing her signature "Kiiin" and "N'cha" for ''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]]'' Cosplay Bus Tour series. Because of failing to complete his task (getting spaghetti for the entire cast) he then had to fly to Italy to get Spaghetti for the entire cast and crew, dressed as Arale all the way.

The 2004 episode "Bogus Booty" of ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'' has a scene where Mugen impersonates Arale's signature run by sticking his arms out and making the sound "Kiin".

An episode of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' featured a video with a cutout of Arale that people could stick their head through, only to have it fall down.

Korean mixed martial artist [[Seo Hee Ham]] is nicknamed "Arale-chan" in Japan due to her appearance outside of the ring bearing resemblance to the fictional character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mfight.co.kr/news/viewbody_ex.php?code=mfight_board_news&amp;number=7880| title = '함더레이 실바' 별명 가진 귀염둥이 女파이터 함서희| author = 이교덕| date = 2008-03-05| publisher = MFight| language = Korean| quote = 일본에서는 그녀를 '닥터슬럼프'의 주인공을 닮았다고 한다. 안경을 쓴 모습이 영락없는 '아라레짱'이라고. 일본의 기사에 날 정도로 함서희의 동그랗고 커다란 뿔테 안경은 유명하다.| accessdate = 2018-04-28| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305203304/http://www.mfight.co.kr/news/news_view.php?bcode=1&amp;lcode=1&amp;mcode=&amp;scode=&amp;Page=&amp;number=7880| archivedate = 2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://fightland.vice.com/blog/make-way-for-hamderlei-silva| title = Make Way for Hamderlei Silva| date = 2014-11-20| work = [[Fightland]]| publisher = [[Vice Media]]| accessdate = 2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Argentine rock''' (known locally as '''''rock nacional''''', Spanish for "national rock") is [[rock music]] composed or performed by [[Argentina|Argentine]] bands or artists mostly in Spanish.

''Argentine rock'' began recycling hits of English-language rock &amp; roll. However a rising trend of composing new songs mostly in Spanish [[Origins of Argentine Rock|can be traced]] at late 1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing [[songs]] and [[lyrics]] that related to local social and musical themes. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, being widely considered one of the most prolific and successful forms of [[Rock en Español]], and one of the most important non-English [[language]] forms of rock music in the world.
In Argentina it is known as "Rock Nacional" (''/rok.nasjo'nal/''), literally National Rock (''national'' here meaning ''local'', ''not international'').

A distinguishing trait of Argentine rock is its insistence on [[Spanish language]] lyrics. It's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing in a foreign language as is common in other countries (except to convey a sense of artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.

== 1958−1964: Early rock and roll ==
[[File:Sandro y fuego.jpg|thumb|Sandro y Los del Fuego in 1961.]]
Rock and Roll music emerged in the United States from a [[Blues|Rhythm &amp; Blues]] base, gaining international popularity in the 1950s with artists like [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley]] (who visited Argentina in 1958), awakening the interest of several Argentine artists. The most notable among Argentine garage bands which sprung up in this period was [[Sandro y Los de Fuego]], who recorded a successful series of Spanish language covers of American rock and roll hits, and attained commercial popularity. [[Sandro de América|Sandro]] would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular internationally.

==1964−1975: The classic period==
The first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands. In 1964, Argentina, like much of the rest of the world, was shaken by [[The Beatles]] [[Beatlemania|phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas.html A Very Brief Story of Argentine Rock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103193408/http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas.html |date=2006-11-03 }} www.elortiba.org (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a development unique to Argentina which may help to explain, in retrospect, why the country would become a very important rock music-producing nation. Historians describe a parallel pattern of development with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] and [[Country music|Country]] in the US, in Argentina ''[[Music of Argentina#Folk music|Folklore]]'' and [[Pampas]] music. [[Country music]] is an important pillar of Rock &amp; Roll. In Argentina ''folklore'' (at that time [[Nueva canción]] was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s.

===Late 60s beat music===
[[File:Los Gatos estamapados.jpeg|thumb|First formation of [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]], circa 1968.]]
By 1965, rock music was developing rapidly in Argentina. On television, several shows such as ''Ritmo y Juventud'' and ''El Club del Clan'', with singers like [[Palito Ortega]], [[Violeta Rivas]], [[Chico Navarro]], and [[Lalo Fransen]], featured a poppy version of rock, which owed equal amounts to [[Merseybeat]] and to Argentine and Italian romantic pop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockerosargentinos.com.ar/paghistorock.htm Brief History of Argentine rock] Rockerosargentinos.com.ar/paghistorock.htm (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was in the underground where the most influential figures of early Argentine rock would emerge. In former [[Jazz]] bars like ''"La Cueva"'' or ''"La Perla del Once"'', bohemians like [[Moris (singer)|Moris]], [[Pajarito Zaguri]], Javier Martinez - drummer and lead singer in the most known Argentine blues band [[Manal]] - [[Miguel Abuelo]], and [[Tanguito]] would gather in the lazy days of mid-1960s Argentina to exchange ideas. [[Los Beatnicks]], of which Moris and Martinez where members, began the transition that would slowly take Argentine rock from imitation to a more creative state (while still following UK trends mainly). Forming in quiet beaches of [[Villa Gesell]], they recorded the first [[Spanish language]] single in 1966 called ''"Rebelde"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lahistoriadelrock.com.ar/gen/cap2.html Chapter 2] History of Argentine Rock (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The definitive breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock would be up to the band [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]]. After playing in ''"La Cueva"'' for a few months (and members of the band being arrested on a regular basis by police, for political reasons), the band released two singles in 1967. ''"[[La Balsa]]"'', a sunny track vaguely reminiscent of [[The Doors]], co-written by [[Tanguito]] and [[Litto Nebbia]], sold 200,000 copies. The following year saw the first publication of ''[[Pinap]]'', a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, [[Mandioca]]. In 1969, four major concerts of so-called ''"música beat"'' ("[[beat music]]") were held: the ''June Sunday'' concerts, ''Festival Nacional de Música Beat'', ''Festival Pinap'' and ''Festival de Música Joven''.

[[File:Almendra y Manal.png|thumb|[[Almendra (band)|Almendra]] and [[Manal]] in a poster for ''Pelo'' magazine, circa 1970.]]
In the wake of Los Gatos, an explosion of bands emerged including [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]]'s [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]], the most influential band of the late 1960s, and [[Manal]], the first successful blues-oriented group in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The three are considered the founders of the Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history: in fact most disbanded by the early 1970s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterised by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. However, the shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity.

Almendra would split with Spinetta forming [[Pescado Rabioso]], and the remaining members forming [[Color Humano]] and [[Aquelarre]]. Spinetta's album [[Artaud (album)|Artaud]] (incorrectly credited to the-then disbanded Pescado Rabioso due to his record label contract) it is widely considered the greatest Argentine rock album of all time.{{by whom|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="Los 100 albumes RS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/lists/list_view?list_id=85766&amp;show=25&amp;start=75 |title= 100 Mejores Discos del Rock Nacional |publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |location=Argentina |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, [[Vox Dei]] and their unique mixture of hard nosed rock with subtle melodious undertones refreshed the movement. Their album ''"La Biblia"'' (The Bible) is one of the seminal works of the early 1970s, even getting an unusual stamp of approval by the Catholic Church. In that same year, the first B.A ([[Buenos Aires]]) Rock festival would be the first showcase of a rising subgenre that would dominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock.&lt;ref name="html.rincondelvago.com"&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/rock-argentino.html The Beginnings] ABC of Argentine Rock (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock.

That the original creators of the movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries the original wave in the wake of the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not only did it continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the United States or Britain. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}{{Better source|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~hipodel/historia.htm The History of Rock en Español] by Gregorio Montiel Cupello (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic and heavy rock===
[[File:Pappo 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Electric guitarist [[Pappo]], frontman of Pappo's Blues, performing in 1973.]]
By the turn of the decade the first real diversification in Argentine rock began taking place. In reality, the split had been brewing even before, as some bands began playing much heavier music, with the world of rock entering the [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] era. Among them, [[Pescado Rabioso]], [[Vox Dei]], and [[Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock]]. But out of all of the heavy rock bands, [[Pappo's Blues]] would become the most influential heavy metal band and [[blues]] artist of its era in Argentina, and also acclaimed overseas (even playing with [[B.B. King]] in New York City). Another important but overlooked heavy rock act of the period is [[El Reloj]], but they would drift towards progressive rock in the following years.

Conversely, the first B.A Rock festival (now promoted by Pinap magazine successor [[Revista Pelo]]), had many of the artists and bands that would lead the [[Acoustic music|Acoustic]] rock movement: [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] forming [[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]], [[León Gieco]]'s [[folk-rock]] hybrid, [[Sui Generis]] and the start of [[Charly García]]'s music career, [[Raul Porchetto]], and [[Pedro y Pablo]], among other bands. These groups not only turned to Argentine folk for inspiration, they began experimenting with South American musical styles as well; their lyrics becoming increasingly poetic with concerns about nature and the human condition.&lt;ref name="html.rincondelvago.com"/&gt;

The proliferation of these bands and their increasing popularity, the early 1970s being the height of the [[hippie]] movement in Argentina, led to the [[Acusticazo]] of 1972. Several acoustic rock bands would gain popularity from their performances there, including [[Vivencia (band)|Vivencia]], [[Pastoral]], and [[Alma y Vida]]. The behemothic success of the Acusticazo was a turning point, Argentine rock would enter a new era of increased greater appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos20/rock-dictadura/rock-dictadura.shtml National Rock during the Dictatorship] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In that year also, [[Tanguito]] was killed when he was hit by a [[train]]. Conspiracies about his death abound, including that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown onto the tracks by police. A heavy user of drugs, others contend he simply might have tripped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lahistoriadelrock.com.ar/gen/cap6.html The Acusticazos] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 motion picture ''[[Tango Feroz]]'' ("Wild Tango"), would tell the life of Tanguito to new generations and the movie was an international hit.

As the 1970s progressed, acoustic rock continued as the most popular style in the country, with the above-mentioned and other bands dominating the charts and musical tastes. And for the first time in its history, Argentine rock began spreading overseas: Sui Generis and Pastoral attained some popularity with counter-culture hippies in Latin America, and even Japan (Pastoral had an EP edited there).&lt;ref name="lahistoriadelrock.com.ar"&gt;[http://www.lahistoriadelrock.com.ar/gen/cap9.html Chapter 9] History of Argentine Rock (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; But a major shift was at hand.

===Sui Generis farewell concerts===
[[File:Charly Garcia en Adios Sui Generis.jpg|thumb|[[Charly García|Charly Garcia]] during [[Sui Generis]] farewell concerts, 1975]]
[[Sui Generis]] began shifting from their classic acoustic rock to a more electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal ''Agitor Lucens V'' with its world music influences), by [[Tango music]] and also by British [[progressive rock]]. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into the apex of the movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too.

[[Charly García]] and [[Nito Mestre]] decided it was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most important acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaberinto.com/pentagrama/suigeneris1.htm Sui Generis] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them [[Moris (singer)|Moris]] and [[Aquelarre]].

The Classic era of Argentine rock music was completely over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including [[Pastoral]], and [[Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre]]. But it was the beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.

== 1975−1984: The intermediate period ==

=== Progressive rock ===
[[File:Invisible, 1974.jpg|thumb|[[Invisible (band)|Invisible]] in 1974.]]
As early as 1973, the band [[Contraluz]] combined rock with progressive and folk tinges. They would be an influential group in the years leading to the rise of symphonic and Argentine progressive rock. It would create some of the most enjoyable and brilliant albums in the history of the music, acclaimed nationally and by progressive rock fans worldwide.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}

Perhaps the first major act of symphonic/progressive was [[Crucis (band)|Crucis]]. Their music began attracting attention in the underground, and so they started getting bigger performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with surprising breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar (often spectacular wah-wah) and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=488 Crucis] www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Espíritu (band)|Espíritu]], who formed in 1973 but had roots since 1969, would go on to be an internationally followed group in the latter part of symphonic rock's heyday. The first album ''Crisalida'' is cited as their best effort, with beautiful and alternating compositions and changing atmospheres (from mellow with acoustic guitar to up-tempo with heavy electric guitar), lush keyboards and some vocal harmonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=993 Espiritu] www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource&lt;/ref&gt;

Former heavy rockers [[El Reloj]] turned to prog with 1975's self-titled album. Their sound has been compared to [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]'s mystic and proggy sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progarchives.com/Progressive_rock_discography_BAND.asp?band_id=2603 El Reloj] www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource&lt;/ref&gt;

A symphonic band that would have a great year in 1976 was [[ALAS (band)|ALAS]]. Their music was even more intellectual and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as [[Rodolfo Mederos]] and [[Pedro Aznar]]. [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] would begin his third band [[Invisible]] later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with [[tango music|tango]] would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialised was [[Reino de Munt]]. Formed by [[Raul Porchetto]], it featured a young [[Alejandro Lerner]], and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck.&lt;ref name="lahistoriadelrock.com.ar"/&gt;

[[Charly García]] formed his first post-[[Sui Generis]] band, [[La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros]], which began Garcia's explorations of symphonic and progressive rock. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be [[Torax]], [[Ave Rock]], [[Anacrusa]], and [[Materia Gris]].

[[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]] meanwhile continued expanding on their symphonic-folk rock and were joined by veteran Chilean band [[Los Jaivas]], whom were escaping the [[Pinochet]] dictatorship that had come to power in their nation in 1973. The two along with [[Contraluz]] were the main exponent of the subgenre.

On March 24, 1976, the democratic government was toppled by a [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|military coup]]. It opened one of the [[National Reorganization Process|darkest political chapters in Argentina's history]], full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst period of censorship in its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation's authority figures, who began to clamp down on the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral [[Emilio Massera]] denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives and repression of them began in 1977. Before the end of the decade, rock had gone increasingly underground.

In spite of this however, the music would continue its development against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies [[Vox Dei]] and [[Pappo's Blues]] continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, [[Plus (band)|Plus]], made their debut in '76 and enjoyed success through the end of the decade.

=== Symphonic rock at late 1970s ===

Argentine rock continued its symphonic, so-called 'concert hall' sound through the end of the decade. The '78-'79 period was not the most prolific period for rock, as the progressive bands continued with their blueprint, and symphonic rock bands actually turned slightly commercial.

At the height of symphonic rock, [[Crucis (band)|Crucis]] was joined at the top by the popularity of [[Espíritu (band)|Espíritu]]; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. [[La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros]] efforts were impressive as well, their first album featuring many of the elements of good prog: intricate ensemble work, good individual performances, great melodies, dynamic contrast, and interesting arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130205135112/http://www.virtshops.com/cds/reviews/B00009Y2JA.html La Maquina de Hacer Pajaros]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Soluna-tapa.jpg|thumb|''[[Soluna]]'', 1976.]]
1977 was a year of separation and endings: [[Crucis (band)|Crucis]] would disband at the end of the year. In heavy metal, [[Pappo]]'s blues would see their nearly seven-year run end. [[Aquelarre]] would return from their Spanish stint, but following a tour run went their separate ways.

But the year would show a glimpse at the future: a band from [[La Plata, Argentina|La Plata]] called [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 was a year of one-year wonders: Soluna ([[Gustavo Santaolalla]]'s 2nd group), with their electric folk, and [[Orion's Beethoven]], a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lahistoriadelrock.com.ar/gen/cap11.html Chapter 11] History of Argentine Rock (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bubu]] with their album ''Anabelas'' was 1978's one-year wonder.

And even more bands ceased to be. After two successful albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, [[La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros]] hung up, as did [[Invisible]], leaving as a legacy three of the greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: ''Invisible'', ''Durazno Sangrando'' and ''Jardin de los Presentes''. [[Pastoral]], one of the last acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did [[ALAS (band)|ALAS]]. With the country gripped by [[1978 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the [[disco]] craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.

Throughout its history, Argentine rock had the strange fortune to get exactly what in needed at the right time, fuelling an even greater expansion in the music. [[Sandro y los del fuego]] in '63 with their Argentine rockabilly igniting inspiration; the [[Uruguayan Invasion]] of 1965 that proved the commercial viability of non-US or UK bands; the massive hit of ''"[[La balsa]]"'' by [[Los Gatos]] in '67 showing Spanish language rock could be appealing to the masses; the ''[[Acusticazo]]'' of '72. In the drought days of 1978, what Argentine rock needed was its first successful '[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]'. It got it in [[Serú Girán]].

=== Serú Girán ===

In 1977 Charly García got together with his friend [[David Lebón]], an ex member of [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]]'s famous band [[Pescado Rabioso]], to write songs in Brazil. There Charly re-encountered [[Oscar Moro]], the drummer of his former band "La Máquina De Hacer Pájaros" and they decided to invite him to help compose new material. The trio soon decided that instead of selling their songs like they had originally planned, they would play them themselves in a new band. Now all they needed was a bass player. [[Pedro Aznar]] was a lesser known bassist who had once been a member of progressive rock group "ALAS". He also happened to be a friend of Moro's, who knew of Aznar's ability with the funk and jazz bass. Moro brought Aznar into the group and they began to prepare themselves.

Charly, Moro, Lebón, and Aznar managed two major things with Serú Girán. The first was to create a sound that was truly distinctive from anything in English-language rock. The second was their ability to massively achieve popularity in the lower and upper classes with their style of rock. [[Serú Girán]] could be 'brainy' yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously.

Partly because the group lived for three months in northeast Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian music]], mixed with symphonic rock and [[jazz]]. But the band's first live concert to support the album created one of the strangest anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song ''"Disco Shock"'', a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and what should have been a great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for [[Sui Generis]] songs. People failed to get the message and [[Serú Girán]] did not get their point across too well either. It would all fuel wild speculations about the members' sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.&lt;ref name="Serú Girán"&gt;[http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/260.shtml Serú Girán] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904012710/http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/260.shtml |date=2006-09-04 }} www.rock.com.ar (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

But the group bounced back with a vengeance with their 2nd album ''[[La Grasa de las Capitales]]''. It was well received by the specialist press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museorock.com/pelo/ Pelo Magazine #122] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216004007/http://www.museorock.com/pelo/ |date=2007-02-16 }} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Serú Girán's third album ''[[Bicicleta (album)|Bicicleta]]'' (1980) was tepidly received at first, but in time would be considered the band's best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and 'simple' with less arrangement and pomp. Serú Girán would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period.

=== Argentine rock and Falklands War ===

The nation was still in the grip of a dictatorship as the 1980s dawned, even as repression had eased somewhat by then. The start of the decade continued to feature [[Serú Girán]], now with their less pretentious sound, at the top of the charts. [[Vox Dei]] entered their 3rd decade in rock, a virtual first for any local band, and [[León Gieco]]'s popularity as a solo artist was on the rise.

One of the last progressive bands of importance would be [[Tantor]]. They were less symphonic and far more prog-experimental, with [[jazz]] as a major support. Their first eponymous album was a hit in the scene, and the band would continue till the mid-1980s as one of the last bands of the progressive era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nucleusprog.com.ar/ingles/progressiveargentina.htm The Progressive and Symphonic in the Argentinean] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011173543/http://www.nucleusprog.com.ar/ingles/progressiveargentina.htm |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serú Girán]] went touring in Brazil in 1980, where their reception by fans at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]] was so overwhelming that the organizers requested that they perform again, the next day, but on the main stage with jazz-rockers [[Weather Report]]. There, [[Pedro Aznar]] met [[Pat Metheny]], and Aznar gave him some cassettes with his own works. Serú Girán returned home, released "Bicicleta" and gathered 60,000 fans in [[La Rural]] back in [[Buenos Aires]] chanting ''no se banca más'' (''it isn't bearable anymore'', alluding to the dictatorship). That year they had also performed in concert with [[Spinetta Jade]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]]'s latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s. It was a great event in which both bands eventually played some songs of each other's repertoire.&lt;ref name="Serú Girán"/&gt;

Spinetta Jade was a blend of jazz and rock that escaped the trappings of symphonic rock, something that was unheard in Argentina at that time. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more "pop", and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesizers with "artificial" textures).&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] Wikipedia- The Free Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Shouldn't use Wikipedia as a source: see WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2017}}

Serú Girán released their fourth album ''[[Peperina (album)|Peperina]]'' in 1981 and promoted it on tour, but by the end of the year [[Pedro Aznar]] decided to leave the band because he wanted to study at [[Berklee]]. (When he was there, by the end of 1982, he was called to join the [[Pat Metheny Group]]). Serú Girán (which at the time was even planning tours in Europe), had a strong sendoff on March 6–7, 1982, when they performed for the last time at the [[Arena Obras Sanitarias]]. A memorable moment was the performance of the song ''"No llores por mi Argentina"'' ("Don't Cry for me Argentina", which has no relation to the ''Evita'' musical theme); a song full of symbolism. It was not only a farewell for Aznar, and for Serú Girán, but for an era in Argentine music, and history. The timing was beyond befitting.

Argentina's economy was in full recession in 1982, and discontent with the military government was rampant. On April 2, the world would awake yet again in the 20th century to the horror of [[Falklands War|war]]. After a season of death and destruction in the South Atlantic in which both sides suffered sunken ships, aircraft blown from the sky, and hundreds of young lives were cut short, the United Kingdom regained control over the [[Falkland Islands]] (Islas Malvinas). The popularity of the Argentine military government hit then bottom, and democratic elections were called shortly after.

== 1984−1990: Argentine rock goes global ==

=== New Democracy Sound ===

The war would be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the paradoxical effect of creating one of the most fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre.

In May of '82 the ''Festival for Latin American Solidarity'' brought together all the great bands of Argentine rock. It was a festival in support of the troops overseas, and also a veiled protest to war, and a call for peace (at first the musicians feared appearing for risk of being portrayed pro-war). This event was the final stepping stone of Argentine rock in becoming ''the'' dominant form of music in the country. At the same time, English-language rock was wiped out from radio play. The programmers had to fill the voids with something, and that was with Argentine rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas.html Ayer Nomás (Only Yesterday)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103193408/http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas.html |date=2006-11-03 }} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; This created the opportunity of exposure to countless underground bands. It would set the foundations for the explosion of rock in the mid-1980s.

In the latter days of symphonic rock, a great number of new groups started popping
seemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands influenced by [[post-punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]] from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in [[La Plata, Argentina|La Plata]], Federico Moura would form a pioneering  [[New wave music|new wave]] band called [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]]. In [[Buenos Aires]], three young men influenced by the advent of [[post-punk]] in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name [[Soda Stereo]].

In 1980 friends who were enthralled by the wave of US and UK punk formed the band [[Los Violadores]]. [[Miguel Abuelo]], a founding figure of Argentine rock in the 1960s, would return after a decade in Europe and form [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], which happened to feature a young man by the name of [[Andres Calamaro]]. Someone named [[Miguel Mateos]], after talking to [[Freddie Mercury]], won the opportunity to open for [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in Buenos Aires with his new band [[ZAS]]. At the local pubs in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] a pop-rock act called Los [[Enanitos Verdes]] appeared. An Italian of Scottish background named [[Luca Prodan]] arrived in Argentina to fight his [[heroin]] addiction, worsened by the death of his friend [[Ian Curtis]] of [[Joy Division]]. Prodan would form [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]]. This band, one of the least conventional in Argentina at the time, and since, has been voted Best Argentine Band by a poll composed by rock journalists in 2009. Despite its 'underground' status, it has fervent followers in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and a plethora of countries worldwide.

From the ''Festival of Latin American Solidarity'' emerged solo artists that would go on to delve into a more adult oriented form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were [[Juan Carlos Baglietto]] (who was optimistic about a young musician from [[Rosario, Argentina|Rosario]] named [[Fito Páez]]), [[Alejandro Lerner]], and [[Celeste Carballo]]. In heavy metal, [[Pappo]] founded his new band [[Riff (Argentine band)|Riff]], and newcomers [[V8 (band)|V8]] and [[La Torre]] would emerge. New witty rock bands like [[Los Twist]], [[Suéter]], and the [[riot grrrl]] group [[Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll]] crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/rock-argentino.html ABC Rock Argentino] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Gothic rock|gothic]] side of rock, [[La Sobrecarga]] and [[Euroshima]] would carry the torch.

And for the first time in Argentine rock history there was a "revival" of an earlier style, with Acoustic rock making a comeback on the back of reunions by [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]] and [[Manal]]. On the other hand, [[Charly García]] and [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] embarked on their solo careers. [[Moris (singer)|Moris]] returned from his period in Spain.

Meanwhile, Argentina entered a new era with the inauguration of [[Raúl Alfonsín]] as president of a fully democratic nation. Rock bands would no longer be harassed and even censored by the powers-that-be, and freedom of expression flowered. Songs critical of the military that were in prior years censored, some with exquisite lyrical poetry and allegory, were released during this time: ''"Tiempos Dificiles"'' by Fito Páez (sung by Juan Carlos Baglietto), ''"Maribel se Durmió"'' by Luis Alberto Spinetta, ''"Sólo le pido a Dios"'' by León Gieco and ''"Los dinosaurios''" by Charly García. A more direct criticism of the military government that ended in 1983 came from the Argentine punk groups like Los Violadores (singing songs like "Represión") or seminal heavy metal bands like V8.

Finally, segments of Argentine rock moved away from the concert hall and 'solemn' era, full of very heavy lyrics and concerns with domestic issues. It started to lighten up and turn more irreverent, and to focus on mundane concerns such as money, love, and sports. This would make the music and lyrics far more accessible (and commercial) to international audiences.

The stage was set for the boom of Argentine rock in Latin America and beyond.

=== Argentine Invasion {{Dubious|date=February 2016}} ===

The ''Cafe Einstein'' was opened in 1982 by [[Omar Chaban]] (who would end up convicted for the [[República Cromañón nightclub fire]] 22 years later), featuring some of the first presentations of three underground bands: [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]], [[Soda Stereo]], and [[Los Twist]]. Both Sumo and Soda Stereo featured slightly different line-ups in their early days, with Sumo having an English girl, Stephanie Nuttal, on drums. She returned to England when war broke out between her country and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lahistoriadelrock.com.ar/gen/cap21.html Chapter 21] History of Argentine Rock(Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in '82 [[Charly García]] released his full-album solo debut, the acclaimed ''Yendo de la Cama al Living''.

"One could feel the winds of change" in 1983 Argentina. A cliché perhaps, but at no time more appropriately used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: it was the year the [[compact disc]] was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: [[Patricia Sosa (singer)|Patricia Sosa]] and her heavy rock band [[La Torre]] were voted best band of the year and ''"Solo quiero Rock and Roll"'' best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female-fronted band, [[Los Twist]], and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when [[Fabiana Cantilo]] left.

As the early 1980s progressed it became clear that the new generation of rockers were not like anything before: [[Los Violadores]] pioneering punk in Latin America; [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]] oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by [[Cosméticos]] with a similar style ; [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]]'s punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following ([[Luca Prodan]] sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and [[Soda Stereo]] the buzz of the underground. [[ZAS]] introduced the phrase "''rock en tu idioma"'' ([[rock in your language]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rock.com.mx/miguel-mateos.html Miguel Mateos] www.rock.com.mx (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]] and newcomers [[G.I.T.]] found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.

By 1985, year in which [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] formed, several bands began receiving consistent airplay across Latin America. Argentine rock began "climbing" the continent up the [[Andes]]: first [[Chile]], then [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]]. [[Zeta Bosio]] of [[Soda Stereo]] said of this: ''"We would leave [[Argentina]] and tour in Chile, Peru, etc, and in some places they had never heard a live rock concert before... they said that such music was for another world and wouldn’t work... now it's all joy seeing how it did work and that it now has its own legs..."'' Argentine rock bands were the first to be signed to multinational record labels for distribution across many nations.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt;

The trickle became a flood as 1986 approached, and by the start of that year it had become a continental phenomenon, reaching [[Central America]], [[Mexico]], and crossing the Atlantic to Spain, even as far Italy, France, and Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{Dubious|date=February 2016}} [[Los Enanitos Verdes]] with their energetic pop-rock that appealed through music lines gained previously unseen popularity across borders.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}} The [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs|Cadillacs]], with their ska-rock with a heavy Latin infusion, turned instant rock stars across Latin America and eventually worldwide.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Rata Blanca]], a heavy metal band formed in 1987 from the ashes of influential early 1980s rockers [[V8 (band)|V8]], also conquered the Spanish-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} As did [[Charly García]], [[Fito Páez]], and now solo artist [[Miguel Mateos]]. 1986 was the climax of an unprecedented wave of international success for Argentine rock.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}

It would help to revitalize rock movements in other Latin American countries for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that "[[Rock en Español]]" could work and make them money.{{Dubious|date=February 2016}} In Mexico, Argentine bands were being marketed by media giants like [[Televisa]] as "rock in your language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://popmatters.com/chapter/Issue3/mexico.html Remembering La Onda through the literature of José Agustín and La Onda roquera (rock’n’roll in México)] by Roberto Avant-Mier&lt;/ref&gt; Its success changed the landscape of the Mexican scene: it laid the groundwork for [[Mexican rock]] in Spanish to itself expand overseas. In [[Peru]], the Argentine invasion was a catalyst that brought that country's own movement more to the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/pattroni/rocknac.html They Are Peruvian and they are good] Peruvian Rock (Spanish).

As 1988 began, with the most important Argentine bands ([[Soda Stereo]], [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], [[Los Enanitos Verdes]], [[Rata Blanca]], [[Charly García]], [[Andres Calamaro]], [[Miguel Mateos]], [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]], [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]]) on constant tour of Latin America, Europe, and even countries in Asia, the globalization of Argentine rock and pop was complete.{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}{{Dubious|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} By this time the invasion had begun to 'quiet' down in comparison to the prior three years, but its legacy of opening the doors of Argentine rock to massive success beyond its own borders remains to this day.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{promotion inline|date=February 2016}}

=== Soda Stereo ===
[[File:SodaenLima-2100924195.jpg|thumb|Soda Stereo in concert.]]
[[Soda Stereo]] was one of the most successful and influential rock band in Spanish ever. The influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even 'business acumen' is undeniable. They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as [[The Police]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[Talking Heads]], and by symphonic rockers [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] and [[Aquelarre]].

With their first album, the self-titled ''[[Soda Stereo (album)|Soda Stereo]]'' (1984), they reached national success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and a sound that combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, ''[[Nada Personal (album)|Nada Personal]]'', strengthened the popularity of the band, with instant classics such as ''"Nada Personal"'' and ''"Cuando Pase el Temblor"'' opening the doors of the Latin American market; 1986's "[[Signos]]" would heavily increase their popularity and in 1988 they came up with what could arguably be called their masterpiece, their album "[[Doble Vida]]". The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety never heard before from the band's production, the most notable example being the album's lead single "''En La Ciudad De La Furia''", a cryptically metaphorical ode to the band's hometown of [[Buenos Aires]] and the city's inhabitants. They embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America that brought the live album ''[[Ruido Blanco]]''.&lt;ref name="vh1.com"&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/sodastereo/bio.jhtml Artist A-Z Biography: Soda Stereo] www.VH1.com&lt;/ref&gt;

With the tour supporting ''Signos'', [[Soda Stereo]] became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success well into the 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds unlike almost any other [[Rock en Español]] band. In fact, they would lead the way in the changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near.

=== Late '80s: Loss and Experimentation ===

The year 1987 ended in tragedy for Argentine rock. [[Luca Prodan]] had finally lost his personal battle with alcohol and was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dementioteka.com/web1/Luca%20Prodan%20%20Sumo.htm Luca Prodan/Sumo] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; His death was a shock to the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans. Following Prodan's death, the members of [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]] split, founding two new rock outfits: [[Divididos]] and [[Las Pelotas]]; both bands became major players of 1990s rock.

[[Miguel Abuelo]], following gallbladder surgery, was diagnosed with [[AIDS]]; terminally ill, he died from [[cardiac arrest]] on March 26, 1988. [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]] leader [[Federico Moura]]'s persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rock.com.mx/oncetv.html Estrenos en ONCE TV: Virus] www.rock.com.mx (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Moura died on December 21, 1988. Moura's passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. It was a tough blow for rock. As a group, Virus survived and soldiered on into the 1990s as a more adult pop-rock outfit than the outrageous yet influential 1980s band that helped define the sound of "techno-pop".

Three major trends defined the Argentine rock of the end of the 1980s. The first trend was the consolidation of the Argentine Invasion bands into somewhat more mature rock groups. Some began to experiment with world music in the last two years of the 1980s. For example, [[Charly García]] got together with his old [[Serú Girán]] partner [[Pedro Aznar]] and recorded ''"Tango"'', whose name accurately suggests the style of the album.&lt;ref name="polimeni"&gt;{{cite book |first= Carlos |last=Polimeni |year=2000 |title=Demasiado Artista }} Excerpt at {{cite web|url=http://www24.brinkster.com/songsandpoems/chwz/chwzsoviw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105204516/http://www24.brinkster.com/songsandpoems/chwz/chwzsoviw.htm |archivedate=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Federico Moura's death, Virus had also begun turning to Brazilian music for their album ''Superficies de Placer''. In general the mood of the music got darker echoing a deteriorated economic climate.

A second was the rise of ''"Tropical"'' rock, and the explosion of local [[Reggae]] bands in Argentina seemingly out of nowhere in 1987. While Argentine rock was triumphant internationally, Argentina was caught in a reggae-mania: in the summer of that year arose [[Los Pericos]], [[Los Cafres]], [[La Zimbabwe]], and [[Jafran]], among many other smaller outfits. But it was a fad, and only Los Pericos would sustain and grow their careers once the fancy faded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/69.shtml Zimbabwe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065514/http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/69.shtml |date=2006-07-18 }} www.rock.com.ar (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; (Los Cafres would be mildly successful starting in 1994).
A band that was not a fad was [[Los Auténticos Decadentes]], who would become a hugely popular ska-Latin pop and ballad group. They along with [[Los Pericos]] and [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] would be leaders in the tropical rock scene of [[ska]], [[reggae]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]].

The third trend came about partly as a result of the first: many rock fans did not approve of the commercialism and experimentation of the A-bands, and increasingly looked underground for a more confrontational guitar-led rock. Among them: [[Todos Tus Muertos]], [[Don Cornelio y La Zona]] (later [[Los Visitantes]]), [[Los Brujos]], [[Babasónicos]], [[Los Siete Delfines]], [[Massacre Palestina]]. All of them would be part of the'' "Nuevo Rock"'' ("New Rock") explosion of the early 1990s.

In heavy metal, the already mentioned [[Rata Blanca]] dominated popular tastes, specially in other Latin American countries, along with [[Hermética]], [[Juan Antonio Ferreyra|JAF]], and [[Horcas]] (the last two more domestic), in a very healthy scene for a style that never was overwhelmingly crowded in Argentine rock. An important band in the metal underground was [[Nepal (band)|Nepal]], one of the pioneering bands of [[thrash metal]]. Formed in 1984, they were part of the first generation of worldwide thrashers, and gained prominence as the decade ended and musical tastes turned approbatory for more extreme metal. The genre got many magazines committed solely to it and distributed nationwide: [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]], [[Metal (magazine)|Metal]], [[Riff Raff (Argentine magazine)|Riff Raff]], [[Revista Epopeya (Argentine magazine)|Revista Epopeya]], etc.

The end of the 1980s were also a period of continued growth for [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], on their way to becoming one of the most mythic cult bands of broad popularity in the history of rock, anywhere. It was also the time when [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]] were gaining followers with the burgeoning ''"rolingas"'' (followers of a subgenre of Argentine rock that is greatly indebted to the [[Rolling Stones]]). On the pop side [[Man Ray]] with their tailor-made FM songs were ubiquitous. Finally, [[Divididos]] and their guitar-crunching melodic noise was more and more becoming a preview of what the next decade would bring. In general, as the fantastic 1980s for Argentine rock closed, the music was in period of transition and exploration at all levels.

== 1990−1998: The Contemporary Period ==

=== "Canción Animal" and New Rock ===

[[Soda Stereo]]'s frontman [[Gustavo Cerati]] could foresee the musical trends, putting his own band in front of it. After releasing the increasingly hard rocking ''[[Doble Vida]]'', the band headed to studio with new producer [[Daniel Melero]] to record their fifth album, ''[[Canción Animal]]''. It was released in October 1990, about a year before [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] released ''[[Nevermind]]''.

''Canción Animal'' confirmed that it was OK to return Argentine rock to an 'in your face', edgy attitude that shaped the Argentine Invasion aesthetic in the early years of the 1980s, but this time with electric guitars as the stars.  From that album, the single ''"De Música Ligera"'', might well be the most recognizable Spanish-language rock single of all time, and also one of the most covered by bands all over Latin America and elsewhere. ''Canción Animal'' helped underground acts like [[Los Brujos]], [[Peligrosos Gorriones]], and [[Massacre (Argentine band)|Massacre]] break faster into the mainstream, by taking guitar-crunching rock to the apex as 1991 began. Even pop-bound groups like [[Los Enanitos Verdes]] rocked harder in their early 1990s works, particularly in their ''Big Bang'' album, whose single ''"Lamento Boliviano"'' is now a classic.

These and other bands in their wake would be dubbed the ''"Nuevo Rock Argentino"'', or New Argentine Rock. A term that not long after would also be used as an umbrella to group bands with a hard-to-pin-down style, like the neo-surf pop of [[Super Ratones]] (from [[Mar del Plata, Argentina|Mar del Plata]]), and neo-fusionists [[La Portuaria]] with their world music touches. ''"Nuevo Rock"'' would be the dominant form of rock in Argentina until the middle of the decade when it lost ground to so-called ''"rock suburbano"''.

In 1992, [[Soda Stereo]] presented ''[[Dynamo (Soda Stereo album)|Dynamo]]'', their sixth album, arguably the most conceptual (the other being ''"Signos"''), and the most experimental to that point. It apparently took fans by surprise, and was the lowest seller of the group's works (it didn't help that in the middle of all this the band changed labels; Sony wouldn’t promote a band that was leaving, and BMG wouldn't promote another label's album).&lt;ref name="vh1.com"/&gt;
[[File:Babasónicos.jpg|thumb|Babasónicos, 2006.]]
On the other hand, [[Babasónicos]] had in 1992 their first major breakthrough of their careers with the hit ''D-generación'' from their 1992 album [[Pasto (album)|Pasto]], which would herald future international success for a band that would define the sound of "sonic" rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/rock-argentino/zb.htm Babasónicos] ABC Rock Argentino-Artistas (Spanish). [https://www.webcitation.org/5knIqDhNo?url=http://www.geocities.com/rock-argentino/zb.htm Archived] 2009-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juana La Loca]] was another band in the so-called sonic scene that started in the early 1990s and would breakthrough a few years later. The band that founded the Sonic Movement in Buenos Aires was [[Iguana Lovers]], started in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesoundofconfusionblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/iguana-lovers-colonias-espaciales.html Iguana Lovers, The Sound of Confusion, excellent shoegaze from Buenos Aires started in 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Now with collaborations of the [[shoegaze]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://shoegazekid.tumblr.com/post/98409899092/iguana-lovers-colonias-espaciales Shoegaze-A journey through gaze]&lt;/ref&gt; British indie [[Ride (band)|Ride]] members, [[Mark Gardener]] and Loz Colbert, they were positioned as the most important new band of the Buenos Aires indie scene in 1991. [[Los Brujos]] would have a great year 1992; the single ''"Kanishka"'' was an instant chart-topper. [[Los Visitantes]] equalled the success of Los Brujos the next year with their album ''Salud Universal'', an offbeat mix of guitar rock and [[tango music|tango]] tinges. [[Todos Tus Muertos]] was a punk response to the Argentine rock being made in the late 1980s, consciously choosing to be far more direct and explicit in their musical (and political) statements. The band gained rapid acclaim with the rise of New Rock, and were one of the favorite bands of the period. Slowly the group would evolve from their early punk to a more diverse style that include afro-Latin rhythms.
[[File:Iguana Lovers 1990.jpg|thumb|Iguana Lovers, 1990]]
The odd-group out that appeared in the early 1990s was the outrageously named [[Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas]] (a reference to Colombian footballer [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]]). More rappers than rockers, the group nonetheless made a mark in the rock scene as time progressed and they were able to more successfully integrate rap with Argentine rock, and also Latin rhythms. One of the members, [[Dante Spinetta|Dante]], is the son of [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]].

=== Rock rolinga ===
{{main article|Rock rolinga}}
As New Rock was dominant, some acts in the distant suburbs of Buenos Aires where playing straightforward and guitar centered rock music, with a foundation in the blues, and an unsophisticated image (somewhat a counter-movement to the image conscious, musically more pretentious New Rock).

Some of these suburban acts owed so much to the sound of the [[Rolling Stones]], that their followers came to be known as "rolingas". Eventually the rock rolinga (a.k.a. rock stone) became a style: cheesy 1970s sneakers, tight T-shirts with the logo of the Stones or a local 'stone' band, and a disdain for other Argentine rock subgenres they consider part of the establishment. At the forefront of this movement were Los Ratones Paranoicos, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come.&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/05/09/espectaculos/c-00615.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined in the Rolinga scene by [[Viejas Locas]] in the mid 1990s.

The incessant touring of the rolinga bands around the suburbs of Buenos Aires and other cities would reap benefits not only for themselves but for other suburban groups that would follow soon after. Thus, Rolinga rock arguably became the most popular music genre in Argentina in the 1990s.

===1990s Metal===
The last decade of the twentieth century was a very productive one for this style of rock in Argentina. There had always been "heavy" bands: [[Billy Bond y la Pesada del Rock]] in the 1960s, [[Pescado Rabioso]] and [[Pappo]]'s Blues in the 1970s, [[V8 (band)|V8]], [[Riff (Argentine band)]], and several underground metal acts in the 1980s. But they had never been at the forefront of Argentine rock, seemingly always obscured by other genres whether it was acoustic, symphonic, progressive, or the 1980s invasion bands. This changed in the 1990s.

As the decade started [[Rata Blanca]], [[Horcas]], [[Hermética]] and [[J.A.F]] had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is plausible to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular to a lesser extent was Hermética, the arch-rivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 1987 when [[V8 (band)|V8]] disbanded), but there were no doubts of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure.

The major development in Argentine metal of the 1990s was the rise of [[A.N.I.M.A.L.]]. The acronym translated literally stands for "Abused (accosted), Our Indians Died While Fighting". And their themes lived up to that title: the band would be one of the most outspoken advocates for indigenous people and even nationalism, while also (as such bands tend to do), blasting against the current world order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p52058 | tab = biography | label = Biography of A.N.I.M.A.L. | first = Drago | last = Bonacich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sound is equal parts [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[thrash metal|thrash]]. Another important band formed in 1990 was [[Tren Loco]], whom long after went to Japan and won second place in a major battle-of-the-band event at famous [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] Stadium in Tokyo. The metal underground also flourished in the 1990s, with bands like [[Alakrán]], [[Jezabel (band)|Jezabel]], [[Jason (band)|Jason]], [[Logos (band)|Logos]], and [[Jeriko]], among others.

===Other developments===

Solo artists from the earlier generations were by the 1990s established figures in the medium. The biggest two stars (as had been the case since 1970), were [[Charly García]] and [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]]. Garcia enjoyed a prolific 1980s with many of his albums turning into classics. Spinetta had a more uneven body of work but nonetheless was successful. [[Pappo]] continued putting out blues and heavy rock records, [[Miguel Mateos]] remained a popular rock figure in Latin America even as he dropped almost off the radar in Argentina.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[León Gieco]]'s unique "folk-rock meets world music" approaches made him an internationally acclaimed musician.
[[File:Fito Paez.jpg|thumb|Fito Páez, 2003.]]
[[Fito Páez]]'s pop career continued to take-off in the early 1990s. In 1992 he released ''El Amor después del Amor'', becoming the best selling Argentine rock album. The title "love after love" was not by chance: he had just ended a well-publicized relationship with female rocker [[Fabiana Cantilo]] (herself an important 1990s singer in the movement), and was getting involved with movie actress [[Cecilia Roth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:El amor después del amor|'El amor después del Amor']] Wikipedia- La Enciclopedia Libre (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Shouldn't use Wikipedia as a source: see WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2017}} With the album Paez was confirmed an international pop star. Meanwhile, [[Andrés Calamaro]] had enjoyed some popularity since his solo career begun, but never managed a complete breakthrough with the public. He left for Spain, and there met two local musicians forming [[Los Rodriguez]] in 1991. Two years later the hit single ''"Sin Documentos"'' finally gave Calamaro an international hit, and the band gained overnight vogue in Spain and Latin America.

Tropical, Fusion, and Latin influenced rock continued its ascent. 1992 was the year of ''"La Pachanga"'': [[Rosario, Argentina|Rosario]]'s [[Vilma Palma e Vampiros]] single was an across the board mega hit in the Spanish-speaking world; there was no way of escaping it unless one did not have any kind of social life in the early 1990s.
Bands like [[Los Auténticos Decadentes]], who had a major hit in 1990 with ''"Loco (tu forma de ser)"'', and [[Los Pericos]] mirrored the tendency of increased popularity for the subgenre. [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] had a slump in the early 1990s after harvesting great accolades in the late 1980s, but came back with a roar in 1994 with ''Vasos Vacios''; the compilation that featured ''"Matador"''. The single would turn into a global superhit, winning MTV's best video of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabulosos-cadillacs.com/bio.htm Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027194309/http://www.fabulosos-cadillacs.com/bio.htm |date=2006-10-27 }} LFC - Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1990s were also the formative years of a group that would have an impact towards the new millennium: [[Bersuit Vergarabat]]. [[La Mosca]] would begin tapping into the tropical and Latin trend by 1995.

Argentine punk-revival took off in the 1990s. [[Los Violadores]] had ruled 1980s punk; them along with the foreign punk bands of yesteryear would inspire the members of [[Attaque 77]] and [[Flema]]. Formed in 1986 and 1987 respectively, they were pioneers of the worldwide punk revival movement. Attaque 77's breakthrough came in 1990 with the single ''"Hacelo por Mi"''; [[Flema]] never broke to the mainstream but were heroic figures of the punk underground. Both groups paved the way for dozens of followers. One of those were [[2 Minutos]], with their pure-energy, extreme, back-to-basics punk rock. Another darling of the scene were [[Todos Tus Muertos]], perhaps one of few bands in any punk movement that was accepted for their various rock styles ''besides'' punk. [[Fun People]] took punk's liberal philosophy to another level by tackling the punk-scene itself: many of their lyrics criticized the macho attitudes in the movement which they saw contradictory to the spirit of punk. They were also the first band that sang in [[Spanglish]], meanwhile another bands, like [[Drop Dead! Argentina]] used to do it only in English. The [[She Devils]] were the leaders of the local [[homocore|queercore]] scene. [[Cienfuegos]], a punk band that had existed since the 1980s but suffered various contingencies, finally would produce albums by the mid 1990s.

''See:'' Argentine punk

In the Argentine northwest, important punk and indie scenes developed in the mid-to-late nineties. Bands like 448, Volstead, Estacion Experimental and [[:es:Los Chicles|Los Chicles]] led the scenes.

=== The Mid '90s Schism ===

In the middle years of the 1990s a rift developed in Argentine rock that would, with only slight wrinkles, endure to present times.

By 1995 ''"nuevo rock argentino"'' or Argentine new rock had lost steam. For starters, bands like [[Los Siete Delfines]] and [[Peligrosos Gorriones]], with their more artistic antics, fell out of favor. At the same time, groups like [[Massacre (Argentine band)|Massacre]] and [[La Portuaria]] went on recording hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds in the early to mid-2000s. [[Los Brujos]] disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last ''hurrahs'' of new rock were rap-rockers [[Actitud Maria Marta]], which had a year of fame in 1995. [[Babasónicos]], [[Todos Tus Muertos]], and [[Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas]] were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached.

Also, 1995 would see the last album by [[Soda Stereo]], their relaxed almost chillout-like ''[[Sueño Stereo]]'', an album at times more electronic than rock previewing the direction of [[Gustavo Cerati]]'s solo career. Soda Stereo would go on a last grand tour through the United States and Latin America, selling out entire stadiums as they went.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copesa.cl/sodastereo/ El último sorbo de Soda Stereo (Chile)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901112124/http://www.copesa.cl/sodastereo/ |date=2006-09-01 }} www.copesa.cl (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;  Their last concert in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1997 was released as a [[El Último Concierto|double-album]], with 70,000 people selling out twice at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]]. The arguably greatest band in Argentine and Rock en Español history wrapped up the concert and their career with the live version of ''"De Musica Ligera";'', Gustavo Cerati, the vocalist, guitarist and leader of the band, would end the song thanking his public, and would finish this gratitude by saying "... Gracias totales" (total thanks), this would become an iconic phrase for the band and Argentine rock thereafter.

Conversely, "rolinga" rock was on the up. On the one hand were the 1980s bands that by the mid 1990s approached the suburban rock sound: [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota|Redonditos de Ricota]], [[Divididos]], [[Las Pelotas]]. They were joined by two bands that would define suburban in the late 1990s as well: [[Los Piojos]] and [[La Renga]]. La Renga is also considered one of the ''Rolinga'' groups (followers of the [[Rolling Stones]] blueprint) like [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]] and [[Viejas Locas]], whose weighty followings would only grow larger.

Argentine youth began to musically and socially gravitate to either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (''rolinga'' and ''post-chabón'' in suburban rock; ''sonico, punk, dark'' in the underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling [[Cumbia]] which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were in place for the current period of rock in Argentina.
On a completely different, and original level, [[Andrea Prodan]] (Luca Prodan's brother) emerged with a bizarre and unique all-vocal, solo album called ''Viva Voce'', recorded on independent label Silly Records. The record won an A.C.E. award and was among [[Peter Gabriel]]'s favourite records in his Real World list of 1996.

== 1998− : Modern Argentine Rock ==

=== Late 1990s &amp; 21st century ===

The late 1990s charts were dominated by the success of bands like [[Los Piojos]], [[La Renga]], [[Divididos]], [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota|Redonditos de Ricota]], [[Las Pelotas]], [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]], [[La Mancha de Rolando]], [[Caballeros de la Quema]], and many more suburban rock bands. They were joined by Uruguayans [[No te va a gustar|No Te Va Gustar]] and [[La Vela Puerca]], giving rise to the term ''"rioplatense"'' rock (rock from the [[Río de la Plata]] region) to label all of the similarly inclined outfits. Rolinga rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the ''rolinga'' scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of rolinga rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate.

On the other hand, the likes of Divididos, Los Piojos, and Redonditos have transcended its constraints and become influential in Argentine rock and popular on an international level. The better bands in the genre also feature an unusual versatility with non-rock styles like [[tango music|tango]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[African music]], Latin, [[jazz]], and even North American [[country music]], each with their own eclectic mixture. It would help elevate them from the legions of imitators in the crowded suburban scene. Divididos 6th album ''"Narigon Del Siglo"'' (2000) was one of the first great Argentine rock albums of the new decade; it was peppered with folk.

The underground was more under than usual in the late 1990s, it was nonetheless extremely creative. A style that gained some mainstream exposure was ''"rock sónico"'' ("sonic" rock), influenced by the 1980s "techno-pop" of [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]] and early [[Soda Stereo]] (and also [[Britpop]]), through [[Babasónicos]] and [[Juana La Loca]]. The latter group found success with sonic rock in 1997's ''Vida Modelo''. The former would increase their popularity with each new album, arriving at 2001's ''Jessico'', which received international acclaim as one of the first truly outstanding albums of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class = album | id = r586191 | tab=review|label=Review of ''Jessico'' (by Babasónicos)|first= Ned |last=Raggett }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other underground groups started making noise at this time: [[Iguana Lovers]], they founded the Sonic movement in Buenos Aires in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/worldhaveyoursay/2006/05/yourovision_song_contest_2.html BBC News, Iguana Lovers, Interesting and fresh independent music from South America]&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Otro Yo]], [[Catupecu Machu]], and [[Santos Inocentes]], leaders-to-be of the early 2000s [[alternative rock]] scene in Argentina. [[Super Ratones]]'s returned to the alternative charts with 2001's Grammy nominee ''Mancha Registrada''.

In heavy metal, [[Hermética]] disbanded by 1995 giving rise to [[Almafuerte (band)|Almafuerte]]. With a more up-to-date sound, they were one of the late 1990s favorites along with [[A.N.I.M.A.L.]]. [[Rata Blanca]] continued to perform and record intermittently touring countries around Latin America. Classic metalists [[O'Connor (band)|O'Connor]] in the underground would emerge by the early 2000s, along with exponents of [[nu metal]] [[Cabezones]] and [[Carajo]]. One of the most critically acclaimed bands of present is [[Los Natas]]. Originally a [[stoner rock]] group, in subsequent albums the band has turned more experimental. Some have called this demiurgic style (infused with Argentine folk, psychedelia, and [[space rock]])'' "Patagonian doom"'', and this brand of metal has been ranked with the best heard in the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class = album | id = r578553 | tab = review | label = Review of ''Corsario Negro'' (by Los Natas) | first = Eduardo | last = Rivadavia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band itself prefers to call it "free" rock.
[[File:Bersuit Vergarabat - Quilmes Rock 04 - Ferro.JPG|thumb|Bersuit Vergarabat, 2004.]]
In punk, [[Attaque 77]] were still going strong, as did [[Fun People]] (including a European tour), until their disbanding in 2000. The punk underground of the late 1990s was buzzing with new bands ([[Cadena Perpetua]], [[Expulsados]]), many of them to guide the early 2000s melodic punk scene ([[Smitten (band)]], [[Shaila]]).

In tropical or fusion rock, [[Bersuit Vergarabat]] rose to the zenith of the genre. ''Libertinaje'' (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up ''Hijos del Culo'' (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility. From the side of [[reggae]]-rock [[Los Pericos]] and [[Los Cafres]] dominated. Ska had [[Los Calzones]] and [[Kapanga]], but by 2000 [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] had called it quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p38689 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs| first = Sandra | last = Brennan | accessdate = 2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Mosca]] and [[Dancing Mood]] reached achieved greater popularity. [[Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas]] produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo's separation in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elacople.com/wp/index.php/1999/01/01/se-separo-illya-kuryaki/ Se Separo Illya Kuryaki] ElAcople.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly talented and promising band was [[Karamelo Santo]], another contribution of the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] (also home of [[Los Enanitos Verdes]]). They featured a very refreshing mix of rock, punk, ska, afro-Uruguayan, and cumbia rhythms that earned them critical praise in Argentina. They would spend most of the 2001&amp;ndash;2004 period on extensive tours of Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/170.shtml Karamelo Santo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902210112/http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/170.shtml |date=2006-09-02 }} www.rock.com.ar&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todos Tus Muertos]] would break up at the height of their popularity in 1999.

To a lesser extent dance and [[electronica]] music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also influenced Argentine rock of the 2000s. A good example of this is the internationally prominent techno-pop act [[Miranda!]], a band that owes as much to current dance and [[electronica]] as the 1980s techno-pop of [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]] and [[Los Encargados]], electronic pioneers in Argentina.

=== Nowadays ===

As with any evolving musical movement, it's hard to define the state of the scene in question. Its final anthology will not be written until 10 to 20 years in the future. But in general terms, Argentine rock in the middle of the 2000s decade can be said to showcase the following trends:

* A continued commercial success of rolinga and suburban rock. In the early part of the current decade the so-called '2nd wave of suburban' crashed to the scene: [[Guasones]], [[Jovenes Pordioseros]], [[La 25]], [[Cielo Razzo]], [[Black Roses (band)|Black Roses]], [[Hijos Del Oeste]], [[El bordo (band)|El Bordo]], [[Callejeros]] and [[Casi Justicia Social]]. Their fan base is somewhat younger than those of the 1st wave, and their music is derivative of the 1st but with a slightly pop, more teen oriented approach.
* Influenced by bands like [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Porcupine Tree]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Dream Theater]] the underground [[progressive rock]] and [[progressive metal]] scene has been constantly growing since 2005, with many trends like: [[Heavy metal music|metal]] - influenced bands like [[Fughu]], [[Dudosa Moral]] and [[Destino 101]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] - [[Pop music|pop]] - [[Heavy metal music|metal]] like [[De Rien]], [[jazz fusion]] - [[progressive rock]] outfit [[Fantasía Cromática]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] - [[Folk music|folk]] [[Isósceles]], [[King Crimson]] - [[Frank Zappa]] influenced [[Souls Ignite]] and [[symphonic rock]]&amp;ndash;[[art rock]] [[Rodrigo San Martín]] and [[Maybe (band)|Maybe]].
* The current punk scene in Argentina features no real mainstream bands (besides eternal punks [[Attaque 77]]), and a huge underground scene which has a healthy amount of talent. Bands worth mentioning include [[Smitten (band)]]; [[Cadena Perpetua]] with their well-crafted and tight songs; [[Romapagana]] certainly unusual and inspiring with their cosmopolitan mix of language and dinamic sound;[[Shaila]] who also features many English lyric songs, unusual for Argentine rock; and veterans [[2 Minutos]] who soldier on.
* Heavy Metal at mid decade features a predominance of nu-metal and [[doom metal]] groups; [[Carajo]], [[Cabezones]] and a recharged [[A.N.I.M.A.L.]] in the former (and all having toured extensively overseas), internationally acclaimed doomsters [[Los Natas]], and [[Lörihen]] for the latter. [[O'Connor (band)|O'Connor]] is the most prominent of the classic metal revivalists. Under AC/DC influence, consolidated his career [[La Naranja Metalica]].
* In fusion or tropical rock [[Bersuit Vergarabat]] still command legions. [[Dancing Mood]] is the ska representative on the mainstream, and [[Nonpalidece]] is the current reggae-rock band in vogue. Other current bands include [[Karamelo Santo]], [[Los Calzones]], [[La Mosca Tsé - Tsé]], and [[Kapanga]]. Ex-[[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] [[Vicentico]] and ex-[[Todos Tus Muertos]] [[Fidel Nadal]] are both well embarked in their solo careers with fusion rock.
* In alternative, [[El Otro Yo]] continue their impressive streak of great albums and fresh sounding music. [[Catupecu Machu]]'s slightly threatening rock has made them a mainstream alternative band, and [[Babasónicos]] are arguably the most internationally popular Argentine band today. [[La Portuaria]], after a late 1990s hiatus in a hostile musical climate, returned in the early 2000s as alternative once again resurfaced in Argentina.
* A renovated indie scene with great bands like [[Jaime Sin Tierra]], which created lush beautiful rock before disbanding in 2001 leaving behind the seed for the sound of bands like Las Curvas de Mondrián, [[1000 NICKS]] with their retro rock style, [[Dalmanerea]] with their original and creative "meZKla argentina" and [[Interama]] and their left-of-the-dial melodies. [[Entre Ríos (band)|Entre Rios]]'s elegant electro lounge with female vocals is one of the best kept secrets in Argentina's indie scene. The indie scene also has a neo-symphonic revival scene with the likes of [[Pez (band)|Pez]] and [[A Tirador Laser]], bands which are reviving the sound of later 1970s Argentine rock with an updated resonance.
* In addition there is a large indie scene influenced by [[Krautrock]] and late 1980s/early 1990s British and American indie-rock acts such as [[The Pastels]], [[The Vaselines]], [[Jesus and Mary Chain]] and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. Some of the most popular bands from this scene include [[Iguana Lovers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/15/february-best-music-map The Guardian UK, Best Music Across the Map]&lt;/ref&gt; (that's started in 1990 with collaborations of [[Ride (band)]] members, [[Mark Gardener]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciudad.com.ar/espectaculos/55611/contacto-en-buenos-aires?quicktabs_1=2 Ciudad espectáculos, Mark Gardener &amp; Iguana Lovers, Ride, contacto en Buenos Aires]&lt;/ref&gt; and Loz Colbert and the Scottish band [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201405/63912-jesus-and-mary-chain-manana-en-groove.html Telam, Iguana Lovers presenta Surfing Caos junto a The Jesus and Mary Chain]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[El Mato a un Policia Motorizado]] and [[Banda de Turistas]].
* The start of the 2nd generation of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Indio Solari]], [[Vicentico]], [[Fidel Nadal]], etc. Ex-[[Soda Stereo]] member Cerati spent most of the early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (''Ahi Vamos'') where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-[[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]] Solari's debut album ''El tesoro de los Inocentes'' was seen as the best of 2004. [[Vicentico]] and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has just released his third solo album, ''Los Pájaros''. [[Skay Beillinson]], also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.
* Many new bands influenced by Redonditos de Ricota are reaching recognition. Those include [[Mavirock]], and [[Cajale Cazazo]].
* The first decade of this century saw the apparition of rock bands singing in English, like [[Watchmen (band)|Watchmen]] (not to be confused with [[The Watchmen (band)|The Watchmen]], the Canadian band), or the Anglo-Argentine [[The Draytones]]. [[Skiltron]], playing Celtic metal, released his first album in 2006. Skiltron split in 2011, giving origin to [[Triddana]]. Another Celtic metal is [[Tersivel]] (2004), whose first EP was recorded in 2006 and their first full-length album was released in 2010. Other notable English singing bands are [[Electronomicón]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/21/21331.shtml |title=Electronomicon |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819192011/http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/21/21331.shtml |archive-date=2016-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (hard rock), [[Kapel Maister]] (symphonic metal), [[42 decibel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/0-9_3/42-decibel-hard-rock.htm 42 Decibel - Hard Rock N' Roll]&lt;/ref&gt;  (hard rock), {{ill|Poncho (band)|lt=Poncho|es|Poncho (banda)}}, [[Maxi Trusso]], [[Full Nothing]], [[Siamés]] and [[Octafonic]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:BadStreetBrawlerSSTrip.png|left|thumb|256px|In-game screenshot]]

The player plays the character Duke Davis, who goes from stage to stage beating up [[gangsters]] that get in his way, dressed in a yellow [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]], [[sunglasses]], and yellow pants. He is described as a former [[punk rock]]er and the "world's coolest" [[martial artist]].

Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (such as "Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you"). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as [[gorilla]]s and circus [[Dwarfism|dwarves]] who throw [[hammer throw|hammers]] at the player (resembling old ladies in the DOS port who throw purses at the player).
There are 15 stages in this game
Moves include the "bull ram" attack and "trip" move.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s [[Seanbaby]] placed it as number 16 in his "20 worst games of all time" feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seanbaby.com:80/nes/egm16.htm|title=Seanbaby's EGM's Crapstravaganza - #16: Bad Street Brawler (NES)|website=Seanbaby.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707231735/http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/egm16.htm|archivedate=2006-07-07|deadurl=yes|access-date=2007-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Below-the-line"''' is a term derived from the top sheet of a [[film budgeting|film budget]] for [[film|motion pictures]], [[television program]]s, [[Sponsored film|industrial films]], [[independent film]]s, student films and [[Documentary film|documentaries]] as well as [[Advertisement film|commercials]]. The "line" in "below-the-line" refers to the separation of production costs between [[Screenwriter|script and story writers]], [[Film producer|producers]], [[Film director|directors]], [[actor|actors,]] and [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] ([[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|"above the-line"]]) and the rest of the crew, or [[production team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does "above/below the line" mean in a film budget?|url=https://www.quora.com/What-does-above-below-the-line-mean-in-a-film-budget|date= Feb 27, 2011|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=August 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does ‘below the line’ mean in movie production?|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/what-does-below-line-mean-movie-production.htm|publisher=''[[How Stuff Works]]''|access-date=August 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top sheet of any creative project's budget serves only as an at-a-glance reference to a fully detailed and attached main budget document, which features total expenses including federal, state and local taxes, as well as insurance within the entire production, and or [[Movie production incentives in the United States|production incentives]]. This painstaking task is usually assigned to the Production Manager or UPM of a production &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budgeting For Production Managers|url=https://edictive.com/blog/budgeting-for-production-managers/|publisher=''[[Edictive]]''|access-date=August 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and should be completed before [[principal photography]] begins for any project.

==Below-the-line crew==

Some below-the-line film and television film crews operate in [[pre-production]], [[Filmmaking#Production|production]], or [[post-production]] stages of filmmaking. For example, the film editor may work solely in the post-production stage of filming but he/she might also work throughout the production, editing the film as it is shot and advising the director if and when additional shots or scenes are needed. The boom operator on the other hand is mostly on set during filming because he or she has to pick up the dialogue of the actors as well as [[Ambience (sound recording)|ambient noise]] when the scene is being recorded.

This particular type of [[film crew]] usually belongs to a guild or union. Some of the unions and/or guilds that represent below-the-line crew include: [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|I.A.T.S.E]]., The International Cinematographer's Guild (an [[IATSE]] organization), The [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]], Motion Picture Editors Guild, Animation Guild, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://filmmakeriq.com/2012/09/a-guide-to-hollywood-unions/|title=A Guide to Hollywood Unions ⋆ FilmmakerIQ.com|date=2012-09-03|work=FilmmakerIQ.com|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually the case for the "below-the-line" crew to work for hourly wages, as opposed to a set wage, or negotiated contractual wage on the front, or back end of any given project. 
These set workers are responsible for a number of many other unsung, and demanding tasks that must be completed to achieve the common goal of creating a film, or television program. These positions could be considered "less glamorous", and the unmentionable part of filmmaking. However, many dedicated and hard working individuals have made a good living with "below-the-line" job positions, whether  it's in [[independent film]]making, and or for a [[major film studio]]. 
[[File:Dolly Grip breaks down a Steadicam-Southland on TNT ...it's a Wrap!.jpg|thumb|Dolly Grip with Steadicam at [[Olympia Medical Center]] [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] on the set of [[Southland (TV series)|Southland on TNT]]]]
Within the many entry-level positions available to gain knowledge of the industry, such as [[Lighting technician]]s, [[Grip (job)|grips]], [[Wrangler (profession)|wranglers]], [[stunt performer]]s, [[property master]]s, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#ADR/post-sync|ADR]], [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]], [[Scenic painting|set painters]] or any [[stagehand]] etc., one could gain knowledge and skill of these, and many other key positions within the [[film industry]].
Many schools and or [[nonprofit organization]]s are set up to train the youth and other interested individuals to better prepare and teach a trade that may not otherwise be available within the traditional school system. These organizations teach about film and video terminology, equipment, and [[life skills]], a must for today's highly completive [[show business|entertainment]] market.

Below-the-line crew refers to everybody else including:

{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}
*[[Assistant director]]
*[[Art director]]
*[[Best boy|Best boy electric and grip]]
*[[Boom operator (media)|Boom operator]]

*[[Broadcast engineering|Video control broadcast engineering]] (television)
*[[Visual effects supervisor|Visual effects editor]]
{{colend}}

Most of these crafts people are considered variable cost in the budget. Meaning, if you cut a scene from the script, potentially, you don't have to build that set, or paint it or dress it, etc.

It does not follow on directly from where ''[[BloodRayne]]'' finished; instead, it takes place 60 and 70 years later&lt;ref&gt;During gameplay, Rayne mentions trying to find her father for 70 years.&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Modern era|contemporary]] 2000s setting.

==Gameplay==
{{empty section|date=November 2017}}

==Plot==
The [[full motion video|FMV]] opens with a flashback set shortly after the first game. Rayne is seen entering a library (called Blood Library), with a few Nazis inside. She finds that Brimstone members have been slaughtered and realizes her vampiric father Kagan is here, acting as an influential Nazi. Rayne rushes to confront him for revenge for her mother's rape and the murder of her family, and Kagan mocks Rayne by saying he doesn't recognize her, as he sired numerous offspring that way.  He finds what he was looking for, called the Vesper Shard. Knowing Rayne still wants to kill him, he then brings Professor Trumain up from the floor, strangled by his own small intestine, but barely alive. Kagan knows that they know each other, and that Trumain "stole" yet another offspring from him. While Kagan mocks Rayne, Truman pulls out a detonator, first giving time for Rayne to run, then detonating the grenade, killing himself and seemingly taking Kagan with him.

Denied the pleasure of killing him herself, Rayne spends the 60 years after the war seeking out and destroying Kagan's offspring.&lt;ref name="storyplot"&gt;[http://www.bloodrayne2.com/storyline.php BloodRayne 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620200026/http://www.bloodrayne2.com/storyline.php |date=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These offspring, Rayne's half-siblings, have banded together to form a group called the Cult of Kagan.&lt;ref name= "storyplot"/&gt; The Cult has created the Shroud, a substance that can render sun rays harmless to vampires, allowing them to surface at all times of the day, and which twists nature into a nightmarish perversion &lt;ref name= "storyplot"/&gt; (trees dying almost instantly, grass catching on fire, corpses twitching). Using the Shroud, the Cult has pledged to create a new era of vampiric supremacy, continuing Kagan's legacy.

Rayne and her ally Severinfind high ranking members of the Cult, who are responsible for hundreds of disappearances in a city. Rayne learns of their plot and defeats her ambitious half-sister Ferrill, the apparent leader of the cult. It's soon revealed that Kagan himself has long survived over the years and has come out of hiding. After Kagan has Ferrill dispatched, he sets about the plot to activate the Shroud, blocking out the sun and setting loose an army of vampires and demonic entities to destroy the city, making it his kingdom. Rayne again sets her sights on killing Kagan.

With Kagan's army having taken over the city, Rayne seeks out his tower to face him once and for all, fighting his army to get to him. A vengeful Ferrill makes an army of her own to usurp Kagan. After Rayne dispatches the last of her half-siblings, she confronts Kagan in his throne room, with Kagan mocking her one last time about the effort he took to create her. A fight ensues and Rayne decapitates her father, avenging her family.

Despite Kagan's death, the vampires still plague the city, and Severin suggests that Rayne should run it now.  Brimestone declares martial law to rescue the surviving humans, cracking down hard on all vampires and more vampire overlords setting their sights on the city.

The '''Clowns Gallery-Museum''' is a museum of [[clowning]] situated at venues in [[Holy Trinity Church, Dalston]] and [[Wookey Hole]], Somerset. Established in 1959, the collection contains costumes and props from famous clowns, as well as a reference library,&lt;ref name="clowns"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clowns-international.com/museum.html | title=The Clowns Gallery-Museum's History | publisher=Clowns International | accessdate=3 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004154353/http://www.clowns-international.com/museum.html | archivedate=4 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to the Clown Egg Register, an archive of painted ceramic and hen's eggs which serve as a record of individual clowns' personal make-up designs. The egg gallery was created because according to an unofficial rule, no two clowns are allowed to have the same make-up. In order to ensure that clowns weren’t copying each other’s makeup style, the practice of painting each unique design onto an egg began. Real eggs were originally used, but were later replaced with ceramic eggs. The gallery opens on the first Friday of each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/attractions/clowns-gallery-museum-london|title=Clowns Gallery-Museum London|work=Time Out London|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is split between the museum's two sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/56cac980-e8f9-11e2-aead-00144feabdc0.html | title=First Person: Matthew Faint – ‘I run the clown egg register’ | work=Financial Times | date=12 July 2013 | accessdate=3 October 2015 | author=Taylor, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dancin'''''' is a musical [[revue]] first produced in 1978, directed and choreographed by [[Bob Fosse]], who won a [[Tony Award]] for the choreography.  The show is a tribute to the art of dance, and the music is a collection of mostly American songs, many with a dance theme, from a wide variety of styles, from [[operetta]] to [[jazz]] to [[classical music|classical]] to [[marches]] to pop.

==Production==
''Dancin''' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] on March 27, 1978.  It then transferred to the [[Ambassador Theatre (New York)|Ambassador Theatre]] and ran for 1,774 performances (including previews).  Additional choreography was by Christopher Chadman.  

After the success of the dance-intensive ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', Fosse proposed a show with little dialogue and singing.  Fosse's concept for the show was to use classical and show music, [[popular music]], [[rock and roll]], [[Mozart]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[George M. Cohan]], and contemporary music by [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Melissa Manchester]], anything ''except'' a new score written by a collaborator. He stated publicly that the project would free him from the burden of an artistic partnership: "When you have collaborators, you have all those midnight meetings. I'm tired of those...So I just decided to meet myself at midnight."&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/fosse/multimedia/dancin.html "Fosse, 'Dancin'"] PBS.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gottfriend359&gt;Gottfried, Martin. ''All His Jazz'', Da Capo Press, 1990, p. 359. {{ISBN|0-306-80837-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fosse invited choreographer [[Graciela Daniele]] to contribute a few numbers, but she declined, saying "When you are out of ideas, call me. I have the feeling that once you get into it, you're going to want to do it all."&lt;ref name=Gottfriend359 /&gt; Despite the lack of creative partners, Fosse still had to negotiate with his co-producer Bernard Jacobs, the president of [[The Shubert Organization]], who objected to Fosse's risqué number depicting a tourist coping with [[New York City]]'s then-notoriously seamy [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;  The show's remaining numbers impressed audiences, and because Fosse co-produced the show, it became his biggest financial success in the theatre.&lt;ref name=musicals101&gt;Kenrick, John.[http://www.musicals101.com/1970bway2.htm "History of The Musical Stage, 1970s II: Concept Musicals, Fosse"] musicals101.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gottfried366&gt;Gottfried, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's choreography was so demanding, however, that small theatre companies were unable to effectively recreate it, and so the show has not been revived.&lt;ref name=musicals101/&gt; However, several numbers from ''Dancin''' were recreated for the 1999 dance review ''[[Fosse]]'', including: "Crunchy Granola Suite", "I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man", "Big Noise from Winnetka", "Mr. Bojangles", and "Sing Sing Sing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=5798 ''Fosse''] Internet Broadway Database&lt;/ref&gt; 

A revival was scheduled to be produced by the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] at [[Studio 54]] for 2009, but this had been postponed until the 2009–10 season, and was again postponed indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

==Review==
In his ''New York Times'' review, Richard Eder writes the show is designed to be a musical show — there is no story line. He states that Ann Reinking is clearly the star and she is at her best in the high point of the evening, "Benny's Number", which recreates [[Benny Goodman]] and his band using "Sing, Sing, Sing". He also mentions several other dances, such as "Dancin' Man", with the entire cast dressed in "ice-cream" suits and lavender shirts; and "Fourteen Feet", where the shoes are nailed to the floor, and the dancers proceed to move within those confines. He sums up by writing "precision and style mark the evening at its best", but they serve very little.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, Richard. Review, ''The New York Times'', March 28, 1978, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive Barnes, newly moved to the ''New York Post'', told Fosse that he thought the show was "tremendous" and "fantastic".&lt;ref name=Gottfried366 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48701">[[Image:DOG Jimbo.jpg|thumb|In a typical digital on screen graphic, the station's logo appears in a corner of the screen.]]

A '''digital on-screen graphic''' (originally known as '''digitally originated graphic''', and known in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[New Zealand]] by the acronym '''DOG'''; in the [[United States|US]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]] and [[Australia]]  as a '''bug'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aurora.tv/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Aurora-Program-Supplier-Pack-0912.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''network bug''') is a watermark-like station [[logo]] that most television broadcasters overlay over a portion of the screen area of their programs to identify the channel. They are thus a form of permanent visual [[station identification]], increasing [[brand recognition]] and asserting ownership of the video signal. In some cases, the graphic also shows the name of the current program. Some [[television network]]s use an on-screen graphic to advertise upcoming programs (usually programs scheduled later the same day, but also for "significant" upcoming programs as much as a week in advance).

The graphic identifies the source of programming, even if it has been [[time shifting|time-shifted]]&amp;mdash;that is, recorded to [[videotape]], [[DVD]], or a digital [[personal video recorder]] such as [[TiVo]]. Many of these technologies allow viewers to skip or omit traditional between-programming station identification; thus the use of a DOG enables the station or network to enforce brand identification even when standard commercials are skipped.

DOG watermarking also helps minimize off-the-air [[copyright infringement]] (for example, the distribution of a current series' episodes on DVD): the watermarked content is easily differentiated from "official" DVD releases, and can help law-enforcement efforts by identifying not only the station an illegally copied broadcast was captured from, but usually the actual date of the broadcast as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Graphics may be used to identify if the correct subscription is being used for a type of venue. For example, showing [[Sky Sports]] within a pub requires a more expensive subscription; a channel authorized under this subscription adds a [[pint glass]] graphic to the bottom of the screen for inspectors to see. The graphic changes at certain times, making it harder to counterfeit.  

==Usage==
Many news broadcasters also place a clock alongside their bug. In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], DOGs may also include the show's [[Television content rating systems|parental guideline rating]].  In Australia, this is known as a Program Return Graphic (PRG). It has become common to place text above the station's logo advertising other programs on the network.

In many countries, some TV networks put "live" in the bottom of the DOG to advise viewers that the program is live, as opposed to a repeat.

During televised sports events, a DOG may also display a few game-related statistics such as the current score. This has led many people in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] to refer to it as a '''[[score bug]]'''.

===Arab world===
Arabic TV logos are placed in the top-right and top-left except for Al-Jazeera, whose logo appears on the bottom-right of the screen. Some of the Arabian TV stations hide their logos during commercial breaks and promos/trailers, such as [[Dubai TV]], [[Dubai One]], Funoon, the Egyptian [[CBC (Egypt)|CBC]] and Nile TV networks, ART Hekayat, ART Hekayat 2, Iqraa and [[Al-Jazeera]].

===Argentina===
Beginning in the late 1990s, almost all television stations in Argentina had their logos being shown on the top-right of the screen. When [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]] relaunched in 2002 to replace Azul Televisión, its logo was shown on the bottom-left of the screen. After intense criticism, Canal 9 moved its logo to the top-right of the screen of which most Argentine broadcasters had almost always followed.

===Australia===
Australia first introduced the digital on-screen graphic in the early 1990s. The [[Seven Network]] was the first metropolitan network to broadcast digital on-screen graphics on all of their programs, following The [[Nine Network]] in mid-to-late 2002 later [[Network Ten]] in 2004. DOGs in Australia most commonly appear in the bottom-right hand corner of the screen, but sports orientated content that uses the network's sports brand (e.g. Seven Network and [[Seven Sport]]) generally appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. [[10 Boss|One]] originally placed its DOG in the top-right hand corner of the screen due to it being a sports orientated channel at the time, but after the 2011 rebrand to allow a wide range of content to be broadcast, the channel's DOG was moved to the bottom-right hand corner of the screen. The [[ABC Me|ABC3]] and [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] channels originally placed their DOGs in the top-left hand corner of the screen, but have since moved them down to the bottom-right hand corner as of late 2013. [[Datacasting|Datacasting channels]] and [[Shopping channel|home shopping channels]] show their DOGs in the top-right hand corner of the screen.

DOGs are generally shown in a semi-transparent format, but are shown opaque during in-programme advertisements that take place at the very bottom of the screen. News services have their own DOGs placed where their network's DOG would normally be, but are only shown in an opaque format. News services generally show footage that was captured by another network (usually for sporting stories), but the semi-transparent DOG of the original network is still shown. [[Current affairs (news format)|Current affairs]] programmes and other news programmes that are produced by the network generally show their own opaque DOG at the bottom-left hand corner of the screen, opposite to their network's semi-transparent DOG which still appears (e.g. [[Nine Network]] and [[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]).

Australian TV networks hide all of their DOGs during advertisement breaks. They only reappear during the promotion for a programme that will be shown on the station and are not shown during any other advertisement material.

At times, networks will superimpose a semi-transparent watermark immediately adjacent to their DOG to advertise an upcoming special event that the network will be broadcasting (e.g. [[Network Ten]] superimposed an advertisement for the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics]] on their primary channel (Ten), [[10 Boss]], and [[10 Peach]] as they were to be the Australian broadcaster of the event), or to advertise a popular upcoming programme.

In addition, during ABC's [[ABC News Breakfast]], Seven's [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]] and 10 Peach's [[Toasted TV]] (except Weekends), a digital clock appears on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen while Nine's [[Today (Australian TV program)|Today Show]] and Ten's [[Studio 10]] appears on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

Currently now ABC, Seven, Nine and Ten are on the bottom-right hand corner while SBS is on the top-right hand corner.

===Austria===
[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Austrian public broadcasting agency, introduced digital on-screen graphics in 1992 on both television channels operated back then. Before, only the abbreviation "ORF" was shown randomly for several minutes during the programming in the top right corner of the screen, styled in a simple white sans-serif typeface. Nowadays, all Austrian television channels, both public and private, are required by law to display a digital on-screen graphic continuously in order to enable channel identification. However, during commercial and continuity breaks, it is forbidden to show digital on-screen graphics, to allow a further distinction between paid commercials or station announcements and programming content.

The position on the screen varies between the top left and the top right corner: for instance, public broadcaster ORF shows the digital on-screen graphics on ORF eins (first channel) in the top left corner, on ORF 2 (second channel) in the top right corner and on ORF III (third channel) again in the top left corner. Commercial broadcaster [[ATV (Austria)|ATV]] places the graphic in the top right corner on its main channel and in the top left corner on its additional channel ATV II. Most other commercial channels show their digital on-screen graphics in the top right corner of the screen.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, digital on-screen graphics were introduced in the mid-1990s and are always used by all channels ([[Free-to-air|free]] and [[Pay television|pay]]). In most free-to-air channels, the logos are located on the bottom-right hand corner of the screen (except for [[RedeTV!]], [[TV Gazeta]], and [[Rede Bandeirantes]], whose logos are placed on the top right corner of the screen, and [[GloboNews]], which is located in the top left corner of the screen (and on the bottom left corner of the screen during reports)) and in all free channels they are usually transparent, but if some program or event is being broadcast live or exclusive or if some archived footage is shown, they become colorful.  In some pay channels, the logos appear even in [[commercial break]]s, but they become transparent in this situation.

===Canada===
[[Image:Sequence01.jpg|right|thumb|[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] places their opaque logo over [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s on-screen graphic during ''[[American Idol]]''.]]
[[Image:DOG Jimbo Global.png|right|thumb|A simulation of how a Canadian TV network could place their logo if a US network's logo is already present.]]

Logo bugs are used by Canadian broadcasters in a nearly identical fashion to U.S. broadcasters. However, a complication emerges when Canadian broadcasters [[simulcast]] U.S. programming (a frequent practice among broadcast television networks, intended to invoke the [[simultaneous substitution]] rules requiring TV providers to substitute the feeds of U.S. broadcast channels with those of local, Canadian broadcast channel, if they are airing identically-scheduled programming). While recorded programs can be delivered to the broadcaster by their distributor and played out locally (without depending on taking a feed from a U.S. network), live programs may not always have a clean feed available that is free of the U.S. network's bugs and imaging, necessitating the use of a dirty feed from the network instead.

In these scenarios, some channels—including, most frequently, CTV and [[CTV Two]], as well as its [[Bell Media]] sister channels—covered the U.S. network's bug with their own, opaque logo. However, Bell has since ceased this practice, and the majority of broadcasters "co-brand" the dirty feed by placing their own bug in a different corner of the screen than the U.S. logo.

===Chile===
Chilean television stations started showing the logos permanently in the 1990s. During that time, logos were placed in the bottom-right of the screen. [[La Red (Chilean TV channel)|La Red]] was the first television broadcaster to move their logo to the top of the screen, in 1997, due to the logo change, the logo was placed at the top-left, and later due to the same reason, moved to the top-right until now. Other broadcasters, such as [[Mega (Chilean television channel)|Mega]], which its logo being originally shown on the bottom-left of the screen, moved to the top-right of the screen due to similar reasons; [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], in a similar manner, moved its logo from the bottom-right to the top-right corner in 2002. [[Chilevisión]] has continued to have its logo being shown on the bottom-right of the screen until 2007, when it moved to the top-right of the screen, of which other television channels in Chile had followed in the previous years.

===China===
TV stations in mainland China always place their logo (usually semi-transparent and sometimes animated) in the top-left corner of the screen in full colour or grey-scale, regardless of the content being broadcast (programme or advertisements); although in some rare cases, the DOG may be placed elsewhere to avoid covering the score bug during the broadcast of a sport event.

===Finland===
[[Nelonen]] was the first channel in Finland to use the DOG, from its start in June 1997. [[MTV3]] started to use DOG in the beginning of 1998, and [[Yle]] introduced DOGs in its two channels in August 1998. The DOGs moved from the top right corner to the top left corner on Yle's channels on 5 March 2012 when the company's new corporate logo was taken into use.

===France===
[[La Cinq]] was the first channel in France to use the DOG when it launched in February 1986; it remained on the bottom-right corner until the channel ceased operations in April 1992. After the first private channels launched between 1986 and 1990, DOGs began to be used on the public television channels operated by [[France Télévisions]] and [[TF1]], where they were placed on the top-right corner.

Currently, the DOGs of TF1 and all channels of France Télévisions are placed on the top-right corner, while those of [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] and [[W9 (TV channel)|W9]] are placed on the top-left corner.  During programming blocks aimed at children, TF1 and international channel TV5 uses another DOG.

=== Germany ===
In the 1980s, public broadcasters started to randomly show logos during programs to prevent video piracy, following the lead of Italian broadcasters [[RAI]] and [[Canale 5]]. After the first private stations emerged in 1984, permanently showing their logo most times, the public broadcasters soon followed.
Today practically all TV stations show their logo during the programs and often these are an integral part of their design using fluent [[motion graphic]] animations to make the transition between programs, previews and advertising, as well as displaying additional information such as teletext numbers or the name of the following program.
Most logos are transparent during programming though some channels do not. (e.g. [[kabel eins]] uses a bright orange coloured logo.)
Also the majority of the channels show their logo in either the top-left or top-right corner of the picture though there are exceptions (e.g. [[RTL II]] in the bottom-right or [[N24 (Germany)|N24]] logo in the bottom-left and date and time in the top-right).

===Greece===
On all Greek network television networks, DOGs appear on the top-left hand corner of the screen. Since 1997, almost all television stations in Greece do not remove their logos during advertisement, although in channels such as [[Skai TV]] the logo becomes transparent.

===Hungary===
Hungarian DOGs was first introduced in MTV's channels ([[M1 (Hungary)|TV1]], [[M2 (TV channel)|TV2]] - not to be confused with the independent channel of the [[TV2 (Hungary)|same name]]) from the late 80's to the early 90's, but it was very rare.

TV2 was the first network to always display its DOG, which was a quarter-circle generated by a video super-imposer connected through the video-casette recorder. It started in 1992 and ceased in 1994.

Most DOGs are semi-transparent, but some including [[ATV (Hungary)|ATV]], [[HírTV]], and [[Echo TV]] have opaque DOGs.

These logos may be at any corner of the screen.

Age ratings have been included since 2001 onwards at the bottom of the screen as well as at the start of the program, but some channels dislike the requirement and use a different age rating system instead (mostly the Romanian ones) or none at all.

Many channels hide their logos in commercial breaks, but some (such as the independent TV2 and its sisters) include them during ads.

===Ireland===
The Irish language channel [[TnaG]] first used their bug during simulcast of [[QVC]] and their coverage of the [[Oireachtas]] (Irish Parliament). In 1998 [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] launch as Ireland's first commercial operator and the first Irish channel to permanently use a bug in the left hand corner of the screen. In 1999 TnaG re-branded as [[TG4]] and began showing their logo during all programmes. In 2002 [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] introduced their bug however it would only appear for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show and it was there to classify the suitability of the content of the show, in 2004 the bug became a permanent part of the on screen presentation for both [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two]]. RTÉ's classification guide also appears for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show. RTÉ's, TG4's and [[Setanta Ireland]]'s bugs appear in the upper right hand corner of the screen, while TV3's bugs appeared in the bottom right hand corner of the screen between the early 2000s and the channel's rebranding as [[Virgin Media One]] in August 2018 (when its bug was moved to the top right hand corner). RTÉ does not use their bug during news or current affairs programming. The now-defunct Channel 6 also displayed a bug during its two years on the air.  The new digital services from RTÉ also display bugs on [[RTÉjr]], [[RTÉ Two]] HD and [[RTÉ One|RTÉ One+1]]. Bugs are also used to tell viewers when shows are live or when they are replays. RTÉ use the word "replay" during repeats of live programming while TV3 advised viewers "Text &amp; Comment Lines are Closed", Setanta replaced the word "Ireland" with the word "live" to advise viewers that they are watching live events rather than repeats and TG4 places the Irish word "beo" (live) below the number '4' in their logo during live programming. RTÉ refer to DOGs as "bugs". In Northern Ireland UTV began displaying their bug in the late 2000s. All of the community and local channels in Ireland display a bug. All bugs also display 888 for subtitles.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, channel watermarks more often appear on the top left or the top right since Israeli cable and satellite based services often have the channel description and programming (OSD) on the bottom of the screen. In ad breaks, it is required to replace the channel watermark with a special symbol - often on the other edge of the screen - indicating there are ads at the moment.

===Indonesia===
Indonesian TV DOGs have been used since 1983. At that time, [[TVRI]] was Indonesia's only television channel. When [[RCTI]] began broadcasting in 1989, the DOG began to be used at the same time. The usage of logo differs by channel, appearing in either the top-left hand (for example, channels owned by [[Media Nusantara Citra]] such as RCTI, [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]] and [[MNCTV]], as well as [[Indosiar]]) or the top-right hand corners (such as [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]], [[antv]] and the channels of [[Trans Corp]] like [[Trans TV]] and [[Trans7]]). Logos of television channels may or may not have moved their logos to the other part of the screen, such as TVRI was the first to move theirs to the bottom-right hand corner in 1999 (the year the network changed its logo, used until 2001), and followed by [[MetroTV]] in 2010, while Indosiar's DOGs have been always on the top-left since it began broadcasting in 1995. SCTV, while using the text logo at the start of broadcast, did not began to use their own logo on screen until 1994.

Unlike Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, since 2004, most Indonesian TV networks never leave their logos during commercial breaks, instead, the logo becomes transparent (before 2004, logos were removed during commercial breaks). For the station identification, the logo will remain on-screen, but sometimes it will disappear prior to the identification.

===Italy===
In Italy, channel watermark usage is different for every television network. [[RAI]] at the end of 1970s, introduced its first watermark, to minimize copyright infringement by private channels. The bug "jumped" around the four corners of the image. At the end of 1987, the bug added the number of the station, until 2010 in letters and from 2010 in numbers.  
Nowadays RAI logos are always on the top right corner of the screen.  On the SD feeds of RAI channels that have an HD feed, the HD channel number is posted below the channel's bug.  [[Mediaset]] bugs are on the bottom-right from beginning, but during some shows or sport events, they can be moved on the top right.  

DOGs are not removed during commercial breaks, with an exception of some channels like [[Disney Channel Italy|Disney Channel]].

===Japan===
On all Japanese network television key stations and their affiliates, DOGs appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. In addition, during some programs, a digital clock appears on the top-left corner of the screen. The digital clock had been in place on all programs prior to the introduction of DOGs; the first DOGs were introduced in 1999 on the [[NHK BS1|NHK's satellite services]], before expanding to terrestrial television with the start of digital broadcasting in that country between 2003 and 2006.

===Mexico===
In Mexico [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Once TV]] and [[Canal 22|XEIMT-TV]] was the first channels to use their logos permanently in the top-right of the screen since 1997. The channels of [[Televisa]] and [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|TV Azteca]] did not start use logos permanently until 2000 and 2004, respectively, in their channels.

===Morocco===
Morocco's TV networks usually display their DOGs permanently, notably the [[SNRT]] and [[2M TV]]. The exception to this is [[Medi 1 TV]], as of now being the only Moroccan TV channel so far to hide its DOG during commercial breaks.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand introduced the digital on-screen graphics in 2001, starting with TV3 and FOUR. New Zealand FTA now placed their logos on the bottom right hand corner, with the exception of [[Maori Television]] and as of 9 February 2017, [[Three (New Zealand)|TV3]]. TV One had the logo on the top right hand corner until the switch to the bottom right hand corner on 1 July 2013. TV2 usually had the logo from the top right hand corner until New Year's Day 2012 when they switched it to the bottom right hand corner. [[Prime Television New Zealand]] now placed their logo on the bottom right hand corner as of March 2016.

===Philippines===
[[GMA Network]] first introduced DOGs in 1995, as the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] had implemented a television content rating system from November that year. Most stations do not display DOGs during commercial breaks, except [[Net 25]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (since 2012), and some cable channels, which display DOGs all the time. The DOGs can most often be seen in the upper-right corner, aligned with the TV content rating logo, but on several cable channels they are placed in the upper-left or bottom-right corners. Formerly, [[ABS-CBN]] removed the DOG and rating 3 minutes before commercial breaks, however from 2000 these are now removed 10 seconds beforehand.  ABS-CBN and GMA previously did not use DOGs during their newscasts but started doing so in 2012.  ABS-CBN and its sister channel S&amp;A append the word HD to their respective HD feeds' DOGs and place the DOGs outside the 4:3 safe zone.

Satellite pay-TV provider Cignal also appends its DOG to the channels it carries.  Hence, those who view channels through Cignal will see its DOG.  

The network logo and the [[MTRCB]] rating of the program (green 'G', blue 'PG' and red 'SPG') are shown 1 to 5 seconds after the start of the program. Hashtags, promotions and announcements are also shown in the middle of the program. All DOGs appear in a solid color.

===Poland===
Virtually all Polish TV channels show their logos in the corner of the screen during all programming, and have done so since the early 1990s. The two [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] channels first introduced them as a test in 1991 and then permanently in early 1993. Various positions of the logo were tested, before settling on the top-right corner on 19 April 1993. [[Polsat]], the first commercial Polish-language broadcaster, launched initially on satellite on 5 December 1992, with a DOG in the top-left corner from the beginning.

Nowadays, most channels, including the major networks such as [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]], [[Polsat]] (since 28 February 2005) and [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]], show their logos in the top-right corner of the screen. Top-left corner is also a common location, used by [[TTV (Poland)|TTV]] and several cable and satellite channels. News-oriented channels such as [[TVP Info]] and [[TVN24]] that display [[news ticker]]s at the bottom of the screen most of the time, usually integrate their DOGs in the ticker design, typically in the bottom-left corner. Few minor cable and satellite channels show their logos in the bottom-right corner. Most broadcasters remove their DOGs during commercial breaks, although the practice is not universal. Some channels, including most basic [[free-to-air]] ones, use alternate logos containing the "HD" branding for their [[HDTV]] feeds. This may be related to the fact that [[Television in Poland#Terrestrial|Polish digital terrestrial TV lineup]] consists almost entirely of [[SDTV]] streams, with HDTV available through cable and satellite.

Since 15 August 2005, all broadcasters licensed in Poland are also required to display the [[Television content rating system#Poland|age rating]] at all times, during all programming except news, sports and advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20051301089|title=Rozporządzenie Krajowej Rady Radiofonii i Telewizji z dnia 23 czerwca 2005 r.}} 23 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but has been criticised by viewers for exaggeration of age rating to +12 in case of animated or family movies on some TV channels, mainly from [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]] and [[Polsat]], and also on talent show with participation of children (e.g. [[The Voice Kids (Polish TV series)|The Voice Kids]]), for pathologizing of system and for [[screen burn-in]]. It is usually shown in the top-left corner, opposite the channel logo. However, Polish broadcasts of international cable networks (such as [[Discovery Channel Poland|Discovery Channel]], [[HBO (international)|HBO]], etc.) usually operate under foreign licenses and are legally treated as rebroadcasts of foreign channels. As such, they don't need to follow this requirement and may use a different rating system instead.

===Portugal===
[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] introduced DOGs in the late 1980s, when it was the only broadcaster in Portugal that operated two television channels. Initially, the logos were placed on the top-right corner, but in 1991 they were moved permanently to the top-left corner, to allow television ratings to be shown in the top-right corner. Until 2004 and [[RTP1]]'s rebranding, their DOGs were placed on the bottom-left corner during newscasts. On some programs or live sport broadcasting{{clarify|date=May 2018}}, DOGs are placed in the top-right corner. Logos are removed during advertising breaks and trailers. For subtitle information, on [[RTP1]] and [[RTP2]] a number such as 884, 885, 886, 887 or 888 is placed near the logo; in other cases ''Direto'' (Live) is sometimes used instead of a number (some programmes use neither numbers nor ''Direto'' (Live), ''Gravado'' (Recorded) or ''Repetição'' (Repetition)).

DOGs of privately owned channels were introduced in the mid-1990s. Initially, the logo of [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]] was placed in the bottom left corner during only some of its programmes; in the mid-2000s the logo was moved into the top left corner, and has been shown across all programmes since then. The two Brazilian-owned television services ([[Globo (Portugal)|Globo]] and [[RecordTV Europa]]) have their DOGs placed in the bottom-right corner.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, television channels usually have watermarks, which are usually placed in the top-right or top-left corner of the screen (one notable exception is [[NTV (Russia)|HTB]], which places it logo on the bottom-left corner). In some channels the watermark becomes half-transparent on ad breaks, but on main channels such as Channel One or Russia-1 they never disappear nor become half-transparent. Channel One was the first channel to have introduced their watermark in 1992 and by 1993 watermarks appeared on other channels.

===Serbia===
The Serbian national television RTS began showing logos in the early 1990s. Their logo was sometimes turned on manually during certain broadcasts but shortly afterwards remained permanently on-screen. One could notice how they were manually controlled, as the "logo-free" time during the begin of a program varied. Until around 1994–1995 their logos were opaque black and white, presumably due to being inserted into the analog CVBS signal just before being broadcast instead of an analog YUV, RGB or digital SDI signal, while in the mid-1990s they upgraded to colorized but still opaque logos. RTS's predecessor RTB (Radio Television of Belgrade) had DOGs of varying sizes, but rather than being introduced one after another they appear to have been used simultaneously at different broadcast sites. At least three different sizes and styles of their opaque black-and-white logo are known today.  On the satellite channel "RTS-SAT", Latin letters were used, but after the destruction of RTS headquarters in 1999 during a NATO air strike, it could be noticed how the logo appeared to have been quickly re-drawn and was being inserted by different equipment as it varied in shape and size, presumably because of the original equipment used to insert it being destroyed. Today RTS has the same opaque color logo from 1999 on RTS-SAT and new translucent logos were introduced in the 2000s for the analog terrestrial programs. Old logos remain on most archived recordings presumably due to lack of a cleanfeed archiving policy in the past, as can be seen in the "Trezor" historical series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbLujWaoJl0]

Most local and regional stations and some national commercial broadcasters (Pink from 2001–present, as of September 2012, when the national news start at 18:30, clock disappears up until the end of its morning program, B92 from 2004 to 2011, Avala from 2007 until 2011) in Serbia along with station logo also show a digital clock below the logo.

===Singapore===
Singaporean televisions began showing the channel logos during television programs in 1994. The first one was [[Mediacorp Channel 5|Channel 5]] then, [[Mediacorp TV12|Channel 12]] and lastly [[Mediacorp Channel 8|Channel 8]]. The television stations show the logo in full-color, and are usually shown in the top right of the screen. Also, since around 2004, logos of Mediacorp television channels also include the parent company's logo, and this expanded in 2005, with [[Mediacorp Channel U|Channel U]] became a part of Mediacorp.

Like its neighbouring country, Malaysia, Singaporean channels remove the channel logos during commercial breaks except for Channel NewsAsia, whose DOG is integrated into the ticker which remains on the screen during breaks.

===Spain===
[[Televisión Española|TVE]] introduced DOGs in 1985 on [[TVE1]] and [[TVE2]]. The DOG of TVE1 was all white until 1991, when the number 1 was changed from white to blue.  It remained so until 2003.

[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]], [[Telecinco]] and [[Canal+]] were the first channels to use DOGs from their launch, with the DOGs placed in the top-left and bottom-left corners. In 1992, Antena 3 and Telecinco repositioned their DOGs in the bottom-right, making it the same as TVE.

[[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], an Autonomical Channel of Catalonia, used DOGs from 1990, earlier shown only alongside [[Clock ident|clock indents]], and from 1994 until 1999, showed DOGs throughout broadcasting. From 1990 the DOG was removed during advertisements.  In 1999, the DOG was removed during the clock.

Currently, almost all channels in Spain use DOGs, with the DOGs are shown in the top or bottom-right of the screen, except [[13-TV]], [[Telemadrid]], and [[Disney Channel (Spain)|Disney Channel]], that uses DOGs on the top-left and bottom-left, respectively.  Most DOGs are removed during advertisements, trade test transmissions or when a program is not aired. An exception to this is [[Intereconomía TV|Intereconomia]]. [[3/24|Canal 3/24]] did not remove their DOG during advertisements between 2011 and 2014.

===Thailand===
Thailand introduced DOGs in 1991. Thai TV logos are in full-color, and the logos are removed during commercial breaks, trade test transmissions,  transitions between programs and when a Thai Royal Family member is shown during the broadcast. All Thai television stations show the logos in the top-right of the screen.

During the mourning period after the [[Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej|death of Bhumibol Adulyadej]] all television stations aired black-and-white, monochrome DOGs and showed the logo on the bottom-right of the screen for a period of a hundred days until 21 January 2017. After the period ended, all television stations reverted DOGs back to regular color scheme but remained on showing the logo on the bottom-right of the screen (except during foreign  sports programming and some foreign series and domestic sports programming on some channels, when television stations still show the logos on the top-right corner of the screen).

===Turkey===
In Turkey, screen graphics, bugs, or DOGs are known as screen badges. On analogue/digital television, screen badges were introduced to TRT1 in 1996 and some private channels had screen badges beginning in the mid-1990s. Beginning January 1, 2000, all television channels at the time had screen badges usually located in the top right hand of the screen. However on January 1, 2010, One got a new theme package and the screen badge was moved down to the bottom right hand of the screen. All of the TRT channels' screen badges were on the bottom right of the screen by the end of 2010.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, DOGs most commonly appear in the top-left hand corner on British channels. DOGs were first used on [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]] systems in their early days, when broadcasts were unmarked. [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] was the first to use DOGs on an analogue terrestrial channel in 1997. The DOG was originally very bright and noticeable, and was soon toned down. Channel 5 said that the DOG was used to assist viewers in tuning to the new channel once its test transmissions had ceased. Following the rebrand to "five" in 2002 the DOG disappeared until late 2007.

There have been two known predecessors to the digital on-screen graphic on British television, namely a small white outline rectangle that was broadcast on the screen throughout [[ITV (network)|ITV]]'s broadcast of the documentary ''Life by Misadventure: A Film about the Seriously Burned'' on 7 September 1973 to warn people that may be uncomfortable with its content,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/9185882/Channel_4_and_the_Red_Triangle_A_Case_Study_in_Film_Curation_and_Censorship_on_Television&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, [[Channel 4]]'s infamous [[Red triangle (Channel 4)|red triangle]] symbol, which was applied in the corner of the screen throughout a series of controversial late-night art films broadcast 1986–87, in addition to an [[television ident|ident]] before the films began, again in both cases to warn viewers of the content.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/9185882/Channel_4_and_the_Red_Triangle_A_Case_Study_in_Film_Curation_and_Censorship_on_Television&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] initially introduced a DOG on each of its digital-only channels. In October 1998, it added DOGs to [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] but following a large number of complaints they were removed just two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://625.uk.com/dogwatch/#choice DOG Watch!: Hello BBC Three (Goodbye Choice)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a BBC TWO DOG was used during the overnight [[BBC Learning Zone]] strand. The DOGs for the other channels appear at the top left-hand corner on other channels except [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] (which is bottom left and forms part of integrated information graphics) and its international counterpart, [[BBC World News]].  The BBC News Channel's DOG does not appear when it airs Breakfast. Whilst [[BBC Four]] and [[BBC Parliament]] have static DOGs, the ones on [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] alongside other channels such as [[Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] feature moving elements. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] uses DOGs on all its channels, as do its counterparts [[STV (TV network)|STV]] in central and northern [[Scotland]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]], and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] in Northern Ireland.  Although BBC One and BBC Two currently do not feature their own channel-specific DOGs, a generic BBC logo appears on the top left-hand corner of their iPlayer feeds as is the case with other BBC channels.  This generic BBC DOG also appears on catch-up or on-demand programmes on the iPlayer.

The logos on channels such as [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (excluding [[STV (TV network)|STV]]), [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], [[E4 (channel)|E4]], [[E!]], [[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney XD]], [[Sky Arts|Sky Arts 1 and 2]], [[Sky1]], [[Sky2]], [[Sky Sports]], [[History (UK TV channel)|History]], and [[More4]] are almost transparent, whereas others like those on [[Comedy Central (UK)|Comedy Central]], [[Disney Junior]], some [[UKTV]] channels, [[CITV]], [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]], [[CBeebies]], the Discovery channels, [[Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nick Jr.]], [[Nicktoons (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nicktoons]], [[Boomerang (UK &amp; Ireland)|Boomerang]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK)|Nickelodeon]] are bright and noticeable. [[Sky Movies]] and [[Film4]] do not use DOGs, but [[Channel 4]] (starting in July 2017), [[Channel 4 HD#Channel 4 HD|Channel 4 HD]] and the timeshift channel Channel 4+1 all do. Some stations display their on-screen graphics permanently. The [[UKTV]] are an example that remove them during commercials and trailers, with some Sky channels removing them altogether at certain times into a programme. In addition to a fixed (sometimes animated) motif, [[MTV UK|MTV]] includes the programme title in the top-right hand corner. During [[widescreen]] programmes, the DOGs on most channels including ITV, BBC Three, BBC Four, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, CITV, CBBC, CBeebies, [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], and [[4Music]] stay in the far corner of the screen, it is now rare for a channel to place their DOG in a 4:3 "[[title safe]] area".{{when|date=July 2018}}

On digital systems such as [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], where stations have a set [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] number and a name displayed across the bottom of the screen when changing channel, DOGs have been deemed unnecessary by some users. Despite this, broadcasters persist with the practice. In response to negative feedback, the BBC has responded, "We believe it is important to ensure that viewers can quickly identify when they are watching a BBC service."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/issue/_issue_dogs/ BBC Complaints: Digital on-screen graphics]&lt;/ref&gt; It reinforced this position in both 2008 and 2009 following continual complaints to its ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'' programme, citing channel identification as the sole reason for the policy.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Points of View'', 11 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Points of View'', 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In its website FAQs, Five's stated reason for its use of a DOG is that "the vast majority of channels carry them, most permanently and virtually every channel at some point has one during the day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.five.tv/aboutfive/contact/faq/#dog five.tv: About Five]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 21 October 2008, the BBC announced that it was removing the DOG from BBC HD for all films and most dramas, acknowledging that there was an "irritation factor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a133304/bbc-tones-down-hd-channel-logo.html|title=BBC tones down HD channel logo|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the DOG came back when [[BBC One|BBC One HD]] launched in 2010. As of 2016, neither BBC One HD nor BBC Two HD was using a DOG. More recent additions are graphics which appear near the end of a programme to tell the viewer what's up next, despite this information being available at a touch of a button on digital TV. Many viewers also find this practice annoying, distracting and unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/columnists/story/0,,2077719,00.html|title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn|first=Charlie|last=Brooker|work=the Guardian|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6924316/How-low-will-TV-companies-stoop-to-stop-us-reaching-for-the-remote.html|title=How low will TV companies stoop to stop us reaching for the remote?|date=2 January 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8642854.stm|title=BBC News - Doctor Who fans angered by trailer for Over the Rainbow|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first logo bug appeared in the 1970's on cable networks and local TV stations. It was often displayed on the bottom of the screen for 5 to 10 seconds. It was usually displayed once per hour, or every 10 or 15 minutes during a program. One of the popular title generator machines during that time was made by "Chryron". But other brands were also used. The first transparent logo bug to be displayed throughout an entire show appeared on [[CBS Evening News]] in 1990.  It was part of the redesign of the news broadcast done by branding design firm Novocom. The reason for its introduction was so that business professionals traveling within the US would know which channel [[CBS News]] was on since it varied in different areas. Later it was adopted by [[CBS]] on every program. Since then, the use of digital on-screen bugs among cable and [[broadcast networks]] became standardized with the bug usually placed on the lower right hand corner of the screen, with the notable exception being during the [[broadcasting of sports events]] (where logo bugs have largely been placed in the top-right), and on most NBCUniversal networks (including [[NBC]]), where its standard bug was moved to the bottom left during prime time programming in 2006. During sports broadcasts, ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' introduced a permanent box at the top left-hand side of the screen showing the score of the game, along with the network's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commarts.com/features/fifty-years-of-tv-graphics|title=Communication Arts - Fifty Years of TV Graphics|work=commarts.com|accessdate= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "big four" networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]) began using on-screen bugs in September 1993 with the bug removed during commercial breaks. Other major networks such as [[PBS]] and [[The CW]] also use logo bugs in the same manner. They are usually monochrome to minimize distraction, while some cable networks ([[The History Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]], and [[CNBC]]) decided to use solid, full-color bugs at all times. Broadcast stations and networks typically only use solid, full color bugs during local newscasts, newscasts, and sports broadcasts; at other times the bug is switched to the transparent, gray variant. Also, broadcast channels typically show their local affiliate's [[call sign]] and/or the channel number on the screen bugs during local newscasts and in some cases [[syndicated programming]].  First-run syndicated programmes often display their own bug in addition to the bug of the station they are running on.  Meanwhile, network-based programming (including [[prime time]] programs and national newscasts) is typically shown with only the network's bug for most of the broadcast (although an automated system may allow a local bug to be overlaid onto network programming for a few seconds after the start of a programme or a commercial break).

Before the 2009 digital television transition, early [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasts often used bugs placed outside the 4:3 safe zone (sometimes with special "HD" branding) to distinguish them from the standard definition broadcast. By the late-2000s, due to networks switching to a singular HD feed downconverted for SD (assuming that the SD feed will be center-cut from the HD feed, or using [[Active Format Description]] (AFD) metadata to specify the framing format) as their network feed rather than distinct feeds for both formats, most broadcast networks dropped HD-specific logo bugs and used bugs in the 4:3 safe zone for all viewers, regardless of feed. However, by 2018, the majority of logo bugs and on-air presentation has been oriented towards 16:9 framing.

The use of bugs to announce upcoming programs with text advertisements is also particularly prevalent among some broadcast stations during prime time programs and many cable TV networks; they usually appear when a program resumes after a [[commercial break]], to inform the viewer of the next scheduled program, a new episode of a program later the same day, or a "significant" broadcast in the near future.  Since the mid-2000s, some stations and networks showed their websites alongside their bugs, especially during newscasts.  National morning shows like Today and Good Morning America have also showed their specific websites rather than their network's main website in addition to the bug that shows their programme.  Beginning in 2010, some networks began to display show-specific [[hashtag]]s alongside their bugs, which encourage viewers to discuss and interact with the program online via [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.linkbird.com/en/online-marketing/the-ultimate-guide-on-how-to-maximize-the-new-twitter-features/ |title=The Ultimate Guide on How to Maximize The New Twitter Features |first=Al |last=Gomez |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=Link Bird }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
Vietnamese TV stations started showing their digital on-screen graphical DOGs since year 1995. Logos are not removed during commercial breaks, but remained in full-color, unlike their counterparts in Indonesia. A digital clock and programme name may also be shown. Some cable channels show its cable provider logo and its logo. For example, VTV Cable's channels has the logo of the cable provider on the top-left, and the channel logo on the top-right.

==Connections with sponsor tags==
Another graphic on television usually connected with sports (particularly in North America, though not in Europe) is the sponsor tag. It shows the logos of certain sponsors, accompanied by some background relevant to the game, the network logo, announcement and music of some kind.

==Usage in [[ham radio]] and TV==
In most countries, the ham station is required to periodically identify their amateur-TV transmission. Such stations frequently overlay their callsign on the signal instead of placing a card in the background. Most hams use homebuilt devices or old consumer character generators to generate such identifications rather than using graphical super imposes of high cost to do so. Only rarely one can see real graphics, as the callsign is usually written in the "OSD font".

==Live DOGs by hobbyists==
One of the easiest and most sought-after devices used to generate DOGs by hobbyists is the 1980s vintage Sony XV-T500 video superimposer. This device can luma-key a signal, capture a still frame into memory and then overlay the [[Keying (graphics)|keyed]] graphic in one of eight colors onto any CVBS signal. Another method commonly used by hobbyists and even low-budgeted TV stations in former times was [[Amiga]] computers with [[genlock]] interfaces.

'''Eddie Cantor''' (born '''Edward Israel Itzkowitz''',&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Cantor, with Jane Kesner Ardmore, Take My Life, Mr. Cantor's second autobiography, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John.[http://www.musicals101.com/who2.htm Who's Who in Musicals: Ca-Cl] Musicals101.com, accessed September 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; January 31, 1892 – October 10, 1964) was an American "[[illustrated song]]" performer, comedian, dancer, singer, actor, and songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', October 14, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar to Broadway, radio, movie, and early television audiences, this "Apostle of Pep" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife Ida and five daughters. Some of his hits include "[[Makin' Whoopee]]", "Ida", "[[If You Knew Susie]]", "Ma! He's Makin' Eyes at Me", "Baby", "Margie", and "[[How Ya Gonna Keep 'em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?]]" He also wrote a few songs, including "[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]", the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[Looney Tunes|Warner Bros. cartoon]] theme.

His eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname, "Banjo Eyes". In 1933,  artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a [[banjo]]. Cantor's eyes became his [[trademark look|trademark]], often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical ''[[Banjo Eyes]]'' (1941).

His charity and humanitarian work was extensive, and he is credited with coining the phrase, and helping to develop [[the March of Dimes]]. He was awarded an honorary [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1956 for distinguished service to the film industry.

==Biography==
Cantor was born in 1892 in [[New York City]], the son of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian]]-[[Jewish]] immigrants, Meta and Mechel Itzkowitz. The precise date of his birth is unknown.&lt;ref name="Bio on Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eddiecantor.com/bio.html|title=The Eddie Cantor Story|work=Eddie Cantor Official Website|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died in childbirth one year after his birth, and his father died of [[pneumonia]] when Eddie was two, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother, Esther Kantrowitz.&lt;ref name="eddie"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Eddie Cantor Dead.

"The Haunted Smile" (2002). PublicAffairs. {{ISBN|1-58648-162-2}}, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; A misunderstanding when his grandmother signed him into school gave him her last name of Kantrowitz (shortened by the clerk to "Kanter"). Esther died on January 29, 1917, two days before Cantor signed a long-term contract with [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]], to appear in his ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]]''.

[[File:Eddie and Ida Cantor 1952.JPG|thumb|180px|The Cantors in 1952]]
Cantor had adopted the first name "Eddie" when he met his future wife Ida Tobias in 1913, because she felt that "Izzy" was not the right name for an actor. Cantor and Ida were married in 1914. They had five daughters, Marjorie, Natalie, Edna, Marilyn, and Janet, who provided comic fodder for Cantor's longtime running gag, especially on radio, about his five unmarriageable daughters. Several radio historians, including [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] (''Raised on Radio''), have said that this gag did not always sit well with the girls. Natalie's second husband was the actor [[Robert Clary]] and Janet married the actor [[Roberto Gari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-children-of-eddie-cantor.html The Children of Eddie Cantor] blog article by David Lobosco&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor was the second president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], serving from 1933 to 1935. He invented the title "The March of [[Dime (United States coin)|Dimes]]" for the donation campaigns of the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]], which was organized to combat [[polio]]. It was a [[Play on words|play]] on ''[[The March of Time]]'' [[newsreels]] popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  At that time, Roosevelt was the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|most notable American victim of polio]].  Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the [[White House]] mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimes—a large sum at the time.

Following the death of their daughter Marjorie at the age of 44, both Eddie and Ida's health declined rapidly. Ida died on August 9, 1962 at age 70 of "cardiac insufficiency",&lt;ref name=eddie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Deaths", ''The New York Times'', August 10, 1962, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and Eddie died on October 10, 1964, in [[Beverly Hills, California]], after suffering his second heart attack  at age 72.&lt;ref name=eddie/&gt; He is interred in [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage==

===Saloon songs to vaudeville===
By his early teens, Cantor began winning talent contests at local theaters and started appearing on stage. One of his earliest paying jobs was doubling as a waiter and performer, singing for tips at Carey Walsh's [[Coney Island]] saloon, where a young [[Jimmy Durante]] accompanied him on piano. He made his first public appearance in [[Vaudeville]] in 1907 at New York's Clinton Music Hall. In 1912, he was the only performer over the age of 20 to appear in [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]]'s ''Kid Kabaret'', where he created his first [[blackface]] character, "Jefferson". He later toured with [[Al Lee]] as the team "Cantor and Lee". Critical praise from that show got the attention of Broadway's top producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, who gave Cantor a spot in the Ziegfeld rooftop post-show, ''Midnight Frolic'' (1917).&lt;ref name=eddie/&gt;

===Broadway===
A year later, Cantor made his Broadway debut in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1917]]''. He continued in the ''Follies'' until 1927,&lt;ref name=bway&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=5198 "Eddie Cantor Broadway Credits"] Internet Broadway database listing, retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a period considered the best years of the long-running revue. For several years, Cantor co-starred in an act with pioneer comedian [[Bert Williams]], both appearing in [[blackface]]; Cantor played Williams's fresh-talking son. Other co-stars with Cantor during his time in the ''Follies'' included [[Will Rogers]], [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Fanny Brice]], and [[W.C. Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank; Hackman, Florence; McNeilly, Donald. "Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers" (2007). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-93853-8}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved on to stardom in book musicals, starting with ''[[Kid Boots]]'' (1923) and ''[[Whoopee!]]'' (1928).&lt;ref name=bway/&gt; On tour with ''Banjo Eyes'', he romanced the unknown [[Jacqueline Susann]], who had a small part in the show, and went on to become the best-selling author of ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]''.

==Radio and recordings==

===Radio===
Cantor appeared on radio as early as February 3, 1922, as indicated by this news item from [[Connecticut]]'s ''[[Bridgeport Telegram]]'':
:Local radio operators listened to one of the finest programs yet produced over the radiophone last night. The program of entertainment which included some of the stars of Broadway musical comedy and vaudeville was broadcast from the [[Newark, N. J.]] station [[WDY]] and the [[Pittsburgh]] station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], both of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]]. The Newark entertainment started at 7 o'clock: a children's half-hour of music and fairy stories; 7:[35?], Hawaiian airs and violin solo; 8:00, news of the day; and at 8:20, a radio party with nationally known comedians participating; 9:55, Arlington time signals and 10:01, a government weather report. G. E. Nothnagle, who conducts a radiophone station at his home 176 Waldemere Avenue said last night that he was delighted with the program, especially with the numbers sung by Eddie Cantor. The weather conditions are excellent for receiving, he continued, the tone and the quality of the messages was fine.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Operators Hear a Good Concert", ''Bridgeport Telegram'', February 4, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bert Gordon Eddie Cantor NBC.JPG|thumb|180px|Cantor (right) with Bert Gordon, AKA "the Mad Russian".]]
Cantor's appearance with [[Rudy Vallee]] on Vallee's ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' on February 5, 1931 led to a four-week tryout with [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. Replacing [[Maurice Chevalier]], who was returning to Paris, Cantor joined ''Chase and Sanborn'' on September 13, 1931. This hour-long Sunday evening variety series teamed Cantor with announcer Jimmy Wallington and violinist Dave Rubinoff. The show established Cantor as a leading comedian, and his scriptwriter, [[David Freedman]], as “the Captain of Comedy.” Freedman's team included, among others, Samuel "Doc" Kurtzman, who also wrote for song-and-dance man, Al Jolson, and the comedian Jack Benny. Cantor soon became the world's highest-paid radio star. His shows began with a crowd chanting "We want Can-tor! We want Can-tor!", a phrase said to have originated in vaudeville, when the audience chanted to chase off an act on the bill before Cantor. Cantor's [[theme song]] was his own lyric to the Leo Robin/Richard Whiting song, "One Hour with You".  His radio sidekicks included [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]], (comic Barney Gorodetsky, AKA "The Mad Russian") and [[Harry Parke]] (better known as "Parkyakarkus"). Cantor also discovered and helped guide the career of singer [[Dinah Shore]], first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, as well as other performers, including [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Bobby Breen]] in 1936 and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] in 1949.

Indicative of his effect on the mass audience, he agreed in November 1934 to introduce a new song by the songwriters [[J. Fred Coots]] and [[Haven Gillespie]] that other well-known artists had rejected as being "silly" and "childish". The song, "[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]", immediately had orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music the next day. It sold 400,000 copies by Christmas of that year.&lt;ref name="Book Ref"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Ace|title=Stories Behind the Greatest Hits of Christmas|date=5 October 2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=0310327954|pages=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4a6oMgT8UsEC&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=%22Santa+Claus+Is+Coming+to+Town%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yN30U4DVF-GIjALvq4GICg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Santa%20Claus%20Is%20Coming%20to%20Town%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 August 2014|ref=Stories Behind|chapter=4 Santa Claus Is Coming to Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His NBC radio show, ''Time to Smile'', was broadcast from 1940 to 1946, followed by his ''[[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] Show'' from 1946 through 1949. He also served as emcee of ''[[The $64 Question]]'' during 1949–50, and hosted a weekly disc jockey program for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] during the 1952–53 season. In addition to film and radio, Cantor recorded for [[Hit of the Week Records]], then again for Columbia, for [[Banner Records|Banner]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] and various small labels.

His heavy political involvement began early in his career, including his participation in the strike to form Actors Equity in 1919, provoking the anger of father figure and producer, Florenz Ziegfeld. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Cantor publicly denounced [[antisemitic]] radio personality [[Father Charles Coughlin]] and Cantor was dropped by his sponsor, [[Camel cigarettes]]. A year and a half later, Eddie's friend [[Jack Benny]] was able to get him back on the air.

===Recordings===
Cantor began making phonograph records in 1917, recording both comedy songs and routines and popular songs of the day, first for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], then for [[Aeoleon-Vocalion]], [[Pathé Records|Pathé]], and [[Emerson Records|Emerson]]. From 1921 through 1925, he had an exclusive contract with [[Columbia Records]], returning to Victor for the remainder of the decade.

Cantor was one of the era's most successful entertainers, but the 1929 [[stock market crash]] took away his multimillionaire status and left him deeply in debt. However, Cantor's relentless attention to his own earnings to avoid the poverty he knew growing up caused him to use his writing talent, quickly building a new bank account with his highly popular, bestselling books of humor and cartoons about his experience, ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/caught-short-a-saga-of-wailing-wall-street/oclc/381325 "'Caught short! A saga of wailing Wall street', OCLC Number: 381325"] worldcat.org, accessed September 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 1929 "A.C." (After Crash), and ''Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!''

Cantor was also a composer, with his most famous song seldom attributed to him. In 1935, along with Charles Tobias and Murray Mencher, Cantor wrote "Merrily We Roll Along", which he recorded in the 1950s. It was adapted as the themesong for the ''Merrie Melodies'' series of [[animated cartoons]], distributed by [[Warner Brothers Pictures]] between 1937 and 1964. Cantor himself was frequently caricatured in Warner cartoons of the period, (see Film and television: Animation).

==Film and television==
[[File:Eddie Cantor - 1933.jpg|thumb|in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933)]]
Cantor also bounced back between films and radio. He had previously appeared in a number of short films, performing his ''Follies'' songs and comedy routines, and two silent features (''Special Delivery'' and ''Kid Boots'') in the 1920s. He was offered the lead in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' after it was turned down by [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]. Cantor also turned the role down (so it went to [[Al Jolson]]), but he became a leading Hollywood star in 1930 with the film version of ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]],'' shot in two-color [[Technicolor]]. He continued making films over the next two decades until his last starring role in ''If You Knew Susie'' (1948).

===Television===
[[File:Eddie cantor television 1952.JPG|thumb|180px|Cantor as host of ''The Colgate Comedy Hour'', 1952.]]
On May 25, 1944, pioneer television station WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia presented a special, all-star telecast which was also seen in New York over WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) and featured cut-ins from their Rockefeller Center studios.   Cantor, one of the first major stars to agree to appear on television, was to sing "We're Havin' a Baby, My Baby and Me".  Arriving shortly before airtime at the New York studios, Cantor was reportedly told to cut the song because the NBC New York censors considered some of the lyrics too risqué. Cantor refused, claiming no time to prepare an alternative number. NBC relented, but the sound was cut and the picture blurred on certain lines in the song. This is considered the first instance of television censorship.&lt;ref&gt;"Cantor Censored in Televised Act". ''The New York Times''. May 27, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950,  he became the first of several hosts alternating on the NBC television variety show ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', in which he would introduce musical acts, stage and film stars  and play comic characters such as "Maxie the Taxi". In the spring of 1952, Cantor landed in an unlikely controversy when a young [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], appeared as a guest performer. Cantor embraced Davis and mopped Davis's brow with his handkerchief after his performance. When worried sponsors led NBC to threaten cancellation of the show, Cantor's response was to book Davis for two more weeks.  Cantor suffered a heart attack following a September 1952 Colgate broadcast, and thereafter, curtailed his appearances until his final program in 1954.  In 1955, he appeared in a filmed series for syndication and a year later, appeared in two dramatic roles ("George Has A Birthday", on NBC's ''Matinee Theatre'' broadcast in color, and "Sizeman and Son" on CBS's ''Playhouse 90'').  He continued to appear as a guest on several shows, and was last seen on the NBC color broadcast of ''The Future Lies Ahead'' on January 22, 1960, which also featured [[Mort Sahl]].

Eddie Cantor was portrayed as a recurring character on [[HBO]]'s series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', beginning with the introduction of the show in 2010, where he is played by [[Stephen DeRosa]]. Cantor's character appeared in three episodes of the show's first season, one episode of the second season, two of the third. and one of the fourth season.

===Animation===
Cantor appears in caricature form in numerous ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons produced for Warner Bros., although he was often voiced by an imitator. Beginning with "I Like Mountain Music" (1933), other animated Cantor [[cameo role|cameos]] include "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" ([[Harman-Ising]], 1933) and "[[Billboard Frolics]]" ([[Friz Freleng]], 1935).  Eddie Cantor is one of the four "down on their luck" stars (along with [[Bing Crosby]], Al Jolson, and Jack Benny) snubbed by [[Elmer Fudd]] in "[[What's Up, Doc? (1950 film)|What’s Up, Doc?]]" ([[Bob McKimson]], 1950). In "[[Farm Frolics]]" ([[Bob Clampett]], 1941), a horse, asked by the narrator to "do a canter", promptly launches into a singing, dancing, eye-rolling impression. The Cantor gag that got the most mileage, however, was his oft-repeated wish for a son after five famous daughters. "[[Slap-Happy Pappy]]" (Clampett, 1940) features an “Eddie Cackler” rooster that wants a boy, to little avail. Other references can be found in "[[Baby Bottleneck]]" (Clampett, 1946) and "Circus Today" ([[Tex Avery]], 1940). In'' Merrie Melodies'', "[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]" Cantor's many daughters are referenced by a group of singing quintuplet girls. In "Porky’s Naughty Nephew" (Clampett, 1938) a swimming Cantor gleefully adopts a "buoy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html From "The Warner Bros. Cartoon Companion", E.O. Costello, ed.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007104507/http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html |date=October 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animated Cantor also appears prominently in [[Walt Disney]]'s "[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]" ([[Wilfred Jackson]], 1938) as [[Little Jack Horner]], who sings "[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]".

==Books and merchandising==
[[File:Eddie Cantor and daughters ad postcard 1926.JPG|thumb|180px|Cantor and three of his daughters strike a pose in 1926 to promote his first film, ''Kid Boots'', and children's shoes.]]
Cantor's popularity led to merchandising of such products as ''Eddie Cantor's Tell It to the Judge'' game from [[Parker Brothers]]. In 1933, a set of 12 Eddie Cantor caricatures by Frederick J. Garner was &lt;!-- set is singular --&gt;published by Brown and Bigelow. These advertising cards were purchased in bulk as a direct-mail item by such businesses as auto body shops, funeral directors, dental laboratories, and vegetable wholesale dealers. With the full set, companies could mail a single Cantor card each month for a year to their selected special customers as an ongoing promotion. Cantor was often caricatured on the covers of [[sheet music]] and in magazines and newspapers. Cantor was depicted as a balloon in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/galleries/entertainment/entertainment.html |title=Floating back in time with Macy's balloons, 1940, photo No.11|author=New York Daily News|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the very few balloons based on a real person.

In addition to ''Caught Short!'', Cantor wrote or co-wrote at least seven other books, including booklets released by the then-fledgling firm of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], with Cantor’s name on the cover. (Some were "as told to" or written with [[David Freedman]].) Customers paid a dollar and received the booklet with a penny embedded in the hardcover. They sold well, and [[H. L. Mencken]] asserted that these books did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined.

==Tributes==
Cantor was profiled on ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', the [[NBC]] program in which an unsuspecting person (usually a celebrity) would be surprised on live television by host [[Ralph Edwards]], with a half-hour tribute. Cantor was the only subject who was told of the surprise in advance; he was recovering from a heart attack and it was felt that the shock might harm him.

On October 29, 1995, as part of a nationwide celebration of the 75th anniversary of radio, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Radio Hall of Fame]] at Chicago's Museum of Broadcasting Communication.

In 1953, Warner Bros., in an attempt to duplicate the box-office success of ''[[The Jolson Story]]'', filmed a big-budget [[Technicolor]] feature film, ''[[The Eddie Cantor Story]]''. The film found an audience, but might have done better with someone else in the leading role. Actor [[Keefe Brasselle]] played Cantor as a caricature with high-pressure dialogue and bulging eyes wide open; the fact that Brasselle was considerably taller than Cantor did not lend realism, either. Eddie and Ida Cantor were seen in a brief prologue and epilogue set in a projection room, where they are watching Brasselle in action; at the end of the film, Eddie tells Ida, "I never looked better in my life"... and gives the audience a knowing, incredulous look. [[George Burns]], in his memoir ''All My Best Friends'', claimed that Warner Bros. created a miracle producing the movie in that "it made Eddie Cantor's life boring".

Something closer to the real Eddie Cantor story is his self-produced 1944 feature ''Show Business'', a valentine to vaudeville and show folks, which was [[RKO]]'s top-grossing film that year.

Probably the best summary of Cantor's career is on one of the ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pondillo|first1=Bob|title=Racial Discourse and Censorship on NBC-TV, 1948-60|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=2005|volume=33|issue=2|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-issued on DVD as ''Eddie Cantor in Person'', the hour episode is a virtual video autobiography, with Eddie recounting his career, singing his greatest hits, and recreating his singing-waiter days with another vaudeville legend, his old pal Jimmy Durante.

Cantor appears as a recurring character, played by [[Stephen DeRosa]], on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.

'''Francisco José Debali''' (26 July 1791 – 13 January 1859), born '''Debály Ferenc József''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born composer who emigrated to [[Uruguay]] in 1838. He authored the [[National Anthem of Uruguay|national anthem of Uruguay]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uruguayinforme.com/articulos/07112003panizza.htm|title=Home - Uruguay Informe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, possibly, the tune to ''[[Paraguayos, República o Muerte]]'', which became the [[Paraguay]]an anthem. (See [[National Anthem of Uruguay#Music]].)

==Name==
As ethnic Hungarian, his original [[Personal name|Eastern order]] name was '''Debály Ferenc József'''. His Christian names were later in Uruguay translated into the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version, but his surname is known to be spelled as '''Debali''', '''de Bali''', '''Debáli''', '''Debály''' and '''Debally'''.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
He was an [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian subject]] born in [[Oltenia]] ("Lesser Wallachia").&lt;ref&gt;This place is given by [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;id=Mbh5AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ferenc+jozsef+debaly&amp;q=debaly&amp;pgis=1 ''Magyar múlt Dél-Amerikában, 1519-1900''] by László Szabó (Európa, 1982), quoting from Debali's emigration document. This seems to be a Hungarian name of a place that lies now in [[Romania]] and is known by a Romanian name. The Hungarian original gives "Oláhország" as the administrative region in which this place is located. Oláhország is nowadays often used in Hungarian synonymously with "Havasalföld", meaning [[Wallachia]]. 

Havasalföld means "Snowy Mountains" ([[Muntenia]]), and Oláhország means "Land near the Olt river" (Oltenia), the two regions which make up [[Wallachia]]. It has been suggested to identify "Kinséen" as either [[Chinteni]], which has a similar pronunciation, but lies in [[Transylvania]], the region which lies north of Oltenia; or [[Câineni]], [[Vâlcea County]], which actually lies in Oltenia; but no source confirming either of these places has been found yet. Many other sources state "Kinnen" or "Kineen" as birthplace which seems to be an approximate Hungarian phonetic transcription of the Romanian name of Câineni.&lt;/ref&gt;

He played the [[oboe]]. In 1820, he went abroad to pursue his musical career in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. There, in [[Alessandria]], he married Magdalena Bagnasco, from [[Genoa]]. They had several children, some of which were born in Uruguay. After a short stay at [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], from which he departed due to a [[yellow fever]] epidemic, he arrived in Uruguay in 1838. Here he was the director of the orchestra at the ''Sala de Comedias'' in [[Montevideo]] from 1841-48.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

===National Anthem of Uruguay===
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2016}}
In 1845 he composed what would be adopted three years later as the Uruguayan national anthem, to a text by [[Francisco Acuña de Figueroa]]. It was played for the first time in public on July 19, 1845. [[Fernando Quijano]], his assistant, who had submitted the composition to the government's selecting contest, was credited with the authorship because of Debali's failure to grasp the content, in the Spanish language, of the governmental decree that adopted his composition as the country's anthem.

'''''GTR 2 – FIA GT Racing Game''''' is a [[sports car racing|sports car]] [[sim racing|racing simulator]] developed by [[Blimey! Games]] and SimBin Studios (later [[Sector3 Studios]]) for the [[x86]] PC and is a sequel to ''[[GTR – FIA GT Racing Game|GTR]]''. Since its release in September 2006, it has received widespread acclaim. The game simulates the [[2003 FIA GT Championship season|2003]] and [[2004 FIA GT Championship season|2004]] [[FIA GT Championship]] racing series.

==Modding==
One of the reasons ''GTR 2'' has been so popular is the ability to create custom content for the game. This has led to a large community of players who create new vehicles and tracks to race with.

==Reception==
*[[IGN]]'s award for Best PC Racing Game of 2006.
*[[GameSpot]]'s award for Best Driving Game of 2006 as well as the Best Game Nobody Played of 2006.
*[[GameSpy]] rated it the 9th best PC game of 2006.

The editors of ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' presented ''GTR 2'' with their 2006 "Best Simulation" award. It was a runner-up for their list of the year's top 10 computer games.&lt;ref name=cgm16th&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=The Best (and Worst) of 2006; The 16th Annual ''Computer Games'' Awards |date=March 2007 | issue=195 | pages=46-51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s 2006 "Best Racing Game" award.&lt;ref name=pcg2006&gt;{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617172734/http://www.futureus-inc.com/archives/2007/02/the_13th_annual_1.php | url=http://www.futureus-inc.com/archives/2007/02/the_13th_annual_1.php | archivedate=June 17, 2007 | deadurl=no | title=The 13th Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards Reveals The Best Of The Best For 2006 | date=February 2, 2007 | location=South San Francisco, California | publisher=[[Future US]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG), under development by [[Bigpoint]] and Artplant, in collaboration with [[HBO]].&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigpoint.net/2012/02/bigpoint-presents-game-of-thrones-mmorpg-at-game-developers-conference/ |title=Bigpoint presents Game of Thrones MMORPG at Game Developers Conference |publisher=Bigpoint |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017035720/http://bigpoint.net/2012/02/bigpoint-presents-game-of-thrones-mmorpg-at-game-developers-conference/ |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is based on the HBO TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', which is itself an adaptation of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' book series by [[George R. R. Martin]].

The game is built using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] platform, and will be playable in the browser using the Unity Web Player plugin.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms'' is set within the fictional realm of Westeros,&lt;ref name="pressrelease" /&gt; and will use a third-person viewpoint. Gameplay will mainly be based around player vs player (PvP) combat, which will involve small group combat, one on one duels and siege battles, large scale battles in which players must capture keeps, forts and castles.&lt;ref name="mmorpg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/790/feature/6418/Game-of-Thrones-Interview-with-Max-Pfaff.html |title=Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms (GoT) Interviews: Interview with Max Pfaff |publisher=MMORPG.com |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Player vs Environment (PvE) combat will be available at launch, although this is not a major priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/game_of_thrones_from_novel_to_tv_series_to_mmo.html |title=Game of Thrones: From novel to TV series to MMO |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat will be realtime, with movement controlled using the WASD keys.&lt;ref name="massively"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/03/09/gdc-2012-bigpoint-discusses-the-game-of-thrones-mmo/ |title=GDC 2012: Bigpoint discusses the Game of Thrones MMO &amp;#124; Massively |publisher=Massively.joystiq.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players will be able to come together to form guilds, known as lesser houses. Lesser houses align themselves with one of the three major houses in-game: Baratheon, Stark or Lannister.&lt;ref name="massively" /&gt; Solo play will be possible, although group play will be encouraged.

Players will be able to customize their characters by changing features such as hair and clothing.&lt;ref name="massively" /&gt;

==Development==
''Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms'' was announced in February 2012, with the first look being unveiled at the [[Game Developers Conference]] in March 2012.&lt;ref name="pressrelease" /&gt; The first gameplay footage was shown in a trailer released on July 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="trailer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11EVQcCsEbE&amp;list=UUb7zo |title=Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms MMO Official Trailer &amp;#124; Bigpoint HBO 2012 |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-07-12 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is under development by German videogame developer [[Bigpoint]], and Norwegian developer Artplant. The studios have previously worked together on [[Battlestar Galactica Online]], another browser based multiplayer game.

The game is being made in collaboration with [[HBO]]. Everything put in game is reviewed by HBO in advance, and Bigpoint is working with the HBO design teams. The look and feel of the weapons and armour, for example, are straight from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/790/feature/6167/Game-of-Thrones-GDC-2012-Game-of-Thrones-Goes-Sandbox-Warfare.html |title=Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms (GoT) Previews: GDC 2012: Game of Thrones Goes Sandbox Warfare |publisher=MMORPG.com |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is being built on the Unity platform.

[[File:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Clemens, American humorist who wrote under the pen name [[Mark Twain]]]]
A '''humorist''' is an [[intellectual]] who uses [[humor]] in writing or public speaking. Humorists are distinct from [[comedian]]s, who are [[show business]] entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh, though some persons have occupied both roles in the course of their careers.

==The iconic humorist==
[[Mark Twain]], pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens (1835–1910) was called the "greatest humorist this country has produced" in his ''New York Times'' obituary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0421.html |title=Obituary (New York Times) |accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Faulkner]] called him "the father of [[American literature]]".&lt;ref name="faulkner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelliffe |first=Robert A. |title=Faulkner at Nagano |year=1956 |publisher=Kenkyusha, Ltd |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States national cultural center, the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], has chosen to award a [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] annually since 1998 to individuals who have "had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain".&lt;ref name="kennedy-center1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/marktwain/ |title=The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |publisher=Kennedy-center.org |accessdate =2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from a comedian==
[[Humor]] is the quality which makes experiences provoke laughter or amusement, while [[comedy]] is a [[performing art]]. The nineteenth century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] lamented the misuse of ''humor'' (a German [[loanword]] from English) to mean any type of comedy. A humorist is adept at seeing the humor in a situation or aspect of life and relating it, usually through a story; the [[comedian]], on the other hand, concentrates on jokes designed to invoke instantaneous laughter. The humorist is primarily a writer of books, newspaper or magazine articles or [[columnist|columns]], [[play (theatre)|stage]] or [[screenplay|screen]] plays, and may occasionally appear before an audience to deliver a lecture or read a piece of his or her work. The comedian always performs his or her work for an audience, either in live performance, audio recording, radio, television, or film.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;{{cite web|last=Study.com|title=Humorist vs Comedian: What is the Difference?|url=https://study.com/articles/humorist_vs_comedian_what_is_the_difference.html|website=Study.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Study.com'', a humorist job requires a bachelor's degree, and according to US Bureau of Labor statistics, earns a 2016 median salary of US$29.44. This is compared to the comedian, which requires a high school diploma and earns a median salary of $17.34.&lt;ref name=SC/&gt;

[[Phil Austin]], of the comedy group [[the Firesign Theatre]], expressed his thoughts about the difference in 1993 liner notes to the ''[[Fighting Clowns]]'' allbum:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fighting Clowns |title-link= |year=1993 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |access-date=February 9, 2018 |first=Phil |last=Austin |author-link=Phil Austin |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=''Clowns'' was the key word because clowning was what I thought had become our collective fate. I had once entertained higher ambitions for us, needless to say, although clowning is certainly a wonderful thing, unless you are a clown in which case it's a job.&lt;br&gt;
To me, there is a great difference between a humorist and a clown, and I had hoped that life for the Firesign Theatre would have led more toward the world of Mark Twain than the world of Beepo. The humorist is a happy soul; he comments from the sidelines of life, safe behind the keyboard or pen; not forced to mold his thinking to the direct response of an audience, he has indirection on his side. He has time to think. Beepo, on the other hand, takes his chances directly facing—or mooning—the audience; a buffoon, a patsy, a performer, he is out in the open and his audience, unlike a humorist's, becomes necessarily half-friend and half-enemy.}}

===Comedians who become humorists===
Sometimes a comedian will adopt a writing career and gain notability as a humorist. Some examples are:

[[Will Rogers]] (1879–1935) was a [[vaudeville]] comedian who started doing humorous political and social commentary, and became a famous newspaper columnist and radio personality during the [[Great Depression]]. He is an exception to the education rule, as he only completed a [[tenth grade#United States|tenth grade]] education.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news| title =Adventure Marked Life of Humorist| work =[[The New York Times]]| publisher =| date =August 17, 1935| url =https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1104.html| accessdate =July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garry Moore]] (1915–1993), known as a television comedian who hosted several [[variety show|variety]] and [[game show]]s, after his 1977 retirement became a regular humor columnist for the newspaper ''[[The Island Packet]]'' of [[Northeast Harbor, Maine]], with a column titled "Mumble, Mumble". He later released a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s. 

[[Victor Borge]] (1909–2000) was a Danish-American comedian known for bringing humor to [[classical music]]. He wrote three books, ''My Favorite Intermissions''&lt;ref name="BorgeSherman1971"&gt;{{cite book

[[Peter Ustinov]] (1921–2004) was an English comic actor who wrote several humorous plays and film scripts.

[[Woody Allen]] (born 1935), known as a comedian and filmmaker, early in his career worked as a staff writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]].&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-2,00.html |title=Woody Allen: Rabbit Running |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 3, 1972 |accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

[[Steve Martin]] (born 1945), comedian and actor, wrote ''[[Cruel Shoes]]'', a book of humorous essays and short stories, in 1977 (published 1979). He wrote his first humorous play ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]'' in 1993, and wrote various pieces in ''The New Yorker'' magazine in the 1990s. He later wrote more humorous plays and two novellas.
  
[[Hugh Laurie]] (born 1959) is an English comic actor who worked for many years in partnership with [[Stephen Fry]]. He is a fan of the English humorist [[P. G. Wodehouse]], and has written a Wodehouse-style novel.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hugh Laurie|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013111/|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|credits=Host: James Lipton|network=Bravo|airdate=31 July 2006|season=12|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark Twain prize===
Despite the name, conference of the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize does not make the awardee a humorist. {{Asof|2017}}, the center has chosen to confer the prize on nineteen comedians and one playwright;&lt;ref name="kennedy-center1"/&gt; only two recipients, the comedian Steve Martin and the playwright [[Neil Simon]], are commonly recognized as humorists in the sense of Twain.

===American===
&lt;!-- It's probably best to order these chronologically ? --&gt;
Renowned [[polymath]] [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790), as a newspaper editor and printer, became one of America's first humorists, most famously for ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' published under the pen name "Richard Saunders". 

[[Ring Lardner]] (1885–1933) was a sports columnist and [[short story]] writer best known for his [[satirical]] writings about [[sport]]s, [[marriage]], and the [[theatre]].

'''Ini3 Digital''' is an online game service provider based in Thailand. Established in 2004, it is the first Thai company to utilize the [[Free-to-play]] model and the first to import Web-browser based games into the Thai game industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.ini3.co.th/#about&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ini3 Digital started servicing Fly for Fun, a.k.a. [[Flyff]], developed by Aeon Soft from South Korea. The slogan used for the game was “we want to see Thais fly” because [[Flyff]] is an [[MMORPG]] game where the in-game characters can fly. As the first service provider to use the “Free to Play” model, Ini3 also launched “[[Pangya]]” in the same year. [[Pangya]] is a Casual golf fantasy game, developed by Hanbitsoft from South Korea. 
From the success of servicing [[Pangya]], Ini3 has launched more than 30 online games up to date with more than 17 million registered users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Julian Eltinge''' (May 14, 1881 &amp;ndash; March 7, 1941), born '''William Julian Dalton''', was an American [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and film [[actor]] and [[female impersonator]]. After appearing in the [[Boston]] Cadets Revue at the age of ten in feminine garb, Eltinge garnered notice from other [[Theatrical producer|producers]] and made his first appearance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1904. As his star began to rise, he appeared in [[vaudeville]] and toured Europe and the [[United States]], even giving a [[Royal Variety Performance|command performance]] before King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. Eltinge appeared in a series of [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]] written specifically for his talents starting in 1910 with ''[[The Fascinating Widow]]'', returning to vaudeville in 1918. His popularity soon earned him the moniker "Mr. [[Lillian Russell]]" for the popular [[beauty]] and musical comedy star.

[[Hollywood]] beckoned Eltinge and in 1917 he appeared in his first [[feature film]], ''[[The Countess Charming]]''. This led to other films, including 1918's ''[[The Isle of Love]]'' with [[Rudolph Valentino]] and [[Virginia Rappe]]. By the time Eltinge arrived in Hollywood, he was considered one of the highest paid actors on the [[Theater of the United States|American stage]]; but with the arrival of the [[Great Depression]] and the death of vaudeville, Eltinge's star began to fade. He continued his show in nightclubs but found little success. He died in 1941 following a show at a [[New York City]] [[nightclub]]. He leaves a legacy as one of the greatest female impersonators of the 20th century.

==Early years==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Though the details of his professional life are widely known, Eltinge's personal life is shrouded in mystery; mystery partly due to the passage of time, but really more likely to Eltinge's own hand. Eltinge was born in [[Newtonville, Massachusetts]] to Julia Edna Baker and Joseph Dalton.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Stars of the American Stage; A Pictorial Record'' Profile#70 by Daniel Blum c. 1952 (this second edition c. 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in [[Butte, Montana]]. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women's clothing and performed in the rugged saloons patronized by ranchers and miners. Upon discovering this in 1899, his father beat him and his mother sent him back to Boston, where the 17-year-old worked in dry goods as a salesman while studying dance.

The early film star Pauline Frederick tells how she and Eltinge (she knew him by his real name of Bill) were childhood friends, playing 'boats' (in fact chips of wood) in the creek that bordered their properties in Madrid, New York State. Indeed she claims that when at boarding school in Boston she met up with Eltinge, who was already making a name for himself on the vaudeville stage. He dared her to apply to apply to one of the music halls, which was the start of her career on stage and in films.&lt;ref&gt;(The Red Letter, April 17, 1920, p.332){{Better source|reason=Give a way for us to find this source, whatever it is. Thanks.|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His start in [[show business]], like his early life, is also shrouded in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having been at the age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the [[Tremont Theatre, Boston (1889)|Tremont Theater]] in [[Boston]]. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to how he came to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking [[cakewalk]] lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.
[[File:Julian-Eltinge-Fascinating-Widow.jpg|left|thumb|Eltinge in ''The Fascinating Widow'' (1911)]]

==Broadway and vaudeville==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Eltinge's first appearance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was in the [[musical comedy]] ''Mr. Wix of Wickham'' which opened September 19, 1904 at the Bijou Theatre in [[New York City]]. The show was produced by [[E. E. Rice]] and included music by [[Jerome Kern]] among others.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

During this time Eltinge began performing in [[vaudeville]]. Unlike many of the female impersonation acts that existed at that time, like [[Bert Savoy]], Eltinge did not present a caricature of women but presented the illusion of actually being a woman. He toured simply as "Eltinge" which left his [[sex]] unknown and his act included singing, dancing and quick costume changes in a variety of female roles, including a [[Gibson Girl]]-like role called "The Sampson Girl". At the conclusion of his performances, he would remove his [[Wig (hair)|wig]], revealing his true nature to the surprise of the often unknowing audience.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1906 Eltinge made his [[London]] debut at the Palace Theater. While in [[London]], Eltinge gave a performance for [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], who later presented him with a white [[bulldog]]. The next year, Eltinge made his New York debut at the Alhambra Theater to critical acclaim. From 1908-09, he toured with Cohan and Harris [[minstrel show|Minstrels]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Eltinge's star began to shine on Broadway and on national tours and his name became known worldwide. Indeed, women were so enthralled by his performances that he established the ''Eltinge [[Magazine]]'' which advised women on beauty, fashion, and home tips.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By 1910, Eltinge had reached the height of his fame. Sime Silverman, Editor of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', called him "as great a performer as there is today".&lt;ref&gt;Variety, April 1, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Fascinating Widow'' and beyond==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Julian Eltinge (the fascinating widow).jpg|upright|thumb|Another picture from ''The Fascinating Widow'']]
In 1911, Eltinge opened one of his most famous shows, ''The Fascinating Widow'' at New York's Liberty Theater. In it he played Hal Blake who disguises himself as "Mrs. Monte" in a ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''-like plot. The show only ran 56 performances in New York, but toured the nation successfully for several years.

The success of this show led producer [[A. H. Woods]] to give Eltinge one of theatre's highest honors, having a theatre named for him. A year to the day that ''The Fascinating Widow'' opened, Woods opened the [[Eltinge Theatre]] on New York's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] designed by noted theater [[architect]] [[Thomas W. Lamb]]. Eltinge himself never performed in his namesake building.  After serving as a legitimate theater for many years, it became a notorious [[American burlesque|burlesque]] house and was shut down during a "public morality" campaign in 1943, before becoming a [[movie theater|cinema]] the next year. The theater is now part of the AMC Empire 25 cineplex having been lifted and moved in its entirety down the block from its original location.

Following on the success of ''The Fascinating Widow'', Eltinge performed in two other comedies that had similar success, ''[[The Crinoline Girl]]'' which opened in 1914 and ''Cousin Lucy'' (with music by Kern) the next year.

==Hollywood and film career==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Julian Eltinge 1917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Advertisement (1917)]]
As many actors began to leave for the [[silver screen]], Eltinge followed and in 1914 he starred in [[silent film|silent picture]] versions of ''The Crinoline Girl'' followed by ''Cousin Lucy'' the next year. According to Anthony Slide's ''The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville'', he also had a [[cameo role]] in a film entitled ''How Molly Malone Made Good'' in 1915. Eltinge's first real screen success came in 1917 in ''The Countess Charming''. His role in the film was again a double role with him playing both a male and said male in female garb.

Settling in [[Hollywood]], Eltinge made three [[film]]s in 1917 and also in 1918. During this time he wrote and produced a vaudeville group called "The Julian Eltinge Players". With this group he returned triumphantly to the vaudeville stage appearing at New York's [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in 1918, where he was paid one of the highest salaries in show business: $3,500 a week. The next year he returned again in a new vaudeville review with sets by the [[France|French]] designer [[Romain de Tirtoff|Erté]].

By 1920, Eltinge was very wealthy and was living in one of the most lavish mansions in [[Southern California]], ''Villa Capistrano''. His star began to shine even brighter after his appearance with [[Rudolf Valentino]] in the 1920 film ''An Adventuress'' (released as ''[[The Isle of Love]]'' in the U.S.). After filming, Eltinge continued touring onstage and did so until 1927. He also made two films, ''[[Madame Behave]]'' and ''The Fascinating Widow'', in 1925.

==Personal life==
[[File:Julian Eltinge and wife.jpg|right|thumb|Eltinge and a woman he identified to the photographer as his wife, during a trip to Japan. The vaudeville actress Laurette Bullivant Frye]]
Aside from the graceful femininity he exhibited onstage, Eltinge used a super-masculine facade in public to combat the rumours of his [[homosexuality]]. This facade included the occasional bar-fight, smoking cigars, and drawn out engagements to women (though he never married). He was also known to physically attack [[stagehand]]s, members of the audience and others who remarked on his sexuality. Indeed, his sexual duality led to Dorothy Parker's creation of the term "ambisextrous" to describe him.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Parker, ''Complete Poems'' (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), pg. 206&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Eltinge may have been a gay man,&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Faderman and Stuart Timmons, ''Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians'', Basic Books: New York, 2006, p. 19&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Milton Berle]] and many others who worked with him believed. Actress [[Ruth Gordon]] stated in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article that he was "as virile as anybody virile." There is no existing record of a lover of either sex, though stories did abound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

According to one such story recorded by Robert Toll in his book ''On With the Show!'' (1976), he gave a photograph of himself as [[Salome|Salomé]], signed "From your friend Jule", to a Boston [[sportswriter]]. When the sportswriter's wife discovered the photograph in her husband's coat pocket she was outraged. Confronting her husband, she had to be convinced that the "woman" in the photograph was actually a man, and then was disturbed to find that her husband had been spending time with him.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Later years and death==
{{one source|section|date=January 2018}}
Eltinge was one of many show business figures to be hit hard by the 1929 stock market crash. By the 1930s, the female impersonations that he had built his career on had begun to lose popularity, as did vaudeville in general. He had grown portly and unable to portray the svelte young female roles of his heyday. Eltinge resorted to performing in [[nightclub]]s.

Crackdowns on cross-dressing in public, a misguided attempt to curb homosexual activity, prevented Eltinge from performing in costume. At one appearance in a [[Los Angeles]] club, Eltinge stood next to displays of his gowns while describing his old characters.

On February 25, 1941, Eltinge fell ill while performing at [[Billy Rose]]'s [[Diamond Horseshoe]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;Louisville Courier-Journal, March 8, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken home and died in his apartment ten days later on March 7. His death certificate lists the cause of death as a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

==In popular culture==
{{or-section|date=April 2017}}
A reference to Julian Eltinge is found in [[Buster Keaton]]'s comedy ''[[Seven Chances]]'' (1925). In the film, Keaton's character must marry before 7:00 PM in order to receive a large inheritance.  After many failed attempts to find an instant bride, he sees a poster with a woman's photo outside a performance hall and, in an act of desperation, enters to ask for her hand in marriage.  While Keaton is inside, a stagehand removes some boxes to reveal the woman's name on the poster: Julian Eltinge.  Keaton then emerges from the theater with a black eye and his boater hat smashed down over his head.

[[File:A FUNTORO MOD system in bus.jpg|thumb|FUNTORO MOD system in bus]]
'''Media on demand'''(MOD) is a new generation of [[Video on demand|Video on demand(VOD]]), which not only allows users to watch/listen video and audio content like movies and TV shows, but also provides functions including real-time information,interactive games, attractions guidance, route information, advertising system, shopping &amp; ordering service etc.Users can select content whenever they want, rather than having to watch it at a specific broadcast time.

In transportation industry MOD technology was first applied by [[FUNTORO]], which offer MOD as [[In-Vehicle Infotainment|in vehicle infotainment]] to bus &amp; railway passengers through high-definition interactive monitors embedded in seatback or armrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computex.biz/computex2011_en/SourcingGuide_Detail.aspx?index=35431|title=COMPUTEX 2011 News Center|website=www.computex.biz|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/2009/03/multimedia-on-demand-system/|title=Multimedia On Demand System|work=Ubergizmo|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://railwaymod.com/railway-mod-empowers-india-railway/|title=FUNTORO Railway MOD &amp; India Government Build Up High-Tech Train - Railway MOD|date=2018-03-19|work=Railway MOD|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some telecommunication companies offer MOD service by transmitting digital signal to [[set-top box]] that is connected to television screen or another display devices of individual homes and users. Clients are required to pay a monthly fee to get access to a bundle of multimedia content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sogi.com.tw/talks/_%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1_%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E9%9B%BBMOD_%E8%A1%9D%E6%93%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%B7%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E6%A5%AD/4071035|title=【經濟日報】中華電MOD 衝擊有線電視業- SOGI手機王|website=SOGI手機王|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Menza''' (July 23, 1964 – May 21, 2016) was an American musician best known as the former drummer for American thrash metal band [[Megadeth]] from 1989-1998 and again in 2004 as well as one final return in 2014. He recorded drums on four of Megadeth's albums: ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' (1990), ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' (1992), ''[[Youthanasia]]'' (1994) and ''[[Cryptic Writings]]'' (1997).

==Early life==
Menza was born in Munich as his father, jazz musician [[Don Menza]], was stationed with the U.S. Army in Germany at the time.  Menza began playing drums at the age of two, at which age he performed at his first public concert when during the intermission someone sat him down on [[Jack DeJohnette]]'s drums and he proceeded to play. His influences stem from being nurtured around the tutelage of such notables as [[Buddy Rich]], [[Steve Gadd]], [[Nick Ceroli]], [[Jeff Porcaro]] and [[Louie Bellson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Menza |url=http://dvd-copy.com/people/Nick-Menza/1269458/bio.htm |title=Nick Menza Biography of {Nick Menza} Bio, Biography – began playing drums public performance age, Father famed |publisher=Dvd-copy.com |date=July 23, 1964 |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322145911/http://dvd-copy.com/people/Nick-Menza/1269458/bio.htm |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning his professional musical career at the age of 18 drumming in the band Rhoads featuring singer Kelle Rhoads, brother of the late [[Randy Rhoads]], Nick released his first record with Rhoads, titled ''Into the Future'', in Europe in 1986.

Following Rhoads, Menza was part of a succession of L.A. metal bands, including The Green (with Rhoads bandmates John Goodwin on guitar and Darwin Ballard on bass), Von Skeletor (another collaboration with Goodwin and Michael Guillory on guitars,Cam Daigneault on drums, and Menza handling lead vocals on the band's demo and self-released album, ''Injection of Death''), and Cold Fire (also featuring [[Warrior (band)|Warrior]] guitarist Joe Floyd) before joining Megadeth.

==Musical career==
Moving on to session playing including styles ranging from R&amp;B to [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[funk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], recording with the likes of [[John Fogerty]], Menza caught the attention of then [[Megadeth]] drummer [[Chuck Behler]] and became his tech. When Megadeth needed a drummer in 1989, Nick Menza was asked by [[Dave Mustaine]] to join the band. Mustaine noted that Menza previously filled in on drums when Behler was unable to. Menza first played live with Megadeth on May 12, 1988 in Bradford, England. This prior experience and personal relationship led to the invitation to join Megadeth for the 1990 recording ''[[Rust in Peace]]''.

For the next ten years, Menza became associated with Megadeth's "classic" period and also his [[Greg Voelker Rack System]]. This included a double-bass drum kit with the tom-toms mounted on a lower chrome rack and all cymbal crashes mounted on a higher rack, which was supported by two chrome bars behind the drummer. This was later adopted by Megadeth on 2004's [[The System Has Failed|Blackmail the Universe tour]], which featured a similar rack system.

During his stint in Megadeth, Menza also played drums on his bandmate [[Marty Friedman]]'s three solo albums, ''[[Scenes (album)|Scenes]]'' (1992), ''[[Introduction (Marty Friedman album)|Introduction]]'' (1994) and ''[[True Obsessions]]'' (1996).

By the summer of 1998, while the band was still touring in support of ''[[Cryptic Writings]]'', Menza was having knee problems and sought medical advice. He was informed he had a tumor, which was later found to be [[benign]], and had it removed. Rather than cancel any dates, Megadeth hired [[Jimmy DeGrasso]] as a temporary replacement. When the time came to record a follow-up album, Menza was not asked back and DeGrasso became the band's official drummer. Menza has said in several interviews that, while in the hospital recovering from knee surgery, he received a phone call from Mustaine that simply said "Your services are not needed anymore". After his departure, he began work on ''Menza: Life After Deth''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIIf03bGyAAC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=Anthony+Gallo+Suicidal+Tendencies#v=onepage&amp;q=Anthony%20Gallo%20Suicidal%20Tendencies&amp;f=false |title=New Wave of American Heavy Metal – Google Books |publisher=|date= December 30, 2005|accessdate=August 9, 2011|isbn=9780958268400|author1=Sharpe-Young|first1=Garry}}&lt;/ref&gt; with guitarist [[Anthony Gallo]],&lt;ref name="tet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/nick+menza |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: NICK MENZA |publisher=Rockdetector.com |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115162615/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/nick+menza |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; bassist Jason Levin,&lt;ref name="tet" /&gt; and guitarist [[Ty Longley]].&lt;ref name="tet" /&gt; The album was initially intended to have a 2002 release date and tour to follow; however, on the tour in 2003 with the reformed Great White, Longley was among the 100 people killed in [[The Station nightclub fire]] in Rhode Island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newprophecy.net/more6.htm |title=Celebrity Deaths and Mishaps Archives 5 |publisher=Newprophecy.net |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later Jason Levin died of heart failure, Menza and Gallo were devastated and the ''Life After Deth'' tour was never announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/nick+menza |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: NICK MENZA |publisher=Rockdetector.com |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115162615/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/nick+menza |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest guitarist [[Christian Nesmith]], son of [[The Monkees]]' [[Michael Nesmith]], did some leads and Menza hired producer [[Max Norman]] ([[Ozzy Osbourne]], Megadeth).

Following the reissue of the entire Megadeth catalog, Menza was invited to reunite with Megadeth in 2004. Days after a reunion was announced Menza was fired after rehearsals and replaced with [[Shawn Drover]]. Dave Mustaine said that this was because Nick "just wasn't prepared" for a full-scale U.S. tour, physically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=29219 |title=MEGADETH's MUSTAINE Says NICK MENZA Wasn't Prepared To Tour with the Band |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514053445/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=29219 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Menza joined the Los Angeles-based metal band Orphaned to Hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=51017 |title=Former MEGADETH Drummer MENZA Resurfaces in ORPHANED TO HATRED |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716165956/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=51017 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group describe their sound as "a continuation of the heavy style of '90s [[Pantera]]". He left the band in late 2010.

Menza nearly suffered the loss of an arm in 2007, after having an accident with a power saw. He required reconstructive surgery and metal plates in his arm and a lengthy rehabilitation, but later recovered. Menza later auctioned off the blood-stained saw blade and an original copy of an X-ray from the incident.&lt;ref name=Saw&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Megadeth Drummer Auctioning Blood-Stained Saw Blade That Nearly Ended His Career|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-megadeth-drummer-auctioning-blood-stained-saw-blade-that-nearly-ended-his-career/|work=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Menza appeared in a music video for Mindstreem's "We Up Next", a song originally written by [[SIN 34]] guitarist [[Anthony Gallo]] featuring Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne, Jr. on vocals. The actual recording is Menza (drums), Gallo (guitars), Gregg Babuccio (bass), and Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne, Jr. (vocals).

Also in March 2011, Menza's band Deltanaut posted a video for the song "Sacrifice"[https://vimeo.com/21186049] in conjunction with the release of their [[Roy Z]] produced digital-only 5-song EP.  The line-up consisted of Menza, his old Rhoads and The Green bandmate, bassist Darwin Ballard, guitarists Christopher Grady and Colin Reid, and lead vocalist Brian Williams. Menza's father, [[Don Menza]] who famously played tenor sax on ''[[The Pink Panther Theme]]'' with the [[Henry Mancini]] Orchestra, plays saxophone on the song "The King"; other guests include Roy Z on guitar and Ed Roth on keyboards.

In 2015, Menza contributed drum tracks to the song "Are We Alone?" on the album ''Warless Society (The Global Invasion)'' by Ci2i, with John Goodwin and Darwin Ballard on guitar and bass, respectively. In 2015 he also began working with Los Angeles band Sweet Eve on their follow up album "The Immortal Machine" as producer and drummer.

==Death==
On May 21, 2016, Menza was performing with his band, [[OHM (band)|OHM]], at [[The Baked Potato]] jazz club in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], CA.  Only three songs into the set, Menza collapsed onstage.  He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.  An autopsy later showed the cause of death to be [[congestive heart failure]].  Menza was 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former MEGADETH Drummer NICK MENZA Dies At 51|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-megadeth-drummer-nick-menza-dies-at-51/|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thenortheasttoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenortheasttoday.com/former-megadeth-drummer-nick-menza-dies-at-the-age-of-51/ |title=Former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza dies at the age 51.

The business was founded 1972 by [[Leif Aage Hagen]] in [[Norway]] as a mail order business selling adult magazines, toys and films. From 1976 the company published Rapport 76 (later called Aktuell Rapport). The business was founded as a public company, Scandinavian Publishing Group A/S in [[Denmark]] in 1985 &lt;ref&gt;http://cvr.dk/Site/Forms/PublicService/DisplayCompany.aspx?cvrnr=78800712&lt;/ref&gt;
and went on to produce magazines covering sex and erotica, cars, rock music, softcore entertainment, home furnishing and design. In the late 1980s Leif Aage Hagen sold of the company but remained as chairman of the board. By the late 1990s the focus was concentrated on pure erotica and pornography content alone. In 2007 the company was sold to two employees, CEO Danish [[Lau Laursen]] and Anders Brodin and a third person, a private investor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.no/forsiden/etterBors/article1087906.ece&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flashback.info/showthread.php?t=676183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
By 2009 the company has businesses and subsidiaries with production in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands and claims to 60 employees with a turnover of more than 20 million Euros and to have sold about 140 million magazines and books - and produced more than 250 movies with erotic content.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naegroup.eu/economy_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The company currently

[[Human trafficking]],&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; [[child prostitution]]&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; and [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; are problems in the country.

==Overview==
Prostitution takes place all over the country, particularly in border areas, transport corridors, [[Walvis Bay]] and the capital [[Windhoek]].&lt;ref name="nid" /&gt; Most prostitutes are Namibian, but there are also a significant number from [[Zambia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Angola]].&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; Most women work independently and few have [[pimps]].&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt;

Most prostitutes in [[Namibia]] meet their clients either on the [[Street prostitution|street]] or in bars.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt; Bars often have a room on the premises for the prostitutes to use, and brothels usually have a bar, so the line between a bar and a brothel is often blurred.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; Some, more up-market, sex workers are contacted by cell phone or the internet and work in high-end clubs and hotels.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt;

Many clients are reluctant to use [[condoms]], and offer to pay more for unprotected sex.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; Condoms may be difficult to obtain at times, and can be confiscated by police and used as evidence of prostitution.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt;

Sex workers and [[NGO]]s report abuse and violence against them by clients and police.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; Extortion and forced sex by the police is also reported.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt;

Child prostitution is a problem, particularly in Walvis Bay and Windhoek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen prostitutes have few options|url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=16740&amp;page=archive-read|website=The Namibian|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en|date=2005-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===German Rule===
In 1899, regulations around brothels using white prostitutes were drawn up in [[Swakopmund]]. This allowed the authorities to monitor the sexual health of the prostitutes and was designed to control the spread of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]]. Colonial authorities believed unregulated African prostitutes were the main source of STIs. Other towns subsequently introduced similar regulations, including [[Okahandja]], [[Karibib]], [[Windhoek]], [[Keetmanshoop]], [[Luderitz]], [[Tsumeb]] and [[Seeheim]]. The use of white prostitutes was encourage to try and prevent relationships between white men and African women. There is evidence that some of the white prostitutes had been trafficked into the country.&lt;ref name="assist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whose body is it?: commercial sex work and the law in Namibia|url=http://www.lac.org.na/projects/grap/Pdf/commsex.pdf|publisher=Legal Assistance Centre (Namibia)|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Herero Wars]], the German military set up a brothel in Windhoek for their troops. Although some indigenous women volunteered to work in the brothel, others were forced to work there.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

Although white men seeing African prostitutes was discouraged, it was tolerated throughout this era.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

===South African Rule===
Prostitution was not made illegal, but the ''Undesirables Removal Proclamation'' (1920) was used to expel most of the white prostitutes and brothel keepers back to Germany. Also introduced in 1920 was the ''Police Offences Proclamation'', which criminalised loitering and solicitation for the purpose of prostitution. There were concerns about child prostitution, and in 1921 the ''Girls' and Mentally Defective Women's Protection Proclamation'' was introduced which set the age of consent at 16.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt; 

Prostitution was blamed by the authorities for African women migration to the cities from rural areas. A new regulation was introduced in 1938 requiring all "native females" in Windhoek between 18 and 60, unless legally married and living with their husbands, to undergo a medical examination every 6 months. After violent protests in March 1939 the regulation was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
The ''Combating of Immoral Practices Act (Act 21 of 1980)'' is the main piece of legislation controlling prostitution in Namibia. The main provisions are the prohibiting of mainly third party involvement:
* to solicit in a public street or place&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to exhibit oneself in an indecent dress or manner in public view&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to commit “any immoral act” with another person in public (but not in private)&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to keep a brothel&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to “procure” any female to have unlawful carnal intercourse with another person, to become a prostitute, or to “become an inmate of a brothel”&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to entice a female to a brothel for the purpose of prostitution&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to knowingly live wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to assist in bringing about “the commission by any person of any immoral act with another person”&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;
* to detain a female against her will in a brothel&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

Windhoek has Municipal Street and Traffic Regulations which prohibit loitering and soliciting.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

In case law it has been established that a prostitute working on her own in a house is not keeping a brothel, and that living on the earnings of prostitution does not apply to the prostitute themselves.&lt;ref name="assist" /&gt;

Public order offences are also used against sex workers.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

===Legalisation discussion===
A number of prominent groups have called for the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution. In 2008, the [[Legal Assistance Centre]], a [[Windhoek]]-based non-profit [[human rights]] organisation, called for the [[decriminalization of prostitution]] as a means of cutting the country's high HIV-AIDS rate as well as a means for maintaining the human rights of the prostitute themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tjaronda|first1=Wezi|title=Namibia: Sex Work Debate Continues|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200807150285.html|website=New Era (Windhoek)|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rights not Rescue, a sex workers organisation is amongst those calling for decriminalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kathindi|first1=Andreas|title=Sex work, a human rights conundrum|url=https://www.thevillager.com.na/articles/5962/Sex-work--a-human-rights-conundrum/|website=The Villager|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups in Namibia actively oppose legalization and instead focus on providing skills to former sex workers. Some groups approach the issue from a religious perspective, arguing that Namibia's population is overwhelmingly [[Christianity|Christian]] and therefore should not accept what they consider an immoral profession.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tjatindi|first1=Charlie|title=Why legalising prostitution is not the answer in Namibia|url=http://www.africareview.com/analysis/979190-1038636-iepvu7/index.html|website=Africa Review|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en-UK|date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions in [[Parliament of Namibia|Parliament]] are usually controversial. An outspoken proponent of legalisation is [[Kazenambo Kazenambo]], until 2015 Minister of Youth.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;

==HIV==
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Namibia}}
HIV/AIDS in Namibia is a critical [[public health]] issue. The prevalence of HIV in Namibia is among the highest in the world. Since 1996, HIV has been the leading cause of death in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namchild.gov.na/library.php?po=186 |title=Namibian DHS 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234543/http://www.namchild.gov.na/library.php?po=186 |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }} National Demographic Health Survey, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are a high risk group. Some sources put the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers as high as 70%.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt; Reluctance to use condoms, lack of sexual health education and limited access to healthcare are cited as contributory factors.&lt;ref name="unaids1" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Namibia}}
Namibia is a source and destination country for children, and to a lesser extent women, subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Namibian children are subjected to sex trafficking in Windhoek and Walvis Bay. A 2015 media report alleged foreign [[sex tourism|sex tourists]] from southern Africa and Europe exploit child sex trafficking victims. In 2014, an NGO reported persons in prostitution, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, were taken aboard foreign vessels off the Namibian coast. Children from less affluent neighbouring countries may be subjected to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271249.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=12 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Namibia as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]] country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Sound Bites: Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand''' is a book written by [[Alex Kapranos]] from the band [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]. It was published on 2 November 2006.

In September 2005, whilst touring the world with Franz Ferdinand, Alex Kapranos had begun writing about what he ate in the various countries he had visited. The book concentrates heavily on where he eats and the people he eats with and the unusual flavours he tastes on the road. Much of the book is compiled from the column he had for ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonthesound.com/?p=525 Sound Bites - Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand » Sound On The Sound&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019112059/http://www.soundonthesound.com/?p=525 |date=19 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said,

{{Cquote|With my writing I literally wanted to give people a taste of what we had with my writing. There are a few things I wouldn't try again for example the raw sea urchin, that and bull testicles which I ate in Argentina, they were foul, the thought, the smell and the taste which was something like tuna on a bit of metal.&lt;ref name="YouTube - alex kapranos food news"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TedS2hrJDZE YouTube - alex kapranos food news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] food has advanced and one of the biggest advances I think is that we've stopped looking outside for inspiration, I think maybe ten years ago the idea of good food had to be from somewhere else, had to be from Spain or France or [[Italy]], whereas now we're realising we actually have some amazing stuff here.&lt;ref name="YouTube - alex kapranos food news"/&gt;}}

'''''St George''''' is a multi-award-winning television commercial for the British soft drink, Blackcurrant [[Tango (drink)|Tango]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.framestore-cfc.com/#/Commercials%20London/BlackcurrantTango,StGeorge "Blackcurrant Tango 'St. George'"].

The advertisement was Tango's biggest advertisement to date, and with most of its budget being spent on production as opposed to airtime, the advert only appeared on national television ten times, mostly in advert breaks during the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[TFI Friday]]''. This unusual scheduling idea was deemed groundbreaking. The advert won several major advertising awards in 1997, notably a Cannes Gold Lion and a Silver Pencil from [[D&amp;AD]] in London. It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kanner |first=Bernice |title=100 Best TV Commercials: And Why They Worked |publisher=Times Books |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular for its latent [[jingoism]] and the fact that it appears to have been filmed in one continuous shot.

The advert also saw the re-release of "[[Don't You Want Me (Felix song)|Don't You Want Me]]" by [[Felix (musician)|Felix]], which features in the advert, as a CD and cassette release, which also featured the Tango Blackcurrant logo. It reached number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Sequence==
''St George'' opens with Tango "spokesman", Ray Gardner,&lt;ref name="raygardner.net"/&gt; in his office in the headquarters of Tango. He appears to be doing a corporate video. He has a letter in his hand from a French exchange student, Sebastien Loyes, who is critical of new blackcurrant flavoured Tango. Ray addresses Sebastien's criticism in what begins as a mutual retort before slowly developing into a full-on rant. Ray walks forward, bumping into the camera before continuing his rant through the office. He is joined by some colleagues who follow him out into the car park where, now in full flow, he begins stripping off. Ray is joined by more staff who help him off with the rest of his clothes, revealing some bright purple boxing shorts under his trousers. Ray and his entourage arrive seamlessly on the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] where a flag waving army of supporters have gathered to cheer on their leader. The commercial is now fully widescreen and the action is accompanied by rousing anthemic dance music - "Don't You Want Me" by [[Felix (musician)|Felix]]. As they help him into some purple boxing gloves and place a purple cloak around his shoulders, Ray continues his rant against Sebastien. On the edge of the cliffs is a boxing ring which Ray climbs into, before challenging Sebastian, France, Europe and the world to a fight. In the sky behind him, three [[Harrier Jump Jet]]s appear and tilt menacingly.

==Production==

===Background and conception===
Since 1992, London-based off-kilter advertising agency [[HHCL]] + Partners (Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners) had created each advertisement for the different variants and flavours of Tango, owned by [[Britvic]], beginning with the controversial but acclaimed ''[[Orange Man (advertisement)|Orange Man]]'' advertisement for the orange flavour. Several of the agency's advertisements for the brand had proven controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adturds.co.uk/2015/03/30/tango-adverts-you-know-when-youve-been-tangod/ |title=Tango Adverts and Campaigns: Heroes Of AdTurds |date=30 March 2015 |work=adturds.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1994, the brand's ongoing "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPCDMIcjuA |title=Tango advert banned during kids TV for being too scary |author=mimechap |date=27 April 2008  |accessdate=12 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign had finished in 1995 when Tango focused on individual advertising for its different flavours.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Stephen |title=Free Gift Inside!!: Forget the Customer. Develop Marketease |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=Hoboken, New Jersey, USA |year=2003| page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each flavour was now being advertised with its own campaigns and distinct identities; advertisements for the Orange flavour were largely put on hold whilst Tango Apple advertisements involved imbibers' bizarre sexual fetishes for the product, Tango Lemon advertisements featured the product as the euphoric, ritualistic drink of a fictional cult worshipping their god, Jim, whilst advertisements for the "Still Tango" variant warned viewers that the variant was unofficial and that viewers should call a number given on screen, only for callers to be greeted with the news that it was a trick.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

When Tango Blackcurrant launched as the fourth official flavour of Tango in 1995–96, an advertisement for the flavour entitled ''Trade'' was created in which Britvic's National Sales Manager Nigel Harrison announces several promotional tie-ins, but which are then denounced by his colleague Sunhil Patel because "this stuff with sell itself anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhOeG-uTJxw |title=Tango Adverts '91-'97 |author=NessRobert |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it is disputed whether the advertisement was ever aired, and in early 1996, Tango began planning for their re-launch in July 1996 with a new logo; the planning included "re-launching" Tango Blackcurrant with a brand new advertisement, introducing not just the flavour's new logo but indeed widening knowledge of the flavour itself; the plan effectively rendered ''Trade'' a standalone advertisement.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishman.fr/the-making-of-blackcurrant-tango/ |first=Barth |last=Hulley |title=The making of Blackcurrant Tango |work=englishman.fr |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing their focus on instigating advertisements for flavours of Tango other than Orange, David Atter of Britvic re-hired HHLC + Partners to create the new Tango Blackcurrant advertisement.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The original plan was to create a commercial that was only 30 seconds long and was intended to be an attack on [[Coca-Cola]], who had dominated the soft drinks market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jun/15/how-we-made-you-know-youve-been-tango-orange-man-ad |title=How we Tango'd Britain with the Orange Man |first=Trevor |last=Robinson |date=15 June 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement soon evolved into the radically different ''St George'', which they planned as a 90-second advertisement–the longest Tango advertisement so far–which would not attack Coca-Cola but instead present the drink as very "British" and present another confrontational style of advertising the product. The decision to make the advertisement longer came from both Tango's desire to surprise its customers and because the only soft drink brand that could afford to do such a long commercial was Coca-Cola. Using a majority of the advertisement's budget on the production (rather than airtime) and only airing it 10 times was a risk that Tango believed was worth taking. HHCL hired television actor Ray Gardner to play a fictionalized version of himself in the advertisement, having worked with him previously when he played the character of Marshall in a 1995 HHCL-created advertisement for [[the Automobile Association]].&lt;ref name="raygardner.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raygardner.net/ |title=The Ray Gardner Official Website |work=raygardner.net |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
''St George'' was written by Chas Bayfield and Jim Bolton, directed by television drama director [[Colin Gregg]] and produced by production company Eclipse on a total campaign budget of £400,000, which remains the largest budget for a Tango advertisement to date.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1175631/3-great-ads-i-nothing-6-ben-tollett-emer-stamp-tango-lynx-nspcc |title=3 great ads I had nothing to do with #6: Ben Tollett &amp; Emer Stamp on Tango, Lynx and the NSPCC |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported the budget to be £500,000.&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; The commercial was filmed over only three days in April 1996.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt; The office section was shot in a new high rise development overlooking [[East Croydon]] railway station, the car park was in a business park in [[Welwyn Garden City]] and the White Cliffs filmed at [[St Margaret's at Cliffe]], [[Kent]]. Gregg explained that the White Cliffs were chosen as a filming location because "what more British location can you have than the White Cliffs of Dover?"&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; Ray's office and the White Cliffs were filmed first and the car park sequence was shot to link the two together. Ringcraft Boxing Ring Hire Specialists built the boxing ring used in the advertisement.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; The flag-wielding extras in Gardner's entourage recorded their chants separately on the same day in the same field.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; During production of ''St George'', Barth Hulley, who produced the advertisement, also duly shot and directed ''The Making of Blackcurrant Tango'', a fifteen-minute "making-of" video.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; Hulley's brief stated that the making-of video was required in order to be supplied to his client.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt;

The style of ''St George'' gradually changes from an amateurish [[corporate video]]-style piece into an epic, cinematic [[widescreen]] piece whilst Gardner is running towards the White Cliffs with his growing entourage.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt; There are several tricks in ''St George'' to give the illusion that it was filmed in one take; Gardner moves from a 20th storey office to the ground floor, then to the office car park and the White Cliffs, all apparently in one take. In fact, Gardner passes a white wall on leaving his office and his position is matched exactly against a white wall on the ground floor. Similarly, Gardner’s position as he passes a Tango truck in the car park had to be replicated exactly to match his actions as he passes the truck on the White Cliffs.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; The usage of music in the advertisement–an unfinished remix of [[Felix (musician)|Felix]]'s "[[Don't You Want Me (Felix song)|Don't You Want Me]]"–marked the first time since 1991, and the first time since HHCL began creating Tango advertisements, that a Tango commercial featured a musical soundtrack.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''St George'' was also the first Tango advertisement to use commercially available music since a 1988 commercial featuring "[[Apache (instrumental)|Apache]]" by [[The Shadows]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Framestore office exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Framestore CFC]] (''offices pictured'') provided computer generated effects.]]
There were several problems during production; Gardner needed to step out of his trousers as he leaves the building, something which needed nearly thirty takes to get right, and Gregg cancelled his idea for Gardner to start running after taking a sip of Tango Blackcurrant because it implies the drink has given him energy.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; Production was not helped by how the fact that on the first two days of filming, the weather was fine but on the third, it snowed. Due to health and safety regulations, the crew were not allowed to use real Harrier jets on the day–the planes were computer generated afterwards by the digital visual effects company, [[Framestore CFC]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Unlike many television advertisements, ''St George'' does not feature a slogan, nor indeed is the Tango logo ever superimposed on the screen in its final moments; however, ''St George'' is not free of Tango branding: The Tango offices depicted in ''St George'' suitingly features numerous staff members from Britvic, as well as several Tango branded items, such as the "Tango doll"–taken from a 1995 campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXntBj_hT8U |title=Tango - Doll (1995, UK)|first=|last=The Hall of Advertising |date=26 April 2012|publisher= |accessdate=12 July 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Tango Blackcurrant vending machine, a Still Tango poster and a Tango door sticker, whilst outside the offices is a Tango sign Tango Blackcurrant delivery lorry, and later on in the advertisement, Gardner's entourage Tango Blackcurrant flags whilst Gardner himself wears a Tango-branded boxing shorts and cape, whose Tango logo was stitched on the day of filming.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt;

==Broadcast==
''St George'' premièred on British television on 1 October 1996.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61180608.html |title=Free Can of Tango for every reader.(Features) |date=13 October 1996 |work=highbeam.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the majority of the advertisement's budget was put into production instead of airtime, ''St George'' only ever aired on television ten times,&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt; mostly during advert breaks during the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[TFI Friday]]''; one commentary later clarified that ''St George'' aired once a week for six weeks during ''TFI Friday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freddieandmatt.virb.com/adswelike/14012218 |title=Blackcurrant Tango - ADS WE LIKE |work=virb.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations firm [[Freud Communications]] worked with Britvic in publicising ''St George'' by making "a celebrity" out of the otherwise unknown Ray Gardner, arranging for him to be interviewed on television and in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="prweek.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweek.com/article/100517/integration-pr-panache-provides-advertising-bonus-recent-survey-revealed-advertising-story-become-staple-national-press-diet-companies-realising |title=Integration: PR panache provides an advertising bonus - A recent survey revealed that the advertising story has become a staple of the national press’ diet. More companies are realising the benefit of getting PR involved at the outset |work=PR Week.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Atter, international marketing manager for Tango, explained to ''[[PR Week]]'' that "as a youth product, Blackcurrant Tango was particularly adaptable and flexible. We didn’t need to have a well-known celebrity to reach our audience."&lt;ref name="prweek.com"/&gt; Scheduling the commercial in advert breaks of ''TFI Friday'' alone was considered unusual, even revolutionary, at the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/647724/channel-4-tv-planning-awards-2006-planners-planner The Channel 4 TV Planning Awards 2006: The planner's planner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came from George Michaelides of Michaelides &amp; Bednash. Vizeum UK's joint managing director, Matt Andrews, considered Michaelides to be a worthy candidate for a legacy prize at the 2006 Channel 4 TV Planning Awards, citing his scheduling idea for the advertisement as a reason. Andrews explained:

{{quote|"Previously, it had been all about ratings. He pioneered the use of bespoke and qualitative research to understand what people were really engaging with. For instance, on the launch of Blackcurrant Tango, they advertised in only one programme - ''TFI Friday''. To go to an advertiser and tell them they were only going to be in one show was, at the time, very brave. But the awareness tracking they got for the ratings they bought was amazing. It blew all preconceptions away."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

An unreleased and unfinished remix of [[hardbag]] musician [[Felix (musician)|Felix]]'s 1992 song "[[Don't You Want Me (Felix song)|Don't You Want Me]]" features in ''St George''; by the time of the broadcast of the advertisement, the remix had been updated to become the "'96 Pugilist Mix", featuring samples of Ray Gardner's dialogue from the advertisement. This version was released as a single on 4 October 1996 by [[Deconstruction Records]] on [[CD]], [[compact Cassette|cassette]] and purple-coloured [[seven-inch single|seven-inch vinyl]] to coincide with the Tango Blackcurrant and ''St George'' launch.&lt;ref name="discogs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/view/104279 |title=Felix - Don't You Want Me |work=discogs.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single features the Tango Blackcurrant logo several times in its packaging,&lt;ref name="discogs.com"/&gt; and reached number 17 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_F.HTM |title=Chart Log UK: Adam F - FYA |work=zobbel.de |year=2013 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the remix's music video, the ''St George'' samples were modified to remove mentions of Tango Blackcurrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXFd0_aUCJk |title=Felix - Don't You Want Me (96 Version) Music Video |work=youtube.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the original version later featured on the hits compilation ''[[Hits 97]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Hits-97/release/2951323 |title=Various - Hits 97 |work=discogs.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, the campaign continued when customers who bought ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' at branches of [[Esso]] Snack &amp; Shop were each given a free can of Tango Blackcurrant.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;

==Reception==
''St George'' was an instant critical and commercial success. Peter York of ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that "the launch of Blackcurrant Tango provides the opportunity for a fizzy drink to make a unique political statement - indeed an intervention. The European Movement will no doubt object strenuously."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/patriot-games-pop-and-purple-prose-1360494.html |title=Patriot games, pop and purple prose |first=Peter |last=York |authorlink=Peter York |date=26 October 1996 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the advertisement's diversion from the norm, saying "Roy displays a patriotic body of a kind never normally seen in TV commercials: white, with a proudly cantilevered beer-belly and two pendulous crescent breastettes. British as they come, the Roy Gardner body speaks for pork pies, British lager, and full-cream dairy products. It defies gymnasia and sunbathing."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; He called it "a simply brilliant launch".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1997, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] included it in their ''Assuming Positions'' exhibition.&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; The exhibit examined how art could be created from a number of unexpected sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmgt.co.uk/ica/OldWEBSITE/Bulletin/months/7-97index.html ICA July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Bush, curator of the exhibition, said ''St George'' was used because it was "technically brilliant as well as self-knowing": "It starts off dull and builds to a wonderful cinematic climax. You could read it as real laddishness and repugnant xenophobia, but at the same time you known it knows all that about itself and is a parody. This helps it transcend being an advert and becomes art."&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; Mike Cozens, creative director of Young &amp; Rubicam, praised the advertisement and said "it's been a great hit with punters as well as with advertising juries, which doesn't always follow. It's good to see such a mainstream brand like this winning awards for its advertising; it's often more obscure brands that win, which is sometimes questionable."&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt;

Impressed with Gardner's performance in ''St George'', the advertisement's producer Barth Hulley asked him to star in his short film ''Up and Running''.&lt;ref name="englishman.fr"/&gt; Despite ''St George''{{'}}s popularity in the public eye, it was also nonetheless controversial; it was also one of the top 10 most complained about adverts reported to the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) in 1996, as 68 complainants citied it as 'insulting and xenophobic'.&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; The ITC dismissed the complaints, characterising the humour as harmless and likening it to what viewers might see on ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; Letters of complaint from French exchange students who did not see the humour in the advertisement were ridiculed in newspaper inserts.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

===Accolades===
''St George'' was a major success in the industry and won a string of awards.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt; A year after its premiere, Paul McCann of ''The Independent'' said that ''St George'' "has won nearly every advertising award in Britain."&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; In March 1997, ''St George'' won HHCL Partners the British [[Creative Circle]] award for best advertisement of the year.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/tango-advert-is-flavour-of-the-year-1270928.html |title=Tango advert is flavour of the year |first=Marianne |last=Macdonald |date=4 March 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial, which was honoured in the platinum section, also won the gold award for best use of humour, as did its sister advert for Tango Apple.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk1"/&gt; In May, ''St George'' won the [[D&amp;AD]] "Silver Pencil" design award for best advert of the year,&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; in June, ''St George'' won a [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|Cannes]] "Gold Lion" award for being a top-tier advertisement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advertolog.com/festivals-awards/cannes-lions/cannes-lions-1997/ |title=Cannes Lions 1997 Winners Film : Cannes Lions : Advertising Award Shows |work=advertolog.com |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1997, ''St George'' was selected as the grand prize winner from among 7,000 entries from 78 countries at the [[London International Advertising Awards]].&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; It has also been listed on many industry "advert of the year" lists,&lt;ref name="Independent 18 November 1997"/&gt; and won the "ITV gold award" at the [[British Television Advertising Awards]].&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt;

In later times, ''St George'' continued to receive acclaim. In as early as May 1997, ''St George'' was named "ad of the decade" in a survey of readers of ''[[SKY Magazine|Sky Magazine]]'', beating [[Levi]]'s 1995 ''Planet'' advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/sky-readers-choose-blackcurrant-tango-ad-decade/24367 |title=Sky readers choose Blackcurrant Tango as ad of the decade |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk"/&gt; Bernice Kanner included ''St George'' in his 1999 list book ''100 Best TV Commercials: And Why They Worked''.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; It won the [[Film Four]] "Best Long Commercial 1956-2001" award in June 2007, whilst Gardner was honoured with the Channel 4 "Director's Cut" Gold Award that same summer, where the advertisement was awarded top honours in the "Vintage Category".&lt;ref name="raygardner.net"/&gt; Ray Gardner later won the "ITV Best Actor In A Commercial" Award for his performance.&lt;ref name="raygardner.net"/&gt; In 2008, advertising industry publication ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign Live]]'' ranked ''St George'' at number 2 in their list of the "Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/865453/ |title=The Top 10 funniest TV ads of all time |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Ben Tollett and Emer Stamp, joint creative directors of Adam &amp; Eve DDB, included the advert in his list of "3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With", part of a series for ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1392131/3-great-ads-i-nothing-31-ben-priest-tango-lynx-levis |title=3 great ads I had nothing to do with #31: Ben Priest on Tango, Lynx and Levi's |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the millennium, the original [[Hooj Choons|Hooj]]-produced "Hooj Mix" version of "Don't You Want Me", which features in ''St George'' in an early variation of its specially created "'96 Pugilist Mix", was included on several commercially successful, TV-advertised British various artists [[compilation album]]s of popular music featured in acclaimed television advertisements, including [[Virgin Records]]' ''The Best TV Ads...Ever!'' (2000),&lt;ref name="discogs.com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Best-TV-Ads-Ever/release/1659956 |title=Various - The Best TV Ads...

==Aftermath==
[[File:Stamp of Armenia m141.jpg|thumb|Ray Gardner later appeared in a [[FIFA World Cup 1998]]-tie-in Tango commercial.]]
Tango themselves parodied ''St George'' in a HHCL-created advertisement for the orange flavour entitled ''Vote Orange Tango''.&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/63561/britvic-doubles-tango-ad-spend?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=Britvic doubles Tango ad spend |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement, broadcast in March 1997 in the run up to the [[General Election]], takes the form of a mock [[party political broadcast]] where a Tango Orange campaigner criticizes the Apple, Lemon and Blackcurrant variants of the drink individually; his remarks against the blackcurrant flavour see him walk to the roof of a building where the character of Ray Gardner (portrayed by an actor other than Gardner) is still shown expressing his anger against Sebastian, but is clearly exhausted, and ultimately falls into a puddle.&lt;ref name="tvwhirl.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tvwhirl.co.uk/adverts/adverts-q-z/ |title=TV Whirl - Adverts Q-Z |work=tvwhirl.co.uk |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson criticizes "Blackcurrant Tango" as "stinky wind" and "lets off" an inflatable Ray Gardner.&lt;ref name="tvwhirl.co.uk"/&gt; The advertisement was broadcast in the first ever advert break on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].&lt;ref name="campaignlive.co.uk1"/&gt;

Despite his ties to the blackcurrant flavour, Gardner himself later appeared in two advertisements for the orange flavour. The first of these advertisements, ''Clowns'', aired between late 1997 and early 1998 and showed him encouraging a colleague at an event where clowns were being run over by giant trucks.&lt;ref name="tvwhirl.co.uk"/&gt; The advertisement was released to promote the send-away Tango Horn toy, but Tango themselves appeared to deem the advert a failure when a further advertisement in early 1998 humorously dismissed the advert as such.&lt;ref name="tvwhirl.co.uk"/&gt; Gardner's second Tango Orange advertisement aired in mid-1998 during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and showed Gardner advertising a competition to win television sets as part of the brand's World Cup promotions.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFCVX9IwsAM |title=Sky One Adverts 1998 (9)|first=Adam |last=Beckwith |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sported the same uniform as in the start of ''St George''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Additionally, Gardner appeared in several wraparound stings (break bumpers) during [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the World Cup where he is shown exploring [[Paris]] between games, although these stings do not feature Tango branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6GTcI7czkg |title='Blackcurrant Tango' Ray Gardner in France |author=hoopjammer |date=30 November 2012  |accessdate=12 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of ''St George'', there were no further advertisements for Tango Blackcurrant, and the flavour was discontinued after several years. Post-''St George'' Tango advertising prior to 2000 focused mainly on the Tango brand as a whole or on the orange and diet orange flavours, and the blackcurrant variant was dropped before their more eclectic advertising would return in the millennium. Tango Blackcurrant was relaunched as an [[Asda]]-exclusive flavour in August 2011 and as a standard flavour in December 2012. Nonetheless, ''St George'' remains the final advertisement for the drink, with Tango having seldom advertised on television in the 2010s.

'''Text roulette''' or '''SMS roulette''' is a game played chiefly by schoolchildren, in which they compose a [[text message]] on their [[mobile phone]] then send it to one of their contacts or a made-up number at random. 

==Popular use==
[[BBC Radio 1]] disc jockey [[Scott Mills]] makes regular use of [[texting]] as a form of entertainment. In an early form of the game in 2007, he encouraged listeners to send "I love you" messages to a contact at random.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2007/01/the_i_love_you_text_roulette_game.html The "I Love You" text roulette game], ''Mobile Industry Review'', 15 January 2007. Retrieved 2010-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last episode of Series 3 of [[Channel 4]] sitcom [[The Inbetweeners]], the four main characters play Text Roulette with each other's phones.

==Demographics of users==
In 2010, a [[United Kingdom]] survey of people aged 13 to 16 found that one in five had played a variation of the game in which the message must be [[obscene]]. A similar proportion had sent texts to previously unknown mobile numbers typed in at random, asking for the recipient to reply. Motivations included [[loneliness]], "[[fun]]" and [[boredom]], while 9% admitted being [[Truth or Dare?#Similar games|"dared"]] to do it. Of those who had played text roulette, one in three admitted to being in trouble from the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/10714067-fifth-of-under-16s-admit-to-risky-random-texting.html Fifth of under 16s admit to risky random texting], rightmobilephone.co.uk, 3 June 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905233538/http://www.prlog.org/10714067-fifth-of-under-16s-admit-to-risky-random-texting.html |date=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
Neil McHugh, who had commissioned the survey, said it showed that young people did not realize the dangers of texting unknown numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefonecast.com/News/tabid/62/EntryId/2869/Survey-reveals-a-fifth-of-youngsters-play-Text-Roulette.aspx Survey reveals a fifth of youngsters play Text Roulette], The Fonecast, 7 June 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer for business organisation [[ICAEW]] commented that text roulette is a modern variation on an old pattern, i.e. young people finding ways to irritate adults by doing what is forbidden, but raises concerns about [[child safety]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Vogel, [http://www.ion.icaew.com/itcounts/20046 SMS roulette, anyone?], ICAEW IT Faculty, 7 June 2010.

'''Tharu cinema''' refers to films produced in the [[Tharu language]] in the [[Terai]] or [[Madhesh]] region of southern [[Nepal]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].

The first Tharu talkie film, ''Karam'', was released in around 1988. Tharu cinema has grown in recent years. Tharu movies are seen across various parts of Asia where second and third generation migrants still speak the language

==History==
Tharu cinema does not have a very long history but from its local origins among the [[Tharu people]] in the far western and mid-western region of Nepal and the release of ''Karam'' in 1988  has grown very fast with the help of now-established [[Film director|director]]s, [[Film producer|producer]]s and other [[technician]]s of [[Nepali cinema]].

[[File:Vauxhall Gardens by Samuel Wale c1751.jpg|thumb|300px|A prospect of Vauxhall Gardens in 1751]]

'''Vauxhall Gardens''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɒ|k|s|ɔː|l}} was a [[pleasure garden]] in [[Kennington]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] and accessed by boat from London until the erection of Vauxhall Bridge in the 1810s. The wider area was absorbed into the metropolis as the city expanded in the early to mid-19th century.

It was one of the leading venues for public entertainment in London, from the mid-17th century to the mid-19th century. Originally known as 'New Spring Gardens', the site is believed to have opened before the Restoration of 1660, the first known mention being made by [[Samuel Pepys]] in 1662. The Gardens consisted of several acres of trees and shrubs with attractive walks. Initially entrance was free, with food and drink being sold to support the venture.

The site became Vauxhall Gardens in 1785 and admission was charged for its many attractions. The Gardens drew all manner of people and supported enormous crowds, with its paths being noted for romantic assignations. Tightrope walkers, hot-air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks provided entertainment. The rococo "Turkish tent" became one of the Gardens' structures, the interior of the Rotunda became one of Vauxhall's most viewed attractions, and the ''chinoiserie'' style was a feature of several buildings. A statue depicting [[George Frideric Handel]], erected in the Gardens, later found its way to Westminster Abbey. In 1817 the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted, with 1,000 soldiers participating.

It closed in 1840 after its owners suffered bankruptcy, but re-opened in 1841. It changed hands in 1842, and was permanently closed in 1859. The land was redeveloped in the following decades, but [[slum clearance]] in the late 20th century saw part of the original site opened up as a public park. This was initially called Spring Gardens and renamed in 2012 as Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It is managed as a public park by the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. Vauxhall Gardens is depicted in a tile motif at [[Vauxhall tube station]], done in about 1971 by George Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Porter, Laura|url=http://golondon.about.com/od/Victoria-Line-Tile-Motifs/ss/Vauxhall.htm|title=Victoria Line tile motifs – Vauxhall|work=Go London|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Thomas Rowlandson - Entrance to Vauxhall Gardens.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Vauxhall Gardens by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]]]
Eminent 18th-century scholar [[John Barrell]], writing in the ''Times Literary Supplement'', brings out Vauxhall's significance. "Vauxhall pleasure gardens, on the south bank of the Thames, entertained Londoners and visitors to London for 200 years. From 1729, under the management of [[Jonathan Tyers]], property developer, impresario, patron of the arts, the gardens grew into an extraordinary business, a cradle of modern painting and architecture, and&amp;nbsp;...  music&amp;nbsp;.... A pioneer of mass entertainment, Tyers had to become also a pioneer of mass catering, of outdoor lighting, of advertising, and of all the logistics involved in running one of the most complex and profitable business ventures of the eighteenth century in Britain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-english-pleasures-of-vauxhall/ The English pleasures of Vauxhall] John Barrell, 25 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; References to Vauxhall are, for 150 years, as ubiquitous as references to "Broadway" later would be.

==History==
[[File:Vauxhall Gardens - plan - 1826.jpg|thumb|300px|Plan of Vauxhall Gardens, 1826]]
The Gardens are believed to have opened just before the [[The Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] in his ''History of Lambeth Parish'' conjectures that she was the widow of [[Guy Fawkes]], executed in 1606, [[John Timbs]] in his 1867 ''Curiosities of London'' states for a fact that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one [[Falkes de Breauté]], a mercenary working for King [[John of England|John]] who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M5MLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA745&amp;vq=Vauxhall+Gardens&amp;dq=Curiosities+of+London+Timbs&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Curiosities of London] John Timbs, 1867, page 745&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the earliest record is [[Samuel Pepys]]' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at [[Charing Cross]]; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZIWiVW1EMcC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Pepys+Diary+Spring+Gardens |title=The Diary of Samuel Pepys |page=231 |author1=Pepys |first1=Samuel |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed Spring Gardens appears to have been a longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C2guAAAAMAAJ London; being an accurate history and description of the British metropolis...] vol IV, David Hughson, 1807, page 327&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gardens consisted of several acres laid out with walks. Initially admission was free, the proprietors making money by selling food and drink. [[John Evelyn]] described "the New Spring Garden at Lambeth" as a "very pretty contrived plantation" in 1661. [[John Aubrey]], in his ''Antiquities of Surrey'' gives the following account:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At Vauxhall, [[Samuel Morland|Sir Samuel Morland]] built a fine room, anno 1667, the inside all of looking-glass, and fountains very pleasant to behold, which is much visited by strangers: it stands in the middle of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a [[Pulcinella|punchinello]], very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5INAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=Aubrey+Antiquities+of+Surrey+Morland |last=Walford  |first=Edward |title=Old and New London |volume=VI |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1893 |page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A plan of 1681 shows the circular central feature planted with trees and shrubs, and the formal [[allée]]s that were to remain a feature as long as the Gardens lasted.&lt;ref&gt;Coke, 1984: p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[John Hawkins (musicologist)|John Hawkins]], in his ''General History of Music'' (1776), says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The house seems to have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730,&lt;ref&gt;The lease to Jonathan Tyers (1702–1767) was from 1728; little is known of Tyers' early history; his portrait bust, attributed to [[Louis-François Roubiliac]], is in the Birmingham City Museum and Art Collections. David Coke, "Vauxhall Gardens", ''Rococo: Art and Design in Hogarth's England'' (London: Victoria and Albert Museum) 1984:75–81, p.75, and cat. no. F1 (bust).&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the occupier of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a ''Ridotto&lt;ref&gt;In Venice, a ''ridotto'' was a small apartment for entertaining convenient to Piazza San Marco, the intimate setting for paintings of fashionable life by [[Alessandro Longhi]]: see [[Procuratie]]; the squib in the paper reported that "several Painters, and Artificers are employed to finish the Temples, Obelisks, Triumphal Arches, Grotto Rooms &amp;c for the Ridotto Al'&lt;!--Al' is correct--&gt; Fresco, commanded for the 7th of June, at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall." (quoted by Coke 1984:75).&lt;/ref&gt; al Fresco'', a term which the people of this country had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets&lt;ref&gt;These were season tickets; William Hogarth, who marshalled the painters to decorate the supper boxes, was issued a gold "lifetime" ticket, now in the British Museum (1984 Rococo exhibition, cat. no. F4.&lt;/ref&gt; at one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of [[George Frideric Handel|Mr. Handel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_csAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA888&amp;dq=General+History+of+Music+Tyers |last=Hawkins |first=John |title=A General History of the Science and Practice of Music |volume=2  |publisher=Novello |location=London |year=1853 |page=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[George Frederick Handel (Roubiliac)|seated marble of Handel]] by [[Louis-François Roubiliac]] (1738), almost the only survivor of the vanished Vauxhall Gardens, is at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 'supposed' last night of the gardens was on 5 September 1839 when it attracted 1089 people. Vauxhall was sold at auction on 9 September 1841 for £20,000, following bankruptcy of the owners, after which it re-opened, but it was permanently closed in 1859, and most of the land sold for building purposes.

==The Spring Gardens and the Rococo in England==
The Spring Gardens were the most prominent vehicle in England for the public display of the new [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;The Gardens were so central to the dissemination of Rococo in the public fancy, a section devoted to "Vauxhall Gardens" with an introductory essay by David Coke, was included in the 1984 exhibition ''Rococo: Art and Design in Hogarth's England'' held at the Victoria and Albert Museum (pp 75–81 and catalogue numbers F1-F43).&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest pictorial representation of Tyers' Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, is the "Vauxhall fan" (1736), an etching printed in blue designed to be pasted to a fan;&lt;ref&gt;1984 exhibition catalogue F5, lent by the Prince of Wales.&lt;/ref&gt; it shows the earliest groups of pavilions, in a sober classical taste, but the interiors of the supper boxes were painted by members of [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s [[St. Martin's Lane Academy]], prominent among them [[Francis Hayman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayman's 'conversation piece of Tyers and his family (1740), at the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], was included in the 1984 Rococo exhibition, cat. no. F2.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayman provided most of the subjects, which were rapidly executed by students and assistants; [[Hubert Gravelot]] provided designs for two others, and Hogarth's designs were pressed into service in hastily dashed-off copies that filled the back of every box. At a certain hour, all the paintings were let down at once, to offer some security to the companies at supper and a suitable backdrop, one observer thought, for the live beauties of London.&lt;ref&gt;"And what adds not a little to the pleasure of these pictures, they give an unexceptionable opportunity of gazing on any pleasing fair-one, without any other pretence than the credit of a fine taste for the piece behind her", according to a correspondent to the ''Scots Magazine'' quoted by Coke 1984:78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], who had come to England with his father George II in 1728 and who was a prominent patron of the Rococo, took sufficient interest in the Gardens to have his own pavilion built from the very first.&lt;ref&gt;He was the owner of the real estate. (Coke 1984:76).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fully Rococo structure erected at the Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, was the "Turkish Tent" that was still a novelty in 1744; "this fantastic structure introduced that element of frivolous impermanence which became so characteristic of Vauxhall," David Coke has remarked.&lt;ref&gt;Coke 1984:80.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 1740s it was joined by other examples of Rococo ''[[chinoiserie]]'' and above all by the Rotunda, with the most-viewed Rococo interior decoration in England, designed by [[George Michael Moser]], another member of the St. Martin's Lane Academy; the ornaments were "Executed by French and Italians" [[George Vertue]] noted.&lt;ref&gt;The Walpole Society, ''Vertue Note-Books'' III:150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The experience==
Enormous crowds could be accommodated at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' attracted an audience of 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many of the best known musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example [[Sophia Baddeley]]. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. At that time access from the [[West End of London|West End]] was by water, but the opening of [[Westminster Bridge]] in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.

The man seated at the table on the left is [[Samuel Johnson]], with [[James Boswell]] to his left and [[Oliver Goldsmith]] to his right. To the right the actress and author [[Mary Darby Robinson]] stands next to the Prince of Wales, later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]]]
The main walks were lit at night by hundreds of lamps. Over time more features and eyecatchers were added: additional supper boxes, a music room, a Chinese pavilion, a gothic orchestra that accommodated fifty musicians, and ruins, arches, statues and a cascade. An admission charge was introduced from the beginning and later [[James Boswell]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a [[shilling]] is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7tq2bbc6k8C&amp;pg=PA599&amp;dq=James+Boswell+Vauxhall+Gardens |last=Boswell |first=James |title=Boswell's Life of Johnson |pages=599–600 |publisher=James Murray |location=London |year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unlighted 'dark walks' or 'close walks' were known as a place for amorous adventures. Thomas Brown in "Works Serious and Comical in Prose and Verse" (1760) says:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ladies that have an inclination to be private, take delight in the close walks of Spring-Gardens, where both sexes meet, and mutually serve one another as guides to lose their way; and the windings and turnings in the little wildernesses are so intricate, that the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppUTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA44 Works Serious and Comical in Prose and Verse, Vol III], Thomas Brown, 1760, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A great part of the entertainment was offered by the well-dressed company itself. Pauses between pieces of music were intentionally long enough to give the crowd time to circulate the Gardens anew. M. Grosely, in his ''Tour to London'' (1772) says, relating to [[Ranelagh Gardens]] and Vauxhall:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These entertainments, which begin in the month of May, are continued every night. They bring together persons of all ranks and conditions; and amongst these, a considerable number of females, whose charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you see fathers and mothers, with their children, enjoying domestic happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert, that such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of the levity of the people. Certain it is, that those of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions of France. I do not know whether the English are gainers thereby; the joy which they seem in search of at those places does not beam through their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons there seem to say, what a young English nobleman said to his governor, ''Am I as joyous as I should be''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5INAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;dq=Grosely+Tour+to+London+Vauxhall+Gardens |last=Walford  |first=Edward |title=Old and New London |publisher=Cassell |location=London |pages=452–453 |volume=VI |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new name Vauxhall Gardens, long in popular use, was made official in 1785. After Boswell's time the admission charge rose steadily: to two shillings in 1792, three-and-sixpence in the early 19th century, and 4/6 in the 1820s. [[Season ticket]]s were also sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/s/season_ticket_for_vauxhall_ple.aspx |title=Season Ticket for Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment in this period included hot-air balloon ascents, fireworks, and tightrope walkers. In 1813 there was a [[fête]] to celebrate victory at the [[Battle of Vitoria]], and in 1827 the [[Battle of Waterloo]] was re-enacted by 1,000 soldiers.

The contributor to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopedia]]'' (1830 edition) comments that:
{{quote|the garden's great attraction arises from their being splendidly illuminated at night with about 15,000 glass lamps. These being tastefully hung among the trees, which line the walks, produce an impression similar to that which is called up on reading some of the stories in the Arabian Nights Entertainments. On some occasions there have been upwards of 19,000 persons in them, and this immense concourse, most of whom are well dressed, seen in connection with the illuminated walks, add not a little to the brilliant and astonishing effect of the whole scene.}}

[[Charles Dickens]] wrote of a daylight visit to Vauxhall Gardens, in ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'', published in 1836:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We paid our shilling at the gate, and then we saw for the first time, that the entrance, if there had been any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple!&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be4tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA75&amp;dq=Charles+Dickens+Vauxhall+Boz|last=Dickens |first=Charles|title=Sketches by Boz |publisher=Lea and Blanchard|location=Philadelphia|year=1836 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Gardens feature in a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a brief but pivotal turning point in the fortunes of [[anti-hero]]ine [[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]] in [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s 19th-century novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', as well as a setting in his novel ''[[Pendennis]]''. [[Thomas Hardy]] sets scenes in his ''[[The Dynasts]]'' in the Gardens. In ''[[Cecilia]]'' by [[Frances Burney]] the Gardens are where the character Mr Harrell commits suicide.

The Gardens passed through several hands. In 1840, the owners went bankrupt and the Gardens closed. They were revived the following year, and again in 1842 under new management, but in 1859 they closed for good.
