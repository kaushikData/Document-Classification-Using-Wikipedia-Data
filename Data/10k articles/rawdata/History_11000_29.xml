'''Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco''' (October 12, 1908 in [[Guayaquil]] — May 1, 1993 in [[Quito]]) — born '''Alfredo Pareja y Díez Canseco''' — was a prominent Ecuadorian [[novelist]], [[essayist]], [[journalist]], [[historian]] and [[diplomat]]. An innovator of the 20th-century Latin American novel, he was a founding member of the literary ''[[Grupo de Guayaquil]]'' ("Group of Guayaquil").&lt;ref&gt;Handelsman, Michael (2000), ''Culture and Customs of Ecuador'' (Series: Culture and Customs of Latin America and the Caribbean; Series editor: Peter Standish); Westport, Connecticut/London: [[Greenwood Press]], pp 94-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of President [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]] (1979–81) appointed him Chancellor of the Republic and he served as [[Foreign Minister]] of [[Ecuador]] (1979–80) and Ambassador to France (1983–84).

==Biography==
Pareja was born in [[Guayaquil Guayaquil]] in 1908, the son of Fernando Pareja y Pareja (1862-1919) and of Amalia Diez-Canseco y Coloma (1865–1945), daughter of the former [[Peruvian President]] [[Francisco Diez Canseco|Francisco Diez Canseco y Corbacho]]. He had to support his family from the age of 14, reading at night and assisting as a listener at the [[Colegio Vicente Rocafuerte]]. His early education was accomplished in his hometown: primary school at the [[Colegio San Luis Gonzaga]] of the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]].

In 1930, Pareja embarked on a footloose adventure in the United States. As a result of the [[Great Depression]] he worked on the [[New York City]] docks for a year (his later novel ''El Muelle'' reflects these experiences). Back in Ecuador, he became a professor of history and of Spanish and [[Spanish American literature]] at [[Universidad Laica Vicente Rocafuerte de Guayaquil]]. He also served as a Superintendent of Secondary Education and as a Deputy of [[Guayas Province]]. In 1934 he married his cousin, Mercedes Cucalón Concha niece of [[Carlos Concha Torres]] with whom he had three children, Cecilia, Jorge and Francisco.

During the dictatorship of [[Federico Páez]] (1935–37), however, Pareja was incarcerated and ultimately exiled to Chile where he was employed by the [[Ercilla Publishing House]]. Returning to Ecuador, he became a member of the Assembly, but was jailed again by the regime of President [[Aurelio Mosquera Narvaez]]. (This 30-day detainment formed the basis of his novel, ''Hombres sin tiempo''). He was Ecuador's [[chargé d'affaires]] in Mexico in 1944. In 1945 he became a special representative for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) in [[Washington D.C.]] and later [[Montevideo]] and [[Buenos Aires]] for the Governments of [[México]], [[Central America]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]].

Between August 1979 and July 1980, during the government of President [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]], Pareja was appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the rule of Roldós's successor, President [[Osvaldo Hurtado]], he served as Permanent Delegate to [[UNESCO]] and Ambassador to Paris (1983–84).

After retirement, Pareja dedicated his time to historical research. He died in Quito on 1 May 1993.

==Literary works and political stance==
Pareja, of a conservative family, was part of a “socialist generation” in Ecuador. He lived through considerable political turmoil in the 1920s and concluded that his country’s salvation lay on the left side of the political spectrum. He denied, however, being a “left-winger” and insisted that he did not desire to use the fiction writer’s art as an instrument of propaganda. Rather, he sought to simply and directly depict social conditions that called for redress, while denouncing those in power who were guilty of corruption and injustice. His first novel, ''La casa de los locos'' (1929), satirized  Ecuadorian politics and attacked so many real people that publication was considerably delayed. Pareja attested to the strong influence of the Mexican writer and politician [[José Vasconcelos]]. Other major literary influences included the Greek Classics, [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Dostoievski]],  [[Thomas Mann]], [[Will Durant]] and [[Arnold Toynbee]]. Some critics have also detected the influence of [[Freud]], [[Ilya Ehrenburg|Ehrenburg]], [[André Gide|Gide]] and [[Proust]] in him.

Pareja's cycle of narrative fiction was marked by realism and a strong connection with the history of his country (''El muelle'' [“The Pier”], 1933; ''Hombres sin tiempo'' [“Men Without Time”], 1941; ''Las tres ratas'' [The Three Rats], 1944). Having established a reputation as a writer both inside and outside of Ecuador, in 1944 he published an important novel biography, ''The Barbaric Bonfire'', about the actions and historical circumstances surrounding the life and death of General [[Eloy Alfaro]]. A new cycle of novels started in 1956 with ''La advertencia'' (“The Warning") and continued with ''El aire y los recuerdos'' (“Air and Memories”; 1959) and ''Los poderes omnímodos'' (“All-embracing Powers”; 1964). It was ambitious to describe the evolution of Ecuadorian society since 1925. Subsequently, he published the novel ''Las pequeñas estaturas'' ("Small Statures"; 1970) and authored an essay on “Thomas Mann and the New Humanism” (1956) and “Essays on Essays” (1981). (To date his works have not been translated into English.)

Pareja maintained a long association with the famous "Guayaquil Group" of Ecuadorian writers ([[José de la Cuadra]], [[Joaquin Gallegos Lara]], [[Demetrio Aguilera Malta]], [[Enrique Gil Gilbert]]). He also associated with [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Juan David García Bacca]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[Arnold Toynbee]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Alvaro Mutis]], [[Jorge Enrique Adoum]], [[Benjamin Carrión]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] and his nephew [[Miguel Donoso Pareja]]. The only biography about Pareja was written by the journalist and writer [[Francisco Febres Cordero]].

Pareja maintained periodical correspondence with [[John Steinbeck]].

The President [[Galo Plaza Lasso]], worked with Pareja in educational projects after [[World War II]] around the globe, mostly in Central and South America.

'''Andrew Jackson Blackbird''' (c. 1814-17 September 1908) was an [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odawa (Ottawa)]] tribe leader and historian. He was author of the 1887 book, ''History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan''.

==Early life==
Blackbird was born in the L'Arbre Croche area of [[Michigan]] (now [[Harbor Springs, Michigan|Harbor Springs]])&lt;ref name=peyer&gt;Peyer, Bernd (2007). ''American Indian Nonfiction: An Anthology of Writings, 1760s-1930s'', p. 253. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0-8061-3798-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1815. At least one account, though, places this date as late as 1821. His father was an Ottawa chief named Mack-e-te-be-nessy (''Makade-binesi'', "black hawk"). The name was mistranslated first by the French and from French to English as "Blackbird", which became the family's English name. Makade-binesi was chief of the Arbor Croche or Middle Village band. Makade-binesi was stranded on a small island by white traders he was helping, and was left to die. Although his father survived, this cruelty left a strong impression on Andrew. The death of his brother, William, in [[Rome, Italy]] &lt;ref&gt;Hennessey, James J. (1981), ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'', p. 111. Oxford University Press, US. {{ISBN|0-19-503268-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-503268-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on June 25, 1833, under suspicious circumstances as he was completing his studies for the Roman Catholic priesthood, left an indelible impression on Andrew and perhaps was the source of his intense antipathy for that religion from then on.

Blackbird frequently bemoaned his limited formal education. Because his father was a chief, Blackbird was solidly educated in traditional Ottawa culture and practices.

Blackbird was baptized a [[Roman Catholic]] by a priest called [[Stephen Badin|Father Baden]] in 1825, but later converted to [[Protestantism]]. He served as [[interpreting|interpreter]] at the Protestant mission in L'Arbre Croche.&lt;ref name=peyer/&gt; Even though he was a Christian, he knew the traditional Ottawa religious beliefs well.

Blackbird was trained as a [[blacksmith]] at mission schools in the L'Arbre Croche area. He studied for four years at Twinsburg Institute in [[Twinsburg, Ohio|Twinsburg]] in [[Summit County, Ohio]], but left without graduating. In 1850 his elderly father's health worsened. This forced Blackbird to leave school and return home to assist the old chief. Later he attended [[Eastern Michigan University]] (then called Michigan State Normal School) in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], for two years, but again did not graduate.&lt;ref name=peyer/&gt; In June 1858 Blackbird wrote his Twinsburg Institute mentor Rev. [[Samuel Bissell]]: "...I continue to attend the State Normal School at Ypsilanti, but am getting somewhat discouraged as to ever being perfect in the knowledge of English Language. I have begun rather too late of attending those things. I shall always speak__indistinctly__ungrammatically__for being so deeply rooted or stained with my own language....I have begun a grammar in the Indian tongue__intended to write it upon the same plan in which our first books in Latin and Greek are written...And this I thought would be about as good that I can do for them, since I cannot personally do good among them, so at least, they can have my writings if not prohibited by their Priests...The last I heard of my father were still living but very old and feeble...Our school is let out on the 25th of July__and vacation will last 10 or 11 weeks. I should like to have gone to visit my people but I am considerable in debt, therefore I will have to work out somewheres here during the time, in order to pay up my debts."

==Rise to recognition==

Blackbird was loyal to the United States during various uprisings. In 1858 Blackbird married Elizabeth Margaret Fish, a white woman of English descent. As a result, he was viewed favorably by the United States.

By the 1850s, Blackbird had become a counselor for both sides between the United States government and the Ottawa and Ojibwa peoples. Blackbird helped veterans of the United States who were Native Americans receive their pensions. He also assisted in settling land claims. During this time, Blackbird strongly advocated that citizenship be granted to the Ottawa and other Native Americans.

When the "Treaty With The Ottawa and Chippewa" was signed on July 31, 1855, Blackbird served as an interpreter, translator and official witness ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060710033754/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/ott0725.htm]).

In 1858, Blackbird bought a house in [[Harbor Springs, Michigan]], and settled there permanently. At the time, Harbor Springs was still primarily populated by Ottawas. Blackbird became the town's [[postmaster]].

In 1887, Blackbird published his ''History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan''.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of the book is available at [http://www.turtletrack.org/CO_FirstPerson/Blackbird/CO_04052003_Blackbird_TOC.htm Turtletrack.org ]&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], by the Ypsilantian Job Printing House. The book was among the first authoritative accounts of the Ottawa and [[Ojibwa]] (Chippewa) peoples ever published.

The book covers not only historical facts, but day-to-day details of how the Ottawa and Ojibwa hunted, fished and trapped before the coming of the whites. Blackbird explains many of the traditional beliefs and cultural practices of the two tribes. Because the author was himself a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], the book is free of the bias commonly found in books by white authors of the period.

Finally, the book includes a basic [[grammar]] of the Ottawa and Ojibwa languages.

== Views on White-Indian Relations ==

In a 1900 publication,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-gyAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sketch+of+Andrew+J.+Blackbird&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Indian Problem, from the Indian's Standpoint'']&lt;/ref&gt; Blackbird said:

"But I have heard white people say that the Indians might just as well die, for nothing can be done with them, as they will always be wild and savage and cruel.  They might as well all die or be killed, every one of them, from the face of the earth, for a dead Indian is better than a live Indian.  These frightful statements are heard all over the United States and every Caucasian child and every Indian child that is able to understand, knows this dreadful feeling toward us.  These statements are translated and republished in foreign countries so every foreigner coming to America comes with a prejudice and a persecuting spirit toward the aborigines of America.   Therefore there is no peace nor shelter for the Indians, from injustice. They are exposed to hate, to be shot at, and to be robbed in every way and manner, of their little possessions of lands which the government has allotted to them in treaties.  They are cheated by the crooked works of the law."

'''Arabella Chapman''' (1859–1927) was an [[African-American]] woman who is best remembered for being the first student to graduate from upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]'s Albany School for Educating People of Color, later known as [[Albany High School (New York)|Albany High School]].&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Marian I.|title=Refusing Ignorance; The Struggle to Educate Black Children in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York 1816-1873|date=1998|publisher=Mount Ida Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-9625368-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born free in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. By 1870, her family had migrated to Albany, New York, where Chapman would be raised in that city's thriving African-American community. She first attended Wilberforce School, before going on to Albany Free Academy (now Albany High School).&lt;ref&gt;[https://arabellachapman.history.lsa.umich.edu/?page_id=1001 "Arabella Chapman (1859-1927)"], The Arabella Chapman Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, she became the first African American to graduate from the Free Academy, and by 1880, she was teaching music. Her marriage to Clarence Miller led Chapman to leave Albany, traveling with Miller to [[North Adams, Massachusetts]], where he would be employed as a waiter and she would raise their children.&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;

Chapman created two photographic albums in the 1870s and 1880s. These albums survive in the collection of the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[William L. Clements Library]]. They are rare items that document Chapman's personal and political vision. The photographic portraits included those of notable figures such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Frederick Douglass]], and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Most striking are the portraits of Chapman herself, along with her family and friends. Through Chapman's careful curatorship, the albums convey a sense of how African Americans constructed their social and cultural worlds in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabella Chapman carte-de-visite albums  1878-[1890s]|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/idx/c/clementsgrfx/umich-wcl-F-82cha?cginame=findaid-idx;id=navbarbrowselink;subview=standard;view=reslist|website=William L. Clements Library|publisher=William L. Clements Library|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman's photo albums were exhibited in the 2013–14 exhibition, Proclaiming Emancipation, at the University of Michigan as examples of how the memory of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Emancipation, and citizenship was constructed by ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proclaiming Emancipation|url=http://clements.umich.edu/exhibits/online/proclaiming_emancipation/emancipation-abolition.php|website=William L.

'''Arild Huitfeldt''' (Arvid) (11 September 1546 – 16 December 1609) was a Danish [[historian]] and state official, known for his vernacular Chronicle of Denmark. 

==Life==
Huitfeldt was born into an aristocratic family from [[Scania]], part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] at the time. He was partly educated in Germany and France, made his career as a state official and was, from 1573 to 1580, First Secretary to the Danish Chancellery, the King's central administrative organ. From 1583 to his death he was also superintendent at [[Herlufsholm School]], the first Danish boarding school. In 1586 he achieved his highest appointment, becoming ''Rigskansler'' ([[Chancellor]] of the Realm, the very approximate equivalent to a modern Minister of Justice), until shortly before his death. Huitfeldt also owned several manor estates and handled a number of diplomatic assignments. As a politician and as an official he appears to have been studious, conservative, and sociable, avoiding overt clashes with his colleagues. 

==Historical works==
What has made Huitfeldt famous, however, is his contribution as a historian. He wrote the first great History of Denmark in vernacular Danish – ''Danmarks Riges Krønike'' (''Chronicle of the Kingdom of Denmark'', 8 vols, 1595-1603), thus taking up the weighty legacy of [[Saxo Grammaticus]]. Huitfeldt was no official Danish [[historiographer]], but at his time several official attempts at writing a comprehensive History of Denmark in [[Latin]] had come to little. Huitfeldt created a work that supplanted all earlier Latin attempts and more or less became ''the'' referential history work on Denmark until the time of [[Ludvig Holberg]].

The Chronicle deals with Denmark from what was then a time of legend until 1559. It is mostly structured around the reigns of the various kings and was published in non-chronological order, beginning with the time of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. Through published rather quickly, his work seems to have been prepared across several years. Being a state official with access to documents and with the possibility of using help from scribes, Huitfeldt did have many writing advantages. The form of his Chronicle is [[annalist]] but not narrowly limited to each single year. What makes it still more important is that Huitfeldt reproduces many documents and sources the originals of which are now lost. In that way his book is also a significant [[source text|source]] collection.

In the Chronicle Huitfeldt reveals himself as a pragmatic [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. A central view of his is that history repeats itself, but in aspects such as his emphasis on judicial and constitutional factors, he shows himself rather in advance of his time. At bottom, he remains subjective: his own ideal is that of the aristocratic state, in which the King respects the role and power of the nobility. Thus he may be held responsible for the extremely negative picture of [[Christian II]], and the corresponding idealized version of Christian III, which for many years dominated Danish historical thinking. Yet as a whole, Huitfeldt is sober and calm, using plain and relatively unaffected language. While transmitting the ancient legends and myths he often shows scepticism as to their reliability, an attitude he halso partly displays toward later sources. His prefaces to the separate volumes of his history are themselves worth noting, as an additional testimonial to his political ideals.

His work was largely used by [[Arrian]]. [[Plutarch]] also used him as a reference.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Arthur Wade Wade-Evans''' (born '''Arthur Wade Evans''') (31 August 1875 &amp;ndash; 4 January 1964) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] clergyman and historian.

==Biography==
Evans was born in [[Fishguard]], [[Pembrokeshire]], in south Wales on 31 August 1875 and did not include his mother's maiden name in his surname until 1899, when he was 24 years old.  His father, Titus Evans, was a master mariner. Evans was educated at [[Haverfordwest]] grammar school.  In 1893, he [[matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], graduating in 1896.  He was ordained deacon in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1898 and then served as [[curate]] in various parishes, including [[Ealing]], [[Cardiff]], and [[English Bicknor|English]] and [[Welsh Bicknor]].  In 1909, he was appointed [[vicar]] of [[France Lynch]], where he remained until 1926.  He campaigned for the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church in Wales]].  He was, from 1926 to 1932, vicar of [[Potterspury]] with [[Furtho]] and [[Yardley Gobion]] (1926–32), before his final appointment as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Wrabness]] from 1932 to 1957.  He then retired to [[Frinton-on-Sea]], [[Essex]].  He died on 4 January 1964.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-WADE-WAD-1875.html|title=Wade-Evans, Arthur Wade (Arthur Wade Evans); 1875&amp;ndash;1964; clergyman and historian|last=James|first=Mary Auronwy|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a historian of early Britain, the Celtic church and [[Welsh law]], although some of his theories were unorthodox.  He translated and studied many early historical sources, with his publications including ''[[Nennius]]'s "History of the Britons"'' (1938) ''Coll Prydain'' (1950) and ''The Emergence of England and Wales'' (1956, 1959).  Church history publications included journal articles on the lives of the saints and on church plate, ''Parochiale Wallicanum'' (1911), an analysis and translation of the Latin text of the ''Life of [[St David]]'' (1923), and ''Welsh Christian Origins'' (1934).  He also edited ''Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae'', an invaluable edition of Welsh saints' lives, mostly from the British Library Manuscript Vespasian A.xiv. He was also a contributor to many journals and newspapers.  In 1909, he published ''Welsh Medieval Law'', a translation of Llyfr Cyfnerth; he later wrote an article on Welsh law for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

[[Canonization|Saint]] '''Atto''' (1070 – 22 May 1153) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] bishop and a professed member from the [[Vallumbrosan Order]] as well as the [[Bishop of Pistoia]] and a noted historiographer.

He was born at [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] in the Portuguese region of [[Alentejo]] in 1070. He became Abbot of [[Vallombrosa]] (in [[Tuscany]]) in 1105, and in 1135 was made [[Bishop of Pistoia]], also in Tuscany. He wrote lives of [[St. John Gualbert]] and [[St. Bernard of Vallombrosa]], [[bishop of Parma]]. In 1145 he transferred to [[Pistoia]] certain relics of the Apostle [[St. James of Compostella]]. His correspondence on that occasion is found in [[Ferdinando Ughelli]], ''Italia sacra'', VII, 296.

'''Brad Steiger''' (February 19, 1936&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 2018) was an [[United States|American]] author of [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] works on the [[paranormal]], spirituality, UFOs, [[true crime]], and biographies.

==Biography==
Steiger was born as Eugene E. Olson on February 19, 1936,&lt;ref name=EoOP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology|title=Steiger, Brad (1936–)|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403804325.html|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]] Lutheran Hospital during a [[blizzard]]. He grew up on a farm in [[Bode, Iowa]]. 
He identified as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] until the age of eleven, when a [[near-death experience]] changed his religious beliefs. His parents encouraged him to become a teacher.&lt;ref name=Cosmoetica&gt;{{cite interview|title=The Dan Schneider Interview 10: Brad Steiger|date=8 Apr 2008|publisher=Cosmoetica}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Luther College (Iowa)]] in 1957 and the [[University of Iowa]] in 1963. He taught high school English before teaching Literature and Creative Writing at his former college from 1963 to 1967.&lt;ref name=EoOP/&gt;

Steiger claimed to have written his first book at age seven.&lt;ref name=Cosmoetica/&gt; His first book, ''Ghosts, Ghouls and Other Peculiar People'', was published in 1965. He became a full-time writer by 1967.&lt;ref name=EoOP/&gt; He authored/co-authored almost 170 books, which have sold 17 million copies. He wrote biographies on [[Greta Garbo]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Rudolph Valentino]], the latter of which was adapted as a [[Valentino (1977 film)|film]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=Brad&amp;Sherry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradandsherry.com/brad.htm|title=Brad|last=Steiger|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Steiger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722130952/http://www.bradandsherry.com/brad.htm|archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife Sherry Hansen Steiger, he was the author of ''Four-legged Miracles: Heartwarming Tales of Lost Dogs' Journeys Home''.

Steiger appeared as a radio guest on [[Coast to Coast AM]]&lt;ref name=C2CAM_Guest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/steiger-brad/5860|title=Brad Steiger|publisher=[[Coast to Coast AM]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915180314/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/steiger-brad/5860|archivedate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Jeff Rense]] Program.''&lt;ref name=Brad&amp;Sherry/&gt;

Steiger wrote that he believed [[Atlantis]] was a real place. In his book ''Atlantis Rising'' he argued that Atlantis was the home of an all-powerful civilization with sophisticated technological achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L. Moody. (1976). ''From Atlantis to UFOs''. ''Social Science'' 51 (2): 97–104.&lt;/ref&gt; He also declared the tracks at [[Paluxy River]] to be evidence for an ancient civilization of [[Giants (esotericism)|giant humans]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wiliam F. (2000). ''Enyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File Inc. p. 257. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a proponent of the [[ancient astronauts]] idea. Steiger stated that many humans descend from alien beings. He referred to these beings as "star people".&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John. (1992). ''Alien Encounters''. Time-Life Books. p. 126. "The world is apparently full of such star people, a term used by Brad Steiger, who believes himself and his wife to be among the alien-descended elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Debbora. (2005). ''E. T. Culture: Anthropology in Outerspaces''. Duke University Press. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  

Steiger was married to Sherry Hansen Steiger, an author and minister, from 1987 to his death in 2018. They have five children and nine grandchildren.&lt;ref name=Cosmoetica/&gt; He died on May 6, 2018 at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majorericksonfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Brad-E-Steiger?obId=3083724#/obituaryInfo Brad E Steiger Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Steiger's books have sold well to the public, but have been criticized by academics.

Anthropologist Bonita Freeman-Witthoft gave Steiger's ''Medicine Power'' an entirely negative review. She noted that Steiger failed to cite scholary sources, gave faulty [[documentation]] and his reporting of [[mythology]] was inaccurate. She concluded that "It is a disappointing work of no use to scholars and of little use to a person sincerely interested in American Indian spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman-Witthoft, Bonita. (1977). ''Reviewed Work: Medicine Power: The American Indian's Revival of His Spiritual Heritage and It's Relevance for Modern Man by Brad Steiger''. ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]'' 90 (357): 354–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Higley]] gave Steiger's ''The Werewolf Book'' a mixed review and concluded "with a definite penchant for the sensational at the expense of the accurate, the casual reader will find much in it informative and entertaining as well."&lt;ref&gt;Higley, Sarah. (2000). ''Reviewed Work: The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Beings by Brad Steiger''. ''[[International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts#Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts|Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts]]''. Vol. 11, No. 3 (43). pp. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] considers Steiger an unreliable source and has noted that he "endlessly cranks out books promoting paranormal claims".&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. (2004). ''The Mystery Chronicles: More Real-Life X-Files''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 235. {{ISBN|0-8131-2318-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His books have also drawn criticism from [[Jason Colavito]] who has stated they are filled with [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/brad-steiger-the-nephilim-and-the-lizard-people "Brad Steiger, the Nephilim, and the Lizard People"].

'''''Bryn Mawr Classical Review''''' (''BMCR'') is an [[open access journal]] founded in 1990. It publishes reviews of current scholarly work in the field of [[Classics|classical studies]] including [[classical archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infotree.library.ohiou.edu/single-records/658.html Ohio University Info Tree entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091818/http://infotree.library.ohiou.edu/single-records/658.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This journal is the second oldest online humanities scholarly journal.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr"&gt;http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; It provides both online and print subscriptions at no charge.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt; The journal is funded entirely by the sale of Bryn Mawr Commentaries.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt; The journal receives many submissions from volunteers, and even maintains an online list of materials that need to be reviewed if people are interested.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;O'Donnell, J.J. (1996) Five Years of Bryn Mawr Classical Review. ''The Serials Librarian'', 28(3-4), pp.223-228&lt;/ref&gt; The online version also offers access to Bryn Mawr's electronic resource review, which is made up of reviews of non-print classical scholarly writings.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt; As of now, however, those reviews have not been indexed.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt;

''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' began in 1990 as a [[LISTSERV]] created by John Price-Wilkin of the [[University of Michigan]], who also provided the original gopher site and ongoing technical support for the Review.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt; From 1994 through 1999, ''BMCR'' received support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation through a project which studied the growth and functionality of e-journals.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt; The current web presentation of the journal was created by members of the University of Pennsylvania Center for the Computer Analysis of Text, Jay Treat, Ken McFarlane, Warren Petrovsky, and Ira Winston, and by Vince Patone and Andrew Lacey of [[Bryn Mawr College]].&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt;

In 1993, ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' founded a sister publication, ''Bryn Mawr Medieval Review'' (now ''[[The Medieval Review]]'').&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt; Both journals are offered for subscription both print and online, and there is also an option for those who would like to subscribe electronically to both journals, but do not want to receive duplicate reviews, as some materials are reviewed in both places.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt;

The current editors of the journal are Richard Hamilton and Camilla MacKay of [[Bryn Mawr College]], and [[James J. O'Donnell]] of [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr" /&gt;

In February 1981, the Commission concluded that the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II]] was a "grave injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartime Internment of Japanese was 'Grave Injustice,' Panel Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/25/us/wartime-internment-of-japanese-was-grave-injustice-panel-says.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1981, the Commission held public hearings in Washington, D.C. to hear testimony from Japanese-American and Alaska Native witnesses. Public hearings followed in other American cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, Cambridge, New York City, Anchorage, the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands (St. Paul), Chicago, and Los Angeles, where the testimonies were recorded.&lt;ref name=DenshoEncyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redress Hearings Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) Hearings (1981)|url=http://www.ncrr-la.org/NCRR_archives/redresshearings81/redresshearings.htm|website=Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 750 people testified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internment History Timeline|work=Children of the Camps |url=https://www.pbs.org/childofcamp/history/timeline.html|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, the CWRIC issued its findings in ''Personal Justice Denied'', concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. Rather, the report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on "racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Justice Denied|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/japanese-americans/justice-denied/|work=Personal Justice Denied|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lastly, the Commission recommended legislative remedies: an official [[Federal Government of the United States|Government]] apology and redress payments to survivors. Congress passed legislation and on August 10, 1988, the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]] was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 100-383 -- August 10, 1988|url=http://www.internmentarchives.com/showdoc.php?docid=00172&amp;search_id=44801|website=Internment Archives|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act's purposes included the government's acknowledging and apologizing for the injustice of the evacuation and internment of US citizens and long-term residents; creating a public education fund to inform the public; making restitution to parties affected; discouraging a similar event from happening in the future; and demonstrating the U.S.' consideration of human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of the Civil Liberties Act of 1987|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/100/hr442/text|website=GovTrack|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this act and a related one in 1992, the US government paid reparations to more than 82,200 Japanese Americans.

'''Earl Wesley Bascom''' (June 19, 1906 – August 28, 1995) was an American painter, [[printmaking|printmaker]], [[rodeo]] performer and [[sculpting|sculptor]], raised in Canada, who portrayed his own experiences cowboying and rodeoing across the [[American West|American]] and Canadian [[American Old West|West]].

== Childhood ==
Bascom was born on June 19, 1906 in a sod-roofed [[log cabin]] on the Bascom 101 Ranch in [[Vernal, Utah]], United States, the son of rancher and lawman John W. Bascom and Rachel Lybbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21252391&amp;q=%22john+bascom%22&amp;eq=&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25&amp;core=udn&amp;fd=title_t,paper_t,date_tdt,type_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=Vernal+Express#t_21252391|title=Vernal Express - 1906-06-30 - Local and Personal|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had been a Uintah County deputy [[sheriff]] and later a constable in the town of [[Naples, Utah|Naples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21253673&amp;q=%22john+bascom%22&amp;eq=&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25&amp;core=udn&amp;fd=title_t,paper_t,date_tdt,type_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=Vernal+Express#t_21253673|title=Vernal Express - 1906-11-17 - Precinct Officers|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in northeast Utah, who chased members of [[Butch Cassidy|Butch Cassidy's]] Wild Bunch Gang and other outlaws including Harry "Mad Dog" Tracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Kathryn Jenkins (2013).

Joel Bascom was a member of the [[Nauvoo Legion]] and the Utah militia, serving in the Utah War of 1857 and the Utah Black Hawk War of 1865.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=q0FEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA740&amp;lpg=PA740&amp;dq=joel+bascom,+utah+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ny1zD4byy2&amp;sig=VI_wEibfqHMRlDa3MQOza_bMxZM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVpZ6-sq3dAhWFxIMKHSL3D40Q6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=joel%20bascom%2C%20utah%20war&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  He also served as Chief of Police in Provo, Utah and as the first constable in Mona, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2654843&amp;q=%22joel+a.+bascom%22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2655399&amp;page=3&amp;q=%22bascom%22&lt;/ref&gt;  Lybbert, who served in the Danish army before coming to America, was a blacksmith who served as constable of Levan, Utah and as Justice of the Peace in Naples, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=q0FEAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lybbert,+pioneers+and+prominent+men+of+utah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3wN_wta3dAhVD1IMKHavgDGEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lybbert%2C%20pioneers%20and%20prominent%20men%20of%20utah&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21237969&amp;page=2&amp;q=lybbert&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21253378&amp;page=6&amp;q=lybbert&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newspapers.lib.utah.edu"/&gt;

Members of Earl's family include his grand uncle Ephraim Roberts who was a [[pony express]] rider,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21271489&amp;q=roberts&amp;page=12&amp;rows=25&amp;fd=title_t,paper_t,date_tdt,type_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=%22Vernal+Express%22#t_21271489|title=Vernal Express - 1911-07-21 - Utah Pioneer Goes to Land of Reward|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grand uncle William Lance who was a soldier in the [[Mormon Battalion]] - Army of the West 1846-1848.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mormonbattalion.com/Original_Battalion_Roster&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Bascom relatives include mountain man [[Jedediah Smith|Jedediah S. Smith]], U.S. army Lt. George N. Bascom who instigated the [[Apache Wars]] in 1861, and cattle rancher [[Bryant Butler Brooks|Bryant Brooks]] who served as governor of Wyoming from 1905 to 1911.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Bascom's paternal ancestors include Minne-tin-ka, of the Turtle Clan, daughter of Chief [[Miantonomoh|Miantonomo]] of the [[Narragansett Indian]] tribe, King Edward III of European Royalty, and others from England, Wales, [[List of Scottish Americans|Scotland]], Ireland, Belgium and France with ethnicities including [[Quaker]],&lt;ref&gt;"one of Earl Bascom's ancestors, [[Herodias Long]] (b. 1623) was a Quaker"&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Basque people|Basque]]&lt;ref&gt;[http:"Earl's ancestor Gilbertus Bask'omme was a French Basque nobleman and also Robert Bascom was a Huguenot who escaped religious persecution in France"]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Huguenot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenot.netnation.com/ancestor/AncestorLookup.php|title=The National Huguenot Society - Approved Qualified Ancestors|website=Huguenot.netnation.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bascom's maternal family was of Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and German ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/k/e/r/Debbie-M-Kerkes/|title="Earl's maternal grandmother, Antonette Marie Olsen Lybbert, was from Oslo, Norway; his maternal grandfather, C.F.B. Lybbert, was from Flade, Denmark but was of German, Prussian and Dutch ancestry"|website=Genealogy.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Earl and his two older brothers and their father were riding horseback near Lybbert Gulch, when a bee stung Earl's horse and it bucked across the meadow with him.  Earl hung on until his brothers rode in and picked him off the horse like a rodeo pickup man. Earl was just three years old. For entertainment, the Bascom boys rode anything on the ranch that "bucked, jumped, or crawled." The family was at the local Vernal rodeo where they saw the famous bucking horse "Steamboat" in the arena.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1912, when Earl Bascom was just six years old, his mother Rachel died of breast cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21275499&amp;q=%22john+bascom%22&amp;eq=&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25&amp;core=udn&amp;fd=title_t,paper_t,date_tdt,type_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=Vernal+Express#t_21275499|title=Vernal Express - 1912-05-03 - Suffering from Cancer|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving five children - Raymond, Melvin, Earl, Alice and Weldon - ranging in age from 11 years to nine months. In 1913, Earl's father, who had cowboyed in Utah and Colorado and worked on ranches in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, went to Alberta, Canada securing a job as a foreman on the Knight Ranch. John Bascom's brother-in-law, Ike Lybbert, was already working there as the Knight Ranch blacksmith and farrier.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1914, the Bascom family loaded their belongings into a covered wagon, traveled a week to the nearest railroad in Price, Utah and rode the train to Canada. After working for the Knight Ranches headquartered on the Milk River Ridge in Alberta, Canada and managing [[Raymond Knight (rodeo organizer)|Ray Knight's]] Butte Ranch north of the town of Raymond, Alberta, John W. Bascom and his sons began ranching on their own using the Bar-B-3 brand. Over the following years, the Bascom family lived at Welling Station and ranched along Pot Hole Creek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22663331&amp;page=2&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Vernal Express - 2006-06-28 - Page 5|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at New Dayton on the Fort Whoop-up Trail near Deadman Coulee&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/lethbridge-herald-feb-15-2002-p-1/&lt;/ref&gt; and ran cattle on the open range, at Lethbridge on the Old Man River, and at Stirling east of Nine Mile Lake.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By Canadian law, all minor children who emigrated to Canada before 1915 and whose parent became a naturalized citizen, automatically became Canadian citizens. Earl Bascom's father became a naturalized Canadian citizen. Earl Bascom was technically an American Canadian. During the winter of 1916, the Bascom family moved back to [[Naples, Utah]], returning to Canada in the spring of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21303059&amp;q=%22john+bascom%22&amp;eq=&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25&amp;core=udn&amp;fd=title_t,paper_t,date_tdt,type_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=Vernal+Express#t_21303059|title=Vernal Express - 1917-03-09 - Naples|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schooled mostly in one-room schools, Bascom quit school while in grade three to work on the Hyssop 5H Ranch, east of Lethbridge. It was not long before a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mountie]], who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a seasoned cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old [[stagecoach]] pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboydirectory.com/B/b-arl.html|title="Earl's father got the contract to drive the school district's coach wagon using a team of horses from the Bascom Ranch"|website=Cowboydirectory.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Bascom gained a stepmother and a stepbrother, Frank, when his Earl's father married Ada Romeril Dawley.

Bascom was known as the '''Cowboy of Cowboy Artists''' due to his wide range of western experiences as a professional [[bronc buster]], bull rider, [[cowpuncher]], trail driver, [[blacksmith]], freighter, [[wolf]] hunter, [[wild horse]] chaser, [[rodeo]] champion, cattle rancher, dude [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]], and [[Hollywood]] actor.&lt;ref&gt;''Roundup Magazine'' "Rodeo Champion - Cowboy Artist Earl W. Bascom" (December 1995, Volume III Number 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Bascom was among the last of those who experienced the [[American Old West|Old West]] before the end of free-range ranching. Bascom reminisced:

{{quote|I worked for some of the big open-range outfits from [[Purple Springs, Alberta|Purple Springs]] to the [[Sweetgrass Hills]] and [[Kicking Horse River|Kicking Horse Creek]] to the [[Milk River Ridge]] and the [[Canadian Rockies]]. On one roundup some 7,000 horses were gathered in one bunch a mile wide. And the Knight Ranch dipped 18,000 head of cattle. What a sight to see. The sight, the sounds, the smell I can still remember.&lt;ref&gt;"American Hero Earl W. Bascom". (Summer 1995), ''United Lumbee Nation Times''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Bascom, ranch life and cowboy life was his life. "The life of a cowboy and the West, I know," he stated.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Beef "Cowboy Artist, Earl W. Bascom" (October 1995, page 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Bascom worked on some of the largest horse and cattle ranches in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] — ranches that ran thousands of cattle on a million acres (4000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land. He broke and trained hundreds of horses. He worked on ranches where he chased and gathered horses, cows and even donkeys in [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Texas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[California]] and western Canada. He worked on cattle drives out of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and horse drives through the [[Teton Range]]. He took part on large roundups of horses and cattle, and brandings. He made [[Western saddle|saddles]] and [[stirrup]]s, [[quirt]]s, [[chaps]], [[spur]]s, [[bridle]]s and [[horse tack#Bits|bits]], [[rope]]s and [[hackamore]]s, and even patched his own [[cowboy boot|boots]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckle News "Rodeo Champion - Cowboy Artist, Earl W. Bascom, Rides into Sunset" (November 1995, pages 6 and 7)&lt;/ref&gt; Earl's brothers and their father, John W.

A professional rodeo [[cowboy]], Bascom followed the rodeo circuit internationally, rodeoing from 1916 to 1940, where he won several all-around championships. He competed in the rough stock events of saddle [[bronc riding]], bareback riding and [[bull riding]], and in the timed events of steer decorating and [[steer wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;ProRodeo Sports News "Bascom dies at 89" (September 13, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, he set a new arena record, a new world record time and won third place in the world standings in the steer decorating event.

Bascom has been honored as the "Father of Modern Rodeo" and known as an innovator and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;''Tri-State Livestock News'' (September 23, 2011) "Earl Bascom: The Father of Modern Rodeo"&lt;/ref&gt; He is known in rodeo history for designing and making rodeo's modern [[bucking chute]] in 1916 and modified in 1919. He also made rodeo's first hornless bronc saddle in 1922 and rodeo's first one-hand bareback rigging in 1924, for which he has been called the "Father of Rodeo Bareback Riding." In 1926, he designed and made the modern rodeo riding [[chaps]], and then in 1928, a rodeo exerciser made of spring steel.&lt;ref&gt;Elite Equestrian (June 13, 2013) "Cowboys in Alberta Sports Hall of Fame"&lt;/ref&gt; Bascom has been recognized as one of rodeo's greatest inventors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/64105/Earl-W-Bascom-LDS-cowboy-receives-national-award.html "Earl W.

During his college years, Earl and his brother Weldon produced the first rodeos in [[Columbia, Mississippi]] in 1935, 1936 and 1937 while working for Sam Hickman's B Bar H Ranch near Arm, Mississippi. This first rodeo in Columbia is known in cowboy history as the first rodeo held outdoors at night under electric lights. The rodeo arena designed and built under the direction of Earl Bascom in 1936, was the first permanent rodeo arena built in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fK84DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=earl+bascom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4fjQ9dY5cy&amp;sig=yIsLJX4ZbGPvq1UkJpq5iFtGT78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrlNuStI7bAhXJx1QKHTP2CKY4WhDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=earl%20bascom&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The bucking horses used in the rodeo were shipped in from West Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Recorder (November 22, 1935, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Hickman and Earl Bascom went to New Orleans where they purchased [[brahman cattle|brahma bulls]] for the rodeo [[bucking bull|bucking stock]]. This was the first recorded use of brahma bulls in rodeo. Sam Hickman financed these rodeos through his Wild West Rodeo Company.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Between rodeos of 1936 and 1937, Earl was a [[missionary]] for [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) in Mississippi, serving under Mission President [[LeGrand Richards]] of the Southern States Mission. The Bascom brothers were honored fifty years later for being the "Fathers of Mississippi Rodeo" and given the "Key to the City of Columbia," along with a congratulatory telegram from President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;''San Bernardino County Sun'' (August 26, 2985, page 10) "50 Years Later, Mississippi Rodeo Honors Victorville Cowboy Artist"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon were officially recognized by the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame as the "Fathers of Brahma Bull Riding."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1939, Bascom married Nadine Diffey, who was part American Indian, [[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. He met her in Mississippi while cowboying and rodeoing there. They were married in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in the Salt Lake LDS Temple, and raised five children. Later in life, [[Nadine Bascom]] became a sculptor in her own right, creating [[bas-relief]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Press (October 18, 2013) "Nadine (Diffey) Bascom"&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being a professional rodeo contestant, Bascom tried his hand as a [[rodeo clown]] and [[Rodeo Bullfighter|rodeo bullfighter]] during his rodeo career. Just after his 89th birthday, Earl was honored as the oldest living rodeo clown in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Vernal Express (August 30, 1995) "World's oldest living rodeo clown and bullfighter dies"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 88, Bascom helped roundup longhorn steers on the Shahan Ranch in west Texas and received honors for his art during the 1994 Texas Longhorn Quincentennial Cattle Drive and Celebration. Bascom's bronze sculpture ''The American Longhorn, 1494-1994'' was declared the most authentic example of a classical Texas longhorn steer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22650444&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Vernal Express - 1994-11-16 - Page 9|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bascom was honored posthumously during the tenth anniversary celebration of the National Day of the Cowboy, for his international contributions to cowboy culture and the cowboy way of life.&lt;ref name="the-bull-riding-hall-of-fame.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-bull-riding-hall-of-fame.com/bull-rider-honored-on-national-day-of-the-cowboy.html|title=Bull Rider Honored on National Day of the Cowboy|website=The-bull-riding-hall-of-fame.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magicvalley.com/news/local/community/cowboys-with-local-connections-honored-on-national-cowboy-day/article_d4852cf8-2052-11e4-a3f8-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Cowboys with Local Connections Honored on National Cowboy Day|website=Magicvalley.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Bascom personally knew and associated with such characters as old time cowboys, pioneers and homesteaders, outlaws and lawmen, gunslingers and bootleggers, prospectors and gold miners, Mormon Battalion soldiers and Civil War soldiers, Indian Chiefs and Indian War fighters, muleskinners and pony express riders, squatters and sheepherders, cattle rustlers and horse thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernhorsereview.com/blogs/screen-doors-saddles/bascom-honored-on-national-cowboy-day/|title=Earl Bascom Honored On National Cowboy Day|date=19 August 2014|website=Westernhorsereview.com=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist ==
=== Influences ===
While working for the Nilsson Rafter-E-N Ranch, Bascom happened to read a story in a western magazine about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Jim Thorpe]]. Thorpe had been working as a horse wrangler, but got fired. The camp cook gave him some advice - go to school. Thorpe took that advice, went to school, excelled in sports and became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Jim Thorpe's life touched Bascom. "I felt like I had walked in his boots," Earl said. "Like Jim Thorpe, cowboy life was the only life that I knew. But what about my art, what about art school?"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''United Lumbee Nation Times'', Summer 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting to be an artist since childhood, Bascom filled the pages of his school books in the one-room school house he attended with cowboy scenes. His desire to be a cowboy artist was greatly enhanced after seeing art works of the two great icons of [[American Old West|Old West]] art, [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles M. Russell]] and [[Frederic Remington|Frederic S. Remington]] - both cousins to his father, John W. Bascom (Remington and Russell were both related to Bascom through their mothers, Clarissa "Clara" Bascom Sackrider Remington and Mary Elizabeth Mead Russell, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;https://famousmormons.net/famous-mormon-artists/earl-bascom/&lt;/ref&gt; Both Remington and Russell were artists that spent time in Canada producing art. In the late 1920s, Earl worked on a ranch south of the Sweetgrass Hills in Montana that was once owned by the artist Charlie Russell and only a few months after Russell's death.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Russell was on the Knight Ranch when Bascom was working there, and had drawn a [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] on the bunkhouse wall and also finished a large [[oil painting]] of [[Raymond Knight (rodeo organizer)|Raymond Knight]] on his favorite mount, Blue Bird, roping a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboydirectory.com/B/b-arl.html|title="The bridle headstall shown on C. M. Russell's depiction of the horse, Blue Bird, was the same one that Raymond Knight gave to Earl as payment for breaking a horse for him"|website=Cowboydirectory.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bascom was educated in one-room school houses and only completed one full school year, never finishing high school, he never lost his desire to be an artist. He subscribed to a correspondence art course wherein both Russell and Remington gave instructions on their drawing techniques. "Through those art lessons these two masters of western art were my first real art teachers," Bascom recalled. "In fact the only instructions I ever had in western art were from Remington and Russell."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Even though he had no high school diploma, the [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]] accepted him as a student in the fall of 1933. "There I was a 27 years old college freshman who hadn’t been to school in years," Bascom recalled. "I felt like a wild horse in a pen."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; But as a BYU student,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21519041&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Vernal Express - 1935-12-26 - nNaples|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was persistence, taking every art course the college offered. He studied painting and drawing under professors [[E.H. Eastmond]] and [[B.F. Larsen]], and sculpture under [[Torleif S. Knaphus]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In the summertime between school years, Bascom was a rodeo contestant where he gained notoriety as a cowboy artist and rodeo champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22687031&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Evening Herald - 1936-07-10 - Page 1|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22690611&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Evening Herald - 1937-09-16 - Page 5|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22690627&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Evening Herald - 1937-09-17 - Page 6|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He interrupted his college education in 1934 with the intent to compete at the World Championship Rodeo in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=17956320&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Salt Lake Telegram - 1934-05-03 - Provo Notes|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=15230238&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Springville Herald - 1934-05-03 - 'Y' Student to Ride in London Wilde West Show|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22668120&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Evening Herald - 1934-05-02 - Page 1|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
In 1917, Bascom saw his first [[Hollywood]] movie ''The Silent Man'' starring [[William S. Hart]]. Earl and his older brother Melvin were extras in a silent movie in 1920 being filmed in Lethbridge, Alberta. In 1924, a team of [[palomino]] horses from the Bascom Ranch was used by [[Hoot Gibson]] in a Roman race in the movie ''The Calgary Stampede''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015662/trivia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vvdailypress.com"&gt;http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20170707/earl-bascom-and-calgary-stampede&lt;/ref&gt; Earl later worked in the movie industry with his brother Weldon Bascom in the 1954 [[Hollywood]] [[western (genre)|western]], ''[[The Lawless Rider]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047164/?ref_=nv_sr_1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d2rights.blogspot.com/2015/04/ed-wood-wednesdays-week-60-lawless.html|title=Dead 2 Rights: Ed Wood Wednesdays, week 60: 'The Lawless Rider' (1954)|first=Joe|last=Blevins|date=29 April 2015|website=D2rights.blogspot.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring Weldon's wife Texas Rose Bascom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059679/|title=Rose Bascom|website=IMDb|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earl was one of the outlaws in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3327612/|title=Earl Bascom|website=IMDb|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weldon was the sheriff and one of the stuntmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059680/|title=Weldon Bascom|website=IMDb|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bascom worked as a miner in the Old Gray Mine, digging coal, near Maeser, Utah in the winter of 1930.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

After graduating from college, Bascom and his wife moved to Southgate, [[California]]. Retiring from rodeo after one last season, he pursued his art career and ranched. Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon Bascom worked on a ranch in Perris, California which was formerly owned by Louis B. Mayer of Hollywood's MGM Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3327612/bio|title=Earl Bascom|website=IMDb|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earl worked on the Rex Ellsworth Ranch in Chino, California. Earl was a distant cousin on the Bascom side to Mitch Tenney who was Ellsworth's horse trainer. Earl worked on Al Hamblin's Flying V Ranch in the Beaumont area. Earl had his own cattle ranch in Ontario in San Bernardino Valley&lt;ref&gt;https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21452774&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22&amp;eq=&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25&amp;core=udn&amp;fd=title_t%2Cpaper_t%2Cdate_tdt%2Ctype_t&amp;sort=date_tdt+asc&amp;gallery=&amp;facet_paper=Vernal+Express&lt;/ref&gt; using the Two Bar Quarter Circle brand, before moving to the high desert, living in Hesperia, Apple Valley and Victorville.  His Diamond B Ranch on the Mojave River had buildings dating from the 1870s and was once the temporary resident of Albert Einstein in the mid 1930s.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

During World War II, Bascom worked as a shipfitter in the Long Beach shipyards building ships for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Recorder (September 24, 1943, page 4)&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Long Beach City College, taking a class on blueprint reading in order to qualify for the job at the shipyard.  As such, he was a member of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. After the war, Bascom worked for the Flying V Ranch before entering the home construction industry, first working in the plumbing trade and then the plastering trade, joining what is known today as the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association of the United States and Canada.  As a plastering contractor, he plastered houses in some of the first residential tracts in southern California.  He plastered California Mormon churches in Chino, Ontario, Palmdale, Ridgecrest, Trona, Hesperia and Victorville.

Bascom honored at Alumni Hall of Fame"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International artist ===
Bascom became internationally known as a cowboy artist and sculptor&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=5oM1B1VE-yMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA109&amp;lpg=RA1-PA109&amp;dq=earl+bascom,+wyoming+cowboy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJJn_9ZPNK&amp;sig=DKSMmOOTjRzAemzXpMFokpNE14o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBjd37r8_bAhUJ6IMKHbq6A5M4HhDoAQg1MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=earl%20bascom%2C%20wyoming%20cowboy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; with his art being exhibited in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1994, Earl Bascom was commissioned by the Texas Longhorn Quincentennial Celebration Committee to produce his sculpture of what was deemed "the most authentic example of a classical Texas longhorn steer."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=8eoCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=earl+bascom,+wyoming+cowboy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jjmMqqcxEl&amp;sig=7jXDxHymjpN1QQCIrlNhrQqVZdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVkqH1yM3bAhWC54MKHV6FAeA4HhDoAQhDMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=earl%20bascom%2C%20wyoming%20cowboy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also commissioned in 1994 to design a collector's series of rodeo cowboy belt buckles for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's National Finals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coolbuckles.com/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was honored by the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Artists Association as the first rodeo cowboy to become a professional cowboy artist and sculptor. He was the first cowboy artist to be honored as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] of London since the society's beginning in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19074692/columbianprogress/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2005, the week-long Earl W. Bascom Memorial Rodeo was held in [[Berlin]], Germany during the German-American Heritage Celebration where his cowboy art was exhibited as an honor by the European Rodeo Cowboys Association for Bascom's worldwide influence upon the sport of rodeo.&lt;ref&gt;The Lethbridge Herald (September 28, 2000)"Canadian cowboy Bascom has rodeo named in his honor" Trevor Kenney&lt;/ref&gt; "It was an honor to memorialize Earl Bascom," said Steve Witt, vice-president of European Rodeo Cowboy Association.  "The rodeo equipment he designed back in 1920s has had an influence on rodeo worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Press'' "Horse Talk" September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Equestrian historian Kathy Young said, "Earl Bascom was noted for bridging two worlds, that of rodeo competition and western art."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Press'' "Horse Talk" January 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2014, Bascom was made the international honoree of the National Day of the Cowboy and given the "Cowboy Keeper" award.&lt;ref name="the-bull-riding-hall-of-fame.com"/&gt;

In June 2015, Bascom was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, as the first rodeo champion ever honored and given Canada's highest sports honor as a "Canadian Sports Legend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgarystampede.com/blog/2015/05/19/earl-bascom-canadian-sport-legend/|title=Earl Bascom: Canadian Sport Legend – Blog|website=Calgarystampede.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As a Canadian rodeo athlete and cowboy artist, Earl Bascom is a national treasure," stated Helena Deng, senior curator of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;''Westwind Weekly'' "First Rodeo Champion Inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame" Karlene Skretting July 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bascom's incredible achievements are now to be shared with all Canadians in perpetuity," said Mario Siciliano, president of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, "inspiring generations of Canadians in sports and in life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsebackmagazine.com/hb/archives/41690|title=First cowboy in Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame - Horse Back Magazine|website=horsebackmagazine.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Bascom was commissioned to design a rodeo belt buckle for the National Finals to commemorate the 70th year of the rodeo bareback rigging which Bascom had designed and made back in 1924. The production manager said, "Bascom's buckle was one of our most popular pieces and the most historical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22766769&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Springville Herald - 1994-12-21 - Page 11|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Congressman, the Honorable Jerry Lewis, said in 1995 in "A Tribute to Earl Wesley Bascom" as printed in the Congressional Record, that Earl Bascom was a "cowboy hero and a true inspiration...(who) lived one of the most interesting lives ever known in modern cowboy history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/5/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e2283-2?q=%7B%22search%22:%5B%22%5C%22earl+bascom%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|title=Congressional Record|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22651754&amp;rows=50&amp;q=%22earl+bascom%22|title=Vernal Express - 1995-12-20 - Page 9|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=22767328|title=Springville Herald - 1995-12-27 - Page 3|website=newspapers.lib.utah.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul de Fonville, curator of the Cowboy Memorial Museum, gave tribute to Earl Bascom as "one of the great pioneers of rodeo - a cowboy through and through."&lt;ref&gt;Deseret News, October 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''American Cowboy'' magazine and others have called Earl Bascom a "Renaissance Cowboy" - one who was a main contributor and participant in the renewed interest in cowboy life including the sport of rodeo and western art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865582764/Honoring-a-real-renaissance-cowboy.html?pg=all|title=About Utah: Honoring a real renaissance cowboy|first=Lee|last=Benson|date=7 July 2013|website=Deseretnews.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steamboattoday.com/news/2014/jul/27/real-deal-cowboy-artist-ties-routt-and-moffat-wins/|title=Real-deal cowboy artist with ties to Routt and Moffat wins award posthumously|website=Steamboattoday.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/zz/20130722/NEWS/130728993|title=Cowboy legend Earl Bascom was a rodeo pioneer and Western artist|website=Dailybreeze.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowboy celebrity [[Roy Rogers]], who worked with Earl Bascom in TV commercials and was a collector of Bascom art, once said, "Earl Bascom is a walking book of history. His knowledge of the Old West was acquired the old fashioned way – he was born and raised in it."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ron (2007). ''Famous Mormons, Interesting Profiles of Well-known Latter-day Saints'' (Spring Creek, pages 13-14). {{ISBN|978-1-932898-57-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Earl Bascom's 2013 induction into the Rodeo Hall of Fame is one of the top honors bestowed upon a cowboy," said Pam Minick, president of the Rodeo Historical Society. He is credited with designing the first side-delivery bucking chute in 1916, and then the first reverse-opening side-delivery chute, the first hornless bronc saddle, and the first one-hand bareback rigging. A member of the Cowboys' Turtle Association, he won bareback and saddle bronc titles across North America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/3869567|title=Rodeo Historical Society Announces Rodeo Hall of Fame Inductees for 2013|date=6 August 2013|website=newsok.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earl Bascom was honored as the 2014 International Honoree of the National Day of the Cowboy with these words - "As a rodeo pioneer, an all-around champion, an internationally known artist and a cowboy, Earl W. Bascom has been inducted into more halls of fame than any cowboy in the world."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tsln.com/news/national-day-of-the-cowboy-celebrates-10-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guide to the Calgary Stampede'' published, "With the induction of Earl W. Bascom in 2015, Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame welcomed its first Honoured Member known for Rodeo. With the help of innovators like Bascom, the modernised version of the sport features new methods and equipment which helped shape the face and spirit of the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth (the Calgary Stampede)."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianaffair.com/blog/guide-to-the-calgary-stampede/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vvdailypress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://calgarystampedetickets.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/detailed-notes-on-rodeo-stampede-guide-in-simple-step-by-step-order/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon were the first rodeo cowboys to be given the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame Ken Stemler Pioneer Award.  At hall of fame ceremonies, director Kent Sturman declared Earl Bascom to be a "true rodeo pioneer."  He recognized Bascom for "his complete dedication to the sport of professional rodeo spanning several decades; for his contributions as a rodeo equipment and gear inventor and designer; for his innovation and foresight as the ‘Father of Modern Rodeo’ and the ‘Father of Brahma Bull Riding’; and for his contributions as a rodeo athlete and champion, producer, stock contractor, announcer, clown, trick rider, historian, author, artist and sculptor, and western movie actor that helped advance the development and success of professional rodeo."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

"Earl Bascom is the Michael Phelps of rodeo,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20161104/earl-bascom-and-brothers-inducted-to-rodeo-halls-of-fame&lt;/ref&gt; stated Ken Knopp, historian of the Mississippi Rodeo Hall of Fame.  "With a stack of honors to his name, Bascom remains the all-time leader in the sport of rodeo."  Bascom and Phelps are actually distant cousins, both being descendants of New England founder Thomas Newell and Rebecca Olmstead.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Cowboy historian Stan Paregien said, "Earl Bascom was one of the last great cowboys of the Old West era and became internationally known for his western art and sculpture, as well as for his rodeo equipment designs and inventions."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Author of ''Rodeo History and Legends'', Bob Jordan, said - "The Bascom boys helped shape the sport of rodeo more than any other family in the world."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Earl Bascom was chosen by the ''Toronto Star'' as one of 150 of Canada's greatest athletes, including Wayne Gretsky and Steve Nash, to represent Canada during its 150th year (1867-2017) of Confederation. Sports writer Kerry Gillespie wrote, "Angry bulls to wild horses, there wasn't anything on four legs that Earl Bascom couldn't get the better of..."&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2017/06/22/capturing-a-country-through-sport-the-crossovers.html|title=Capturing a country through sport: The crossovers - Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardston Historical Society recorded, "Earl Bascom and his brothers designed and built the first side-delivery bucking chute on the Bascom Ranch at Welliing Station.  In 1922, Earl made a hornless rodeo saddle, which the cowboys called the "mulee", and first used it at the Cardston Stampede.  Bascom's rodeo innovations helped change rodeo from a cowboy's pastime to an international sport and placed him 0n the list of Canada's most famous inventors."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Wyoming radio personality Rich Roddam named Earl Bascom in 2018 as one of 13 famous people from small Wyoming towns - "In a state full of cowboys, Earl Bascom may have been the best. Considered the "Father of Modern Rodeo", Bascom gained fame as an actor, artist, inventor, and writer."&lt;ref&gt;http://kingfm.com/13-famous-people-from-small-towns-in-wyoming/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15888">'''The [[family]] as a model for the organization of the [[State (polity)|state]]''' is a theory of [[political philosophy]].  It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family.  The first writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was [[Aristotle]], who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the [[polis]].

Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, [[Monarchy|monarchists]] have argued that the state mirrors the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] family, with the people obeying the [[Monarch|king]] as children obey their father.

==Ancient Greek thought==
The family&amp;ndash;state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] rule.

[[Plutarch]] records a laconic saying of the [[Dorians]] attributed to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]].  Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: “Begin, friend, and set it up in your family”. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's ''The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'' &amp;mdash; Lycurgus, p.&amp;nbsp;65)

[[Aristotle]] often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: “the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler”.(2)  Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a [[republic]]an government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (''Politics'' Bk I, §v, 1&amp;ndash;2; 1259a 35&amp;ndash;1259b 1)

However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:
:“Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and master of a family have a common character.  This is a mistake; they think that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, numerical difference.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §i)&lt;!-- standardise translations, &amp; add full reference here and following --&gt;
After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §vi)

Aristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek ''polis'' or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities.  Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.

[[Arius Didymus]] in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: “A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.”  From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, “&lt;nowiki&gt;[s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia)”. Further, he claims: “Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy.  The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.” (''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament'', edd Boring, Berger, &amp; Colpe)

==Confucian thought==
{{main|Role ethics}}

[[Confucius]] believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the [[father of the nation]]. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover [[international relations]] (e.g. the [[emperor of China]] is treated as the older brother of the [[list of Korean monarchs|Korean king]]). Confucian family theory is still espoused in [[North Korea]] to justify their method of leadership succession.

The concept of family is important in classical [[Confucianism]]. For Confucius, ''xiào'' or [[filial piety]] was a ''[[De (Chinese)|dé]]'' or [[virtue]]. The character representing ''xiào'', 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (''lao'', old), and the lower representing children (''zi'', son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of ''[[Li (Confucian)|lĭ]]'' were therefore acting in accordance with ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the ''Xiàojīng'', or [[Classic of Filial Piety]]. In politics, ''xiào'' is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with "paternal love"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius.

American [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|diplomat Edmund Roberts]] in his description of [[Guangzhou|Canton City]], which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sovereign of men, say they, "is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons."&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

==Modern thought==
[[Louis de Bonald]] wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the [[Bible]]:

:“&lt;nowiki&gt;[It]&lt;/nowiki&gt; calls man the ''reason'', the ''head'', the power of woman: ''Vir caput est mulieris'' {man is head of woman} says St Paul.  It calls woman the helper or ''minister'' of man:  ‘Let us make man,’ says Genesis, ‘a helper similar to him.’  It calls the child a ''subject'', since it tells it, in a thousand places, to obey its parents”. (''On Divorce'' pp&amp;nbsp;44&amp;ndash;46)

De Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of [[macrocosm/microcosm]]). He insists that the ''deconstitution'' of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with “[[The Kyklos]]” not far behind. (''On Divorce'', pp&amp;nbsp;88&amp;ndash;89; 149.)

[[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] draws a connection between the family and monarchy:

:“Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society.  (Compare the teaching of Pope [[Leo XIII]]: 'Likewise the powers of fathers of families preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in God, from which ''all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name'' &amp;mdash; Eph 3.15')  The relationship between the King as 'father of the fatherland' and the people is one of mutual love”. (''Liberty or Equality'', p.155)

==Politics and the family==
In her book, ''Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France'', Elisabeth Fraser analyses [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise [[philo-Hellenism]] in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument:
:“Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.” [http://www.kunstform.historicum.net/2005/02/4653.html Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer]

More recently, [[George Lakoff]] has claimed that the [[left-right politics|left/right distinction]] in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for [[right-wing]] people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for [[left-wing]] people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.[https://web.archive.org/web/20020416055642/http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=515].

Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 63 (1977), pp&amp;nbsp;43&amp;ndash;50.

The idea of the [[commonwealth]] as a family is close to [[cliché]]; it permeates political discourse at every level:

:“There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the end functional. There are people in it who aren't just like you, but they are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, despite our differences.” &amp;mdash; [http://metaphorproject.org/our-one-big-family-frame/           Susan C. Strong, ''Our 'One Big Family' Frame'']

The '''First Great Rectification Movement''' refers to a 1965 ideological movement by [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Communism|communists]] led by [[Jose Maria Sison]] wherein they "[[Criticism|criticized]], repudiated and rectified the major [[Ideology|ideological]], [[Politics|political]] and organizational errors and weaknesses" of the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|1930s-era Communist Party of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jose María Sison (Philippines) | url=http://palomapolo.com/unrest/jose_maria_sison.html | accessdate = 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rectification movement led to the reestablishment of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] on December 26, 1968 along [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism|Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Jalandoni | first =Luis G. | title = The Revolutionary Struggle of the Filipino People | url=https://josemariasison.org/the-revolutionary-struggle-of-the-filipino-people/ | date = 8 February 2016 | accessdate = 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930}}
The Communist Party of the Philippines (Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas - PKP)  was established on November 7, 1930 guided by [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist Thought]]. During [[World War II]], the [[Hukbalahap]] under [[Luis Taruc]] and [[Vicente Lava]] was organized under PKP leadership with the aim of resisting the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]]. After the Second World War ended, the PKP found itself in a considerably strengthened position in the working class and peasant movements.

In 1948, the PKP began an armed struggle against the Philippine government, turning the Hukbalahap into a People's Liberation Army. However, in 1950, the entire secretariat of the Central Committee of the PKP was arrested, including General Secretary [[Jose Lava]], following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila. In the course of the armed struggle, the PKP and the People's Liberation Army sustained heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Taruc | first =Luis | title = He Who Rides the Tiger | publisher = [[Geoffrey Chapman]] | year =1967 | pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1954 the armed struggle was effectively over. The PKP then pursued a course of peaceful action.

==Split from the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas==
[[Jose Maria Sison]] was a [[Graduate school|graduate student]] and teacher at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] when he joined the ''Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas'' in 1962 upon the invitation of [[Jesus Lava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Palpal-latoc Tangi | first = Lucia | title =People's War, People's Press:  History and Evolution of Ang Bayan (The People), the News Organ of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) | url=https://josemariasison.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-02-Tangi.pdf | accessdate = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In due course, he joined a five-man committee tasked with reviving the party and organizing a youth movement. Using the [[nom de guerre]] "Amado Guerrero", Sison co-founded the ''[[Kabataang Makabayan]]'' ("Patriotic Youth") with Nilo Tayag in 1964. This organization rallied the Filipino youth against the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos presidency]] and corrupt politicians. It was involved in the period of civil unrest during the 1970s called the [[First Quarter Storm]].

Influenced by the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966, Sison created a youth-based [[Maoism|Maoist]] group within the PKP. The Lavas however, became discomfited by Sison's growing popularity within the PKP. When Sison wrote a draft of the party's history, they pressured him to shelf the document for future discussion when it turned out to be a "powerful indictment of the Lavas' history of incompetence since World War II."&lt;ref name=abinales&gt;{{cite paper | author =Abinales, P.N. | title =Jose Maria Sison and the Philippine Revolution: A Critique of an Interface | publisher =[[University of the Philippines Diliman]] | date = n.d. | url =http://ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/ | format =[[Portable Document Format]] | accessdate = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sison's aim to continue the armed struggle clashed with the party leaders' view that armed struggle was an exercise in futility. Consequently, Sison and his group were expelled from the PKP in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930]] | title =A Short History of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas | url=https://www.pkp1930.org/a-short-history-of-the-partido-komunista-ng-pilipinas.html | accessdate = 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On December 26, 1968, Sison and ten of his companions met in [[Alaminos, Pangasinan]] and formed the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) founded on Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Thought. The revised historical report on the PKP now had a new title, "Rectify Errors and Rebuild the Party"; it was adopted as a founding document.&lt;ref name=abinales/&gt; This came to be known as the "First Great Rectification Movement". The reformed Communist Party included [[Maoism]] within the political ideology as well as a two-stage revolution consisting of a protracted [[people's war]] to be followed by a [[Revolutionary socialism|Socialist revolution]]. The PKP leadership sought to eliminate and marginalize Sison. However, over time, Sison's bloc became the leading communist party in the Philippines.

'''George Grant MacCurdy, A.M., Ph.D.''' (April 17, 1863 – November 15, 1947) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropologist]], born at [[Warrensburg, Missouri|Warrensburg, Mo.]], where he graduated from the [[Central Missouri State University|State Normal School]] in 1887, after which he attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (A.B., 1893; A.M., 1894); then studied in [[Europe]] at [[Vienna]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] (School of Anthropology), and at [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] (1894–98; and at [[Yale College|Yale]] (Ph.D., 1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/klmno/maccurdy_george.html  (Minnesota State University (Biography)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603190030/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/klmno/maccurdy_george.html |date=2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was employed at [[Yale College|Yale]] from 1902 onwards as instructor, lecturer, curator of the anthropological collections (1902–10), and assistant professor of archæology after 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/087maccurdy.pdf THEODORE D.

==European hypothesis==

{{See also|European origin of modern humans}}

MacCurdy argued for [[Europe]] as the origin of the first [[humans]], in his 1924 book ''Human Origins'', he said: “The beginnings of things human, so far as we have been able to discover them, have their fullest exemplification in Europe”.&lt;ref&gt;George Grant MacCurdy, Human Origins, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 until 2001 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]] from which he was awarded his [[PhD]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Aderet |first=Ofer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/a-german-israeli-team-undertakes-the-reconstruction-of-auschwitz-1.458948 |title=A German-Israeli Team Undertakes the Reconstruction of Auschwitz |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2016-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Greif was the scientific advisor and historical consultant for the exhibition "With Me Here Are Six Million Accusers" which marked the 50th anniversary of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s trial in 1961, inaugurated April 11, 2011, at [[Yad Vashem]], Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=kyiv&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/exhibit-showcases-eichmann-50-years-after-trial-102082.html?flavour=mobile Exhibit showcases Eichmann, 50 years after trial]. ''Associated Press'' via ''Kyiv Post'' (11 April 2011). Retrieved 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition describes Eichmann's career at the SS, his personal responsibility for the deportation of millions of Jews to the ghettos and extermination camps, his attempts to hide after the war and the operation of his discovery and seizure in Argentina in 1960. The exhibition aims to prove that Eichmann was not the "murderer behind the desk", but a fanatic foe of the Jews, determined to send them to their deaths.&lt;ref name=kyiv/&gt;

In January 2017, together with [[Emir Kusturica]], representatives of Serbian and Jewish survivors of genocide committed against them by [[Croatian Ustashe]] in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac death camp]] and the Serbian government representatives to the USA, Greif co-organised the exhibition '''''Jasenovac 75''''' in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.balkaninsight.com/Event/The_Balkans_Today_23th_-_27th_January_2017/644316043 "The Balkans Today: 23rd - 27th January 2017" on ''Balkaninsight'' page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Projects==
Greif initiated in 2006 the project of the "Authentic Box Car", which is now standing on the ramp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Auschwitz_II-Birkenau|Birkenau]], not far from the main entrance to the camp, as an eternal memory to the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, murdered by the Germans in the gas chambers of Birkenau in 1944, and dedicated to the memory of Hugo Lowy.

Greifs' book ''[[We Wept Without Tears]]'' inspired Hungarian director [[László Nemes]] to create the film [[Son of Saul]] dedicated to the Sonderkommando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Terry|title='Son Of Saul' Brings Viewers To The Heart Of The Nazi Death Machine At Auschwitz|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/07/446586530/son-of-saul-brings-viewers-to-the-heart-of-the-nazi-death-machine-at-auschwitz|website=npr|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won the 2016 [[Academy Awards]] for the best foreign language film, and also won the 2016 [[Golden Globe]] for the Best Motion Picture- Foreign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners &amp; Nominees|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/son-saul|website=goldenglobes.|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Empire - Africa Proconsularis (125 AD).svg|thumb|right|Africa Proconsularis (125 AD)]]
'''Gratiana''' was an [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] city and bishopric in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], which remains a latin catholic [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Mesnage, ''L'Afrique chrétienne'', (Paris, 1912), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0899.htm GCatholic - (former and) titular bishopric]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Gratiana survives as a [[titular bishop]]ric and the current [[archbishop]], personal title, is [[Francisco Escalante Molina]], [[apostolic nuncio]] to the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]]. He replaced [[Luigi Conti (Nuncio)|Luigi Conti]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2g60.html diocese entry] at www.catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Gratiana, in modern [[Tunisia]], was among the many towns of sufficient importance in the [[Roman province]] of [[Byzacena]] to become a [[suffragan]] of [[Carthage (episcopal see)|Carthage]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Mesnage, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1096329/f216.image ''L'Afrique chrétienne''], (Paris, 1912), p.&amp;nbsp;201.&lt;/ref&gt; but would completely fade, plausibly at the 7th century [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|advent of Islam]].

During the [[Roman Empire]] the [[bishop]]ric was centered on a town(now lost to history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0899.htm GCatholic - (former and) titular bishopric]&lt;/ref&gt;)  in  the [[Roman province]] of [[Byzacena]]. Three of its bishops are historically documented :
*The [[Donatist]] [[bishop]] who attended the [[Council of Carthage (411)|411 Council of Carthage]]. On that occasion the seat had no Catholic bishops. 
*Bishop Boniface took part in the [[Council of Carthage (484)|synod assembled in Carthage  in 484]] by the [[Vandal]] king [[Huneric]], after which Boniface was exiled like most Catholic bishops. 
*Bishop Gennarus participated in the anti-[[Monothelitism|monotheistic]] [[Council of Carthage (641)]].

== Titular see ==
The dicese was nominally restored in 1933 as a [[titular bishop]]ric of Gratiana (Latin) / Graziana (Curiate Italian) / Gratianen(sis) (Latin adjective)

It has had the following incumbents, albeit so far none of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank but all archiepiscopal :
*'' Titular Archbishop Felice Pirozzi (Italian) (1961.10.28 – death 1975.07.25) as papal diplomat : [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[Madagascar]] (1960.09.23 – 1967.01.09), [[Apostolic Nuncio]] (ambassador) to [[Venezuela]] (1967.01.09 – 1970.10.17) and as President of [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy]] (1970.10.17 – 1975.07.25)
*'' Titular Archbishop Luigi Conti (Italian) (1975.08.01 – 2015.12.05) also as papal diplomat : Apostolic Delegate to Antilles (1975.08.01 – 1980.02.09), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Haiti]] (1975.08.01 – 1983.11.19), [[Apostolic Pro-Nuncio]] to [[Iraq]] (1983.11.19 – 1987.01.17), Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to [[Kuwait]] (1983.11.19 – 1987.01.17), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Ecuador]] (1987.01.17 – 1991.04.12), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Honduras]] (1991.04.12 – 1999.05.15), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Turkey]] (1999.05.15 – 2001.08.08), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Turkmenistan]] (1999.05.15 – 2001.08.08), Apostolic Nuncio to [[Libya]] (2001.08.08 – 2003.06.05) and Apostolic Nuncio to [[Malta]] (2001.08.08 – 2003.06.05)
*'' Titular Archbishop Francisco Escalante Molina (Venezuelan) (2016.03.19 – ...) again as papal diplomat : Apostolic Nuncio to [[Congo-Brazzaville|Republic of Congo(-Brazzaville)]] (2016.03.19 – ...) and Apostolic Nuncio to [[Gabon]] (2016.05.21 – ...).

{{Old Norse topics}}
The [[Danish language]] developed during the [[Middle Ages]] out of the [[Old East Norse]], the common predecessor of Danish and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. It was a late form of common [[Old Norse]]. The Danish philologist [[Johannes Brøndum-Nielsen]] divided the history of Danish into "Old Danish" from 800 AD to 1525 and "Modern Danish" from 1525 and onwards. He subdivided Old Danish into "Runic Danish" (800–1100), Early Middle Danish (1100–1350) and Late Middle Danish (1350–1525).&lt;ref&gt;:{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Stephen|title=The Personal Pronouns in the Germanic Languages: A Study of Personal Pronoun Morphology and Change in the Germanic Languages from the First Records to the Present Day|chapter=15. Old/Middle Danish|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Runic Danish==
{{main article|Old East Norse}}
Old East Norse is in Sweden called ''[[Runic Swedish]]'' and in Denmark ''Runic Danish'', but until the 12th century, the dialect was the same in the two countries. The dialects are called ''runic'' because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the [[vowel]] ''u'' which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''ø'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'' which was also used for ''e''.

A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''stæin'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dauðr'' into ''ø'' as in ''døðr''. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tauþr'' into ''tuþr''. Moreover, the ''øy'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''ø'' as well, as in the Old Norse word for "island".

}}
From 1100 and onwards, the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].
In the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not Latinate. The [[Codex Holmiensis|Jutlandic Law]] and [[Scanian Law]] were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=219–21}} Throughout this period, Danish was in contact with [[Low German language|Low German]], and many Low German loan words were introduced.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=221–224}}

==Renaissance and Reformation==
With the [[Protestant Reformation in Denmark|Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the [[stød]] and the voicing of many stop consonants.

The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, "''Rimkrøniken''" (the Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|publisher=Royal Danish Library|title=Bog Museum (Book Museum)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221182726/http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by [[Christiern Pedersen]] was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|page=225}}

==Modern Danish==
The first translation of the Bible in Danish was published in 1550.

Some notable authors of works in Danish are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]], prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]]. Three 20th century Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in 1917) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] (awarded 1944).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14955">[[Hermeneutics]] is the theory and methodology of interpretation. The tradition of Western hermeneutics starts in the writings of [[Aristotle]] and continues to the modern era.

== Mesopotamian hermeneutics ==
{{See|Exegesis#Mesopotamian commentaries}}

== Aristotle and Plato ==
In ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', [[Aristotle]] offers a theory which lays the groundwork for many later theories of [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] and [[semiotics]]:

Equally important to later developments are some ancient texts on [[poetry]], [[rhetoric]], and [[sophistry]]:
* Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', and ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''
* Plato's dialogues, ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Lesser Hippias]]'', and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''
However, these texts deal with the presentation and refutation of arguments, speeches, and poems rather than with the understanding of texts ''per se''. As Ramberg and Gjesdal note, "Only with the Stoics, and their reflections on the interpretation of myth, do we encounter something like a methodological awareness of the problems of textual understanding."&lt;ref name="ramberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/|title=Hermeneutics|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Bjorn Ramberg and Kristin Gjesdal|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Plato, vilified poets and poetry as harmful nonsense. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato denied poets entry into his "ideal state" until they could prove their value. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Plato famously portrayed poets as possessed:

The meaning of the poem thus becomes open to ridicule. Whatever hints of truth it may have, the truth is covered up by madness. However, another line of thinking arose with [[Theagenes of Rhegium]], who suggested that, instead of taking poetry literally, it ought to be taken as [[Allegory|allegories]] of nature. Stoic philosophers further developed this idea, reading into poetry both allegories of nature and allegories of ethical behavior.

{{cquote|Words spoken are symbols or signs (''symbola'') of affections or impressions (''pathemata'') of the soul (''psyche''); written words are the signs of words spoken.

As writing, so also is speech not the same for all races of men.

But the mental affections themselves, of which these words are primarily signs (''semeia''), are the same for the whole of mankind, as are also the objects (''pragmata'') of which those affections are representations or likenesses, images, copies (''homoiomata'').&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[''De Interpretatione'', 1.16&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;4]}} {{cquote|You know, none of the epic poets, if they're good, are masters of their subject; they are inspired, possessed, and that is how they utter all those beautiful poems. The same goes for lyric poets if they're good: just as the [[Corybantes]] are not in their right minds when they dance, lyric poets, too, are not in their right minds when they make those beautiful lyrics, but as soon as they sail into harmony and rhythm they are possessed by [[Bacchus|Bacchic frenzy]].&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[Plato, ''Ion'', 533e–534a]}}

Aristotle differed with his predecessor, Plato, about the worth of poetry. Both saw art as an act of [[mimesis]], but where Plato saw a pale, essentially false, imitation of reality, Aristotle saw the possibility of truth in imitation. As critic David Richter points out, "For Aristotle, artists must disregard incidental facts to search for deeper universal truths." Thus, instead of being essentially false, poetry may be universally true.&lt;ref&gt;David Richter, ''The Critical Tradition'', 1997, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apostolic Age ==
{{see also|Apostolic Age}}The earliest Christian period of biblical interpretation was the [[Apostolic Age]]. Traditionally, that  was the period of the [[Twelve Apostles]], dating from the [[Great Commission]] until the death of [[John the Apostle]] (about 100 &lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt;). Because John lived so long and was the last of the apostles to die, there is some overlap between the Apostolic Age and the first [[Apostolic Fathers]]. (See [[Apostle (Christian)#Deaths of the Twelve Apostles|Deaths of the Twelve Apostles]].)

The operative hermeneutical principle in the New Testament was ''prophecy fulfillment''.  [[Gospel|The Gospels]], particularly the [[Gospel of Matthew]], make extensive use of the Old Testament for the purpose of demonstrating that Jesus was the [[Messiah]].  Examples include Matthew&amp;nbsp;1:23, 2:15–18, 3:3, 21:42, Mark&amp;nbsp;1:2–3, 4:12, Luke&amp;nbsp;3:4–6, 22:37, John&amp;nbsp;2:17, 12:15, and notably Luke 4:18–21. Jesus read extensively from [[Isaiah|Book of Isaiah]] and said that the prophecy was fulfilled in the crowds who heard it. The [[Pauline epistles]] also employ the principle of  prophecy fulfillment, as evidenced by 1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians&amp;nbsp;1:19 and Ephesians&amp;nbsp;4:8–10.

=== Apostolic Fathers ===
{{See also|Apostolic Fathers|Christianity in the 2nd century}}The [[Apostolic Fathers]] were [[Disciple (Christianity)|followers]] of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]]. This period is sometimes called the sub-apostolic period.

The principle of prophecy fulfillment was carried over from the Apostolic Age and was continued up to the beginning of the 3rd century &lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt; For example, [[Irenaeus]] dedicates an entire chapter of [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|''Against Heresies'']] to the defense of [[Isaiah 7:14]], which was one of the chief prophecies used to validate Jesus as the Messiah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.21, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xxii.html?scrBook=Jer&amp;scrCh=22&amp;scrV=24#ix.iv.xxii–p34.1. See also as examples II.34 and IV.9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with Irenaeus' other writings.

Even more than Irenaeus, the [[Apologetics#Early Christian Era|second century apologists]] tended to interpret and utilize most scripture as if it were primarily for the purpose of showing prophecy fulfillment. Prominent among these was [[Justin Martyr]], who made extensive use of scripture to this end. Examples of prophecy fulfillment can be seen in his ''Apology'', in which chapters&amp;nbsp;31–53 are specifically dedicated to proving through prophecy that Jesus was the Messiah. He uses scripture similarly in ''Dialogue with Trypho''.

Here Justin demonstrates that prophecy fulfillment supersedes logical context in hermeneutics. He ignores the [[Christology|Christological]] issues that arise from equating Jesus with the [[Golden calf|golden calf of Bethel]], which is the "him" that is being brought to the king in {{bibleverse||Hosea|10:6}}.

{{cquote|And when Herod succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority which had been allotted to him, [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: "And they brought Him to the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], a present to the king."&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', 103, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.ciii.html?scrBook=Hos&amp;scrCh=10&amp;scrV=6#viii.iv.ciii–p4.1. See also 111, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.cxi.html?scrBook=Isa&amp;scrCh=53&amp;scrV=7#viii.iv.cxi–p2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is likely that the preeminence of prophecy fulfillment was a product of the circumstances of the early church. The primary intent of early authors was a defense of Christianity against attacks from paganism and Judaism, as well as suppressing what were considered to be schismatic or heretical groups. To this end, Martin Jan Mulder suggested that prophecy fulfillment was the primary hermeneutical method because Roman society placed a high value upon both antiquity and [[oracle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jan Mulder, ed., ''Mikra: Text Translation, Reading and Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity'' (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), 743.&lt;/ref&gt; By using the [[Old Testament]] (a term linked with [[supersessionism]]) to validate Jesus, [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] sought to tap into both the antiquity of the [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]] and the oracles of the [[prophet]]s.

== Late antiquity ==
Two divergent schools of thought emerged during this period, which extends from 200 &lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt; to the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. Historians divide this period into the [[Ante-Nicene Period]] and the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]].

=== Ante-Nicene period ===
{{See also|Ante-Nicene Period}}The '''Ante-Nicene Period''' (literally meaning "before [[Nicaea]]") of the [[history of early Christianity]] extended from the late [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] to the early [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th&amp;nbsp;century]]. Its end was marked by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt; Christianity during this time was extremely diverse, with many developments that are difficult to trace and follow. There is also a relative paucity of available material, and this period is less studied than the preceding [[Apostolic Age]] and the historical ages following it. Nevertheless, this part of Christian history is important because it had a significant effect upon the development of Christianity.

=== First seven ecumenical councils ===
{{See also|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}This era begins with the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which enunciated the [[Nicene Creed]] that, in its [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|original form]] and as modified by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] of 381&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt;, was seen as the touchstone of [[orthodoxy]] for the [[Trinity|doctrine of the Trinity]].

The first seven Ecumenical Councils, from the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt; ) to the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;A.D.&lt;/small&gt; ), represent an attempt to reach an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] consensus and to establish a unified [[Christendom]].

The first scholar to study this time period as a whole was [[Philip Schaff]], who wrote ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church]'', first published after his death in 1901. The topic is of particular interest to proponents of [[paleo-orthodoxy]], who seek to recover the church as it was before the [[Schism (religion)|schisms]].

=== Schools of Alexandria and Antioch ===
{{See also|Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Antioch}}As early as the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third century]], Christian hermeneutics began to split into two primary schools: the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian]] and the [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]].

The Alexandrian biblical interpretations stressed [[Allegory|allegorical]] readings, often  at the expense of the texts' literal meaning. [[Origen]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] were two major scholars in this school.

The Antiochene school stressed the literal and historical meaning of texts. [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] and [[Diodorus of Tarsus|Diodore of Tarsus]] were the primary figures in this school.

== Medieval period ==
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Christian biblical interpretations of text incorporated [[exegesis]] into a fourfold mode which emphasized the distinction between the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter and the spirit of the text]]. This schema was based on the various ways of interpreting text that were utilized by the [[Patristics|patristic writers]].
* The [[Literal and figurative language|literal sense]] (''sensus historicus'') of [[Religious text|scripture]] denotes what the text states or reports directly.
* The [[Allegory|allegorical sense]] (''sensus allegoricus'') explains text in the light of the doctrinal content of church dogma, so that each literal element has a [[symbol]]ic meaning (see also [[Typology (theology)]]).
* The [[Ethics|moral application]] of a text to the individual reader or hearer is the third sense (the ''sensus tropologicus'' or ''sensus moralis'').
* The fourth sense (''sensus anagogicus'') draws out of the text the implicit allusions it contains to secret metaphysical and eschatological knowledge, called ''[[gnosis]]''.
Biblical hermeneutics in the [[Middle Ages]] witnessed the proliferation of nonliteral interpretations of the Bible. Christian commentators could read [[Old Testament]] narratives simultaneously:
* as prefigurations of analogous [[New Testament]] episodes,
* as symbolic lessons about church institutions and current teachings,
* and as personally applicable allegories of the [[Spirit]].
In each case, the meaning of the narrative was constrained by imputing a particular intention to the Bible, such as teaching morality. But these interpretive bases were posited by the religious tradition rather than suggested by a preliminary reading of the text.

A similar fourfold mode is found in [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] writings. The four categories are:
* ''Peshat'' (simple interpretation)
* ''Remez'' (allusion)
* ''Derash'' (interpretive)
* ''Sod'' (secret or mystical)
It is uncertain whether the rabbinic categories of interpretation predate those of the patristic version. The medieval period saw the growth of many new categories of [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic interpretation]] and of exegesis of the [[Torah]]. Among these were the emergence of [[Kabbalah]] and the writings of [[Maimonides]].

{{cquote|The hermeneutical terminology used here is in part arbitrary. For almost all three interpretations which go beyond the literal explanations are in a general sense "allegorical".  The practical application of these three aspects of spiritual interpretation varied considerably. Most of the time, the fourfold sense of the Scriptures was used only partially, dependent upon the content of the text and the idea of the exegete.... We can easily notice that the basic structure is in fact a twofold sense of the Scriptures, that is, the distinction between the ''sensus literalis'' and the ''sensus spiritualis'' or ''mysticus'', and that the number four was derived from a restrictive systematization of the numerous possibilities which existed for the ''sensus spiritualis'' into three interpretive dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Ebeling, Gerhard, ''The New Hermeneutics and the Early Luther'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The customary medieval exegetical technique commented on the text in ''[[Gloss (annotation)|glossae]]'' or annotations that were written between the lines or at the side of the text (which was left with wide margins for this purpose). The text might be further commented on in ''[[scholia]]'', which are long, exegetical passages, often on a separate page.

{{History of Egypt}}
The '''history of the Republic of Egypt''' spans the period of modern [[Egypt]]ian history from the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] to the present day, which saw the toppling of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|monarchy of Egypt and Sudan]], the establishment of a presidential republic, and a period of profound economic, and political change in Egypt, and throughout the [[Arab world]]. The abolition of a monarchy and aristocracy viewed widely as sympathetic to Western interests, particularly since the ousting of Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]], over seven decades earlier, helped strengthen the authentically Egyptian character of the republic in the eyes of its supporters. From then until now Egypt has always been an independent country.

Egypt's first four [[President of Egypt|presidents]] were all drawn from professional military backgrounds, due in large part to the central role of the [[armed forces of Egypt]] in the Revolution of 1952, and oversaw authoritarian governments, with varying limits on political participation and freedom of speech. Under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the republic had an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] government, which changed to a more [[free market]]-oriented economy and less-[[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] orientation with his successors  [[Anwar el-Sadat|Anwar Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]].  In 2011 a [[2011 Egyptian revolution|revolution]] calling for more freedom overthrew Mubarak.

==Nasser era==
{{main|History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser}}

===Revolution of 1952===
{{main|Egyptian Revolution of 1952}}
On 22–26 July 1952, the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]], a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], and headed by General [[Muhammad Naguib]], initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with the overthrowing [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]], whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with [[Israel]] and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease, and illiteracy in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power, and, following a brief experiment with civilian rule, abrogated the 1953 constitution, and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President.

Within six months, all civilian political parties were banned, getting replaced by the "Liberation Rally" government party, the elites seeing a need for a "transitional authoritarianism" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class.&lt;ref name=Beattie.p4&gt;''Egypt during the Sadat years'', By Kirk J. Beattie, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; In October and November 1954 the large Islamist [[Muslim Brotherhood]] organization was suppressed and President Naguib was ousted and arrested. He was replaced by Nasser.&lt;ref name=Beattie.p4/&gt; Nasser remained president until his death in 1970.

The revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt.&lt;ref name="Marsot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot|authorlink=Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid-Marsot|title=A Short History of Modern Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhpfWRp-BL0C|accessdate=5 August 2012|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27234-6|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beattie.p2"&gt;''Egypt during the Sadat years'', By Kirk J. Beattie, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  One issue that many agreed on was the need for [[Egyptian land reform|land reform]]. Less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Assem Al-Desoky's  ''Major Landowners in Egypt: 1914-1952'' (in Arabic, Dar Al-Shorouk, Cairo, 2007. quoted in ''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  the process of [[land reform]] began on 11 September 1952, when (among many provisions) a law  prohibited ownership of more than 200 [[feddan]]s of land; limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc.

Nasser evolved into a charismatic leader, not only of Egypt but of the Arab world, promoting and implementing "[[Arab socialism]]".

===Suez Crisis and War===
{{main|Suez Crisis}}
When the United States held up military sales in reaction to Egyptian neutrality regarding the [[Soviet Union]], Nasser concluded an arms deal with [[Czechoslovakia]] in September 1955.  When the US and the [[World Bank]] withdrew their offer to help finance the [[Aswan High Dam]] in mid-1956, Nasser nationalized the privately owned [[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez|Suez Canal Company]]. The [[Suez Crisis|crisis]] that followed, exacerbated by growing tensions with Israel over guerrilla attacks from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and Israeli reprisals, support for the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]]'s war of liberation against the French in Algeria and against Britain's presence in the Arab world, resulted in the invasion of Egypt in October by France, Britain, and Israel.

In 1958 Egypt joined with the Republic of Syria to form a state called the [[United Arab Republic]]. It existed until Syria's secession in 1961, although Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971.

Nasser helped establish with India and [[Yugoslavia]] the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] of developing countries in September 1961, and continued to be a leading force in the movement until his death.

Nasser ruled as an autocrat but remained extremely popular within Egypt and throughout the Arab world due to his socialist policies at home and anti-imperialist internationalism in the region. His willingness to stand up to the Western powers and to Israel won him support throughout the region. It was partially to smash Nasser's independence that the United States armed Israel to the teeth in preparation Six Day War in 1967.

===Six-Day War===
{{main|Six-Day War}}
In May 1967, Nasser closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to passage of Israeli ships. On 26 May Nasser declared, "The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel".&lt;ref name="Mutawi2002p95"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samir A. Mutawi|title=Jordan in the 1967 War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9bBJusRJIMC&amp;pg=PA94|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52858-0|page=95|quote="On 26 May he declared, "The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel considered the Straits of Tiran closure a ''[[casus belli]]''. In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel attacked  Egypt after observing Egyptian forces mobilized on Israel's border with Egypt.  The Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armed forces were routed by the Israelis, after Nasser convinced the Syrians and Jordanians to attack Israel. Israel occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] from Egypt, [[Golan Heights]] from Syria, and the [[West Bank]] from Jordan.

This defeat was a severe blow to Nasser's prestige at home and abroad. Following the defeat, Nasser made a dramatic offer to resign, which was only retracted in the face of mass demonstrations urging him to stay. The last three years of his control over Egypt were far more subdued.

===Education===
Educational opportunities were "dramatically expanded" after the revolution.  The Free Officers pledged to provide free education for all citizens and abolished all fees for public schools. They doubled the Ministry of Education's budget in one decade; government spending on education grew from less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1952-53 to more than 5 percent by 1978. Expenditures on school construction increased 1,000 percent between 1952 and 1976, and the total number of primary schools doubled to 10,000. By the mid-1970s, the educational budget represented more than 25 percent of the government's total current budget expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/egypt/71.htm EDUCATION] from Country Study of Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sadat era==
{{main|Sadat era}}
After Nasser's death, another of the "[[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|free officers]]", then Vice President [[Anwar el-Sadat]], acceded to the office of the Presidency.  He was not elected democratically.

In 1971, Sadat concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, but a year later he ordered Soviet advisers to leave. Nevertheless, up to 4,000 military Soviet advisers were being shared with Syria, and Soviet engineers continued to maintain Egyptian military radar and equipment during the October War.

===1973 War===
In 1973, Sadat launched the [[Yom Kippur War|6 October 1973 war]] with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, BD. ''The USSR in Third World Conflicts'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's armed forces achieved initial successes in [[Operation Badr (1973)|the Crossing]] of the Suez Canal and advanced 15&amp;nbsp;km, reaching the depth of the range of safe coverage of its own air force. 

Having defeated the Israeli forces to this extent, Egyptian forces, rather than advancing under air cover, decided to immediately penetrate further into the Sinai desert. In spite of huge losses they kept advancing, creating the chance to open a gap between army forces.  That gap was exploited by a tank division led by [[Ariel Sharon]], and he and his tanks managed to penetrate onto Egyptian soil, reaching [[Suez|Suez City]].&lt;ref name="countrystudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/egypt/41.htm |title=Egypt - October 1973 War |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel was stunned by the attack but recuperated by infusion of weaponry from the U.S. Arab oil producers announced a boycott of Western backers of Israel: a 5% cut in output, to be followed by reductions every month until Israel had withdrawn from all the occupied territories and the rights of the Palestinians had been restored. A UN resolution supported by the United States and the Soviet Union called for an end to hostilities and for peace talks to begin.  For President Anwar Sadat, however, the war was much more a victory than a draw, as the Egyptian successes restored Egyptian pride and led to peace talks with the Israelis and to Egypt regaining the entire Sinai peninsula.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

===International relations and the Camp David Accords===
[[Image:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|Celebrating the signing of the Camp David Accords: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar El Sadat|Anwar Al Sadat]].]]
In foreign relations Sadat also launched momentous change from the Nasser era. President Sadat shifted Egypt from a policy of confrontation with Israel to one of peaceful accommodation through negotiations. Following the [[Sinai Disengagement Agreements (disambiguation)|Sinai Disengagement Agreements]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; of 1974 and 1975, Sadat created a fresh opening for progress by his dramatic visit to [[Jerusalem]] in November 1977. This led to the invitation from President [[Jimmy Carter]] of the United States to President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] to enter trilateral negotiations at Camp David.

The outcome was the historic [[Camp David accord]]s, signed by Egypt and Israel and witnessed by the US on 17 September 1978. The accords led to the 26 March 1979, signing of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]], by which Egypt regained control of the Sinai in May 1982. Throughout this period, [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|US–Egyptian relations]] steadily improved, and Egypt became one of America's largest recipients of foreign aid.  Sadat's willingness to break ranks by making peace with Israel earned him the enmity of most other Arab states, however. In 1977, Egypt fought a [[Libyan-Egyptian War|short border war]] with Libya.

===Domestic policy and the Infitah===
Sadat used his immense popularity with the Egyptian people to try to push through vast economic reforms that ended the [[Arab socialism|socialist controls]] of [[Nasserism]].  Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new economic policy, the most important aspect of which was the [[infitah]] or "open door" that relaxed government controls over the economy and encouraged private investment. While the reforms created a wealthy and successful upper class and a small middle class, these reforms had little effect upon the average Egyptian who began to grow dissatisfied with Sadat's rule. In 1977, Infitah policies led to massive [[1977 Egyptian Bread Riots|spontaneous riots ('Bread Riots')]] involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs.

Liberalization also included the reinstitution of due process and the legal banning of torture.  Sadat dismantled much of the existing [[political machine]] and brought to trial a number of former government officials accused of criminal excesses during the Nasser era. Sadat tried to expand participation in the political process in the mid-1970s but later abandoned this effort. In the last years of his life, Egypt was wracked by violence arising from discontent with Sadat's rule and sectarian tensions, and it experienced a renewed measure of repression including extra judicial arrests.

== Mubarak era==
{{main|Mubarak era}}
On 6 October 1981, [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|President Sadat was assassinated]] by Islamic extremists. [[Hosni Mubarak]], Vice President since 1975 and air force commander during the October 1973 war, was elected president later that month. He was subsequently "re-elected" by referendum for three more 6-year terms, most recently in September 2005, all but the 2005 vote lacking any competing candidate.

Mubarak maintained Egypt's commitment to the Camp David peace process, but was able to coax Arab countries into resuming diplomatic relations with Egypt and re-establishing Egypt's position as an Arab leader. Egypt was readmitted to the [[Arab League]] in 1989. Egypt also has played a moderating role in such international forums as the UN and the Nonaligned Movement.

[[Image:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of present-day [[Cairo]], as seen from the [[Cairo Tower]].]]
From 1991, Mubarak undertook an ambitious domestic economic reform program to reduce the size of the public sector and expand the role of the private sector.

During the 1990s, a series of International Monetary Fund arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in the [[Gulf War]] coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance. During the 1990s and 2000s, inflation was lowered from double-digit to single digit rate. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) increased fourfold between 1981 and 2006, from US$1355 in 1981, to US$2525 in 1991, to US$3686 in 2001 and to an estimated US$4535 in 2006. Despite this, most Egyptians suffered a drop in their standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.130-1&lt;/ref&gt;

There was much less progress in political reform. The November [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 People's Assembly elections]] saw 34 members of the opposition win seats in the 454-seat assembly, facing a clear majority of 388 affiliated with the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP). A constitutional amendment in May 2005 changed the presidential election to a multicandidate popular vote rather than a popular validation of a candidate nominated by the People’s Assembly and on 7 September Mubarak [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|was elected]] for another six-year term with 87 percent of the popular vote, followed by a distant but strong showing by [[Ayman Nour]], leader of the opposition [[El-Ghad Party|Ghad Party]] and a well-known rights activist.
Shortly after mounting an unprecedented presidential campaign, Nour was jailed on forgery charges critics called phony; he was released on 18 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/02/18/66736.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219170414/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/02/18/66736.html |date=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brotherhood members were allowed to run for parliament in 2005 as independents, garnering 88 seats, or 20 percent of the People’s Assembly.

The [[List of political parties in Egypt|opposition parties]] have been weak and divided and are not yet credible alternatives to the NDP. The [[Muslim Brotherhood]], founded in Egypt in 1928, remains an illegal organization and may not be recognized as a political party (current Egyptian law prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion). Members are known publicly and openly speak their views. Members of the Brotherhood have been elected to the People's Assembly and local councils as independents. The Egyptian political opposition also includes groups and popular movements such as [[Kefaya]] and the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], although they are somewhat less organized than officially registered political parties. Bloggers, or cyberactivists as [[Courtney C. Radsch]] termed them, have also played an important political opposition role, writing, organizing, and mobilizing public opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/?article=692 Arab Media &amp; Society]. Arabmediasociety.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Mubarak had tight, autocratic control over Egypt. A dramatic drop in support for Mubarak, or a dramatic increase in people dissatisfied with his practices and his domestic economic reform program increased with surfacing news about his son [[Alaa Mubarak|Alaa]] being extremely corrupt and favored in government tenders and privatization. As Alaa started getting out of the picture by 2000, Mubarak’s second son [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]] started rising in the National Democratic Party and succeeded in getting a newer generation of neo-liberals into the party and eventually the government. Gamal Mubarak branched out with a few colleagues to set up Medinvest Associates Ltd., which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winne.com/topinterviews/gamal.htm Interview with MR.

== Civil unrest since 2011 ==
{{main|Egyptian Crisis (2011–present)}}

===2011 revolution===
{{main|Egyptian Revolution of 2011}}

Beginning on 25 January 2011, a series of street demonstrations, protests, and civil disobedience acts  took place in Egypt, with organizers counting on the [[2010–2011 Tunisian protests|Tunisian uprising]] to inspire the crowds to mobilize. The demonstrations and riots were reported to have started over [[police brutality]], [[state of emergency]] laws, [[unemployment]], desire to raise the [[minimum wage]], lack of housing, [[food inflation]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], lack of [[freedom of speech]], and poor living conditions.&lt;ref name="Egypt braces for nationwide protests"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jailan Zayan |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hP30nA0bbEaHZKjlpUKhdHxoN8Cg?docId=CNG.95111380dfbe35f8a08d6124c5e915e8.71 |title=AFP – Egypt braces for nationwide protests |publisher=AFP |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests' main goal at the beginning was mainly to protest against the above-mentioned problems, but due to the reactions of the system which was considered late, inadequate and inconvenient the demonstrations started to develop and evolve so that the goal was to oust President Mubarak's regime. Most observers and analysts noticed a unique feature about the revolution that it did not have any leader and it is a clear example of "The [[wisdom of the crowd]]". On 11 February 2011, President Mubarak resigned, relinquishing power to an interim military authority.&lt;ref name="Mubarak resigns"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/11/AR2011021102386.html |title=Mubarak resigns; hands power to military |work= The Washington Post|accessdate= |first=Craig |last=Whitlock |date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, followed Mubarak's resignation.

=== First transition ===
{{main|Timeline of the Egyptian Crisis under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces}}

The military provisional government, under [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], initiated reforms. [[2011 Egyptian constitutional referendum|Constitutional referendum]] was held; a provisional constitution came to force. [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012|Parliamentary free elections]] were held. A [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt|constituent assembly]], founded on 26 March 2012, started to work for implementing a new constitution. [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|The first free presidential elections]] were held in March–June 2012, with a runoff between former Prime Minister [[Ahmed Shafik]] and [[Muslim Brotherhood]] parliamentarian [[Mohamed Morsi]]. On 24 June 2012, Egypt's election commission announced that Morsi had won the run-off.

=== Morsi's presidency ===
{{main|Timeline of the Egyptian Crisis under Mohamed Morsi}}

On 8 July 2012, Egypt's new president Mohamed Morsi announced he was overriding the military edict that dissolved the country's elected parliament and he called lawmakers back into session.&lt;ref name="Fahmy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahmy|first=Mohamed|title=Egypt's president calls back dissolved parliament|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/08/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2012, the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] negated the decision by President Mohamed Morsi to call the nation's parliament back into session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Court overrules Egypt's president on parliament|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/10/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 2 August 2012, Egypt’s Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the influential [[Muslim Brotherhood]], six others and the former military ruler [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] as the Defence Minister from the previous  Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= |title= Egypt unveils new cabinet, Tantawi keeps defence post | date= 3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2012, President Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20451208 |title=Egypt's President Mursi assumes sweeping powers |publisher=BBC News |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution.  Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while [[Muslim Brotherhood]] backers threw their support behind Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-22-11-27-48 |title=Rallies for, against Egypt president's new powers |work=Associated Press |date=23 November |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was criticized by [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], the leader of Egypt's Constitution Party, who stated "Morsi today usurped all state powers &amp; appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh" on his Twitter feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ElBaradei/status/271656968341581824 | title = Twitter / ELBaradei | date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt's President Morsi takes sweeping new powers &amp;#124;publisher"Washington Post |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypts-president-morsi-takes-sweeping-new-powers/2012/11/22/8d87d716-34cb-11e2-92f0-496af208bf23_story.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Michael |last=Birnbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name="violencebreaks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9699801/Violence-breaks-out-across-Egypt-as-protesters-decry-Mohammed-Morsis-constitutional-coup.html|first=Richard|last=Spencer|date=23 November 2012|accessdate=23 November 2012|title=Violence breaks out across Egypt as protesters decry Mohammed Morsi's constitutional 'coup'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2012, Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324640104578160902530961768 |title = Egypt Sees Largest Clash Since Revolution |publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six senior advisors and three other officials resigned from the government and the country's leading Islamic institution called on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal cities to desert towns.&lt;ref name="LaTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-egypt-morsi-20121207,0,2119116.story|title =Morsi refuses to cancel Egypt's vote on constitution|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012|first=Jeffrey|last=Fleishman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morsi offered a "national dialogue" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamist-dominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest.&lt;ref name="LaTimes"/&gt;

A constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against. It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012.

On 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July, General [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]], head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed President Morsi from power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and appointed [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt|Supreme Constitutional Court]]'s leader, [[Adly Mansour]] as acting president. Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 2013.

During the months after the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|coup d'état]], a [[Egyptian Constitution of 2014|new constitution]] was prepared, which took effect on 18 January 2014. After that, [[Egyptian presidential election, 2014|presidential]] and [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015|parliamentary]] elections have to be held within 6 months.

On 24 March 2014, 529 of Morsi's supporters were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://zpravy.ihned.cz/svet/c1-61906190-egypt-muslimske-bratrstvo-tribunal-odsoudil-529-egyptanu-k-smrti| title= Soud s islamisty v Egyptě: Na popraviště půjde více než 500 Mursího stoupenců| author = Czech News Agency| publisher = IHNED.cz| date= 2014-03-24|accessdate = 2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 28 April, the verdict against all except 37 of them was changed to life sentence, but another nearly 700 Islamists including the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Mohammed Badie]] were sentenced to death. As of 28 April, the [[Mohamed Morsi#Trial|trial of Morsi]] is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/soud-v-egypte-vynesl-za-protesty-trest-smrti-nad-skoro-700-lidmi/1072887|title= Soud v Egyptě vynesl za protesty trest smrti nad skoro 700 lidmi|author=Czech News Agency|publisher=ceskenoviny.cz|date=2014-04-28|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improvised nuclear devices'''&lt;ref&gt;https://responder.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/training/SG-NCR-Awareness-Briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or (INDs)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1919-25045-0618/communicating_in_the_immediate_aftermath__final_june_2013_508_ok.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muskegonhealth.net/publications/fact_sheets/ind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/pdf/infographic_improvised_nuclear_device.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; are theoretical illicit [[nuclear weapon]]s bought, stolen, or otherwise originating from a nuclear state, or a weapon fabricated by a [[terrorist group]] from illegally obtained fissile nuclear weapons material that produces a nuclear explosion. An IND could be bought, or it could be built from the components of a stolen weapon or from scratch using nuclear material ([[plutonium]], [[uranium]], or highly [[enriched uranium]]).  A successful detonation would result in catastrophic loss of life, destruction of infrastructure, and nuclear contamination of a very large area.

== Types ==
One type of an improvised nuclear device, could be conducted by terrorists with radiological materials using a radiological dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “[[dirty bomb]].”&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41890.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fs-dirty-bombs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.uml.edu/bleblanc/44.212/pdf/Microsoft_PowerPoint_-_DirtyBombs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An RDD causes no nuclear explosion but instead uses chemical explosive to spread harmful radioactivity. It could cause severe economic disruption and panic in an urban area, without causing large numbers of fatalities. Due to their common use in industry, agriculture, and medicine, these materials would be easier for terrorists to obtain.

[[Nanotechnology]] can theoretically be used to develop miniaturised [[laser]]-triggered [[pure fusion weapon]]s that will be easier to produce than conventional nuclear weapons and could be used in terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/17/mini-nukes-and-inspect-bot-weapons-being-primed-for-future-warfare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations ==

The INDs when built from scratch would most likely be of [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which is fairly easy to design and manufacture (however, requiring highly [[enriched uranium]]).

Improvised nuclear devices are likely to cause more [[nuclear fallout]] because of incomplete fission - due to overengineering the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] (making it heavier to ensure [[Nuclear fission|fission]] occurs at least in part of it), using the gun-type design or as a result of a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] (yield lower than planned due to engineering/manufacturing errors) — and are likely to be [[Groundburst|exploded at ground level]] rather than [[Air burst| at an altitude]], which causes ground materials to be irradiated and drawn up into the [[mushroom cloud]].

The '''Institut Nova Història''' (INH) is a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cultural [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] with headquarters in [[Barcelona]]. Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer [[Jordi Bilbeny]], hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or "Castilian") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. They claim that major historical figures, including [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] and others were Catalan. The institute's work has been criticised as [[pseudohistory]].

The institute promotes research, study and dissemination of ideas about Catalan influence on history through publications, conferences and symposia, in particular the annual "Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America" in [[Arenys de Munt]]. It is funded by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan autonomous government]], and has received support from [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] politicians.

The INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish ("Castilian") state. By minimising the role of Catalonia—or the [[Crown of Aragon]]—in Spanish collective history through falsification, concealment and censorship or "appropriation" of certain historical episodes, the prevalence of Castilian ideology is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pere Forès i Malleu|first=Pere|title = Esborrant la traça catalana|magazine=Presència|location=Barcelona|number=2021|date=19 November 2010|pages=28–31|id= GI-143-1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its claims are:

A history rewritten by the Castilians'', noting that the books published by the INH "are very convincing", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, [[Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira]], participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's ''Brief account of the destruction of history'', where he spoke in praise of the book.&lt;ref name=EC140804&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernández|first=A.|title=Jordi Pujol y Carod se suman a la teoría de que Colón y los Pinzón eran catalanes|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2014-07-03/jordi-pujol-y-carod-se-suman-a-la-teoria-de-que-colon-y-los-pinzon-eran-catalanes_155815/|work=El Confidencial|date=3 July 2014|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 INH symposium in [[Arenys de Munt]], under the title "The Catalan Discovery of America", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and [[Arenys de Mar]], together with associations such as the {{lang|ca|Ateneu Independentista}} of Arenys de Munt. [[Muriel Casals i Couturier|Muriel Casals]], representative of the separatist coalition [[Junts pel Sí]], gave the closing speech entitled "From the erased past to political independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruiz Coll|first=M.A.|title=ERC reúne a 40 historiadores con dinero público para demostrar que Da Vinci, Marco Polo, Colón y Cervantes eran catalanes|url=https://okdiario.com/espana/cataluna/2015/11/25/erc-reune-a-40-historiadores-con-dinero-publico-para-demostrar-que-da-vinci-marco-polo-colon-y-cervantes-eran-catalanes-28378|work=ok diario| language=Spanish|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INH members have given talks on their theories in the main Catalan government-owned television and radio channels such as [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] and [[Catalunya Ràdio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/el-documental/desmuntant-leonardo/video/5561885/|title=Desmuntant Leonardo|author=[[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prkiy0K0Cuk|publisher=youtube|title=Entrevista Mònica Terribas: Bilbeny/Grau (1/4) histocat.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Punt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cat Radio"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The INH has been described by one academic as "a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile".&lt;ref name=Rodríguez&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodríguez López-Abadía |first=Arturo |date=2014 |title=The origins of Christopher Columbus, a never-ending controversy |url=https://www.academia.edu/9952462/The_origins_of_Christopher_Columbus_a_never-ending_controversy |journal=Revista Internacional Digilec|volume=Vol. 1|number=1|pages=1 to 10 |issn=2386-6691|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sallés|first=Quico|title = C's: «És ridícul dir que Cristòfol Colom és català»|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/67614/es/ridicul/dir/cristofol/colom/catala|work= NacióDigital.cat|date =22 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javier Barraycoa, vice-chancellor of the [[Abat Oliba CEU University]], former secretary of the {{ill|Carlist Traditionalist Communion|ca|Comunió Tradicionalista Carlista}} in Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Directorio General de la Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|url=http://www.carlistas.es/descargas/organigrama.pdf|website=Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista| language=Spanish|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the anti-Catalanist organisation [[Somatemps]], said that the INH "has absolutely no recognition in the academic world" and that its members "have not been invited to any serious congress because it is impossible for them to defend these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Rosalina|title=Barraycoa: ‘Cataluña vive un delirio colectivo’|url=http://www.gaceta.es/noticias/cataluna-vive-delirio-colectivo-10072014-1128|work=La Gaceta |date=10 July 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José María Ramos Mejía''' (1849–1914) was a politician and historian of Argentina.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1849, son of colonel [[Matías Ramos Mejía]] and Francisca Madero. He made studies of medicine, promoting changes to the academic standards in 1871, which would be achieved between 1873 and 1880. He graduated in 1879, with a thesis about [[brain trauma]].

He kept working at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and headed the newly created professorship of nerve pathology in 1887. He made further studies of nerve and mental pathology, being considered later as one of the first researchers of [[psychiatry]] in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; He was vicepresident of the Buenos Aires municipal commission in 1882, first director of public assistance in 1883, national deputee between 1888 and 1892, head of the National department of hygiene between 1893 and 1899, and president of the National Council of Education. He died in 1914.

===Work as historian===
His first book, "''Neurosis de los hombres célebres en la historia argentina''" ({{lang-es|Neurosis of noteworthy men in the history of Argentina}}) was started during his studies, and published in 1887. His work was influenced by [[Vicente Fidel López]], and influenced later historians as [[José Ingenieros]], [[Lucio López]] and [[Luis Agote]].

As a historian, he rejected the current tradition of making studies of history with the point of view fixed on elites or notable key people, but rather on the social groups that promoted those peoples into importance. He considered the [[Argentine War of Independence]] as the result of romantic peoples, the [[Argentine Civil War]] as the result of aggressive peoples, and his own time period of 1890 as the result of passive peoples.

He included [[Phrenology|phrenologist]] analysis of historical peoples, as part of a new wave of [[Positivism|positivist]] historians that sought to combine history with science.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; However, phrenology is currently rejected as a pseudo-science.

==Works==

* Las multitudes argentinas (1899)
* La locura en la historia. Contribución al estudio psicopatológico del fanatismo religioso y sus persecuciones (1895)

==Biography==
In 1818, after the death of his father, Odriozola was left in charge of the upkeep of the home. He did calligraphy work entrusted to him by an employee of the Virreunal Secretariat to provide for himself financially. Two years later, upon learning of the landing of the  [[Expedición Libertadora del Perú|Expedición Libertadora]] (Liberation Expedition), he went to [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]] to join it, being one of the first patriots to do so. Within a year he was promoted to cavalry lieutenant. He participated in the Proclamation of Independence and was stationed in [[Callao District|Callao]] until the surrender of the realists. Shortly thereafter, in 1822, he was ascended to the position of Captain and the following participated in the [[Zepita District|Zepita]] Battle. However, upon the advance of the realists, he quickly migrated to [[Trujillo District|Trujillo]], where he continued to contribute to public life.

In 1887, at the age of 26, returned to the seminary in Caltagirone and September 21, 1889, was ordained a priest by Xavier Gerbino, previously the Bishop of Piazza Armerina.
He was rector of the seminary of Caltagirone in 1890-1891 and among his pupils was his brother Luigi, whom he helped to reach priesthood. He was later appointed canon of the Cathedral of Caltagirone and then vicar general. In 1894 he coordinated the work of the first diocesan synod. In his priestly activity he collaborated with his brother Louis to promote the Catholic movement Calatino. In 1895 the first interparochial committee of organization of congresses in St. George’s parish, with the youth section “St. Philip Neri”, the workers section, St. Joseph" and the agricultural section, “St. Isidor”. In 1897 he collaborated in the redaction of the Catholic movement Calatino review, “The Cross of Constantine”, in which he published three novels of the popular-moralistic character with the pseudonymEneleo in the appendix. Moreover, he wrote 27 sketches which highlight his initial inclination for Christianity embodied in the story.

===Activities as a bishop===
In 1903 Pope Leo XIII appointed him Bishop of Piazza Armerina and was consecrated in the cathedral of Catania by Cardinal Francesco Nava July 19, took possession of the diocese on 11 October and made the solemn entry on 15 November 1904.
In his first pastoral letter, of November 1903, he maintains, on the wake of the thought of his brother Luigi’s thought, that, for obtaining salvation of souls one cannot ignore so as to pursue interests of the body, through a commitment in the renewal of the society in the light of the social teaching of the church. He realized a general reorganization of the diocesan clergy and erected numerous parishes in almost all the twelve town councils of the diocese. He refounded the diocesan monthly bulletin, changing the title from “Gleaning” to “The Angel of the Family”. His episcopal activities were carried on, in the periodic pastoral visits, in the celebration of meetings of “Catholic Action”, in the Lenten preachings and retreats and in the conference for teachers and professionals. He reformed morally and materially the diocesan seminary, closed temporarily from 1904 to 1907 and from 1920 he started his activity of teaching in the internal school of the seminary. He founded in the diocese the priestly congregation of the Oblates of Mary, on the example required by Carlo Borromeo, for which he laid the constitutions and of which he organized the common life. In the villages of his diocese he favoured the rise of rural banks and other Catholic Social works. Some local officials accused him to the Holy See of modernism and socialism and was sent to the diocese as apostolic visitor, Charles Joseph Cecchini, who wrote to pope Pius X on 19 August 1907 a letter accompanied by a positive report on his reforms. He established in Piazza Armerina a Catholic School named after Prospero Intorcetta. He wrote numerous pastoral letters in which a cross-recurring theme was that of the family and moral education. He also wrote on the theme of psychological intense activity of the conversion and outlined a theology of the laity. For a decade he was also a secretary of the Sicilian Episcopal Conference and spread some collective pastoral letters. In 1937 he addressed at Enna the first Congress of the parish.

===Activities as a scholar===

He was interested in philosophical studies, attempting to rinnovate the Scholastic Philosophy with the aim of putting the contemporary culture at the service of God and of the church as an apostolate instrument. From 1915 he collaborated with the neo-scholastic review. And critically confronted with some of the main exponents of the Western Philosophy, including Maurice Blondel, Etienne Gilson and Benedetto Croce, opposed to positivism and idealism. In 1927, after making contacts with scholars of the Catholic Institute in Paris and in Milan, with Fr. Agostino Gemelli, he founded in Piazza armerina a Literary-Philosophical Review (Review of Autoformation), that resumed faithfully in format and in the graphic the review, “Critic of Benedetto Croce”. He himself taught literature and philosophy, publishing notes which later on were collected in volumes.

===Correspondences in exile and relations with the fascist regime===
During the exile of his brother Luigi, former secretary of the Italian Popular Party, he exchanged with him many letters in which they discussed philosophy, theology, literature and mysticism. They loved and respected one another, but they criticized each other and at the same time strengthening one another spiritually. From those letters emerges despite the difference of their personality and of their personal histories, their profounding spirituality- the common anxiety of sanctity, the great intellectual approach and pastoral charity which led them to deepen the cultural and social relevance of the faith lived in the internal of the church. The two brothers do not write about politics just as “special surveillants” of the fascist regime. In the central archive of the State there are over a thousand sheets that refer to Sturzo don Luigi, was Felix, anti fascist. For Mario exist about three hundred sheets in the same archive in two funds. Mons. Mario Sturzo had an uncompromising attitude toward the fascist regime attracting ungenerous slanders and veiled persecutions which he endured with firmness and evangelical patience as ensues from the documentation preserved in the central archive of the state.

==Philosophy and neo-syntheticism==
The initial aspect from which Sturzo begins his philosophical research is the “thought relation-action. Surely the action will be worthy of admiration only if it will have philosophical foundation and anthropological objective. For Sturzo there will be no true philosophical research if not in the history and at the service of the same, philosophy becomes almost the methodology of history in the sense that it gives method in living and in reading the same. “Sturzo, writes Salvatore Latora in opposition-dialogue with the modern philosophy goes on elaborating its philosophical system- the neo-synthetism, which inspired in a critical manner I. Kant and A. Rosmini , wants  to propose a new form  of classical realism and christian, supporting the thesis of priority of synthesis on analysis, which has at its centre man” (Latora Salvatore, Sturzo Mario, in ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Thinkers and of Theologians of Sicily, 19th and 20th Centuries'', vol. VI, Salvatore Sciascia editor, Caltanisetta- Rome, 2010, 3062). The comparison with the epistemological subjectivism and the historicism of the “neo-Italian idealists” led him to grant a privilege to the role of the subject in the known process in a synthesis between immanence and transcendence, between natural and supernatural.

==Call by the Holy See==
His life was not of easy paths or foreseen, indeed, his activity of philosophical research, had disapproval of the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the time. In 1931 there was a call of Holy Office of 17 January and came to be published an editorial of Catholic Civilization in which the content and language of Sturzo’s thought were criticized as they seemed to be closer to the neo-idealism of Cross and Gentile which are not to the Scholastic and Thomistic philosophy. They also criticize even his doctrine on knowledge, as also the concepts of philosophy and history. The explicit call of Holy Office put an end to the activity of the “Autoreformation Review” and brought the bishop to the public retraction in cathedral, after the solemn pontifical mass of 8 April 1931. On 19 of the same month the “Osservatore Romano” published the news, leaving his brother Luigi, who was from London in darkness of all stunned. Immediately after this order from the part of the Holy See, Mons. Sturzo suspended the publication of the “Autoreformation Review” because, as he writes to his brother “in it, it is seen not as a service but a struggle”.

'''Osip Maksimovich Bodyansky''' (Осип Максимович Бодянский; 1808–1877) was a notable [[Slavist]] in the [[Russian Empire]] of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ethnicity who studied and taught at the [[Moscow University]]. Bodyansky's close friends included [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]], and [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]]. He was elected a corresponding member of the [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1854.

==Biography==
Bodyansky was born in the [[Poltava]] [[guberniya]], and, as a student in Moscow, entered [[Nikolai Stankevich|Stankevich]]'s circle of intellectuals. After getting his master's degree, he was at work rummaging obscure libraries and archives of [[Little Russia]]. Such activities brought to light a splattering of important documents, such as the illustrated ''[[Peresopnytsia Gospels]]'' and the controversial ''[[History of the Rus]]''.

Bodyansky's publication of [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder|Giles Fletcher]]'s sketch of [[Muscovy]]  was deemed an act of [[Russophobia]] and incurred the displeasure of [[Tsar Nicholas I]], leading to the scholar's departure from Moscow to [[Kazan]]. In his 30s, Bodyansky travelled in the [[Slavic countries]] on behalf of the Russian government, in order to study their languages, literature, and societies. Having for long moved in [[Slavophile]] and [[Pan-Slavist]] circles, he spent some time working in [[Prague]] with Šafárik. Upon his return he became professor in Moscow, where he died in 1878. His tomb is in the [[Novodevichy Convent]].

Bodyansky was one of the first serious scholars of the [[Ukrainian language]] and wrote some amateur poetry in his native tongue. His master's dissertation involved a comparison of Ukrainian and Russian folks songs. Bodyansky's chief work was editing the ''Treatises of the Moscow Society for Russian History and Antiquities'' (1846–49 and 1858–78). Of his own works, notable are ''On the Folk Poetry of the Slavic Tribes'' (1837) and ''On the Time of Origin of the Slavic Script'' (1855).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">The '''Personnel Reliability Program''' (PRP) is a [[United States Department of Defense]] security, medical and [[psychological]] evaluation program, designed to permit only the most trustworthy individuals to have access to [[nuclear weapons]] (NPRP), [[chemical weapons]] (CPRP), and [[biological weapons]] (BPRP).

The program was first instituted for nuclear weapons during the [[Cold War]]; it was later extended to the realm of chemical and biological workers.  Among its goals are, (Quoting from DOD Directive 5210.42)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The Department of Defense shall support the national security of the United States by maintaining an effective nuclear deterrent while protecting the public health, safety, and environment.  For that reason, nuclear-weapons require special consideration because of their policy implications and military importance, their destructive power, and the political consequences of an accident or an unauthorized act.  The safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are of paramount importance to the security of the United States.
# Nuclear weapons shall not be subject to loss, theft, sabotage, unauthorized use, unauthorized destruction, unauthorized disablement, jettison, or accidental damage.
# Only those personnel who have demonstrated the highest degree of individual reliability for allegiance, trustworthiness, conduct, behavior, and responsibility shall be allowed to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons, and they shall be continuously evaluated for adherence to PRP standards.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PRP evaluates many aspects of the individual's work life and home life.  Any disruption of these, or severe deviation from an established norm would be cause to deny access.  The denial might be temporary or permanent.  However, the policy does explicitly state, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The denial of eligibility or the revocation of certification for assignment to PRP positions is neither a punitive measure nor the basis for disciplinary action.  The failure of an individual to be certified for assignment to PRP duties does not necessarily reflect unfavorably on the individual's suitability for assignment to other duties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In certain instances officers and enlisted personnel certified under PRP have been punitively punished for information that also disqualifies them from the program. The suspension from, or indeed the permanent removal of an individual from the program in it itself does not represent a punitive measure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''Peter Hafftiz''' (also ''Haftiz''; ''Petrus Haftitius, Hafftitius'', c.  1525 &amp;ndash; c. 1601) was a [[early modern Germany|German]] educator and historiographer. 
From 1550 he was teacher at the schools of [[St. Nicholas' Church, Berlin|St. Nicolai]] and [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin|St. Marien]] in [[Berlin]], from 1560 as rector.
He received Berlin citizenship in 1564. From 1577 to 1580 he was rector in the public school of [[Cölln]].

His major work is a chronicle of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], probably begun after 1593, which is in part based on the earlier chronicles of [[Engelbert Wusterwitz]] and [[Andreas Angelus]]. The chronicle is extant in a number of manuscripts in his hand, under various titles, among others ''Microchronicon Marchium'', and in a number of later manuscript copies.
 
Minor works by Hafftiz include ''De vita et obitu Joachimi II. S. R. I. archicamerarii [...] ac d. Johannis fratris march. Br.'' (1571),  ''Liber de extremo iudicio'' (1576),  ''Ecloga in obitum Augusti el. Saxoniae'' (1586), ''Tractat vom Adel u. dessen Ursprung'' (1587 manuscript).

Hafftiz' ''Microchronicon Marchium'' was edited in 1862, from a manuscript beginning with the year 1411, in [[Adolph Friedrich Johann Riedel|Riedel]]'s ''Codex Diplomaticus Brandenburgensis'' (vol. IV.1, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=WzpsyuNGAAkC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 46]–168).

'''Pietro Luigi Galletti''' was an Italian [[Benedictine]], historian and archaeologist; b. Rome in 1724; d. there, 13 December 1790. 

==Biography==
He was educated in Rome where he entered the Order of St. Benedict. While a monk in the Abbey of [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|St. Paul Without the Walls]], he made a collection of the numerous ancient inscriptions used in the pavement of the floor of the famous basilica or scattered among the cloister buildings and in the surrounding vineyards. These became soon the nucleus of a classified museum of Christian and Pagan inscriptions. Later on he became keeper of the archives and librarian of the Benedictines in [[Florence]]. [[Pius VI]] bestowed various benefices on him and made him titular Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |noicon=1 |last=Kirsch |first=J.P.|wstitle=Pietro Luigi Galletti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His collection of inscriptions and his works on the higher papal officials of the old [[Lateran Palace]] remained authoritative for some time. His writings were directed to widely divergent periods and spheres of historical and archaeological research. On Roman antiquity he wrote: ''Capena, municipio dei Romani'' (Rome, 1756), and ''Gabbio, antica città di Sabina, scoperta ove era Torri'' (Rome, 1757). His two works ''Del Vestarario della santa Romana chiesa'' (Rome, 1758), and ''Del Primicerio della S. Sede Apostolica e di altri Uffiziali Maggiori del Sacro Palazzo Lateranense'' (Rome, 1776) deal with the early history of the [[Roman Curia]]. The latter work is especially thorough and important. Among his contributions to the history of the religious orders the following are noteworthy: ''Lettera intorno la vera e sicura origine del ven. ordine di S. Girolamo'' (Rome, 1755), and ''Raggionamento dell'origine e de'primi tempi dell'abbadia Fiorentina'' (Rome, 1773). He was the author of a biography of the bishops of [[Viterbo]], ''Lettera a Giannantonio Bersetta sopra alcuni vescovi di Viterbo'' (Rome, 1759), and of Cardinal [[Domenico Silvio Passionei]], ''Memorie per servire alla storia della vita del card. Domenico Passionei'' (Rome, 1762). His work on three early churches of [[Rieti]] deals with Christian archaeology: ''Memoria di tre antiche chiese di Riete, S. Michele Arcangelo, S. Agata alla Rocca, S. Giacomo'' (Rome, 1765). Finally, he produced first great collection of medieval inscriptions, treated as a source of historical information. His ''Inscriptiones Venetae infimi aevi Romae exstantes'' (Rome, 1757) was followed in the same series by the inscriptions found in Rome concerning [[Bologna]], Rome itself (3 vols.), the [[March of Ancona]], and [[Piedmont]], in all seven volumes (1757–66).&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

'''Rawalpindi''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|راولپِنڈى}}}}, ''{{transl|ur|Rāwalpiṇḍī}}''), commonly known as '''Pindi''' ({{lang-pa|{{nq|پِنڈی}}}}), is a city in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Rawalpindi is adjacent to Pakistan's capital of [[Islamabad]], and the two are jointly known as the "[[twin cities]]" on account strong social and economic links between the cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//tables/POPULATION%20SIZE%20AND%20GROWTH%20OF%20MAJOR%20CITIES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Rawalpindi is the [[List of Pakistani cities by population|fourth-largest]] city in Pakistan by population, while the larger [[Islamabad Rawalpindi metropolitan area]] is the country's third-largest metropolitan area.

Rawalpindi is located on the [[Pothohar Plateau]], known for its ancient Buddhist heritage, especially in the neighbouring town of [[Taxila]] - a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/08/26/city/islamabad/rawalpindi-history-behind-a-bustling-city/ |title= Rawalpindi: History behind a bustling city |date= 2012-08-26 |access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was destroyed during the invasion of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] before being taken over by [[Gakhars]] in 1493. In 1765, the ruling Gakhars were defeated as the city came under Sikh rule, and eventually became a major city within the [[Sikh Empire]] based in [[Lahore]]. The city fell to the [[British Raj]] in 1849, and in 1851 became the largest [[Garrison|garrison town]] for the [[British Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/08/26/city/islamabad/rawalpindi-history-behind-a-bustling-city/|title=Rawalpindi: History behind a bustling city|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[partition of British India]] in 1947, the city became home to the [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|headquarters]] of [[Pakistan Army]] hence retaining its status as a major military city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1215003|title=What is being built on GHQ land?|last=Junaidi|first=Ikram|date=2015-10-23|website=www.dawn.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/32513/the-lost-jewish-history-of-rawalpindi/|title=The lost Jewish history of Rawalpindi|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "Rawalpindi" consists of two [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] words; Rawal, and Pindi. The origin of the name may derive from the combination of two words:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} ''Rawal'', meaning "lake" in Punjabi, and ''Pind'', meaning "village." The combination of the two words thus means "The village of lake". Other sources have posited a Sanskrit origin of the city's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tariq|first1=Umair|title=Pothowar — A Land of Forgotten History|url=http://pakteahouse.net/2014/02/10/pothowar-a-land-of-forgotten-history/|website=Pak Tea House|accessdate=16 June 2017|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fasting Buddha BM OA1907.12-28.1.jpg|thumb|The "Fasting [[Buddha]]," on display at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], was discovered in Rawalpindi.]]

===Origins===
The region around Rawalpindi has been inhabited for thousands of years. Rawalpindi falls within the ancient boundaries of [[Gandhara]], and is in a region littered with Buddhist ruins. In the region north-west of Rawalpindi, traces have been found of at least 55 [[stupa]]s, 28 Buddhist monasteries, 9 temples, and various artifacts in the [[Kharoshthi]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tK-nRXoQ40oC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=rawalpindi%20buddhism&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Buddhist Sects in India |first= Nalinaksha |last=Dutt

===Medieval===
The first mention of Rawalpindi's earliest settlement dates from when [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] destoyed Rawalpindi and the town was restored by ''[[Gakhars|Gakhar]]'' chief ''Kai Gohar'' in the early 11th century. The town fell into decay again after Mongol invasions in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="IGI"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_278.gif |title= Imperial Gazetter of India, Volume 21, page 272 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library |publisher= Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= 2013-02-18 |accessdate= 22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated along an invasion route, the settlement did not prosper and remained deserted until 1493, when ''Jhanda Khan'' re-established the ruined town, and named it ''Rawal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad|first1=Asghar|title=Pakistan tourism directory, '86: everything about tourism|date=1986|publisher=Holiday Weekly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-x0zAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rawalpindi+history+gakkhar&amp;dq=rawalpindi+history+gakkhar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrk9nH3vfXAhUR9WMKHSFUBMwQ6AEITDAH|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rawat_Fort_-_Main_Gate_East.jpg|thumb|The 16th century [[Rawat Fort]] offered military protection to Rawalpindi.]]
During the Mughal era,  Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the [[Gakhars|Ghakhar]] clan, who in turn pledged allegiance to the Mughal Empire. The city was developed as an important outpost in order to guard the frontiers of the Mughal realm.&lt;ref name="agrawal"/&gt; Gakhars fortified a nearby [[caravanserai]], in the 16th century, transforming it into the [[Rawat Fort]] in order to defend the Pothohar plateau from [[Sher Shah Suri]]'s forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malik|first1=Iftikhar Haider|title=Culture and Customs of Pakistan|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313331268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[Attock Fort]] in 1581 after Akbar led a campaign against his brother [[Mirza Muhammad Hakim]], further securing Rawalpindi's environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Rawalpindi district|date=1895|publisher="Civil and Military Gazette" Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxsUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=akbar+rawalpindi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzuIuP4PfXAhVQ5WMKHTbaBswQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=akbar%20rawalpindi&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1585, the Emperor [[Akbar]] arrived in Rawalpindi, and remained in and around Rawalpindi for 13 years as he extended the frontiers of the empire,&lt;ref name="agrawal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agrawal|first1=Ashvini|title=Studies in Mughal History|date=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120823266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZdCrUxFAHEC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=rawalpindi+mughal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiukKS73_fXAhVM0WMKHRe0DdkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rawalpindi&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an era described as a "glorious period" in his career as Emperor.&lt;ref name="agrawal"/&gt;

Following Rawalpindi's capture by the British Indian Empire, Her Majesty's 53 Regiment took quarters in the newly captured city.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The decision to man a permanent military cantonment in the city was made in 1851 by the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]].&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The city saw its first [[telegraph]] office in the early 1850s.&lt;ref name=army/&gt; The city's Garrison Church was built shortly after in 1854,&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; and is the site where [[Robert Milman]], Bishop of Calcutta, was buried following his death in Rawalpindi in 1876.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The city was home to 15,913 people in the 1855 census.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt; During the 1857 [[Sepoy Mutiny]], the area's [[Gakhars]] and [[Janjua]] tribes remained loyal to the British.&lt;ref name=army/&gt;

Numerous civil and military buildings were built during the British era, and the Municipality of Rawalpindi was constituted in 1867,&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt;  while the city's population as per the 1868 census was 19,228, with another 9,358 people residing in the city's cantonment.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The city was also connected to railways that offered connection to India and the northwest frontier in [[Peshawar]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The Commissariat Steam Flour Mills were the first such mills in Punjab, and supplied most of the needs of British cantonments throughout Punjab.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; Rawalpindi's cantonment served as a feeder to other cantonments throughout the region.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt;

Rawalpindi flourished as a commercial centre, though the city remained largely devoid of an industrial base during the British era.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; A large portion of Kashmir's external trade passing through the city; in 1885, 14% of Kashmir's exports, and 27% of its imports passed through the city.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; A large market was opened in central Rawalpindi in 1883 by Sardar Sujan Singh, while the British further developed a shopping district for the city's elite known as ''Saddar'' with an archway built to commemorate Brigadier General Massey.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt;

Rawalpindi's cantonment became a major center of military power of the Raj after an arsenal was established in 1883.&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt; Britain's army elevated the city from a small town, to the third largest city in Punjab by 1921.&lt;ref name=army/&gt; In 1868, 9,358 people lived in the city's cantonment - by 1891, the number rose to 37,870.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; In 1891, the city's population excluding the Cantonment was 34,153.&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; The city was considered to be a favourite first posting for newly arrived soldiers from England, owing to the city's agreeable climate, and nearby [[hill station]] at nearby [[Murree]].&lt;ref name="gazetteer"/&gt; In 1901, Rawalpindi was made the winter headquarters of the Northern Command and of the Rawalpindi military division.

===Partition===
On 5 March 1947, members of Rawalpindi's Sikh and Hindu communities took out a procession against the formation of a Muslim ministry within the Government of Punjab. Policemen fired upon protestors, while Hindus and Sikhs fought against weaker Muslim counter-protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The forgotten massacre|url=http://nation.com.pk/29-Dec-2014/the-forgotten-massacre|accessdate=8 December 2017|agency=The Nation|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's first Partition riots erupted the next day on 6 March 1947, when the city's Muslims, angered by the actions of Hindus and Sikhs and encouraged by the Pir of [[Golra Sharif]], raided nearby villages after they were unable to do so in the city on account of Rawalpindi's heavily armed Sikhs.&lt;ref name=horrors&gt;{{cite news|first1=A.G.

At the dawn of [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistan's independence]] in 1947, Rawalpindi was a 43.79% Muslim, while Rawalpindi District as a whole was 80% Muslim.&lt;ref name=ispahani/&gt; The region, on account of its large Muslim majority, was thus awarded to Rawalpindi's [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] population, who had made up 33.72% and 17.32% of the city,&lt;ref name="ispahani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ispahani|first1=Farahnaz|title=Purifying the Land of the Pure: A History of Pakistan's Religious Minorities|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jl7ODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=rawalpindi+hindu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bByA-ab7k_&amp;sig=zDIxZj8PNkV_UwNTGQzCrXMD834&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq-MOqmPrXAhUI52MKHbWLAw44HhDoAQgvMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=rawalpindi%20hindu&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; migrated ''en masse'' to the newly independent [[Dominion of India]] after communal riots in western Punjab, while [[Muslim]] refugees from India settled in the city following anti-Muslim pogroms in eastern Punjab and northern India.&lt;ref name=horrors/&gt;

===Modern===
In the years following independence, Rawalpindi saw an influx of [[Muhajir people|Muhajir]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] settlers. Having been the largest British Cantonment in the region at the dawn of Pakistan's independence, Rawalpindi was chosen as headquarters for the Pakistani Army, despite the fact that Karachi had been selected as the first capital.&lt;ref name="burki"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burki|first1=Shahid Javed|title=Historical Dictionary of Pakistan|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442241480|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk-sBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA479&amp;lpg=PA479&amp;dq=rawalpindi+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-K9oDfJBCg&amp;sig=EwjstkT1v6EdWkDpo-7LKeV9ehM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1xYHkh_rXAhVW7GMKHZJrCtU4ChDoAQhUMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=rawalpindi%20history&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the [[Rawalpindi conspiracy]] took place in which leftist army officers conspired to depose the first elected [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]].&lt;ref name="burki"/&gt; Rawalpindi later became the site of the Liaquat Ali Khan's assassination, in what is now known as [[Liaquat National Bagh|Liaquat Bagh Park]]. In 1958, Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] launched his ''[[coup d'etat]]'' from Rawalpindi.&lt;ref name="burki"/&gt; In 1959, the city became the interim capital of the country under Ayub Khan, who had sought the creation of a new planned capital of Islamabad in the vicinity of Rawalpindi. As a result, Rawalpindi saw most major central government offices and institutions relocate to nearby territory, and its population rapidly expand.

Construction of Pakistan's new capital city of [[Islamabad]] in 1961 led to greater investment in Rawalpindi.&lt;ref name="Planet"/&gt; Rawalpindi remained the headquarters of the [[Pakistani Army]] after the capital shifted to Islamabad in 1969, while the [[Pakistan Air Force]] continues to maintain an airbase in the [[Chaklala]] district of Rawalpindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan Air Force|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/march98/paf1.htm|publisher=Defense General|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAF Active Bases|url=http://www.paf.gov.pk/active_bases.html|publisher=Pakistan Air Force|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The military dictatorship of General [[Zia ul Haq]] hanged Pakistan's deposed [[Prime Minister]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], in Rawalpindi in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siddiqui|first=Salman|title=No Morning English Daily Carried the News of Bhutto's Hanging|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/143320|publisher=Daily Dawn|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad, and the greater [[Islamabad Rawalpindi metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom-communities for workers in Islamabad.&lt;ref name="Abbasi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furniture"/&gt; In June 2015, the [[Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus]], a new [[bus rapid transit]] line with various points in [[Islamabad]], opened for service.

===Climate===
Rawalpindi features a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Cwa)&lt;ref name="Climate-Data.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate: Rawalpindi - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/1009/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with hot and wet summers, a cooler and drier winter. Rawalpindi and its twin city [[Islamabad]], during the year experiences an average of 91 thunderstorms, which is the highest frequency of any plain elevation city in the country. Strong windstorms are frequent in the summer during which wind gusts have been reported by [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] to have reached {{convert|176|km/h|abbr=on}}. In such thunder/wind storms, which results in some damage of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2006/10/13/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA |title=Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan &amp;#124; Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather is highly variable due to the proximity of the city to the foothills of Himalayas.

The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|1200|mm|abbr=on}}, most of which falls in the summer monsoon season. However, westerly disturbances also bring quite significant rainfall in the winter. In summer, the record maximum temperature has soared to {{Convert|48.4|C|F|0|lk=on}} recorded in June 1954, while it has dropped to a minimum of {{Convert|-3.9|C|F|0|lk=on}} several occasions, though the last of which was in January 1967.

===Cityscape===
Social structures in Rawalpindi's historic core centre around neighbourhoods, each known as a ''[[Mohallah]]''. Each neighbourhood is served by a nearby bazaar and mosque, which in turn serve as a place with diverse people can gather for trade and manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Hull, M. S. 2013"&gt;Hull, M. S. (2013). "Government of Paper: The Materiality of Bureaucracy in Urban Pakistan", University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Each ''Mohallah'' has narrow and short roads that are often unnamed. The grouping of houses around short lanes and [[cul-de-sac]]s lends a sense of privacy and security to residents of each neighbourhood. Major intersections in the neighbourhood are each referred to as a ''chowk''.

South of Rawalpindi's historic core, and across the [[Lai Nullah]], are the verdant and wide lanes of the [[Rawalpindi Cantonment]]. With tree-lined avenues and historic architecture, the cantonment was the main European area developed during British colonial rule. British colonialists also built the Saddar Bazaar south of the historic core, which served as a retail centre geared towards Europeans in the city. Beyond the cantonment are the large suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom communities for Islamabad's commuter population.&lt;ref name="Hull, M. S. 2013"/&gt;

==Demographics==

The population of Rawalpindi is 2,098,231 in 2017. 84% of the population is [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], 9% is [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], and 7% is from other ethnic groups.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
The [[Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus]] is a {{convert|22.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} [[bus rapid transit]] service that connects Rawalpindi to [[Islamabad]]. The Metrobus network was opened on 4 June 2015, and connects the [[Pak Secretariat]] in Islamabad to [[Saddar, Rawalpindi|Saddar]] in Rawalpindi. A second stage is currently under construction from [[Peshawar Morr Interchange]] to the [[New Islamabad International Airport]]. The system uses e-ticketing and [[Intelligent Transportation System]] wand and is managed by the [[Punjab Mass Transit Authority]].

===Road===
Rawalpindi is situated along the historic [[Grand Trunk Road]] that connects Peshawar to [[Islamabad]] and [[Lahore]]. The road is roughly paralleled by the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M-1 Motorway]] between Peshawar and Rawalpindi, while the [[M2 motorway (Pakistan)|M-2 Motorway]] provides an alternate route to Lahore via the [[Salt Range]]. The Grand Trunk Road also provides access to the Afghan border via the [[Khyber Pass]], with onwards connections to [[Kabul]] and [[Central Asia]] via the [[Salang Pass]]. The [[Karakoram Highway]] provides access between Islamabad and western China, and an alternate route to Central Asia via [[Kashgar]] in the Chinese region of [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Islamabad Expressway]] connects Rawalpindi's eastern portions with the [[Rawal Lake]] and heart of [[Islamabad]]. The IJP Road separates Rawalpindi's northern edge from Islamabad.

[[File:PKM1-3.JPG|thumb|The [[M2 motorway (Pakistan)|M-2 motorway]] connects Rawalpindi to [[Lahore]], and is part of an under-construction network of motorways that will continue onwards to the port city of [[Karachi]].]]
Rawalpindi is connected to [[Peshawar]]  by the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M-1 Motorway]].  The motorway also links Rawalpindi to major cities in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, such as [[Charsadda]] and [[Mardan]]. The [[M2 motorway (Pakistan)|M-2 motorway]] offers high speed access to Lahore via the [[Potohar Plateau]] and [[Salt Range]].

[[Image:Reversed strat.001.png|thumb|Example of how reversed archaeological stratigraphy may form.]]

'''Reverse stratigraphy''' (sometimes known as '''inverted stratigraphy''') is the result of a process whereby one sediment is unearthed by human or natural actions and moved elsewhere, whereby the latest material will be deposited on the bottom of the new sediment, and progressively earlier material will be deposited higher and higher in the [[stratigraphy]]. Such events can be triggered by [[rockslide]]s, [[tree throw]]s, or other events which cause the strata of a deposit to be flipped or reversed. In archeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] a common cause of inversions in the stratigraphy is the collapse of walls on river banks or other raised mounds where deposits which have been cut through behind the wall prior to collapse slip over the collapsed structure resulting in the structure being under the deposits that originated earlier in time. In this case care must be taken to re-[[Archaeological context|context]] the slipped deposits so the event of slippage appears in the correct place stratigraphically in the [[Harris matrix]]. There are numerous process that can reverse the stratigraphy or more accurately redeposit it. Many rely on slope processes, however other instances where deposits containing material later than overlying deposits occur in such features as drains or hypocaust systems. In these instances a clear understanding of the direction of "UP" and site formation processes is essential. Drains or hypocaust systems often have later material deposited within them during their "use", which may be much much later than either their initial construction or indeed the construction, use and disuse of the floors above them.

[[Image:skeleton-salvation-armies.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Members of the Salvation Army being pursued by the Skeleton Army with its distinctive [[skull and crossbones (military)|skull and crossbones]] banner c. 1882]]

The '''Skeleton Army''' was a diffuse group, particularly in [[Southern England]], that opposed and disrupted [[The Salvation Army]]'s marches against alcohol in the late 19th century. Clashes between the two groups led to the deaths of several Salvationists and injuries to many others.

==Origins==
[[Image:skeleton-gazette.jpg|thumb|left|''The "Skeleton"'', a Skeleton Army [[gazette]]]]
The earliest reference to an organised opposition to The Salvation Army was in August 1880 in [[Whitechapel]], when 'The Unconverted Salvation Army' was founded with its flag and motto of "Be just and fear not."

In 1881 Skeleton Armies were raised in [[Whitechapel]], [[Exeter]] and [[Weston-super-Mare]], and the name was quickly taken up elsewhere as other groups were formed in the south of England; there are no records of Skeleton Armies north of London. Membership was predominantly lower to middle working-class.&lt;ref name=Horridge&gt;Horridge, Glenn K., ''The Salvation Army Origins and Early Days 1865–1900'' Ammonite Books (1993) pg 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Skeletons" recognised each other by various insignia used to distinguish themselves.&lt;ref name=sac&gt;[http://www.sacollectables.com/eastbourne.html Salvation Army Collectables website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025162859/http://www.sacollectables.com/eastbourne.html |date=25 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeletons used banners with skulls and crossbones; sometimes there were two coffins and a statement like, "Blood and Thunder" (mocking the Salvation Army's war cry "Blood and Fire") or the three Bs: "Beef", "Beer" and "[[tobacco|Bacca]]" – again mocking the Salvation Army's three S's – "Soup", "Soap" and "Salvation". Banners also had pictures of monkeys, rats and the [[devil]]. Skeletons further published so-called "gazettes" considered libellous as well as [[obscene]] and [[blasphemous]].&lt;ref name=sac/&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Several techniques were employed by the "Skeletons" to disrupt Salvation Army meetings and marches; these included throwing rocks and dead rats, marching while loudly playing musical instruments or shouting, and physically assaulting Salvation Army members at their meetings.

Alhough [[George Scott Railton]], second in command of the Salvation Army, claimed the Skeleton Army first started in [[Weston-super-Mare]] in 1881,&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/4be78290d9a20b738025697c0051c5b2?OpenDocument The Salvation Army International Heritage Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023202407/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/4be78290d9a20b738025697c0051c5b2?OpenDocument |date=23 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  contemporary press reports show that it first appeared in Exeter in October 1881.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Blood on the Flag'', Nigel Bovey, Shield Books.2015&lt;/ref&gt; In Weston-super-Mare, in March 1882 Captain William Beatty, Thomas Bowden and William Mullins  were given a three-month prison sentence by the [[magistrate]]s for a [[breach of the peace]] when they broke a local ban on processions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This led to the case of ''Beatty v Gillbanks'' (1882), which held that the Salvation Army was acting lawfully when marching, despite knowing that their assembly could well lead to riots. As their intentions were ultimately peaceful and unrelated to the cause of inciting riot, the court found their actions to be within the limits of the law. That it was known that their marching may cause riots was not found to be a breach of the law, as it was the actions of antagonistic parties including the Skeleton Army which led directly to the riotous behaviour. The convictions against Beatty and the two other Salvationists were later quashed by the Queen's Court and costs were awarded against the sentencing magistrates.

The action was reported by ''[[The Times]]''; at the appeal hearing it was erroneously stated that the Skeleton Army was founded in [[Weston-super-Mare]].&lt;ref&gt;Queens Bench Vol 1X
pp. 308–315&lt;/ref&gt;

Of an attack in [[Bethnal Green]] in November 1882 the ''Bethnal Green Eastern Post'' stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A genuine rabble of 'roughs' pure and unadulterated has been infesting the district for several weeks past. These [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s style themselves the 'Skeleton Army'.... The 'skeletons' have their collectors and their collecting sheets and one of them was thrust into my hands... it contained a number shopkeepers' names... I found that [[pub]]licans, beer sellers and butchers are subscribing to this imposture... the collector told me that the object of the Skeleton Army was to put down the Salvationists by following them about everywhere, by beating a drum and burlesquing their songs, to render the conduct of their processions and services impossible... Amongst the Skeleton rabble there is a large percentage of the most consummate loafers and unmitigated [[wikt:blackguards|blackguards]] London can produce...worthy of the disreputable class of publicans who hate the [[London School Board]], education and [[wikt:temperance|temperance]] and who, seeing the beginning of the end of their immoral traffic, and prepared for the most desperate enterprise.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both sources agree [[Salvationist]]s were pelted with missiles. At Bethnal Green, such items as flour, rotten eggs, stones and brickbats were among those used, and many Salvationists were manhandled and beaten. When news of trouble in London spread, Skeleton riots took place in other parts of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/CommunityArchives/Potton/PottonSalvationArmy.aspx [[Bedfordshire County Council]]: [[Potton]] Salvation Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916121855/http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/CommunityArchives/Potton/PottonSalvationArmy.aspx |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GOjt7Rycb_YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=skeleton+army+salvation+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1_BLgCbleL&amp;sig=6zdfLUXrI69uyVqy5a3UYUvGnDo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0S3KSs7XLcWK4QaKjJnHAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=skeleton%20army%20salvation%20army&amp;f=false Swift, Roger (Editor) 'Victorian Chester: Essays in Social History 1830–1900' Published by Liverpool University Press (1996) pg 185] {{ISBN|0-85323-661-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when in April 1884 the owner of an alcohol shop in [[Worthing]] objected to Salvation Army criticism concerning the selling of alcoholic beverages, 4,000 "Skeletons" joined together in that town in direct opposition to the [[Salvationist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1260460 JSTOR ''Folklore'' Vol. 99, No. 2 (1988) pgs 221–231]&lt;/ref&gt; Black, sticky tar was painted onto the wall of the alley which the entrance to the Salvation Army barracks shared with the alcohol shop. This damaged Salvation Army uniforms as they marched through it. Also eggs filled with blue paint were thrown at the "Sally Army". Many in Worthing approved of these confrontational activities, but the Salvation Army continued unabated.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Captain Ada Smith led those who faced the "Skeletons" in Worthing. [[William Booth|General Booth]] requested police protection for the Salvation Army in that town and ordered Captain Smith and her soldiers to remain in their barracks until they got it. However, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], said it was outside his jurisdiction to offer such protection. Finally General Booth ordered Captain Smith and her group to march on Sundays unprotected by the authorities.&lt;ref name=worthing&gt;[http://www.worthingsalvationarmy.org.uk/Corps/Corps%20History.htm History of Worthing Salvation Army Corps] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827235036/http://www.worthingsalvationarmy.org.uk/Corps/Corps%20History.htm |date=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 17 August 1884, the police, the Salvation Army and the Skeletons confronted each other in Worthing. For an hour the police kept the peace, then the Skeletons rioted. The area was filled with screaming men, brick dust and broken glass. The Salvationists returned to their "barracks" and the Skeletons tried to burn it down. The landlord of the barracks, George Head, a Salvation Army supporter, defended his property and the people there with a revolver, wounding several Skeletons. Head was later brought before the [[magistrate]]s on a charge of feloniously and maliciously wounding a young man named Olliver.&lt;ref name=worthing/&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Police]] were at first unhelpful. The [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Edmund Henderson]] denied what happened.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; The public eventually demanded action and Skeleton riots in London were belatedly put down.

==Final stages==
Skeleton riots continued elsewhere until 1893 when they faded out.&lt;ref&gt;''The Surrey Advertiser and County Times'' 23 September 1893, 1ff&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 at least 669 Salvation Army members were assaulted, including 251 women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XEJIc5nnc0gC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;lpg=PA479&amp;dq=1889+at+least+669+Salvation+Army+members+were+assaulted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vyLqtqn4-Y&amp;sig=z1jpbAKXjisnm2QzPT6LIGNgFWA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IsrCUefDNZKFhQfv64HwBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1889%20at%20least%20669%20Salvation%20Army%20members%20were%20assaulted&amp;f=false Hughes, R. Kent, ''John: That You May Believe, Volume 43'' Crossway Books (1999) pg 479 ''[[Google Books]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gospel/&gt; On one occasion, while defending themselves 86 Salvation Army members were arrested and imprisoned on disorderly conduct charges.&lt;ref name=Gospel&gt;[http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/boothbioshort.htm 'William Bramwell Booth: His Life and Ministry' on The Gospel Truth website]&lt;/ref&gt; When a new Salvation Army Corps was opened in [[Potton]] in Bedfordshire on 1 June 1890, large contingents of the Skeleton Army made fun of the local Salvationists. ''[[The War Cry]]'' reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the skeletons did all the shouting and we had only the opportunity of blessing them by showing unruffled love in answer to the disturbance in our proceedings"...."The skeleton flag was out with its coffin, skull and cross-bones as well as the whole Skeleton force, uniformed, beating a drum, playing flutes, whirling rattles and screaming through trumpets. One of their chosen leaders was carried shoulder high, ringing a bell and attired in an untrimmed coal-scuttle bonnet. I noticed that the publicans looked pleased to see this array and several waved their hats. But we were good friends of the skeletons, twelve of whom sat at our tea table... Their leaders were very courteous and sincerely desirous of keeping their somewhat rabble followers within bounds. Almost implicit obedience was given them. Their skeleton War Cry was freely sold, but doesn't quite beat the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/CommunityArchives/Potton/PottonSalvationArmy.aspx Potton Salvation Army on the [[Bedfordshire County Council]] website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916121855/http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/CommunityArchives/Potton/PottonSalvationArmy.aspx |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At [[Guildford]] the corps officer's wife was kicked unconscious close to a police station and a woman Salvationist fatally injured. At [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] too, a woman was killed when a stone hit her.&lt;ref name=sac/&gt; The mayor of [[Eastbourne]] stated he would, "put down this Salvation Army business" with help from the Skeleton Army if necessary.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; Skeletons attacked many Salvationists. Salvationists considered it incompatible with Christian principles to defend themselves but thought the police should protect them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Skeleton to Salvationist ==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image: Commissioner Charles H. Jeffries.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Charles Jeffries as a Commissioner in [[The Salvation Army]] in about 1935]] --&gt;
[[Charles Jeffries]] was a 'lieutenant' in the Skeleton Army in [[Whitechapel]] in 1881, and was well known for disrupting Salvation Army public meetings and on occasion had assaulted Salvation Army [[Soldier in The Salvation Army|Soldiers]] and [[Officer in The Salvation Army|Officers]]. Then Jeffries was proselytised and started to attend a [[Salvation Army corps]], soon becoming an active Soldier, and then after attending training college, became an Officer. He served in many countries including China and Australia and eventually rose to the rank of [[Commissioner in The Salvation Army|Commissioner]], serving as the head of corps work as British Commissioner in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Claughton"&gt;{{Cite news

==Pre-Holocene (1.5 Mya)==
The time from roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BC was a time of transition, and swift and extensive environmental change, as the planet was moving from an [[Ice age]], towards an [[interstadial]] (warm period). [[Sea level]]s rose dramatically (and are [[Current sea level rise|continuing to do so]]), land that was depressed by glaciers began [[isostatic rebound|lifting up again]], forests and deserts expanded, and the climate gradually became more modern. In the process of warming up, the planet saw several "cold snaps" and "warm snaps", such as the [[Older Dryas]] and the [[Holocene climatic optimum]], as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] became extinct due to environmental and [[evolutionary pressure]]s from the changing climate. This marked the end of the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which was continued into the modern era [[holocene extinction|by humans]]. The time around 11,700 years ago (9700 BC) is widely considered to be the end of the old age ([[Pleistocene]], [[Paleolithic]], [[Stone age]], [[last glacial period|Wisconsin Ice Age]]), and the beginning of the modern world as we know it.

|Sahara becomes fully desiccated, and conditions become largely identical to those of today. [[Desiccation]] had been proceeding from 7500–6000 BC, as a result of the shift in the West African tropical [[monsoon]] belt southwards from the [[Sahel]], and intensified by the [[5.9 kiloyear event]]. Subsequent rates of evaporation in the region led to a drying of the Sahara, as shown by the drop in water levels in [[Lake Chad]].

|[[Minoan civilization]] in the [[Mediterranean]] declines, but scholars are divided on the cause.  Possibly a [[volcanic eruption]] was the source of the catastrophe (see [[Minoan eruption]]). On the other hand, gradual [[deforestation]] may have led to materials shortages in manufacturing and shipping.

|Evidence of major droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean.  Hittite and Ugarit records show requests for grain were sent to Egypt, probably during the reign of Pharaoh [[Merenptah]].  Carpenter has suggested that droughts of equal severity to those of the 1950s in Greece, would have been sufficient to cause the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]].  The cause may have been a temporary diversion of winter storms north of the Pyrenees and Alps.  Central Europe experienced generally wetter conditions, while those in the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially drier.  There seems to have been a general abandonment of peasant subsistence agriculture in favour of nomadic pastoralism in Central Anatolia, Syria and northern Mesopotamia, Palestine, the Sinai and NW Arabia.

{{main|Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|l1=Battle of Mogadishu}}
The '''1993 Battle of Mogadishu''', more commonly known as '''Black Hawk Down''', was detailed by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and lasted from October 3 to October 4 in 1993.

[[File:Black Hawk Down Rangers under fire October 3, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Task Force Ranger under fire in Somalia - October 3, 1993]]

== October 3, 1993 ==
=== Afternoon ===
13:50 – Task Force Ranger analysts receive intelligence of Salad's location.

14:49 – [[Habr Gidr clan]] leaders, two principal targets, and the United Nations Corporation are located at a residence in central [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]].

15:32 – Official force launch, consisting of 19 aircraft , twelve vehicles, and 160 men.

15:42 – Official assault begins. [[Delta Force|1st SFOD-D]] soldiers hit the target house. Four-[[Ranger (US Army)|Ranger]] [[Chalk (military)|"chalk"]] [[Fast-roping|"fast-rope"]] in. A Ranger, Private First Class Todd Blackburn, misses the rope and falls 70 feet to the street.

15:47 – Large crowds of Somalis begin converging on the target area.

15:58 – One of the vehicles, a [[M939 Truck|five-ton truck]], is hit and disabled by a [[rocket propelled grenade]]. Twenty-seven American soldiers are wounded.

16:00 – Groups of armed Somalis from the city of Mogadishu begin converging on the target area .

16:02 – Raid targets captured: Assault force reports both clan leaders and about 21 others were in custody. As the force prepares to pull out, three vehicles are detached to rush the wounded Private Blackburn back to the base. SGT Dominick Pilla is killed as these vehicles return to base, becoming the first American fatality.

16:15 – The convoy is delayed and does not move out due to confusion about who is signaling whom. It turned out that ''Delta'' was waiting for the convoy to originate the signal to them while the convoy was waiting for Delta to initiate the signal to them. The prisoners were eventually loaded after the Delta teams moved the prisoners to the trucks.

16:20 – First helicopter crash: [[Black Hawk helicopter|Black Hawk]] ''Super 6-1'' is hit by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] and crashed five blocks northeast{{Verify source|date=January 2009}} of the target building. Delta Force snipers SSG Daniel Busch and SGT Jim Smith, survive the crash and begin to defend the crash site.

16:22 – Crowds of armed Somalis start racing towards the Super 6-1 crash site.

16:26 – A [[Humvee]] convoy starts moving. When the prisoners are loaded up, the convoy and ground forces all begin moving towards the crashed helicopter. Black Hawk ''Super 6-4'', piloted by [[Chief Warrant Officer]] [[Michael Durant]], takes the place of Black Hawk Super 6-1 circling over the city.

16:28 – Search and rescue of Black Hawk Super 6-1: search and rescue team ropes in to assist the crew of the first crashed helicopter. Both pilot and co-pilot were dead.

16:35 – The Convoy made a wrong turn and got lost among the city streets, sustaining heavy casualties by Somali snipers and armed militia.

16:40 – Second helicopter crash: Mike Durant's Black Hawk, Super 6-4, is also hit by a Somali [[rocket propelled grenade]], and crashed about a mile southwest{{Verify source|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- does WAY not compute with map data --&gt; of the target building. Hostile crowds of Somalians begin moving toward it as well.

16:42 – Two Delta Force [[snipers]], [[Sergeant First Class]] [[Randy Shughart]] and [[Master Sergeant]] [[Gary Gordon]], who had been providing cover fire by air were inserted into the crash site by helicopter at their own request, to help protect the injured Durant and his crew.

16:54 – HMMWV convoy abandons Black Hawk Super 6-1 search. The '''Lost Convoy''', with more than half of its force either wounded or dead, abandons its search for the first downed Black Hawk and begins fighting its way back to the base.

17:03 – [[Quick Reaction Force]] convoy (a smaller, emergency convoy) is dispatched from Command and Control in an attempt to rescue the men stranded at Durant's crash site. It encounters immediate obstacles.

17:34 – QRF and the Lost Convoy decided to return to base. Both convoys, having sustained heavy casualties, linked up and abandon the efforts to break through to Durant. The remainder of the ground force of Rangers and commandos were converging around the first crash site, sustaining many casualties. Ranger [[Corporal]] Jamie Smith is among those shot.

17:40 – Snipers Shughart and Gordon run out of ammunition and are killed when hostile Somalis overrun Durant's crash site. Every member of the crew are dead, except for Durant, who suffered a broken leg and injured back. Durant is carried off by militia (He was eventually released to the Red Cross, 11 days later.) During [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter "Super Six Four." It was the second [[UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60L]] of two Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] on October 3, 1993. His helicopter was hit on the tail by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. That led to its crash about a mile southwest of the operation's target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The battle of Mogadishu: first-hand accounts from the men of Task Force Ranger|first=Matt|last= Eversmann|page=36|publisher =Presidio Press|year= 2005 |ISBN=978-0-345-45966-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/27/lklw.00.html "Encore Presentation: 1993 Interview With Michael Durant," CNN: Larry King Weekend (January 27, 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt; (Both Gordon and Shughart received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for their heroism in this action.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America's Heroes: Medal of Honor Recipients from the Civil War to Afghanistan |first=James H.|last=Willbanks |page=308|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year=2011 |ISBN= 978-1-59884-393-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17:45 – Both convoys return to the base. Ninety-nine men remain trapped and surrounded in the city around the first downed Black Hawk. Corporal Smith is bleeding heavily, medic requests immediate evacuation.

19:08 – Black Hawk Super ''6-6'' makes a daring re-supply run, dropping water, [[ammunition]] and medical supplies to the trapped force. It is badly damaged, cannot land to evacuate Corporal Smith, and limps back to base.

20:27 – Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith dies.

21:00 – [[Task force|Joint Task Force Command]] requests assistance from other commands. The '''Rescue Convoy''', composed of two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of 10th Mt. Division troops along with the remainder of [[Task Force Ranger]], Pakistani tanks and Malaysian armored vehicles, is formed at Mogadishu's ''New Port'', and begins planning the rescue.

23:23 – The rescue convoy moves out, but as it approaches the crash site there is a large explosion which severely damages the convoy and makes the rescue almost impossible. However, a stockpile of [[rocket-propelled grenades]] in the city allows them to be used to great effect. A large proportion of the population is affected by power outages due to the Americans' destroying electrical substations in Mogadishu.

== October 4, 1993 ==
At Midnight 00:00 (24:00), the Rangers are still trapped inside Mogadishu without essential equipment, such as [[night vision device]]s.

01:55 &amp;mdash; Rescue convoy reaches the trapped Ranger force. A second half of the convoy reaches the site of Durant's downed Black Hawk. Durant and his crew are missing.

03:00 &amp;mdash; Forces are still struggling to remove the pinned body of Clifton "Elvis" Wolcott, pilot of downed Super Six One.

05:30 &amp;mdash; Rangers start moving from the city to the Pakistani Stadium, on foot. Wolcott's body is finally recovered. Vehicles roll out of the city. Elements of the Rangers are left to run to a rendez-vous point on National Street, covering the vehicles whilst enduring gunfire during the exfiltration. The road they take is known as the [[Mogadishu Mile]].

06:30 &amp;mdash; The force returns to the Pakistani Stadium. 13 Americans are confirmed dead or mortally wounded, 73 injured, and 6 missing in action (5 are later confirmed dead, raising the death toll to 18, and 1 taken prisoner).

'''''Waffen-SS im Einsatz ''''' (''Waffen-SS in Action'') is a 1953 book in German by [[Paul Hausser]], a former high-ranking [[Waffen-SS]] member and a leader of the Waffen-SS lobby group [[HIAG]]. As part of the organisation's [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] agenda, it advanced the idea of the purely military role of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Simpson|1990}}

The first major work by one of the HIAG leaders, it was published by {{Illm|Plesse Verlag|de|Plesse-Verlag}}, owned by a right-wing politician and publisher {{illm|Waldemar Schütz|de|Waldemar Schütz}}. Hausser's book, along with those by other key HIAG members [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Kurt Meyer]], has been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as one of the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature."{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

== Background ==
From 1950, Hausser was active in [[HIAG]], a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] organization and a [[advocacy group|lobby group]] of former [[Waffen-SS]] members. HIAG began in late 1950 as a loose association of local groups; by October 1951, it claimed to have 376 local branches. In December 1951, Hausser became its first spokesperson.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=82–83}}

As part of its lobbying efforts, HIAG attempted to advance the idea of the Waffen-SS being the "fourth branch of the [[Wehrmacht]]" and in no way connected to the crimes of the regime.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}} HIAG's rewriting of history included significant multi-prong [[Propaganda|propaganda efforts]], including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, along with a publishing house – [[Munin Verlag]] – to serve as a platform for its publicity aims. The express aim of Munin Verlag was to publish the "war narratives" of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}

== Contents ==
British [[military history|military historian]] [[Keith Simpson (politician)|Keith Simpson]] in his book ''Waffen SS'' quotes Hausser for writing that, he "hoped the work would disperse the lies and calumnies which had formed themselves around the Waffen-SS and help to give this courageous formation its place."{{sfn|Simpson|1990|p=6}} The book had an unmistakable connection to the Nazi origins of the Waffen-SS: the SS runes on the cover art and the SS motto ("my honor is my loyalty") embossed on the cloth cover. A foreword from the former Wehrmacht general [[Hans Guderian]] provided an endorsement for the Waffen-SS troops and referred to them as "the first realization of the European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}}

The book described the growth of Waffen-SS into a so-called multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a "militant example of the great European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}} Historians have refuted this characterisation, arguing that it was largely Nazi propaganda employed to bolster the ranks of the Waffen-SS with foreign volunteers. The message was later repurposed by HIAG as it sought historical and legal rehabilitation of the force.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}}

Hausser wrote another book, published in 1966 by HIAG's imprint {{illm|Munin Verlag|de|Munin-Verlag}}, under the title ''Soldaten wie andere auch'' ("Soldiers Like Any Other"). According to the military historian [[Simon MacKenzie|S.P. MacKenzie]], the work epitomised how HIAG leaders wanted the Waffen-SS to be remembered, while the historian Charles Sydnor described it as "equally tendentious".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}}{{sfn|Sydnor|1973}}

== Reception ==
''Waffen-SS in Action'' was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]]. The index was created in the early 1960s to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|p=539}}

Hausser's books, along with those by other key HIAG members and former Waffen-SS generals [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Kurt Meyer]], have been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature." These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen-SS members as both victims and misunderstood heroes.{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

'''William Frederick Friedman''' (September 24, 1891 – November 12, 1969) was a [[United States Army|US Army]] [[cryptography|cryptographer]] who ran the research division of the Army's [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (SIS) in the 1930s, and parts of its follow-on services into the 1950s. In 1940, subordinates of his led by [[Frank Rowlett]] broke [[Japan]]'s [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE cipher]], thus disclosing Japanese diplomatic secrets before America's entrance into [[World War II]].

== Early life ==
Friedman was born '''Wolf Friedman''' ({{lang-yi|װאָלףֿ פֿרידמאַן}}, {{lang-ru|Вольф Ф. Фридман}}), in [[Chişinău]], [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]], the son of Frederick Friedman, a Jew from [[Bucharest]] who worked as a [[translator]] and [[linguist]] for the Russian Postal Service, and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant. Friedman's family fled Russia in 1892 to escape the virulent [[anti-Semitism]] there, ending up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huachuca.army.mil/sites/History/PDFS/MFRIED.PDF "William W. Friedman: Principal Cryptologist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717134140/http://www.huachuca.army.mil/sites/History/PDFS/MFRIED.PDF |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, his first name was changed to William.

As a child, Friedman was introduced to cryptography in the short story "[[The Gold-Bug]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenheim |first=Shawn James |title=The Cryptographic Imagination |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1997 |page=11 |isbn=0-8018-5331-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the Michigan Agricultural College (known today as [[Michigan State University]]) in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] and received a scholarship to work on [[genetics]] at [[Cornell University]]. Meanwhile, [[George Fabyan]], who ran a private research laboratory to study any personally interesting project, decided to set up his own genetics project and was referred to Friedman. Friedman joined Fabyan's [[Riverbank Laboratories]] outside [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in September 1915. As head of the Department of Genetics, one of the projects he ran studied the effects of moonlight on crop growth, and so he experimented with the planting of [[wheat]] during various phases of the [[moon]].

== Initial work in cryptology ==
Another of Fabyan's pet projects was research into secret messages which Sir [[Francis Bacon]] had allegedly hidden in various texts during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]]. The research was carried out by [[Elizabeth Wells Gallup]]. She believed that she had discovered many such messages in the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and convinced herself that Bacon had written many, if not all, of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s works. Friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects, and was asked to travel to England on several occasions to help Gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research. He became fascinated with the work as he courted [[Elizebeth Friedman|Elizebeth Smith]], Mrs. Gallup's assistant and an accomplished cryptographer. They married, and he soon became director of Riverbank's Department of Codes and Ciphers as well as its Department of Genetics. During this time, Friedman wrote a series of 23 papers on cryptography, collectively known as the "Riverbank publications", including the first description of the [[index of coincidence]], an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis.

With the entry of the United States into [[World War I]], Fabyan offered the services of his Department of Codes and Ciphers to the government. No Federal department existed for this kind of work (although both the Army and Navy had had embryonic departments at various times), and soon Riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the US Government. During this period, the Friedmans broke a code used by [[Germany|German]]-funded [[India]]n radicals in the US who planned to ship arms to [[India]] to gain independence from Britain. Analysing the format of the messages, Riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort, a cryptographic technique common at the time. The Friedmans soon managed to decrypt most of the messages, but only long after the case had come to trial did the book itself come to light: a German-English dictionary published in 1880.

== Signals Intelligence Service ==
The United States government decided to set up its own cryptological service, and sent Army officers to Riverbank to train under Friedman. To support the program, Friedman wrote a series of technical monographs, completing seven by early 1918. He then enlisted in the Army and went to France to serve as the personal cryptographer for General [[John J. Pershing]]. He returned to the US in 1920 and published an eighth monograph, "The [[Index of coincidence|Index of Coincidence]] and its Applications in Cryptography", considered by some to be the most important publication in modern cryptography to that time. His texts for Army cryptographic training were well thought of and remained classified for several decades.

In 1921 he became chief cryptanalyst for the War Department and later led the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS)—a position he kept for a quarter century. In 1929, after The American [[Black Chamber]] in New York City was disbanded, its files were entrusted to SIS, and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the War Department.

Friedman coined several terms, including "[[cryptanalysis]]", and wrote many monographs on cryptography. One of these (written mostly in his spare time) was the first draft of his ''Elements of cryptanalysis'', which later was expanded to four volumes and became the U.S. Army's cryptographic main textbook and reference. Realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to SIS' work, Friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge. They were [[Solomon Kullback]], [[Frank Rowlett]] and [[Abraham Sinkov]], each of whom went on to distinguished service for decades. In addition he also was finally able to hire a man fluent in Japanese, John Hurt.

During this period [[Elizebeth Friedman]] continued her own work in cryptology, and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and [[FBI]] during [[Prohibition]].

== Solution of cipher machines ==
[[Image:Friedman-1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Friedman with an AT&amp;T cipher machine]]

During the 1920s, several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using [[typewriter]] mechanics and basic electrical circuitry. An early example was the [[Hebern Rotor Machine]], designed in the US in 1915 by [[Edward Hebern]]. This system offered such security and simplicity of use that Hebern heavily promoted it to investors.

Friedman realized that the new [[rotor machines]] would be important, and devoted some time to analysing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) at either end of the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough [[ciphertext]] and applying a standard statistical method known as the [[Vigenère cipher#Friedman test|kappa test]], he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.

Friedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks. The best of the lot, the [[SIGABA]]—which was destined to become the US's highest-security cipher machine in [[World War II]]—was co-invented by [[Frank Rowlett]]. At least one patent related to it was finally granted after Friedman had died.

In 1939, the Japanese introduced a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as "RED." The new cipher, which SIS called "[[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]]", was different and much more difficult. The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS thought it might be related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and [[Frank Rowlett|Rowlett]], in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] or the [[Hebern Rotor Machine|Hebern]] design, did not use [[rotor machine|rotor]]s but [[stepping_switch|stepper switches]] like those in automated [[telephone exchange]]s. [[Leo Rosen]] of SIS built a machine — as was later discovered, using the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen.

Thus, by the end of 1940, SIS had constructed an exact analog of the PURPLE machine without ever having seen one. With the duplicate machines and an understanding of PURPLE, SIS could decrypt increasing amounts of Japanese traffic. One such intercept was the message to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., ordering an end (on December 7, 1941) to negotiations with the US. The message gave a clear indication of impending [[war]], and was to have been delivered to the US State Department only hours prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The controversy over whether the US had [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate|foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack]] has roiled well into the 21st century.

In 1941, Friedman was hospitalized with a "[[nervous breakdown]]", widely attributed to the mental strain of his work on PURPLE. While he remained in hospital, a four-man team — [[Abraham Sinkov]] and [[Leo Rosen]] from SIS, and Lt. [[Prescott Currier]] and Lt. [[Robert Weeks]] from the U.S. Navy's [[OP-20-G]] — visited the British establishment at the "[[Government Code and Cypher School]]" at [[Bletchley Park]]. They gave the British a PURPLE machine, in exchange for details on the design of the [[Enigma machine]] and on how the British [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|decrypted the Enigma cipher]]. However Friedman visited Bletchley Park in April 1943 and played a key role in drawing up the [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]].&lt;ref name=BletchleyParkDiary-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=William F.|last2=MacKinnon|first2=Colin (edited with notes and bibliography)|title=The Bletchley Park Diary|date=2013|url=http://www.colinmackinnon.com/files/The_Bletchley_Park_Diary_of_William_F._Friedman_E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Security Agency ==
[[Image:Friedman-bust.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Bust of Friedman on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]], where he is identified as the "Dean of American Cryptology".]]

Following World War II, Friedman remained in government signals intelligence. In 1949 he became head of the cryptographic division of the newly formed Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) when it was formed to take over from AFSA. Friedman produced a classic series of textbooks, "[[Military Cryptanalysis (book) (William F. Friedman)|Military Cryptanalysis]]", which was used to train NSA students. (These were revised and extended, under the title "[[Military Cryptanalytics]]", by Friedman's assistant and successor [[Lambros D. Callimahos]], and used to train many additional cryptanalysts.) During his early years at NSA, he encouraged it to develop what were probably the first super-computers, although he was never convinced a machine could have the "insight" of a human mind.

Friedman spent much of his free time trying to decipher the famous [[Voynich Manuscript]], written sometime between 1403–1437. However, after four decades of study he finally had to admit defeat, contributing no more than an educated guess as to its origins and meaning.

In 1955, Friedman initiated, on behalf of the NSA, a secret agreement with [[Crypto AG]], a Swiss manufacturer of encryption machines. The agreement resulted in many of the company's machines being compromised, so that the messages produced by them became crackable by the NSA.&lt;ref name=BBC-2015-07-28&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33676028|newspaper=[[BBC]]|title=How NSA and GCHQ spied on the Cold War world
|date=2015-07-28|accessdate=2015-10-09|last=Corera|first=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman retired in 1956 and, with his wife, turned his attention to the problem that had originally brought them together: examining Bacon's supposed codes. Together they wrote a book entitled ''The Cryptologist Looks at Shakespeare'' which won a prize from the [[Folger Library]] and was published under the title ''The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.''&lt;ref name=ShakespeareanCiphersExamined-1957&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=William F.|last2=Friedman|first2=Elizebeth S.|title=The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined: An Analysis of Cryptographic Systems Used As Evidence That Some Author Other Than William Shakespeare Wrote the Plays Commonly Attributed to Him|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/shakespearean-ciphers-examined-an-analysis-of-cryptographic-systems-used-as-evidence-that-some-author-other-than-william-shakespeare-wrote-the-plays-commonly-attributed-to-him/oclc/496959058/viewport|date=1957|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|language=en|oclc=718233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book demonstrated flaws in Gallup's work and in that of others who sought hidden ciphers in Shakespeare's work.

At NSA's request Friedman prepared ''Six Lectures Concerning Cryptography and Cryptanalysis'', which he delivered at NSA. But later the Agency, concerned about security, confiscated the reference materials from Friedman's home.

== Death and legacy ==
Friedman's health began to fail in the late 1960s, and he died in 1969.&lt;ref name=EveningStar-WilliamFriedman-Obit-1969&gt;{{cite news|title=William Friedman Dies; Broke Japanese Code|url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/03/Xerox3088.pdf|work=[[The Washington Star|The Evening Star]]|date=3 November 1969|page=B-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-WilliamFriedman-Obit-1969&gt;{{cite news|title=William Friedman Dies; Broke Japanese Code; Truman Gave Cryptanalyst Highest Civilian Award; Marshall Said Work Saved Many American Lives|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/11/03/79433021.pdf|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 November 1969|language=en}}&amp;nbsp;{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Elonka-ArlingtonNationalCemeteryGrave-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunin|first1=Elonka|title=Cipher on the William and Elizebeth Friedman tombstone at Arlington National Cemetery is solved|url=http://elonka.com/friedman/FriedmanTombstone.pdf|work=Elonka.com|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman and his wife donated their archives to the library of the  [[George C. Marshall Foundation]], which also has had material reclassified and removed by the NSA.&lt;ref name=FriedmanCollection-AnalyticalGuide-2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Rose Mary|title=The Friedman Collection: An Analytical Guide|date=2014|url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/09/Friedman_Collection_Guide_September_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman has been inducted into the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]] and there is a building named after William and Elizebeth at the NSA complex at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. He was also presented the [[Medal for Merit]] by President [[Harry Truman]], and the [[National Security Medal]] by [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. Friedman and his wife Elizebeth are buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Friedman has the distinction of having one of the longest known suppressed patent applications, for {{US patent|6097812}}, a patent for a "cryptographic system". It was filed on July 25, 1933, issued on August 1, 2000.

== In popular culture ==
Commander Schoen, a character appearing in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'', is to a large extent inspired by Friedman. Schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with Friedman, including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army, breaking Japanese codes prior to Japan's involvement in World War II, and the psychological problems that he suffered from as a result.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In his acknowledgements, Stephenson writes "Among all these great wartime hackers, some kind of special recognition must go to William Friedman, who sacrificed his health to break the Japanese machine cipher called Purple before the war even began."&lt;ref name="Stephenson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neal Stephenson|title=Cryptonomicon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwAwSzmTHNEC|date=17 March 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-179257-1|page=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yelü Bei''' ({{zh|c=耶律倍}}) (born 899 &lt;ref name=HL72&gt;''[[History of Liao]]'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷72|vol. 72]].&lt;/ref&gt;-January 7, 937&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷280|vol. 280]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;[http://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/ [[Academia Sinica]] Chinese-Western Calendar Converter].&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Yelü Tuyu''' (耶律突欲 or 耶律圖欲), posthumously honored '''Wenxian Qinyi Huangdi''' (文獻欽義皇帝) with the [[temple name]] '''Yizong''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Simplified]]: 辽义宗, [[Traditional Chinese|Traditional]]: 遼義宗), formally known as '''Ren Huangwang''' (人皇王, "imperial king of men") during his lifetime (including his period as the King of [[Dongdan Kingdom|Dongdan]]), known as '''Dongdan Muhua''' (東丹慕華) (931) and then '''Li Zanhua''' (李贊華) (931-937) as a [[Later Tang]] subject, was the eldest son of [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]], the founder of the [[Liao Dynasty]].  He was declared successor to the Emperor Taizu in 916, but never succeeded to the throne.  Rather, after the accession of his younger brother [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Yelü Deguang]] (Emperor Taizong), he fled to the [[Shatuo]] Later Tang, where he was killed in 937.

== Background ==
Yelü Bei was born in 899, before the founding of the Khitan empire (which would later become known as [[Liao Dynasty]]).  His father was the Yelü clan chieftain [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Yelü Abaoji]], and his mother was Yelü Abaoji's wife [[Empress Shulü Ping|Shulü Ping]]; he was their first son.  He was described by the ''[[History of Liao]]'' as intelligent and studious in his youth, with a relaxed appearance and a loving heart.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;

In 916, when Yelü Abaoji declared himself emperor of a new Khitan empire as its Emperor Taizu,&lt;ref name=ZZTJ269&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷269|vol. 269]].&lt;/ref&gt; he created Yelü Bei his [[crown prince]].  When Emperor Taizu inquired of his attendants which god he should first offer sacrifice to as part of his becoming emperor, his attendants largely advocated offering sacrifices to the [[Buddha]].  When Emperor Taizu pointed out that the Buddha was not a Chinese god, Yelü Bei advocated offering first to [[Confucius]].  Emperor Taizu was pleased by the suggestion and built a temple for Confucius, having Yelü Bei offer sacrifices to him twice a year.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;

Yelü Bei subsequently served as Emperor Taizu's forward commander in campaigns against the Wugu (烏古) and the [[Dangxiang]] tribes.  Later, on incursions that Emperor Taizu made into the Chinese/[[Shatuo]] state [[Later Tang|Jin]] territory — specifically, Jin's Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern [[Beijing]]) — he left Yelü Bei in charge at his capital Linhuang Municipality (臨潢, in modern [[Chifeng]], [[Inner Mongolia]]).  It was during this time that Yelü Bei was said to have drafted a plan to conquer Khitan's eastern neighbor [[Balhae]].&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;

== As King of Dongdan ==
In 926, Emperor Taizu decided to carry out the plans to conquer Balhae.  In a campaign, he captured the important Balhae city Fuyu (夫餘, in modern [[Siping, Jilin]]).&lt;ref name=ZZTJ275&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷275|vol. 275]].&lt;/ref&gt;  (This appeared to have ended the Balhae state, even though Emperor Taizu did not at this time capture Balhae's capital [[Sanggyeong Yongcheonbu|Longquan]].)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 68 [926].&lt;/ref&gt;  Emperor Taizu set up a [[Dongdan Kingdom]] over the old Balhae territory, with its capital at Fuyu, and made Yelü Bei its king, with the title of "Imperial King of Man" (人皇王, ''Ren Huangwang''), echoing the titles used by himself ("Imperial Emperor of Heaven," 天皇帝, ''Tian Huangdi'') and his wife (Yelü Bei's mother) Empress Shulü ("Imperial Empress of Earth," 地皇后, ''Di Huanghou'').  He gave his second son (Yelü Bei's younger brother) [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Yelü Deguang]] the title of "Generalissimo Crown Prince" and made Yelü Deguang in charge of Linhuang, replacing Yelü Bei.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ275/&gt;

Shortly after conquering Fuyu, however, Emperor Taizu fell ill and died while still at Fuyu.  Empress Shulü took over effective leadership of the Khitan, and she and Yelü Bei began the trek of escorting Emperor Taizu's casket back to Linhuang, leaving one of Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yelü Anduan (耶律安端) temporarily in charge at Dongdan.  Once then returned to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yelü Bei, as she had favored Yelü Deguang.  However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yelü Bei and Yelü Deguang, and stated to them, "I love both of my sons, and I do not know which one to make emperor.  You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein."  The chieftains, knowing that she favored Yelü Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein.  She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong).  Yelü Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards.  Empress Shulü (now [[empress dowager]]) did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ275/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''History of Liao'' gave an account where it was Yelü Bei who voluntarily yielded the throne to Emperor Taizong, but that would appear to be inconsistent with his subsequent actions.  See ''History of Liao'', vol. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Taizong, after becoming emperor, became suspicious as to whether his older brother intended to take back the throne, and therefore moved Dongdan's capital to Dongping (東平, in modern [[Liaoyang]], [[Liaoning]]) and forcibly moved the former Balhae people to Dongping.  He also put guards in place to monitor Yelü Bei's actions.  When [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] heard this, he sent secret emissaries encouraging Yelü Bei to flee to Later Tang. Yelü Bei, commenting, "I yielded the empire to the Emperor, but now I am under suspicion. It is better that I go to another state so that I can be like [[Wu Taibo]]." He thus took his favorite concubine Lady Gao and his extensive book collection, got into a ship, and sailed to Later Tang.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;  In 930, he arrived at Later Tang's Deng Prefecture (登州, in modern [[Yantai]], [[Shandong]]).&lt;ref name=ZZTJ277&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷277|vol. 277]].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Yelü Bei's wife Imperial Queen Xiao and his oldest son [[Emperor Shizong of Liao|Yelü Ruan]] did not follow him to Later Tang, and Imperial Queen Xiao would subsequently continue to rule the Dongdan state until her death in 940, while Yelü Ruan would eventually succeed Emperor Taizong after his death (as Emperor Shizong).)&lt;ref name=HL3&gt;''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷3|vol. 3]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷4|vol. 4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== As Later Tang subject ==
[[File:騎射圖.jpg|thumb|騎射圖 "Archer and Horse" attributed to Yelü Bei, [[National Palace Museum]]]]

=== During Emperor Mingzong's reign ===
In 931, Emperor Mingzong made Yelü Bei the military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') of a newly created Huaihua Circuit (懷化, headquartered in modern [[Baoding]], [[Hebei]]), and gave him a new name of Dongdan Muhua.  Later in the year, he changed the Dongdan Muhua name further to Li Zanhua, and that would be the name used by the Khitan prince for the rest of his life.  However, there was no sign that Li Zanhua ever reported to Huaihua, and in 932, Emperor Mingzong instead stated an intention to give him a command south of the [[Yellow River]].  When the Later Tang officials opposed, Emperor Mingzong stated, "His father and I agreed to be [[blood brothers]], and that is why Zanhua came to me.  I am now old.  How would he have even come to a later emperor now matter how hard they enticed him?" He thereafter made Li Zanhua the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern [[Anyang]], [[Henan]]), but selected a talented staff to take effective governance of the circuit, allowing Li Zanhua not to carry out actual responsibilities.  He also gave a concubine of his predecessor [[Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang|Emperor Zhuangzong]]'s, Lady Xia, to Li Zanhua to be his new wife, and he also was lenient toward Li Zanhua such that even when Li Zanhua committed offenses, he would not punish Li Zanhua.  However, it was said that Li Zanhua was cruel toward his concubines and servants — as he liked to drink blood, his concubines often had to injure themselves so that they would bleed for him to drink, and the servants would often suffer severe punishments, including having their eyes gouged out, being cut by swords, or being burnt by fire, for minor faults.  Lady Xia eventually could not endure seeing this and, after requesting permission from Emperor Mingzong, divorced Li Zanhua and became a [[Buddhist nun]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ277/&gt;  Despite his cruelty, however, Li Zanhua was also said to be highly talented.  He understood fortunetelling and music, and was very talented in medicine.  He could write in both the Khitan and [[Han Chinese|Han]] languages, and translated the ''[[Huangdi Yinfujing]]'' into Khitan.  He was particularly well known for his paintings of Khitan people and things, and many of his paintings eventually ended up in the palace collections of the [[Song Dynasty]] decades later.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;  In 933, he was recalled from Yicheng and given the completely honorary title of military governor of Zhaoxin Circuit (昭信, headquartered in modern [[Ganzhou]], [[Jiangxi]]) (as Zhaoxin's territory was then ruled by [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties|History of the Five Dynasties]]'', [[:zh:s:舊五代史/卷44|vol. 44]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his having fled to Later Tang territory and becoming a Later Tang subject, Li Zanhua continued to maintain communications with his mother and brother, often sending emissaries to them.  The communication went the other way around, too, as when his grandmother [[Empress Dowager Yaonian Yanmujin|Grand Empress Dowager Yaonian]] died in 933, his mother and brother notified him of her death.&lt;ref name=HL3/&gt;

=== After Emperor Mingzong's reign ===
Also in 933, Emperor Mingzong died, and was initially succeeded by his biological son [[Emperor Min of Later Tang|Li Conghou]] the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min).&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷278|vol. 278]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 934, Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son [[Li Congke]] the Prince of Lu overthrew Emperor Min in a rebellion and became emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷279|vol. 279]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Li Zanhua was said to have secretly communicated to his brother Emperor Taizong the opinion that this was a good opportunity to invade Later Tang, although Emperor Taizong took no actions at that time.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;

Throughout the years, apparently because of Li Zanhus'a presence in Later Tang and the fact that Later Tang had captured a number of important Khitan commanders, Empress Dowager Shulü had repeatedly sought ''[[heqin]]'' alliances between Khitan and Later Tang.  In early 936, Li Congke, apprehensive over the prospect that his brother-in-law [[Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin|Shi Jingtang]] the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]) might rebel and enlist Khitan aid in doing so, had his officials [[Li Song (politician)|Li Song]] and Lü Qi (呂琦) draft a plan under which such an alliance would occur — but then abandoned the plan.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280/&gt;

Later in the year, Shi Jingtang did rebel, and Later Tang forces was initially successful in advancing to Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality and putting it under siege.  However, they were thereafter crushed by aid troops that Emperor Taizong himself commanded and trapped by Khitan forces at Jin'an Base (晉安寨, near Taiyuan).  When Li Congke sought advice from his officials, Long Min (龍敏) suggested that he create Li Zanhua the Emperor of Khitan and send an army to escort him back to Khitan territory, to create a second front that Khitan's Emperor Taizong would have to deal with.  Li Congke gave initial approval to the plan, but the more powerful officials opposed, believing the plan to be useless, and nothing eventually came of it.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280/&gt;

Eventually, Emperor Taizong created Shi the emperor of a new [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] (as its Emperor Gaozu), and Shi subsequently headed south, with Khitan aid, toward the Later Tang capital [[Luoyang]].  With Later Tang generals defecting to Later Jin in droves, Li Congke gathered his family and generals loyal to him to the palace, intending to commit suicide by burning down the palace.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280/&gt;  When he summoned Li Zanhua, however, Li Zanhua refused to join the mass suicide, so Li Congke sent the officer Li Yanshen (李彥紳) to kill Li Zanhua.  After the new Later Jin emperor entered Luoyang, he mourned Li Zanhua, posthumously created Li Zanhua the Prince of Yan, and had his body delivered back to Khitan.&lt;ref name=HL72/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280/&gt;

==Biography==

=== Family and personal life ===
As a descendant of a [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] [[Mirza]] nobility from his mother, İlber Ortaylı's family fled [[Joseph Stalin]]'s persecution and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deportation]], and was born in [[Bregenz]], [[Austria]] in a refugee camp on 21 May 1947. He came to [[Turkey]] when he was 2 years old.

İlber Ortayli is heir to a bilingual Turkish family so that he obtained German from his father and Russian from his mother. As a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]] historian he has enough competency in Italian, English, French, Persian and also in Ottoman Turkish and Latin in order to fluently employ or maintain historical research with historical documents in the archives.&lt;ref name="min"&gt;[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313B6B8DA541AA02A11ED7DB6D9E3FA8EFE Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism -  ''İlber Ortaylı'']&lt;/ref&gt; His published articles are mainly in Turkish, German and French and various of them are translated in English.

During his studies in Turkey, he also worked as a travel guide which according to him improved his approach to the history: cultivating his apprehension in practice and gave him an opportunity "to give lecture on history" to different groups of people from different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zaman Kaybolmaz: Ilber Ortaylı Kitabı|last=Uysal|first=Nilgün|publisher=İş Bankası yayınları|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives credit to his experiences as travel guide for writing "popular history" books and essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/moskova-da-ogreniyor-veletler-39118620|title=Interview with İlber Ortaylı in Turkish / Hürriyet Newspaper|last=Ortaylı|first=İlber|date=12 December 1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public figure ===

==== Criticism on Turkish intellectual and political figures ====
{{Essay-like|section|date=May 2017}}
Among his interviews on TV, newspapers; Ortaylı’s critical discourse on Turkish intellectual and political figures became emblematically popular among public even as entertaining [[internet meme]] shared on social media such as humiliating notes written under his photograph as depiction of a superiour personality reacting to the ignorant others.

But his criticisms shouldn’t be confused with [[anti-intellectualism]]. Yet criticism of Turkish intellectuals is an old and an ongoing debate in Turkey and İlber Ortaylı may be put separate from other figures of Turkish media those who shape the public opinion as journalist commentators. He is one of very few to bring historical context -in respect to every subject in its own variety- to debates on contemporary social issues and debates so that his thoughts and opinions bring attention and his knowledge is praised widely among public.

==Works==
Ortaylı's published articles as diplomatic, cultural and intellectual history are briefly on:
* ''Ottoman History''
* ''Russian history'' (e.g. ''"Romanovs and Constantinople''" and ''"19th century Russian Empire"'')
* ''Ottoman-Habsburg Relations''
* ''German Influence in the 19th century Ottoman Empire'' (as his masters degree thesis)
* ''Travel writing In the Ottoman Empire''
* ''History of Turkish Drama'' 
''And also '''urban history''' like'' ''"Latins of the Pera district of the Constantinople"'' for Istanbul and various historical cities which were once under the Ottoman influence; '''history of provincial administration''' focusing on the transformation of institutions in the Ottoman Empire from the beginning to the 19th century. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
