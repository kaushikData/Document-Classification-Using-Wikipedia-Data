      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">The '''24-year rule''' is a rule in [[Denmark|Danish]] immigration law meant to cut down [[forced marriage]]s and [[family reunification]] [[immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhri.net/news.asp?ID=713 Denmark – Analysis of legislation on spouse reunification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013084429/http://www.nhri.net/news.asp?ID=713 |date=2007-10-13 }}. Nhri.net. Retrieved on 2011-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cphpost.dk/news/making-the-cut/200-making-the-cut/51943-the-price-of-love-100000-kroner-and-counting.html |title= The price of love: 100,000 kroner and counting |publisher=[[Copenhagen Post]] |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule has four requirements
# '''Age''' – Non-resident spouses can be united and thus cohabit with their spouse living in Denmark only when both parties have reached the age of 24 years.
# '''Ties''' – The couple’s aggregate ties to Denmark must be stronger than those to the country of origin. However, the demands of aggregate ties are not applicable to people born in Denmark or people who acquired Danish [[citizenship]] as young children and have lived in Denmark for more than 28 years.
# '''Economy''' – The Danish spouse must prove to be able to financially support the new couple (there is a minimum income requirement of twice the welfare benefit rate), post a DKK 100,000 guaranty (the sum is adjusted for inflation annually), and not have received welfare benefits for a year and not owe money to the authorities.
# '''Residence''' – The couple must show that they own or rent a residence of at most two people per room and at least 20 m² (217&amp;nbsp;ft²) per person.

The rule has drawn criticism from [[human rights]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45829-24-year-rule-affects-marriage-rates.html 24-year rule affects marriage rates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120110335/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45829-24-year-rule-affects-marriage-rates.html |date=2011-01-20 }}. Cphpost.dk (2009-06-03). Retrieved on 2011-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule has also been criticized by anti-immigration activists, saying it is not fulfilling its purpose. Instead of cutting down on forced marriages, girls are now being forced by their parents to move either back to their homeland or other European countries where EU rather than local immigration rules apply for Danes and their spouse. The rule also affects many ethnic Danes and their spouses, forcing couples to live in third countries apart from their families and support networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cphpost.dk/news/politics/50410-pm-24-year-rule-expands-to-points-system.html PM: 24-year-rule expands to points system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007052052/http://cphpost.dk/news/politics/50410-pm-24-year-rule-expands-to-points-system.html |date=2011-10-07 }}. Cphpost.dk. Retrieved on 2011-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is supported by all major political parties except [[Red–Green_Alliance_(Denmark)|Enhedslisten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://kbh.enhedslisten.dk/vote-enhedslisten-local-elections-in-copenhagen-2013 |title= Vote Enhedslisten in the local elections |publisher= [[Enhedslisten Copenhagen]] |date= |accessdate= |location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Danish politicians have advocated increasing it to 28 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48039-broad-political-backing-for-28-year-rule.html |title=Broad political backing for 28-year rule |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Copenhagen Post]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120203705/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48039-broad-political-backing-for-28-year-rule.html |archive-date=2011-01-20 |dead-url=yes |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.b.dk/politik/df-vil-sortere-blandt-udlaendinge |title= DF vil sortere blandt udlændinge|publisher= [[Berlingske]] |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also advocated by the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] in neighbouring country [[Norway]], centre-right parties agreed to implement the rule there in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/02/28/nyheter/samfunn/politikk/innenriks/regjeringen/32080843/ "Enighet om asylavtale på Stortinget"], ''Dagbladet''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-enighet-i-asylforhandlingene-1.11569614 "– Enighet i asylforhandlingene"], ''NRK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Animal Welfare Board of India''' ('''AWBI'''), headquartered at [[Ballabhgarh]] in [[Haryana]] state, is a statutory advisory body advising the [[Government of India]]'s [[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change]].&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/mar/06/animal-welfare-board-of-india-headquarters-shifted-from-chennai-to-haryana-1782557.html Animal Welfare Board of India headquarters shifted from Chennai to Haryana],  March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously based at [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

==History==
The Animal Welfare Board of India was established in 1962 under Section 4 of [[The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; Well-known humanitarian [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] was instrumental in setting up the board&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; and was its first chair.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; The Board consists of 28 Members, who serve for a period of 3 years. Its headquarters was in Chennai,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; which moved to Ballabhgarh of [[Faridabad district]] in Haryana state in early 2018.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

The Board was initially within the jurisdiction of the Government of India's Ministry of Food and Agriculture. In 1990, the subject of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was transferred to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change, where it now resides.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt;

===Lab animals===
Concerned about the abuse of animals in research, in the Board's early history, it recommended that the government create the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The Committee was created, and the Board's representative Dr. S. Chinny Krishna deposed twice before the Committee about "the dismal state of laboratories in India."&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; 

A number of years passed before the subject was "taken up effectively by the Government."&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; In 2001, the government passed Rules covering the breeding and experimentation on animals.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt;

===Animals in entertainment===
Another early concern of the Board was the cruelty involved when animals were used in entertainment.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; In 1964, the Board published the booklet, "Circuses - Amusement for the Uncivilised".&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; In 2001, the government passed the Performing Animals Rules, which were amended in 2005.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt; In 2012, the Board reported that the Rules were being implemented in an effective way.&lt;ref name="early days"/&gt;

==Functions==
Some of the functions of the Board include:

===Recognition of Animal Welfare Organisations===
The Board oversees Animal Welfare Organisations (AWOs) by granting recognition to them if they meet its guidelines.&lt;ref name="recognition"/&gt; The organisation must submit paperwork; agree to nominate a representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India on its Executive Committee; and to submit to regular inspections.&lt;ref name="recognition"/&gt; After meeting the requirements and an inspection, the organisation is considered for grant of recognition. The AWBI also appoints key people to the positions of (Hon) Animal Welfare Officers, who serve as the key point of contact between the people, the government and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="recognition"/&gt;

===Financial assistance===
The Board provides financial assistance to recognised Animal Welfare Organisations (AWOs), who submit applications to the Board.&lt;ref name="Financial"/&gt; Categories of grants include Regular Grant, Cattle Rescue Grant, Provision of Shelter House for looking after the Animals, Animal Birth Control (ABC) Programme, Provision of Ambulance for the animals in distress and Natural Calamity grant.&lt;ref name="Financial"/&gt;
===Animal welfare Laws and Rules===
The Board suggests changes to laws and rules about animal welfare issues. In 2011, a new draft Animal Welfare Act was published for comment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awbi.org/?q=node/113 "Draft Animal Welfare Act 2011"], Animal Welfare Board of India, accessed August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Guidance is also offered to organisations and officials such as police to help them interpret and apply the laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awbi.org/?q=node/177 " Protection Laws for guidance of Police, HAWOs, NGOs &amp; AWOs"], Animal Welfare Board of India, accessed August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raising awareness===
The Board issues publications to raise awareness of various animal welfare issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awbi.org/?q=node/48 "Publications"], Animal Welfare Board of India, accessed August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board's Education Team gives talks on animal welfare subjects, and trains members of the community to be Board Certified Animal Welfare Educators.&lt;ref name="humane education"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53192">'''Anti Monopoly Law of China''' refers to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, passed by the National People’s Congress on 30 August 2007, and implemented as of 1 August 2008. 

== Definition ==

The Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) of China in a narrow sense refers only to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, passed by the National People’s Congress on 30 August 2007, and implemented as of 1 August 2008. In a broad sense it refers to the anti-monopoly legal system of China, including not only the AML, the post-AML ancillary legislative, and legal documents for the purpose of enforcing the AML, but also all pre-AML legislative and administrative documents with an anti-monopoly nature, as well as regulatory or administrative enforcement, private enforcement and judicial procedures.  The definition used here refers to its broad meaning.

== History of the Legislation ==

It is commonly recognized that the legislation of the anti-monopoly law in China was initiated in August 1987 when an AML drafting team was set up by the former Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council to formally proceed to draft the AML.  Prior to this, however, and following the economic reforms and opening in China, the State Council had already promulgated The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 23 March 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1 July 1980, aiming to “break down... territorial blockades and departmental barriers.” This was followed by The State Council Provisional Rules on the Launching and Protecting the Socialist Competition&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 October 1980, aiming to “step by step reform the existing economic management system and actively promote and protect... smooth competition;" a third document, the State Council Rules on Further Expediting and Protecting Socialist Competition,&lt;ref&gt;Replaced The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance of 1980 and became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; was released on 23 March 1986. These three documents served as the earliest form of anti-monopoly law and were intended to break down the historical planning of economic monopolies in the pre-1980’s era and to promote the initial and basic market economy and competition.

Since August 1987 onward, the significant milestones of anti-monopoly law legislation in China are as follows:

'''* 1988: the drafting team produced the Anti-Monopoly and Anti Unfair Competition Provisional Regulations (Proposal Draft).'''

* 2 September 1993: the Anti Unfair Competition Law was promulgated by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, implemented as of 1 December 1993.
* 1994: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, and the former National Economic and Trade Commission and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce were delegated to be jointly responsible to draft the AML; in May, the AML Draft Steering Team and AML Draft Working Team were set up
* July 1997: the 1st Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced.
* 1998: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 9th Session of the NPC Standing Committee; in November, the 2nd Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced
* June 2000: the 1st Draft of the AML (Soliciting Opinion Version) was produced
* December 2003: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 10th Session of the NPC Standing Committee as one of the fundamental economic legislations
* 2004: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the State Council; on 26 February, the Ministry of Commerce submitted the AML (For Review Version) to the State Council
* February 2005: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the NPC Standing Committee; in the same year, the State Council set up AML Review and Modify Steering Team, AML Modify Working Team, and AML Review and Modify Expert Team to review and modify the AML (Draft)
* 7 June 2006: the AML (Draft) was reviewed, discussed, and passed in principle by the State Council Executive Meeting that also decided to submit it to the NPC Standing Committee for review upon further revision; from 24 to 29 June, the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the first read of the AML (Draft)
* from 24 to 29 June 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the second read of the AML (Draft) and third read from 24 to 30 August

'''* 30 August 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee passed and promulgated the AML'''

'''* 1 August 2008: the AML was put into enforcement'''

* Post-AML Legislative Practice and Development'''
* Landmark Judicial Judgements and Rulings'''

'''* ''Huawei vs. IDC cases'''''

'''* ''Ruibang vs. Johnson &amp; Johnson case'''''

== The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” and “''rule of reason''” in the anti-monopoly law of China ==

The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” (“''per se rule''”) and the “''rule of reason''” are two landmark and the most important legal theories in the history and development of the anti-trust law not only in its country of origin but also in many other countries and jurisdictions all over the world.  The doctrines make a clear and straight definition in legal theory and can be efficiently and effectively implemented in practical enforcement.  The fact that the doctrines in the United States have directly, effectively and successfully regulated the market situation and competitive practices, protected and promoted the market competition, and the anti-trust legal theory and practice have been consistently evolving and developing to cope with the market, economic and competition development, makes the doctrines significantly influential in the competition law legislation and enforcement in other countries and jurisdictions.

Literally, the doctrines of “per se rule” and the “rule of reason” can be found in the AML context as well as in the Supreme Court Judicial Opinion on one hand, but it is found otherwise in several court judgement on the other hand.

=== Legislation ===

During the processes of the AML legislation, the AML drafting team had not only studied and referenced to the greatest extent the statues of the EU competition law legislation as a result the basic structure and contents of the AML are as close and similar as the EU competition law,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, AML Articles 13, 14 and 15 vs. Articles 81(1), 82 and 81(3) of the EU Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; but had also studied the US antitrust legal theory and cases and consulted the US antitrust law experts.  As such, the spirit of the doctrines of “''per se rule''” and the “''rule of reason''” indeed exists or influences the creation of the AML.

In the legislation, as far as the literal provisions of the AML is concerned, it is found that '''Articles 13 (horizontal agreement), 14 (vertical Agreement) and 17(1) (abuse of dominant market position)''' as one category using the literal word "prohibit" without any pre condition, while there is a condition of "reasonable cause" for the "prohibition" in '''Articles 17(2) to (6) (abuse of dominant market position without justifiable cause)''' as another category, as a result making literal difference that there should be different legislative purposes and intents as well as different legal meanings in the AML between the above two categories: with regard to the unconditional prohibition in the first category on one hand, any agreement or conduct breaching unconditional prohibition will then constitute a violation of law without regard to the result or effect caused by the violation, as such these unconditional prohibitions can be treated or argued to have the nature or character of "''illegal per se''" and accordingly it is an alternative expression of "''illegal per se rule''" in the AML; while with regard to Articles 17(2) to (6), on the other hand, the literal words "reasonable cause", given its obvious literal meaning, will then be an alternative expression of the "''rule of reason''".

=== Supreme Court Judicial Opinion ===

In the judicial opinion, however, unlike the EU Court of First Instance in Case T-112/99 M6 and Others v Commission&lt;ref&gt;Section 72, Case T-112/99 [2001] Métropole télévision (M6), Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux, France Télécom and Télévision française 1 SA (TF1) v Commission of the European Communities&lt;/ref&gt; has expressly denied the existence of "''rule of reason''" in the EU competition law, China Supreme Court by far has yet clearly clarified and it has been hesitating in its Judicial Opinions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Civil Cases Caused by Monopolistic Conducts (Fa Shi [2012] No. 5)&lt;ref&gt;Passed by the China Supreme Court on 30 January 2012, published on 3 May 2012 and implemented as of 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (hereinafter the “SCJO”) if the "''illegal per se rule''" and the "''rule of reason''" exists in the anti-monopoly legal system of China or can be invoked in the practical enforcement cases or not, in other words, it still remains unclear if '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category would have the nature of "''illegal per se''" and only '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category subject to the "''rule of reason''", or if there is any different legislative purpose and intent and different legal meaning or not between the two categories.  As a result, also unlike the EU Court of First Instance in the same Case T-112/99 that has clearly stated that the pro- or anti-competition aspects should be examined within the scope of Article 85(3) of the EU Treaty, otherwise “Article 85(3) of the Treaty would lose much of its effectiveness if such an examination had to be carried out already under Article 85(1) of the Treaty”,&lt;ref&gt;Section 74, Case T-112/99 [2001].&lt;/ref&gt; China Supreme Court has further left unclear if the "reasonable cause" provided in Articles 17(2) to (6) is limited to the pre-set scope in Article 15 or all relevant pro- or anti-competition aspects of undertaking and the relevant market can be taken into account and examined according to the doctrine of "''rule of reason''".

In the Supreme Court Judicial Oipnions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Anti-Monopoly Civil Dispute Cases (Soliciting Comment Version) Circulated by the China Supreme Court on 25 April 2011 (hereinafter the “SCJO SCV”), unlike in the literal provisions of the AML, it seems to draw no distinction as between '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category as initially drafted as in Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO : “The victims of the monopoly agreements shall have burden of proof against the alleged monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition.  The victims shall not have burden of proof against such monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition if the monopoly agreements fall within the scope of ''Articles 13(1) to (5)'' or ''Articles 14(1) and (2)'', except for if the alleged undertakings to the said monopoly agreements are able to prove otherwise by the contrary evidence.” which could be read as that both Articles 13(1) to (5) or Articles 14(1) and (2) are subject to effect examination (''rule of reason'').

In the official SCJO, however, Article 7 of the SCJO merely provides that “the defendant shall have burden of proof for no effect of exclusion and restriction of competition for acts falling within the monopoly agreements under Articles 13(1) to (5)”, which draws an obvious distinction between the formally equal Article 13, per se illegal unless defendant proves otherwise, and Article 14, subject to plaintiff’s burden of proof on effect (or rule of reason) examination.&lt;ref&gt;See Paragraph (1) in Section 6.3 Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case below.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO also seems to have drawn an unclear distinguish on burden of proof between Article 17(1) from Articles 17(2) to (6) by saying “plaintiff shall [only] have burden of proof for the dominant position, and the abuse of such dominant position by the defendant in the relevant market”, alleged defendant monopoly conduct will be justified unless plaintiff proves illegal by effect examination (or rule of reason); this Article 8 seems to make AML Article 17(1) equal to Articles 17(2) to (6)  that both are subject to the effect examination.

=== Judicial Judgements ===

This topic, especially as to if there is any difference between Articles 13 and 14, remained unclear until the Ruibang vs. J&amp;J case that Shanghai High Court made a very judgement on 1 August 2013 in which including an analysis on the interrelations between AML Articles 13 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 7(ii) below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shanghai High Court examined and concluded that “the effects of exclusion and restriction of competition are the constitutive and necessary factors in the examination of monopoly agreement with clause of restricting the minimum resale price as referred to in Article 14 of the AML”.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 38 and 39 of the Ruling.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this ruling and the position that Shanghai High Court allowed both plaintiff and defendant to submit and cross examine the reports prepared by the economic experts on the relevant markets, J&amp;J’s products and its market share, the effects of pro- and anti-competition of the alleged vertical agreement in question with restriction on the minimum resale price, etc., it appears that Shanghai High Court is rather in favour of agreeing to conduct a comprehensive examination of all related aspects in particular of the pro- and anti-competition effects of "Article 14 agreements" in accordance with the doctrine of the “rule of reason”.

=== Administrative Enforcement ===

Nonetheless the above, however, in the administrative enforcement, it appears that the NDRC is rather apt to apply the doctrine of “illegal per se rule” directly to the first category (i.e., AML Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)) because of the low difficulty and costs and easy proceeding to apply the “per se rule” in the administrative enforcement of the AML.  This is evidenced by the most recent four major cases that NDRC announced during January to August 2013 &lt;ref&gt;The four major cases include (1) LED panel price fixing agreement case amongst Samsung, LG, Chimei, AU Optronic、Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Hannstar; (2) price monopoly case by Wuliangye and Maotai; (3) price monopoly case by Shanghai Gold Accessories Industry Association and several Gold Accessory Shops; and (4) “agreements to restricting minimum resale price agreements” case by milk powder suppliers including Biostime, Mead Johnson, Danone Dumex, Abbott, Friso and Fonterra; in which LED price fixing agreements existed prior to the AML implementation and the NDRC’s ruling was then based on the Price Law instead of AML.  However, as it was defined at the beginning, Price Law is also an important component of the anti-monopoly law of China in broad sense.&lt;/ref&gt; because neither examination nor analysis on the “reason” or “reasonable cause” had ever been made to the effects of restriction or exclusion of competition by the alleged monopolistic conducts.  Albeit this has been questioned,&lt;ref&gt;While there had no questionable comment made towards the application of “per se rule” in the LED and Gold Accessories cases because both of which were horizontal agreements, some questions and comments had been made towards the milk powder and Wuliangye/Maotai vertical agreement cases that whether or not the “reason” or the “reasonable cause” must have been examined, on a case by case basis, for the effects of exclusion or restriction of competition before the decision was made.&lt;/ref&gt; NDRC appears to follow and carry on the strategy and tactics that were adopted in the US in the early stage of the enforcement of Sherman Act at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries to put a direct “''illegal per se''” effect to the AML Articles 13 and 14.  This makes very important sense because it is drawing a boundary line as between the “''illegal per se''” conducts and agreement and those conducts and agreement with “reasonable cause”.

In a summary, until the Supreme Court clearly interprets this important issue by further judicial opinions or rulings, whether or not the unconditional prohibition in Articles 13 and 14 would equally have similar nature of "illegal per se" and how to distinguish Articles 13 and 14 them from the "reasonable cause" in Articles 17(2) to (6), still remain an open topic in the anti-monopoly legal system in China.

== Legal Applicable Exemptions ==

The AML adopts in Article 15&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Article 15, AML Articles 55 and 56 also provide extra exceptions where the AML will not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; the same doctrine of “legal applicable exceptions” as in Article 81(3) of the EU Treaty.  Unlike the EU competition law that the EU Commission has promulgated and implemented various specific regulations for the purpose of implementing and enforcing Article 81(3), however, several fundamental issues such as the specific contents and criteria of the “legal exceptions”, who has the authority or being authorized to stipulate the implementing rules, by the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council, or the NDRC or SAIC, still remain unclear in the anti-monopoly legal system.  In private enforcement, the contents and criteria of the proof of evidences for “reasonable cause” and whether the assessment and comparison between pro-competition vs. anti-competition are limited within the preset scope of AML Article 15 only or can include all reasonable  causes in all relevant aspects or elements beyond AML Article 15, also remain unclear.

== Some Landmark Cases and Judicial Judgements ==

There is no precedent case law in China.  The judgements, especially those methodological or judicial examinations in the judicial rulings or opinions made by the high court or the Supreme Court in the landmark cases, are commonly studied by law practitioners, academic researchers and sometimes indirectly as a principle or guideline invoked by other courts in the subsequent cases.

=== 'Huawi v. IDC cases' ===

In 2011, Huawei brought two separate litigations against the same group of defendants of Inter Digital Corporation, Inc. and its affiliated companies (IDC).  The first case was brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for the judicial ruling on the royalty rate by Huawei to IDC for certain patent licenses ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 857, Case 857) and the second on was also brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for damages caused by IDC’s abuse of dominant market position ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 858, Case 858).  Both cases were appealed to the Guangdong Provincial High Court.Guangdong Provincial High Court made the final judgement on the first Huawei v. IDC case (Case No. 857) On 16 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 305, Judgement 305) and on the second one (Case 858) on 21 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 306, Judgement 306).  Upon the petition of both Huawei and IDC, both cases were not publicly heard due to the large amount of sensitive commercial and technical information and dada.

The two judgements made by Guangdong High Court are published in which all sensitive information and data are redacted. Both cases and the two judgements, usually treated as one combined case by Huawei against IDC, have been appraised by the China Courts as one of the best 10 AML cases by then, while commented by the public as very controversial.  The following can be considered:

(1)	In Judgement 305 (Case 857): there is an extremely lack of (1) judicial analysis to justify and support the ruling on choices of Chinese law and the forum jurisdiction of the China court in a royalty rate case arising from, or at least substantially depending on the interpretation of, royalty policy and rules of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI, which is organized and governed by French law; (2) legal grounds under the current Chinese law on the [discretionary] right of the court in determining a non-tort (or infringement), non-breach of contract, but a pure commercial term as well as its other judicial rulings.

(2)	On 14 April 2014, IDC filed a petition to the China Supreme Court for retrial and seeking a dismissal of this judgement or at least a higher, market-based royalty rate.  It is currently pending with China Supreme Court.

(3)	In Judgement 306 (Case 858), this is rather an “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 than an “abuse of dominant market position” case under AML Article 17, Guangdong High Court finally upheld the initial judgement to judge IDC to compensate Huawei RMB20 millions. this final Ruling covered two AML aspects both of which are not only jurisprudence important but also leading edge.  The first aspect is the “extraterritoriality” under AML Article 2, while the second aspect is that the Ruling appears to make use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55.&lt;ref&gt;It appears that both plaintiff and the Court recognized the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic nature of the intellectual property right according to the relevant laws, as such the difficulty, especially the burden of proof, in the “abuse of intellectual property right” litigation is significantly higher than the “abuse of dominant market position” litigation, the latter of which can be established as a good arguable case on the basis of the adequate information and data of the relevant market.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) AML Article 2 is itself too general and vague which merely empowers the right and offers possibility to apply “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  As to how to apply such “extraterritorial jurisdiction”, the detailed rules, conditions and criteria in the application, neither AML nor the Supreme Court has yet made any clear implementing regulations, interpretation or guideline, but would rather merely rely on the discretionary power of the competent court.  Taking these into account in conjunction with the complicated factors of either or both private and public international laws that may be associated with the application of “extraterritorial jurisdiction” as well as that many other courts may possibly follow after this Ruling to apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction” in other cases, it appears to be desirable and urgent for the Supreme Court to make judicial ruling as to how to appropriately and delicately apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  (2) Because this Ruling may be a modeling precedent of making use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 or even it is merely an “abuse of dominant market position” case involving intellectual property right elements, how to treat and balance the prohibition of “abuse of intellectual property right” verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right as well as verse the legal exception of application of the AML provided in the same AML Article 55, and how to treat the anti-monopoly provisions provided by the AML verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right provided by intellectual property laws such as Patent Law, all of such complicated and delicate issues remain unclear and uncertain pending the Supreme Court judicial opinion, in order to not only protect competition and prohibit monopoly but also to protect the intellectual property right as well as its lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right.

NDRC, upon Huawei’s petition (or informant), launched the formal AML investigation against IDC in June 2013.  With the high pressure from the NDRC, IDC eventually reached a private settlement with NDRC by making certain commitments leading to NDRC withdrawing the investigation in May 2014.  It is widely believed that both courts (of Shenzhen Municipality and Guangdong Province) and NDRC played both judicial and administrative sticks against IDC to support Huawei’s launching and development in the US market.

=== 'Ruibang v. Johnson &amp; Johnson cases' &lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 4 above for analysis on the application of “rule of reason” in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;===

This is the first judicial case and judgement of vertical monopoly agreement under AML Article 14.2, as well as the first case that the High Court (of appeal) overruled the judgement in favour of the defendant made by the Intermediate Court (of first instance).

The fact of the case is simple and straightforward: Ruibang Yonghe Technology Co., Ltd. ("Ruibang"), the plaintiff in this case, is an authorized distributor of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Shanghai) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. and Johnson &amp; Johnson (China) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. ("J&amp;J"), the defendants in the case, in the authorized territory under a distribution agreement.  Ruibang sued J&amp;J to the Shanghai Pudong New District Court for J&amp;J's partially withdraw of Ruibang's distributorship, taking off Ruibang's distributor deposit and eventually refusing to supply by reason of Ruibang's breach of lowest re-sell price in the unauthorized territory.  Both courts (of first instance and appeal) made similar judicial analysis in term of AML Article 14.2, Shanghai New District Court made a judgement on 18 May 2012 (Judgement (2010) Hu Yi Zhong Min Wu (Zhi) Chi Zi No 169) in favour of J&amp;J on the ground of plaintiff's insufficient evidence.  Ruibang appealed to the Shanghai High Court and submitted a very comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of China Foreign Economic and Trade University, as a defending fight back J&amp;J also submitted the a comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of Shanghai Finance and Economic University.  The Shanghai High Court conclusively made a judgement on 1 August 2013 (Judgement (2012) Hu Gao Min San (Zhi) Zhong Zi No 63) that overruled the judgement made by the Shanghai Pudong New District Court ruling that J&amp;J had violated AML Article 14.2 and be liable for the judged damages.

This case and its final judgement offer some observation:

(1)	Under the AML, the vertical agreement is subject to “rule of reason”, namely, it is not “per se illegal” but very likely “per se challengeable” and “effect” test is necessary to assess if a vertical agreement breaches the AML, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Page 38 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2)	Four elements in the “effect” test: (1) sufficient competition, (2) market position, (3) motivation, and (4) effects of competition restriction and competition promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 40-61 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(3)	The application of the doctrine of maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit in the AML private enforcement case.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 39-40 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case' ===

This is a case of the “abuse of dominant market position”, the first AML private enforcement case that was initially brought to and examined by the provincial High Court, then appealed to and finally judged by the Supreme Court, and by far, the Supreme Court’s written judgement is the best and most professional, both judicially and technically, judicial judgement of its kind ever amongst all AML cases in China.  Given the judicial power and nature of the Supreme Court, this judgement established and reaffirmed several very important judicial rules with precedent case law effect insofar as the private enforcement of AML is concerned.

These important judicial rules include:

(1)	reaafirms the doctrine of semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit (he who alleges must prove) with regard to the allocation of onus probandi (burden of proof) in the AML judicial case

(2)	defining relevant market is not a purpose but instead rather a methodology in assessing the relevant undertaking’s market power and the influence power of the alleged monopoly conduct on to the competition, as such it is not compulsory to specifically and exactly define the relevant market in every AML litigation of abuse of dominant market position

(3)	an HMT (hypothetical monopoly test) based on tools of SSNIP (small but significant and non-transitory increase in price) or SSNDQ (small but significant and non-transitory decrease in quality) may be conducted in defining the relevant market but should be conducted carefully with cautious

(4)	the related market situation and technology development trend post the litigation may be taken into consideration in defining the relevant market

(5)	market share is not the only one element in concluding dominant market position

(6)	multi elements should be comprehensively evaluated in defining the dominant market position, including but not limited to: (1) the market share of the undertaking in question and the competition situation of the said market; (2) the control ability of the undertaking in question in the said market; (3) the financial and technical status of the undertaking in question; (4) the degree of dependence of other undertakings on the undertaking in question; and (5) the degree of difficulty to access to the relevant markey by other undertakings

(7)	if the relevant market is clearly defined and the alleged undertaking does not have dominant market position, normally it is not necessary to conduct an abuse behavior analysis and it can be directly concluded that such undertaking did not have abuse behavior; however, if neither the boundary of the relevant market nor the dominant market position of the alleged undertaking is clear or if the alleged undertaking had dominant market position, “effect examination” may be carried out so as to determine if the alleged conduct was lawful or not

(8)	the “tie-in” under the AML is illegal if it meets all of these criteria: (1) the base product and the “tie-in” product are independent to each other, (2) the undertaking has dominant market position in the base product market, (3) certain enforcement implemented upon the buyer who became lack of other options but to accept the tie-in product, (4) the tie-in could not be justified, was contrary to the commercial or consumer practice or ignored the functionalities of the products, and (5) the tie-in gave rise to negative effect to the competition

(9)	if an undertaking successfully proved the alleged monopoly conduct was justifiable under AML does not mean such undertaking has automatically and same successfully proved the monopoly conduct has not caused negative effect of exclusion or restriction of competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1811">'''The Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland''' – often known as the '''Declaratory Articles''' - were drawn up early in the 20th century to facilitate the union of the [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. The "declaratory" nature of the Articles means that they are intended to define or "declare" a status that already existed, but explicitly spelt out for the avoidance of doubt. By an Act of Parliament – The [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]] – the Articles Declaratory were held to be lawful, thus recognising the [[Church of Scotland]] as the national church in [[Scotland]] but independent from the state in matters spiritual. They are still in force. Special procedures are required to amend the Articles Declaratory (see Article VIII), but Article I cannot be altered.

'''''Bauer &amp; Cie. v. O'Donnell''''', 229 U.S. 1 (1913), was a 1913 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision involving whether a purchaser of a patented product bearing a price–fixing notice incurs guilt of patent infringement by reselling the product at a price lower than that which the notice commands. A divided Court (5-4) held that it was not.

Bauer &amp; Cie, a German company, was the assignee of U.S. Patent No. 601,995, covering [[Sanatogen]], a water-soluble drug product (patent medicine), advertised as the "King of Tonics" and a strength-giving "concentrated scientific food."&lt;ref&gt;See advertisement at right, [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1911-06-23/ed-1/seq-2/ {{smallcaps|N.Y. Daily Tribune}}], p.2 (June 23, 1911). A January 1913 article in [https://books.google.com/books?id=eoDOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=santogen+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sFnWQT5DPq&amp;sig=-wzVAdxTPQ_NFYHeRiZw7wZs2hg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwJOHq63MAhWGlh4KHZhlCxsQ6AEINDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=santogen%20patent&amp;f=false ''Good Housekeeping''] stated that Sanatogen "was representative of the class of advertised tonics which make exaggerated claims and charge a high price." It added that $1 worth of Sanatogen was equivalent to 6¢ worth of milk and 1¢ worth of wheat flour.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer sold the patented product in the United States through its exclusive sales agent, Hehmeyer, under a license agreement.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanatogen was sold with this notice on each bag:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Notice to the Retailer.
This size package of Sanatogen is licensed by us for sale and use at a price not less than one dollar ($1.00). Any sale in violation of this condition, or use when so sold, will constitute an infringement of our patent No. 601,995, under which Sanatogen is manufactured, and all persons so selling or using packages or contents will be liable to injunction and damages.

A purchase is an acceptance of this condition. All rights revert to the undersigned in the event of violation.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Donnell, a retail druggist in Washington, DC, purchased Sanatogen at wholesale and resold the Sanatogen for less than $1. He persisted in doing this and was cut off, but he managed to continue to purchase the product from jobbers in DC "and avers that he will continue such sales." This led to the present patent infringement suit. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia certified the case to the Supreme Court with this question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did the Acts of the appellee [O'Donnell] in retailing at less than the price fixed in said notice on original packages of ''Sanatogen'' purchased of jobbers, as aforesaid, constitute infringement of appellants' patent?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==
[[File:William Rufus Day cph.3b31004.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Justice Day delivered the majority opinion]]

Justice [[William R. Day]] delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices White, Hughes, Lamar, Pitney. Justices McKenna, Holmes, Lurton, and Van Devanter dissented without opinion.

The Court restated the question before it as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The question therefore now before this Court for judicial determination, is: may a patentee, by notice, limit the price at which future retail sales of the patented article may be made, such article being in the hands of a retailer by purchase from a jobber who has paid to the agent of the patentee the full price asked for the article sold?&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The patentee argued that the purpose of the restrictive notice was "to prevent ruinous competition by the cutting of prices in sales of the patented article." Day responded, however, that absent a patent the Court had held resale price fixing unlawful in ''[[Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.]]'' And Congress could, if it had wanted to, have conferred on patentees the right to impose such restrictions. He then asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Has it done so? The question has not been determined in any previous case in this Court, so far as we are aware. It was dealt with under the copyright statute, however, in the case of ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Bobbs-Merrill'' case the Court held that the copyright was exhausted by the first sale, and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t was not the purpose of the law to grant the further right to qualify the title of future purchasers by means of the printed notice affixed to the book, and that to give such right would extend the statute beyond its fair meaning and secure privileges not intended to be covered by the Act of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court recognized that "there are differences between the copyright statute and the patent statute, and the purpose to decide the question now before us was expressly disclaimed" in ''Bobbs–Merrill''. Nonetheless, "it is apparent that, in the respect involved in the present inquiry, there is a strong similarity between and identity of purpose in the two statutes." Both statutes grant an exclusive right to "vend." There is no difference of importance in the respective legal rights to vend books and vend products:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as the use of the terms "vend" and "vending" is concerned, the protection intended to be secured is substantially identical. The sale of a patented article is not essentially different from the sale of a book. In each case, to vend is to part with the thing for a consideration.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The patentee here insists that the purpose of notices fixing resale prices, specifically "keeping up prices and preventing competition"—is more essential to the protection of patented goods than of copyrighted books. The Court expressed doubt that this was so, but in any case it was more likely that "Congress had no intention to use the term 'vend' in one sense in the patent act and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. in another in the copyright law." Congress intended to provide "[p}rotection in the exclusive right to sell .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. in both instances, and the terms used in the statutes are to all intents the same."&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1911_adv't_for_Samtogen,_King_of_Tonics.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sanatogen, "crowned King of Tonics," according to this 1911 advertisement, was "a concentrated scientific food that constructively gives strength and vitality"]]
The only significant difference is that patent law gives an exclusive right to use and copyright law does not. The Supreme Court decision involving a post-sale restraint on which the patentee places chief reliance here is ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 1 (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; But that decision was based on the exclusive ''use'' right:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he restriction was sustained because of the right to ''use'' the machine granted in the patent statute, distinguishing in that respect the patent from the copyright act. In that case, a patented mimeograph had been sold which bore an inscription in the form of a notice that the machine was sold with the license restriction that it might only be ''used'' with stencil, ink, and other supplies made by the A. B. Dick Company, the owners of the patent. The alleged infringer sold to the purchaser of the mimeograph a can of ink suitable for ''use'' with machine, with full knowledge of the restriction, and with the expectation that the ink sold would be ''used'' in connection with the machine.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 14 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, the patentee has argued "that the notice in this case deals with the use of the invention, because the notice states that the package is licensed 'for sale and use at a price not less than $1,' [and] that a purchase is an acceptance of the conditions.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;." But, the Court insisted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is a perversion of terms to call the transaction in any sense a license to use the invention. The jobber from whom the appellee [O'Donnell] purchased had previously bought, at a price which must be deemed to have been satisfactory, the packages of Sanatogen afterwards sold to the appellee. The patentee had no interest in the proceeds of the subsequent sales, no right to any royalty thereon, or to participation in the profits thereof. The packages were sold with as full and complete title as any article could have when sold in the open market, excepting only the attempt to limit the sale or use when sold for not less than $1. In other words, the title transferred was full and complete, with an attempt to reserve the right to fix the price at which subsequent sales could be made.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. There was no transfer of a limited right to use this invention, and to call the sale a license to use is a mere play upon words.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co v. Straus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;210 U.S. 339 (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; with copyright, the Court ruled, restrictions could not be extended beyond the terms of the statute, which grants an exclusive right to vend but grants no "privilege to keep up prices and prevent competition by notices restricting the price at which the article may be resold." When the right to vend is exercised, patent rights are [[Exhaustion doctrine|exhausted]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This being so, the case is brought within that line of cases in which this Court, from the beginning, has held that a patentee who has parted with a patented machine by passing title to a purchaser has placed the article beyond the limits of the monopoly secured by the patent act. [As in] ''[[Adams v. Burke]]'', .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.  in the essential nature of things, when the patentee, or the person having his rights, sells a machine or instrument whose sole value is in its use, he receives the consideration for its use and he parts with the right to restrict that use. The article, in the language of the court, passes without the limit of the monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;229 U.S. at 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==

● A contemporary Note in the ''Michigan Law Review'' said the case "was of vital importance to a large number of manufacturers," as was "evidenced by the various ingenious methods and devices which have since been adopted by numerous manufacturers to avoid the operation and application of the principles set forth in the decision," such as leasing and agency. The writer was surprised that "The tendency of the Supreme Court seems to be to take the view that the monopoly enjoyed by the patentee was not meant by Congress to be without limitation, and consequently to make it practically impossible for the patentee to control the retail price."

The writer maintains: "This decision by the Supreme Court was unquestionably a very great surprise to many, as it is not only directly in conflict with an almost unbroken line of decisions of the inferior federal courts," beginning with the ''Button-Fastener'' case, and "it is also nearly impossible to reconcile this decision" with ''Henry v. A. B. Dick Co.'' As for the ''Dick'' case, the writer continues, "It was generally thought that in the ''Dick'' case the Supreme Court had expressly committed itself to the doctrine that the patentee could require the user to comply with any conditions which he might choose to impose." He considers the distinction drawn with that case to be flimsy and not "clear, sound, or convincing."&lt;ref&gt;Note, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1275326 ''The Right of the Patentee to Control the Resale Price''], 12 {{smallcaps|Mich. L. Rev.}} 394 (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

● A contemporary Note in the ''California Law Review'' also observed that in light of the ''A.B. Dick'' decision it was natural "that some slight surprise should be occasioned by the decision of the Supreme Court in the so-called Sanatogen case which holds that a patentee is without right to make or enforce a resale price stipulation." More accurately than the Michigan note, this note attributed the see-sawing in recent years to the changes in the personnel of a closely divided Court and successive replacements by new Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson appointees:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is of decided interest to note that the four justices who constituted the majority of the court in the ''Dick'' case, dissented from the decision of the ''Sanatogen'' case. Of the five justices who formed the majority in the latter decision, three had vigorously dissented in ''Henry v. Dick Company''; the other two justices took no part in the determination of the earlier case. Whether there be a valid ground of distinction between the two cases or not, the results reached would seem to be best accounted for by the difference in the personnel of the court. The law on this and other simiIar questions in regard to a patentee's rights is apparently in a state of some uncertainty, and the presence or absence of certain justices would seem to be an important factor in the determination of any case which might arise in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Note, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3474103 ''Right of Patentee to Restrict Sale and Use of Patented Article''], 2 {{smallcaps|Cal. L. Rev.}} 80, 81 (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

● Granville Munson, in a 1917 article on post-sale restraints, found the ''A.B. Dick'' and ''Bauer'' cases irreconcilable: "It is submitted the ''Sanatogen'' case and the ''Dick'' case cannot both be upheld, although the court professes to distinguish the latter." He i9nsisted that the exclusive right to "vend" must include the right to set terms and conditions on which the patented article will be vended, and not just the right to sell or not sell: "If the word, "vend," is to have any particular meaning in the patent law, it is submitted it must be taken to refer to the conditions which may be imposed on subsales." Munson therefore concludes that "the decision in ''Bauer &amp; Cie v. O'Donnell'' should not be supported."&lt;ref&gt;F. Granville Munson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/786819 ''Control of Patented and Copyrighted Articles after Sale''], 26 {{smallcaps|Yale}} L.J. 270, - (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;

● Charles Miller was critical of the Court's decision to suppress Bauer's resale price fixing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal argument of those opposed to price maintenance among retailers, in legislative committees, and on the bench, is that after one has parted with title to an article, he should not be allowed further to control it. That idea seems to underlie the recent enunciations of the Supreme Court .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The fallacy in this argument is that the manufacturer's interest in his product does not end with the transfer of title to the dealer, but follows the article into the hands of the ultimate consumer or user. His business life is dependent upon the public's being able to buy his article everywhere at a uniform price, and always of the same quality. Cut price sales will speedily and surely decrease the sale of his product; and if he is able to survive the loss of business, the manufacturer will be forced to reduce the quality of his article. One dealer advertising a so-called "cut price" sale invariably causes other dealers to cut below him in retaliation, with the result that all dealers in the community are forced to sell the particular article at a price which yields no profit. It hardly need be said they will not long continue to handle an article at a loss; so the market for the article is killed in that community, not because the people want the "just-as-good" substitute, nor because the quality of the article has been lowered, nor because the standard price is exorbitant, but because a business parasite used the good name of a popular article to deceive the. public into believing he sold everything below cost.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Miller, ''The Maintenance of Uniform Resale Prices'', 63 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 22, 30 (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The price cutter is not a philanthropist, lie is a robber, stealing the advertising and filching the good will of another's product; and like all thieves he does not share his booty with the public. "I cannot believe", said Mr. Justice Holmes in his strong dissent in the ''Dr. Miles Case,'' "that in the long run the public will profit by this court permitting knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose of their own, and thus to impair, if not destroy, the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public should be able to get."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc.''''', 356 U.S. 525 (1958), decided on May 19, 1958, was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that refined the doctrine regarding in what instances courts were required to follow state law.

==Background of the case==
Electric power utility company Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., the defendant in this case, provided electric power to subscribers in rural [[South Carolina]].  James Earl Byrd, the plaintiff, was employed by R. H. Bouligny, Inc., an [[independent contractor]]. Bouligny had a $334,300 contract with Blue Ridge to construct 24 miles of new power lines, the reconversion to higher capacities of about 88 miles of existing lines, and the construction of two new [[Electrical substation|substations]] and a breaker station. Byrd touched a live wire and suffered injuries while connecting power lines to one of the new substations. He brought a claim against his employer, Bouligny, and collected workmen's compensation, his guaranteed but only remedy for work-related injuries under state law. Byrd then proceeded to bring an action in [[Diversity jurisdiction|diversity]] against Blue Ridge in the [[United States District Court for the District of South Carolina|District Court for the Western District of South Carolina]]. Byrd was a resident of the state of [[North Carolina]] and Blue Ridge was a South Carolina corporation. Byrd sought damages for injuries allegedly caused by Blue Ridge's [[negligence]]. At issue was South Carolina's Workmen's Compensation Act that held that the employees of subcontractors are considered employees of the contractor for the purposes of the Act if, but only if, they perform work that is part of the contractor's trade or business. Additionally, the local judicial interpretation of the Act held that it was a question of law, not fact whether a workman was an employee under the statute, thus to be decided by a judge, not a jury. Byrd argued that the work that Bouligny, Inc. was performing (building electric substations) was not part of Blue Ridge's "trade or business." At trial the judge entered judgment for Byrd (agreeing with the plaintiff that substations are not a part of trade or business, as the use of the substations was purely internal, and trade or business required work for someone else). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed judgment for Blue Ridge. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

==The Court's decision==
The question is whether the cause of action brought by the plaintiff is covered by the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act and therefore whether the plaintiff is barred from any other remedy against his employer in connection with the events at issue in this case. The Court, in a majority opinion by Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], first discussed whether the issue should be decided by a [[jury]] or by a [[court]], as is the practice (and common law) in South Carolina.  The Court notes that while in South Carolina the court decided the question, the rule is not bound up with the definitions and rights of the parties, being purely a practical consideration with irrelevant historic causes, a custom. The Court then addressed the outcome determinative test of York. The Court reasoned that if reaching the same outcome were the only consideration then the federal court would have to follow [[U.S. state|state]] practice.  However, in addition to the outcome-determinative test of York the federal courts should consider any countervailing federal policies. In this case, following the state practice would disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between [[judge]]s and [[juries]] and go against "the influence - if not the command - of the Seventh Amendment" (that guarantees the right of a trial by jury in suits at common law). Thus the Court found that the possibility of a different outcome was less important than perverting the judge-jury function allocations in the [[United States|American]] federal system. Brennan concluded that there is no certainty or even a strong possibility that a different outcome would necessarily result if the issue is decided by a jury, mentioning numerous powers federal judges have (including making judgments notwithstanding the verdict.)

==Analysis==
"There was considerable difficulty in applying the Byrd test.. [that] stem[med] from the fact that there is no scale to say with assurance in a particular case that the federal interest asserted is more or less important than the interest in preserving uniformity of result with the state court." C. Wright &amp; M. Kane, The Law of Federal Courts.

"The [Byrd] opinion exhibits a confusion that exceeds even that normally surrounding a balancing test, and lower courts understandably experienced considerable difficulty in applying it." J. Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693

The '''Center for Women's Justice''' ({{lang-he|מרכז צדק לנשים}}, ''Merkaz Tzedek LeNashim'') is a public interest [[law firm]] devoted to advancing and protecting the rights of women to justice, equality and dignity under [[Halakha|Jewish law]] in Israel.&lt;ref name="Angel - CWJ" /&gt; CWJ is a member organization of ICAR, the [[International Coalition for Agunah Rights]].&lt;ref name="ICAR" /&gt;

==History==
===First cases and approach to changing the system===
The Center for Women's Justice (CWJ) was founded in [[Jerusalem]] in 2004, by attorney Susan Weiss. CWJ initiated the practice of suing recalcitrant husbands (men who refuse to divorce their wives under the authority of Jewish law) for financial damages ([[tort]]s) in Israel's civil courts. CWJ has stated that they intend to file as many claims for ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'' abuse as possible across the country. Their declared goal is to make it an established legal certainty in Israeli courts that get refusal is no longer understood as a religious right, but rather as a civil wrong requiring the awarding of financial damages.&lt;ref name="CWJ torts" /&gt; 

In 2007 CWJ sued the [[Justice Ministry (Israel)|Israeli Justice Ministry]] for [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 4.5 million on behalf of an Israeli woman who had been denied a divorce from her husband for 18 years. The suit alleged that the [[Supreme Rabbinical Court]] was guilty of criminal negligence for having assisted the husband in extorting the wife in exchange for a divorce.&lt;ref name="JPost 10/29/07" /&gt; In 2010 CWJ was one of a number of organizations who filed suit against Israeli Justice Minister [[Yaakov Neeman]] to repeal an Israeli law which prevents women from applying for the position of the executive director of the Rabbinical court.&lt;ref name="Sisterhood 8/4/10" /&gt; CWJ currently provides professional training for attorneys, legal advocacy and education about harmful rabbinic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwj.org.il/en/about|title=About|website=מרכז צדק לנשים|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are funded by a variety of foundations including the [[New Israel Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nif.org/what-we-do/grantmaking/grantees/2016-grantees/|title=2016 Grantees - New Israel Fund (NIF)|work=New Israel Fund (NIF)|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hadassah Foundation and the [[National Council of Jewish Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwj.org.il/en/acknowledgements|title=Acknowledgements|website=מרכז צדק לנשים|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement in conversion issues===
CWJ became involved in [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]] issues in Israel when they took on a client whose Jewish status had come into question during a standard divorce case. In the process of divorce proceedings the Rabbinic judge began to question the religious observance of the wife, a convert to Judaism. Instead of receiving a divorce, the Rabbinic courts revoked the conversion&lt;ref name="Hadassah 11/08" /&gt;—an unheard of decision—as according to Jewish tradition a conversion once completed is irrevocable.&lt;ref name="Transforming Identity" /&gt; The original decision not only revoked the woman and her children's Jewish status, but also brought into question all of the conversions done under the authority of Rabbi [[Haim Drukman]], the head of the Conversion Authority within the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Israel)|Israeli Prime Minister's office]]. CWJ was joined in the suit by several organizations including [[Na'amat]], [[Women's International Zionist Organization|WIZO]] and [[Emunah]].&lt;ref name="Jpost 6/6/08" /&gt;

====Debate over civil and religious jurisdiction====
{{Off-topic|date=August 2012}}
In May 2009, the Israeli [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] gave the ''dayanim'' of the Supreme Rabbinical Court 90 days to justify their decision to revoke the conversions done under the auspices of Rabbi Haim Druckman's conversion court. One of the petitioners was represented by CWJ. Shimon Ya'acobi, attorney for the Rabbinic courts argued that the matter rested solely under the jurisdiction of the [[Beth din|religious courts]] and the secular courts had no authority to rule on the matter.&lt;ref name="JPost 5/18/09" /&gt; Druckman's special conversion court, while dealing exclusively with religious conversion, operated out of the Prime Minister's office and was not under the jurisdiction of the Rabbinical courts.&lt;ref name="Haaretz 10/19/04" /&gt;

==Educational projects==
CWJ's educational efforts include a series of YouTube videos. These videos feature a fictional character known as Savta Bikorta (''lit.'' Grandmother Criticism) who narrates the stories of some of CWJ's real-life court cases in a highly sarcastic tone.&lt;ref name="Savta Bikorta videos" /&gt; In the summer of 2011, CWJ introduced a blog. Blog posts feature CWJ staff, volunteers and interns grappling with the issues they encounter in their daily work with the organization.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt; CWJ Social Awareness Coordinator [[Rivkah Lubitch]] has a regular column on [[Ynet]], a major Israeli news site, in which she discusses issues of religion, state and gender as experienced in her work with CWJ.&lt;ref name="Rivkah's columns" /&gt;

'''Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India''' was formed in 1988 through the merger of the Anand and [[Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Harbhajan Sohi)|Harbhajan Sohi]] factions of [[UCCRI(ML)]], CPI(ML) Chandrashekar group, [[Revolutionary Communist Party (India)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and [[Organizing Committee, CPI(ML)]]. The initiative was taken by the two UCCRI(ML) splinter groups.

In August 1994 CCRI merged with the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] section of [[CPI(ML) Central Team]], [[Communist Unity Centre of India]] and [[Marxist-Leninist Organising Centre]] to form the [[Communist Party Reorganisation Centre of India (Marxist-Leninist)]].

'''Charter 77''' (''Charta 77'' in [[Czech language|Czech]] and in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) was an informal civic initiative in [[communist Czechoslovakia]] from 1976 to 1992, named after the document Charter 77 from January 1977. Founding members and architects were [[Jiří Němec (philosopher)|Jiří Němec]], [[Václav Benda]], [[Ladislav Hejdánek]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Jan Patočka]], [[Zdeněk Mlynář]], [[Jiří Hájek]], [[Martin Palouš]], [[Pavel Kohout]] and [[Ladislav Lis]]. Spreading the text of the document was considered a [[political crime]] by the communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.praguecoldwar.cz/rozborcharta.htm |title=Stanovisko generálního prokurátora ČSSR, předsedy Nejvyššího soudu ČSSR, ministra spravedlnosti ČSR a generálního prokurátora ČSR k 'Prohlášení Charty 77' |trans-title=Opinion of the Attorney General of Czechoslovakia, President of the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia to the 'Declaration of Charter 77' |language=Czech |first=Petr |last=Blažek |journal=PWSV |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], many of its members played important roles in Czech and Slovak politics.

==Founding and political aims==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
Motivated in part by the arrest of members of the psychedelic band [[Plastic People of the Universe]], the text of Charter 77 was prepared in 1976.  In December 1976, the first signatures were collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalita.cz/vysvetlivky/ch77.php Totalita.cz: Charta 77]&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was published on 6 January 1977, along with the names of the first 242 signatories, which represented various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. Although [[Václav Havel]], [[Ludvík Vaculík]] and [[Pavel Landovský]] were [[detention of suspects|detained]] while trying to bring the charter to the [[Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia|Federal Assembly]] and the [[Government structure of Communist Czechoslovakia#Executive Branch|Czechoslovak government]], and the original document was [[confiscated]],&lt;ref name=cuni&gt;[http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/ Podpisy Prohlášení Charty 77 (1977–1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114002852/http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/ |date=2007-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; copies circulated as [[samizdat]] and on 7 January were published in several western newspapers (including [[Le Monde]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[The Times]] and [[The New York Times]]) and transmitted to Czechoslovakia by Czechoslovak-banned [[radio broadcaster]]s like [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Voice of America]].

Charter 77 criticized the government for failing to implement [[human rights]] provisions of a number of documents it had signed, including the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], the Final Act of the 1975 [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (Basket III of the [[Helsinki Accords]]), and 1966 [[United Nations]] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|covenants on political, civil]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|economic, and cultural rights]].&lt;ref name=skilling&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin| isbn = 0043210260| last = Skilling| first = H. Gordon| title = Charter 77 and human rights in Czechoslovakia| location = London ; Boston| year = 1981}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209–212}} The document also described the signatories as a "loose, informal, and open association of people . . . united by the will to strive individually and collectively for respect for human and civil rights in our country and throughout the world." It emphasized that Charter 77 is not an organization, has no statutes or permanent organs, and "does not form the basis for any oppositional political activity." This final stipulation was a careful effort to stay within the bounds of [[Czechoslovak law]], which made organized opposition illegal.

Many of the organization's activists and members gathered on 29 March 2007 at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in Richmond, London, to observe the movement's 30th anniversary and to discuss the historical impact their movement generated in modern European politics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Reaction of the government==
The government's reaction to the appearance of Charter 77 was harsh. The official press described the manifesto as "an anti-state, anti-socialist, and demagogic, abusive piece of writing," {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and individual signatories were variously described as "traitors and renegades,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "a loyal servant and agent of imperialism,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "a bankrupt politician,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and "an international adventurer."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} As it was considered to be an illegal document, the full text of Charter 77 was never published in the official press. However an official group of artists and writers was mobilized into an "anti-charter" movement which included Czechoslovakia's foremost singer [[Karel Gott]] as well as prominent comedic writer [[Jan Werich]] who later claimed he had no idea of what he was doing whilst signing the anti-charter. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Several means of retaliation were used against the signatories, including [[dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] from work, denial of [[right to education|educational opportunities]] for their children, suspension of drivers' licenses, forced exile, loss of citizenship, and detention, trial, and imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Many members were forced to collaborate with the communist secret service (the StB, Czech: [[StB|Státní bezpečnost]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The treatment of Charter 77 signatories prompted the creation in April 1978 of a support group, the [[Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted]] (''Výbor na obranu nespravedlivě stíhaných'' – VONS), to publicize the fate of those associated with the charter. In October 1979 six leaders of this support group, including Václav Havel, were tried for subversion and sentenced to prison terms of up to five years.

Repression of Charter 77 and VONS members continued during the 1980s. Despite unrelenting harassment and arrests, however, the groups continued to issue reports on the government's violations of human rights. Until the Velvet Revolution, Charter 77 had approximately 1,900 signatories.&lt;ref name=cuni/&gt;

==Influence==
Under the dictatorship, the influence of Charter 77 remained limited and only 1,065 people ever signed the document.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 9780385497992| last = Hitchcock| first = William | authorlink = William I.

The majority of Czechoslovak citizens knew of the organization only because of the government's campaign against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tajné služby USA sledovaly zrod Charty 77, její vliv na veřejnost (Secret services of USA observed the emergence of Charta 77 and its influence on public)|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/tajne-sluzby-usa-sledovaly-zrod-charty-77-jeji-vliv-na-verejnost/1425919|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=České noviny|agency=ČTK|date=11 December 2016|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, as the [[Eastern Bloc]] regimes weakened, members of Charter 77 saw their opportunity and became more involved in organizing opposition against the regime in power. During the days of the [[Velvet Revolution]], members of the group negotiated the smooth transfer of political power from dictatorship to democracy. Many were elevated into high positions in the government (e.g. Václav Havel became the President of Czechoslovakia) but since most had no experience in active politics (such as skills in diplomacy or knowledge of [[capitalism]]) they met with mixed success. &lt;!--can someone elaborate on that statement?--&gt;

Charter 77 included people who had a wide range of opinions and, after reaching their common goal, the group's presence faded. An attempt to make the group the focal point of an all-encompassing political party (the [[Civic Forum]]) failed and in 1992 the organization was officially dissolved.

The '''Chief Justice of Cyprus''' was the head of the [[Supreme Court of Cyprus]].

The administration of Cyprus was taken over by the British government, following the Russo-Turkish War, under the [[Cyprus Convention|Convention of 4 June 1878]]. Charles Alfred Cookson was appointed in that year as Chief Justice and Attorney General. Following the outbreak of hostilities between the two countries in 1914 the island was annexed to the British crown. The country became independent on 16 August 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Cyprus Issue: A Documentary History, 1878-2006|first= Murat|last= Hakki|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court of Cyprus was established in 1883.

{{Constitutions of Poland}}

The '''Constitution of the Polish People's Republic''' (also known as July Constitution or Constitution of 1952) was passed on 22 July 1952. Created by the [[Polish communists]] in the [[Polish People's Republic]], it was based on the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] (also known as Stalin Constitution), and it superseded the post-war provisional [[Small Constitution of 1947]] which, in its turn, had declared null and void the pre-war [[April Constitution of Poland]] passed by the Polish [[Sejm]] in 1935. The Russian text of the Constitution was reviewed and 'corrected' by [[Joseph Stalin]] himself,&lt;ref name="PL-radio"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Poprawki nanosił Stalin, ostateczną wersję opracował Bierut ("Amendments traced by Stalin, the final version developed by Bierut") |newspaper=Polskie Radio (Polish Radio) |date=22 July 2012 |language=pl |url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/648908,Poprawki-nanosil-Stalin-ostateczna-wersje-opracowal-Bierut |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213748/http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/648908%2CPoprawki-nanosil-Stalin-ostateczna-wersje-opracowal-Bierut |archivedate=25 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later translated into Polish. It legalized the communist legislature and practices as they had been introduced to Poland with the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] in the wake of [[Red Army]] progress in 1944.

The constitution of 1952 broke the tradition of [[separation of powers]], and introduced instead the Soviet concept of "unity of the state's power".&lt;ref name="Cieplak"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cieplak, Tadeusz N. |chapter=Section 4.

The constitution was amended twenty-four times, with the most contentious [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] being that of 10 February 1976. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989#Poland|revolutions of 1989]] it was significantly amended between 1989 and 1992, and after 29 December 1989 it was known simply as the Constitution of the Republic of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |section=Article 1, Section 1|title=Ustawa z dnia 29 gruduia 1989 r. o zmianie Konstytucja Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej (An Act of 29 December 1989 to amend the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic) |series=Dz.U. 1989 Nr. 75, pos 444 |language=pl |publisher=Sejm, Government of Poland |url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3 &lt;!--|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415000000*/http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3 |archivedate=15 April 2012--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was superseded by the [[Constitution of Poland|new Polish constitution]] on 2 April 1997.

{{anchor|Sejm}}

==Legislative branch==
{{details|Sejm}}

In the [[Polish people's referendum, 1946]] the [[Senate of Poland]] had been abolished with the Sejm remaining the sole legislative body in Poland. Under the 1952 constitution the Sejm officially became the "supreme organ of state power" under article 20.&lt;ref name="Simons-294"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Simons, William B. |year=1980 |title=The Constitutions of the Communist World |location=Alphen ann den Rijn, the Netherlands|publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVl4sNPzWlwC&amp;pg=PA294 294] |isbn=978-90-286-0070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sejm of the People's Republic of Poland started with 425 members in 1952, set so that one deputy represented 60,000 citizens. However, as the population grew the number of deputies expanded, so that by 1960 the constitution was amended, dropping the calculation and stabilizing the Sejm at 460 deputies. An article in the constitution stated that deputies were responsible to the people and could be recalled by the people, although this article was never used. Instead of the [[five-point electoral law]], a four-point version was used (not proportional).

Legislation was passed by [[Majority rule|majority vote]]. The Sejm voted on the budget and [[Planned economy|national plans]] as proposed by the executive. The Sejm deliberated in sessions, but the sessions were called by the [[Polish Council of State|State Council]].

The Sejm would also choose a 'Prezydium' body from its members, with the [[marshal of the Sejm]] always being a member of the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. During its first session the Sejm would also nominate the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] together with other ministers ([[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]]) and members of the  State Council. The Sejm would also choose many other government officials, including the head of the [[The Supreme Chamber of Control of Poland|Supreme Chamber of Control]] (''Najwyższa Izba Kotroli, NIK''), members of the [[The State Tribunal of Poland|State Tribunal]] (''Trybunał Stanu'') and [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] (''Trybunał Konstytucjny'') as well as the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] (''Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich'') (the latter three institutions were created in the 1980s).

In practice, like its counterparts in other Communist regimes, the Sejm did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the PZPR.

==Executive branch==
{{further|State Council of Poland|Council of Ministers of Poland}}
[[Image:Polishcouncilofstate.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A meeting of the Council of State during the 1960s]]
Executive power was held by the Council of Ministers and State Council.&lt;ref name="Cieplak" /&gt; The State Council replaced the previous Polish head of the state, the [[president of Poland]] (the last one being [[Bolesław Bierut]]).&lt;ref name="Cieplak-2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Cieplak|1972|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QOc3RKTiNBEC&amp;pg=PA207 207]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 29 provided that State Council members were elected at the first session of the Sejm for the term of the Sejm (established at four years by Article 28),&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Simons, William B. |year=1980 |title=The Constitutions of the Communist World |location=Alphen ann den Rijn, the Netherlands|publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVl4sNPzWlwC&amp;pg=PA295 295–296] |isbn=978-90-286-0070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could be composed of both deputies and non-deputies; they were usually chosen from the [[Dominant-party system|dominant party]] (that party being the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]) although occasionally it contained non-party members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sakwa, George |year=1976 |title=The Organisation and Work of the Polish Sejm 1952–72 |location=Birmingham, England |publisher=Centre for Russian and East European Studies, University of Birmingham|page=7|oclc=4330848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council acted as the [[Head of State]] (in practice usually through the [[Polish Council of State#Chairmen of the Council of State|Chairmen of the Council of State]]).&lt;ref name="Cieplak-2007" /&gt; Article 30 of the constitution set out the authority of the State Council, including representing the Polish People's Republic in [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]] and the ratification of [[international treaty|international treaties]].&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; The Council also had the vote in matters related to the military.&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; It granted citizenship and could invoke pardon.&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; The council not only had legislative initiative under Article 25,&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; but could issue administrative [[decree]]s under Article 31.&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; However, those decrees had to be confirmed by the Sejm in its next session. The council also defined the [[judicial interpretation|interpretation of laws]], which in many countries is reserved to the judiciary.&lt;ref name="Cieplak-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt;

The deputies of the Council of Ministers also had legislative initiative under Article 25.&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt; The composition of the Council of Ministers was set forth at Article 39.&lt;ref name="Simons-298"&gt;{{harvnb|simons|1980|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVl4sNPzWlwC&amp;pg=PA298 298]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  Council of Ministers developed the state budget and the socio-economic plans and presented them to the Sejm for approval.  After approval the Council of Ministers oversaw the execution of the plans and the budget.&lt;ref name="Simons-298" /&gt;

==Judiciary==
The [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] was the overseer of all other courts, which were divided into regional, [[voivodeship]] and particular (administrative and military). In 1980, the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland|Supreme Administrative Court]] was introduced, and in 1982, the [[State Tribunal of Poland|State Tribunal]] (which also existed in the [[Second Polish Republic]]), [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] and the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] were introduced.

==Amendments==
During its forty-five years of service, the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic was subject to many changes, with its text amended 24 times.

The most known [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] was that of 10 February 1976. First suggested by the government in 1975, the amendment declared that Poland was a socialist country, the PZPR was the leading force in the building of socialism and Poland shared "unshakable fraternal bonds" with the [[Soviet Union]]. This amendment caused the protest resulting in the [[Letter of 59]] asking for inclusion of human rights as stated in the [[Helsinki Accords]].&lt;ref name="Pełczyński"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pełczyński, Zbigniew A. |authorlink=Zbigniew Pełczyński|chapter=Chapter 16.

The constitution was heavily amended in the years after the [[Revolutions of 1989]].  The amendments purged the document of its Communist character.  Among the more important changes: 
* In April 1989, the [[April Novelization]] (nowela kwietniowa) was passed, restoring the [[Senate of Poland]] and the office of [[President of Poland]]. The first president of Poland since 1952 would be [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], elected in 1989.
* In December 1989, the [[Contract Sejm]] changed the name of the country (from the Polish People's Republic into the Republic of Poland) and removed references to Poland being a socialist state.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 1, Section 4, paragraph 1 and Article 1, section 8, {{Cite web |title=Ustawa z dnia 29 gruduia 1989 r. o zmianie Konstytucja Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej (An Act of 29 December 1989 to amend the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic) |series=Dz.U. 1989 Nr. 75, pos 444 |language=pl |publisher=Sejm, Government of Poland |url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3 &lt;!--|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415000000*/http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3 |archivedate=15 April 2012--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 17 October 1992, much of the constitution was replaced by the [[Small Constitution of 1992]].

== Importance ==
As in most other communist countries, the constitution was based on the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] and thus failed to regulate the main source of power - the [[communist party]], which was the Polish United Workers' Party in the case of Poland. See also the statute of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]. The constitution also served as a [[propaganda]] tool proclaiming the "People's Republic of Poland", and in theory establishing human rights.&lt;ref name="PL-radio" /&gt;

{{Politics of Armenia}}
The '''Constitutional Court of Armenia''' ({{lang-hy|ՀՀ սահմանադրական դատարան}}) is the highest legal body for constitutional review in [[Armenia]]. It is a judicial body which is separate and independent from the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. It is responsible for supervising the constitutionality of laws and other legislative instruments. The law of constitutional court of Armenia is defined both in [[Constitution of Armenia|Armenian constitution]] and in law. 

It was established in 1995. The president of the Constitutional Court is [[Hrayr Tovmasyan]].

==History==
In December 1988, a Constitutional Control Committee was set up under an amendment to the Constitution of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Law of the Union relating to this Committee also provided for creating a Constitutional Control Committee in each Republic of the Union, which never actually happened. 

In 1991, the Armenian legislature considered setting up a Constitutional Court, although it never actually did so (two laws, namely the Law on the President of the Republic of 1 October 1991 and the Law on the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia of 19 November 1991, simply alluded to such a Constitutional Court). However, no law or amendment to the Constitution of the Armenian SSR was ever adopted to put this declaration of intention into effect.

The new Constitution promulgated by [[referendum]] on 5 July 1995 finally set up the Armenian Constitutional Court. The Law on the Constitutional Court was adopted by the [[Armenian National Assembly]] on 20 November 1995 and signed by the President of the Republic [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] on 6 December 1995. On 5 and 6 February 1996 the members of the Constitutional Court were appointed and the Court began operating on 6 February 1996, when its members were sworn in before the National Assembly. 

In 2005 Constitutional reforms took place in Armenia. On November 27, 2005,  the text of the RA Constitution (with the Amendments) was adopted by referendum. The amendments addressed the system of constitutional justice. Article 93 of the Constitution enshrined: “The Constitutional Court shall administer the constitutional justice in the Republic of Armenia.” According to Article 94 of the Constitution “The powers, the procedures of formation and activities of the courts shall be defined by the Constitution and laws." As a result of the Constitutional Amendments the scope of the persons applying to the Constitutional Court, as well as the scope of the objects of the constitutional control, was substantially extended, the Institute of the Individual Constitutional Complaint was established in the Republic of Armenia (Article 100 Point 6 of the RA Constitution).

==Members of constitutional court==
The Constitutional Court comprises nine members. Membership of the Constitutional Court is open to any citizen of the Republic aged 35 or over. The members (including the President) discharge their duties until the age of 65 (according to transitional provisions, namely Article 117, Paragraph 13 of the RA Constitution, the incumbent members of the Constitutional Court shall continue to remain in office until the age of 70 years). The National Assembly and the President of the Republic are jointly empowered to appoint members of the Constitutional Court. Five members of the Constitutional Court are elected by the National Assembly upon the recommendation of the Chairman of the National Assembly. The other four members are appointed by the President of the Republic, at his/her discretion. The President of the Constitutional Court is not elected by the members of the Constitutional Court. He/she is appointed from the Court membership by the National Assembly on a nomination from the Chairman of the Assembly. 
However, if the National Assembly fails to appoint the President of the Constitutional Court within 30 days after the office of the President of the Constitutional Court is vacant the President of the Republic must do so in its place. 
Persons fulfilling the following conditions are eligible for membership of the Constitutional Court: 
• citizens of the Republic aged at least 35 who holds electoral rights and does not have citizenship of any other country; 
• higher legal education qualifications or an academic degree in Constitutional Law at least 10 years of legal work experience; 
• command of the Armenian language. 
Members of the Constitutional Court may not be engaged in any entrepreneurial activity nor shall he/she hold any office in state or local self-government bodies not related to his/her duties, hold any position in commercial organizations, as well as engage in any other paid occupation, except for scientific, educational and creative work, which shall not hinder from fulfilling the duties of the Member of the Constitutional Court. 
The constitutional principle is that a member of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a majority vote of the total number of Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where such a question has been raised, the Constitutional Court must consider the case in the member’s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the member’s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court member’s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence a member of the Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.

A court member ceases to discharge his/her functions when she/he: 
1) Has reached the age of 65
2) Has died
3) Has had his/her citizenship withdrawn or has been granted a foreign citizenship
4) Has applied in writing to the body that has appointed him/her, requesting to terminate his powers and has informed the Constitutional Court of that appeal and at least in 10 days has reiterated his/her resignation. 
5) Is determined by a Court of Law to be unable to work, missing or dead
6) Has been found guilty by a Court of Law
7) Has been appointed with a violation of Constitution, which was proved by a Court of Law.

On a conclusion from the Constitutional Court, members of the Court must be dismissed if they:
1) Have been absent for three times within one year from the sessions of the Court without an excuse
2) Have been unable to fulfill his/her powers as the Constitutional Court for six months member because of some temporary disability or other lawful reason
3) Violate the rules of incompatibility related to the Constitutional Court Member that are prescribed by this Law. 
4) Express an opinion in advance on the case being reviewed by the Constitutional Law or otherwise raised suspicion in his/her impartiality or released information on the process of the closed door consultation or broke the oath of the Constitutional Court Member in any other way. 
5) Are affected by a physical disease or illness, which affected the fulfilment of the duties of a Constitutional Court Member.

==Powers of the Court== 
The Constitutional Court shall, in conformity with the procedure defined by law: 
# Determine the compliance of the laws, resolutions of the National Assembly, decrees and orders of the President of the Republic, decisions of the Prime Minister and bodies of the local self-government with the Constitution
# Prior to the ratification of international treaties determine the compliance of the commitments stipulated therein with the Constitution

==International relations==

Since the first year of its formation the RA Constitutional Court has become a member of the European Commission "For Democracy through Law" of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission). One year later, in October 1997, the International Organization "Conference of the organs of constitutional control of the countries of young democracy" has been established, the activity of which is coordinated by the RA Constitutional Court. And in 2000, when Armenia was not a member of the Council of Europe yet, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Armenia was elected as a full member of an international organization "Conference of European Constitutional Courts". Yves Guena, President of the Constitutional Council of France, estimated this unprecedented fact very specifically: "The RA Constitutional Court is already a successful institution and it has become the full member of the Conference due to its active participation and numerous interesting and real proposals".

The organization of the Annual Yerevan International Conference, in cooperation with the European Commission "For Democracy through Law" of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission), has become a new tradition. Each conference was differing from the previous one by its actual topic and the large number of participants. And so, a large number of well-known and authoritative lawyers and constitutionalists participated in 15th Yerevan International Conference. 
All presented reports, discussions and analyses of the topics of the Conference have been published in the four-language International Almanac "Constitutional Justice in the new millennium" and are placed on the RA Constitutional Court web-site, which, by the way, is recognized as one of the best in the world. 
A special compact disk has been prepared by the Constitutional Court, where the Constitutions of 150 countries and their comparative analysis are included. The International Association of Constitutional Law recognized it as an important program and placed it on the web-site of the International Association. This unique program package translated into Russian and English is a concise material for constitutionalists and constitutional courts.

The RA Constitutional Court has elaborated a complex program of comparative analysis of the international official documents, where 1500 documents adopted by the United Nations and all international European institutions are included (in Russian and English). The studying, analyzing and decision forwarding processes of the experience of the European Court and the materials of the European Convention on Human Rights have already finished.

==Venice convention==

*Established in May 1990 by 18 Council of Europe Member States
*in 2014: 60 member states, including 12 non-European members and Kosovo, with a total population of more than 1.5 billion people
*5 observer countries and 1 associate member
*EU and OSCE – the two international partners participating in the work of the Commission
*more than 500 opinions on more than 50 countries and 80 studies
*250 seminars and conferences with dozens of courts and universities
*Over 3,000 civil servants trained in human rights and administrative law
*the European Court of Human Rights has referred to Venice Commission opinions in more than 50 cases(since 2002).

On 1 November 2013, the President of the Constitutional Court of Armenia, Mr Gagik Harutyunyan, in his quality of coordinator of the Professional Commission for Constitutional Reforms (hereinafter “the Commission”), and on behalf of the President of the Republic of Armenia, requested the assistance of the Venice Commission in the process of revision of the Constitution of Armenia.
A Specialized Commission on Constitutional Reforms was formed by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Armenia as of 4 September 2013 based on the necessity for implementing the principle of the rule of law, guaranteeing the basic human rights and freedoms, for ensuring the complete balancing of powers and increasing the efficiency of public administration. Having analyzed the historic process of constitutional developments in the Republic of Armenia within the framework of systemic integrity, as well as its key peculiarities and the existing problems, the Specialized Commission on Constitutional Reforms considers it necessary to highlight the following main stages in terms of conceptual approaches.
In view of the international constitutional developments and the Armenian constitutional culture, we have still not found safeguards for ensuring stable development of constitutional legal relations. As a constant and continuous process, constitutional developments have taken place in the international practice in line with the developments of society in the following main ways:
* Adoption of new constitutions; 
* Amendments and/or additions to the existing Constitution;
* Consistent and coordinated constitutionalization of legal acts and the law-application practice;
* Adoption of organic or constitutional laws;
* Official construal of the constitutional provisions; 
* Resolution of disputes arising between the bodies of government in matters of constitutional powers.

==Legal Profession==
According to a 2008 source,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/36294?download=true|title=THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN ARMENIA|last=Urumova|first=Irina|date=September 2008|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2004 Law Republic of the Republic of Armenia requires bar admission in order for attorneys to practice law. Prior to 2004, there was no requirement for a unified nationwide bar. In 1998, following the passage of the first law on advocacy, the following bar associations were created: Union of Advocates of the Republic of Armenia (the latest incarnation of the Collegium of Advocates), International Bar Union, and the International Union of Armenian Advocates. The International Bar Union and the International Union of Armenian Advocates would merge into a single organization.

==Library of the Constitutional Court==
The library of the Constitutional Court was formed in 1996. The library is rich with juridical, scientific, and media materials, and is envisaged not only for the members and staff of the Constitutional Court but also for the students and all those who are interested in jurisprudence.

In the library the constitutions, laws on constitutional courts, and materials on judiciary and constitutional justice system of more than 60 countries exist. The library is periodically filled with new books and periodical press from Russian Federation and other countries. The remarkable literary fund of library makes the literature dedicated to the history of the Armenian Church and to the Genocide, as well as Parliament protocols of 1918–1920. The library has more than 5000 books in Armenian, Russian, English, French and other languages.

The '''Convention on the Political Rights of Women''' was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during the 409th plenary meeting, on 20 December 1952, and adopted on 31 March 1953.

The Convention's purpose is to codify a basic international standard for women's political rights.&lt;ref name=Cherif/&gt;

==Background==
In the aftermath of [[World War II]], many countries had still not granted women full political liberty.&lt;ref name=Dustan/&gt; In 1952, the year before the Convention was adopted, [[women's suffrage]] had been granted in less than 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Cherif&gt;{{citation|last=Cherif|first=Feryal M.|title=Myths About Women's Rights: How, Where, and Why Rights Advance|year=2015|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjy1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main impetus for the legislation, and much of its drafting, came from the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref name=Langley/&gt; The Commission sent a survey about women's political rights to its member states; the resulting replies became the basis for the Convention.&lt;ref name=Dustan/&gt;

The Convention was adopted on 31 March 1953.&lt;ref name=CPRW&gt;{{citation|title=Convention on the Political Rights of Women|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|year=1953|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1954/07/19540707%2000-40%20AM/Ch_XVI_1p.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Preamble===
The preamble of the Convention reiterates the principles set out in article 21 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which declares that all people have the right to participate in the government of their country, and to access public services. The ''Convention on the Political Rights of Women'' specifically protects this right for women.&lt;ref name=CPRW/&gt;

===Articles===
The first three articles of the Convention assert the rights of women to vote (Article I), to be eligible for election (II), and to hold public office (III), with each article ending with the specification: "all on equal terms with men, without any discrimination." The remaining articles cover the mechanics of the legislation itself, specifying how and when it will come into force (Articles IV–XI).&lt;ref name=CPRW/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Convention entered into force on 7 July 1954.&lt;ref name=Langley/&gt; As of August 2015, it has 123 state parties, comprising 122 [[United Nations member states]] plus the [[State of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Convention on the Political Rights of Women|work=United Nations Treaty Collection|publisher=[[United Nations]]|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVI-1&amp;chapter=16&amp;lang=en|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was the first international legislation protecting the equal status of women to exercise political rights.&lt;ref name=Langley/&gt; Moreover, it was the first international treaty to obligate its states to protect citizens' political rights.&lt;ref name=Dustan&gt;{{citation|last=Dustan|first=Leanne|chapter=Convention on the Political Rights of Women|editor-last=Ford|editor-first=Lynne E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics|location=New York|publisher=Facts On File|year=2008|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVtFJ5tvINsC&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention was one of the United Nations' several efforts in the postwar period to set standards of nondiscrimination against women; others were the [[Convention on the Nationality of Married Women]] and the [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages]], brought into force in 1958 and 1964, respectively.&lt;ref name=Dustan/&gt;

The rights outlined by the Convention were incorporated into the later, more substantial [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]].&lt;ref name=Langley&gt;{{citation|last=Langley|first=Winston|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues Since 1945|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|pages=70–1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0j1KI6Utrd0C&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later Convention, a wider-reaching and more straightforward legislation for nondiscrimination, was approved by unanimous vote in 1967.&lt;ref name=Dustan/&gt;

The '''Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel''' is a United Nations [[Multilateral treaty|treaty]] that has the goal of protecting [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeepers]] and other UN personnel.

==Adoption==
[[New Zealand]] and [[Ukraine]] proposed such a convention in 1993, and the [[International Law Commission]] drafted the convention in 1994. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution adopting the convention on 9 December 1994.

==Content==
Parties to the convention agree to criminalise the commission of murders or kidnappings of UN or association personnel as well as violent attacks against the equipment, official premises, private accommodation, or means of transport of such persons. Parties to the convention also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. "UN personnel" refers to individuals engaged or deployed by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] as members of the military, police, or civilian components of a UN operation; it also includes officials of the [[UN specialized agencies]] and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. "Associated personnel" includes other personnel—such as members of [[non-governmental organizations]]—assigned to act in an official capacity by UN personnel.

A central provision of the convention is the principle of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]''—that a party to the treaty must either (1) prosecute a person who commits an offence against UN or associated personnel or (2) send the person to another state that requests his or her [[extradition]] for prosecution of the same crime.

The convention states that the military and police components of a UN operation—including vehicles, aircraft, and vessels—shall bear [[Protective sign|distinctive UN identification]] and that all UN and associated personnel shall carry appropriate identification. The treaty also states that the UN and associated personnel shall respect and abide by the domestic laws of the host state.

==Ratifications and parties==
By the end of 1995, the convention had been signed by 43 states and it came into force on 15 January 1999 after it had been ratified by 22 states. As of June 2016, the treaty has been ratified by 93 states, which includes 92 UN member states plus the [[State of Palestine]]. The states that signed the convention but have not yet ratified it are [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sierra Leone]], and the [[United States]].

==Optional Protocol==
On 8 December 2005, the '''Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel''' was adopted by the UN General Assembly. The Optional Protocol simply expands the scope of what constitutes a "UN operation" to include "delivering humanitarian, political or development assistance in peacebuilding" and "delivering emergency humanitarian assistance". The Optional Protocol was signed by 34 states, came into force on 19 August 2010, and as of June 2016 has been ratified by 30 states.

[[File:PepiII-DecreeOfOfficialExactionForTempleOfMin MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|Fragment of the ''Decree d'', issued by Pepi II, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The '''Coptos Decrees''' are 18 complete or fragmentary [[ancient Egypt]]ian royal decrees ranging from the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th Dynasty]] (2345–2180 BC) to the late [[Eighth dynasty of Egypt|8th Dynasty]] (c. 2170 BC). The decrees are numbered with letters of the Latin alphabet, starting with "Coptos Decree a" and ending with "Coptos Decree r". The earliest of the series were issued by [[Pepi I]] and [[Pepi II Neferkare]] to favor the clergy of the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]],&lt;ref name=Gardiner&gt;[[Alan Gardiner]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lzhBbsElbKAC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Egypt of the Pharaohs: an introduction''], Oxford University Press, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;108; quote: "But perhaps the most persuasive evidence of their short-lived domination is offered by some inscriptions discovered by Raymond Weill at Coptos in 1910-11. Under the ruins of a structure of Roman date were found carefully stowed away a number of decrees carved in hieroglyphic on slabs of limestone, some dating from the reign of Pepy II, and most of them designed to protect the temple of Min and its priesthood from interference and the corvee. But among them as many as eight were apparently dispatched on the same day in the first year of a King Neferkare, the last king but one in the series of the Abydos list. The addressee was in each case the vizier Shemai and each royal command was concerned either with him or some member of his family. One of the decrees confirmed him in his vizierate in all the twenty-two nomes of Upper Egypt, while another recorded the appointment of his son Idi to the post of Governor of Upper Egypt in the seven southernmost nomes. A third decree grants precedence over all other women to Shemai's wife Nebye, who is described as a 'King's eldest daughter', and perhaps even more remarkable is a fourth making elaborate arrangements for the funerary cult of both husband and wife in all the temples of the land. There is no hint of unrest or political disturbance in any of these texts, though we may possibly read into them a desperate anxiety on the king's part to conciliate one specially powerful Upper Egyptian magnate."&lt;/ref&gt; while the others are datable to the reign of various kings of the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty]], and concern various favors granted to an important official from [[Qift|Coptos]] named [[Shemay]] and to his family members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toby Wilkinson]], ''The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt: The History of a Civilisation from 3000BC to Cleopatra'', London, Bloomsbury, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-7475-9949-4}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;121&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; The decrees reflect the waning of the power of the pharaoh in the early [[First Intermediate Period]].&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt;

The Coptos decrees should not be confused with the ''[[Coptos Decree|Coptos Decree of Nubkheperre Intef]]'', a unique document datable to the much later [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]].

Ten of the decrees were discovered during the 1910–1911 excavations of the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]] at [[Qift|Coptos]] by [[Adolphe Reinach]] and Raymond Weill, working for the Société française des fouilles archéologiques.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Weill: ''Les décrets royaux de l’ancien empire égyptien trouvés à Koptos en 1910 ; communication lue à la séance du 27 janvier 1911'', in: Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, 55e année, N. 3, 1911. pp. 268&amp;ndash;275, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_1911_num_55_3_72827 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; The decrees had been carefully stowed under the ruins of a Roman mudbrick structure.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt; The remaining decrees originate either from the same excavations or from illegal operations by local people that were sold in [[Luxor]] in 1914 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

The decrees are inscribed on [[limestone]] slabs {{convert|7|-|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, {{convert|100|-|200|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|50|-|180|cm|in|abbr=on}} high which were intended to be set in the mudbrick wall of a gateway or vestibule inside the temple of Min.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt; As time passed, the space available on the temple walls diminished and the Coptos decrees were dismounted and put away to make space for newer decrees which explains their find spot.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt;

== Political implications ==
[[File:Coptos_decrees_p-q_Met.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fragments of Coptos decrees p and q dating to the reign of Neferkauhor, end of the Eighth Dynasty.]]
===Decline of the Old Kingdom===
The decrees are symptomatic of the powers held by the [[nomarch]]s at the very end of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and beginning of the First Intermediate Period. Decrees ''g'' to ''r'' are addressed to Shemay, his son [[Idy (vizier)|Idy]] and one of Idy's brothers. Shemay, already the nomarch of Coptos, is promoted first to governor of Upper Egypt and then to vizier of Upper Egypt, while his son Idy takes his place after him.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt;

[[Alan H. Gardiner]] and [[William C. Hayes]] find decree ''r'' particularly remarkable because, while it is emitted by the pharaoh, the decree is solely concerned with the welfare and properties of the vizier Idy.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt; For Hayes this reflects the fact that at the end of the 8th Dynasty, royal power had diminished so much that it owed its survival to puissant nomarchs, upon whom it could only bestow titles and honours.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt; The nomarch of Coptos would have been particularly cherished by the [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] rulers who were threatened by the nomarchs of Middle Egypt, especially those of [[Herakleopolis]], who would soon overthrow them and found the [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|9th Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt;

===Coptos Dynasty===
The discovery of the decrees was initially considered by [[Kurt Sethe]] to support the hypothesis of the existence of a "Dynasty of Coptos", a local lineage of more or less independent rulers during the First Intermediate Period, to be identified with the issuers of the decrees subsequent to the 6th Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Sethe]], [[Georg Steindorff]] (eds.), ''Urkunden des Alten Reichs'' (= ''Urkunden des ägyptischen Altertums, Band I''). J. C. Hinrichs’sche Buchhandlung, Leipzig 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;214; 280&amp;ndash;307.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is nowadays considered implausible as was shown by Hayes and others, in particular it is highly unlikely that a king reigning from Coptos would appoint a vizier over the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Hayes]], in ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History]]'', vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-077915}}, p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Grimal]], ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford, Blackwell Books, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complete list==
The following complete list is based on [[William C. Hayes]]'s 1946 publication "Royal decrees from the temple of Min at Coptus":&lt;ref name="hayes"&gt;[[William C. Hayes]], "Royal decrees from the temple of Min at Coptus", ''JEA'' 32, 1946, pp.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Disenfranchising Act''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed in 1727, one of a series of [[Irish Penal Laws|Penal Laws]], prohibiting all [[Roman Catholic]]s from [[voting]]. Its full title is "An Act for the further regulating the Election of Members of Parliament, and preventing the irregular Proceedings of Sheriffs and other Officers in electing and returning such Members" and its citation is ''1 Geo II c.9''. It received [[royal assent]] on 6 May 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irish Catholics and the Parliamentary Franchise, 1692-1728 |author=J. G. Simms |journal=Irish Historical Studies |volume=12 |issue=45 |date=March 1960 |pages=28–37 |jstor=30005038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time elections were held only on the start of a new reign, and so the Act followed the death of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1727 and came into practical effect from 1728. The Act was [[Roman_Catholic_Relief_Act_1791#The_Irish_Act_of_1793|repealed]] in 1793, allowing the vote to all males holding a property with a rental value of at least two pounds annually.

The '''Eclipse Process Framework''' (EPF) is an [[Open-source software|open source]] project that is managed by the [[Eclipse Foundation]].  It lies under the top-level [[Eclipse Technology Project]].  It has two goals:

*To provide an extensible framework and exemplary tools for software process engineering - method and process authoring, library management, configuring and publishing a process.
*To provide exemplary and extensible process content for a range of software development and management processes supporting iterative, agile, and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental development]], and applicable to a broad set of development platforms and applications.  For instance, EPF provides the [[OpenUP]], an [[agile software development]] process optimized for small projects.

By using EPF Composer, engineers can create your own [[Software development process]] by structuring it using a predefined schema. This schema is an evolution of the SPEM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm SPEM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030033843/http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.1 [[Object Management Group|OMG]] specification referred to as the Unified Method Architecture (UMA). Major parts of UMA went into the adopted revision of SPEM, SPEM 2.0. EPF is aiming to fully support SPEM 2.0 in the near future. The UMA and SPEM schemata support the organization of large amounts of descriptions for development methods and processes. Such method content and processes do not have to be limited to software engineering, but can also cover other design and engineering disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, business transformation, and sales cycles.

IBM supplies a commercial version, [[IBM Rational Method Composer]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Limitations ==
The "Content Variability" capability severely limits users to one-to-one mappings.  Processes trying to integrate various aspects may require block-copy-paste style clones to get around this limitation.  This may be a limitation of the SPEM model and might be based on presumption that agile methods are being described as these methods tend not to have deep dependencies.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Since November 2000 the '''European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law''' (ECTIL), based in [[Vienna]], has been an association whose purpose is 
*to conduct legal and comparative research in the field of national, international and common European tort and insurance law
*to draft Principles for a futore harmonisation of European Tort and insurance law in co-operation with the European Group on Tort Law
*to co-operate with scholars and research institutions in the field of tort and insurance law and with undertakings and co-operations interested in joint research projects.

==Principles of European Tort Law==

The unification of European tort and insurance law is the most ambitious goal which the founders of the European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law, the [[European Group on Tort Law]], pursue in cooperation with ECTIL. The broadly-based comparative research resulted in the drafting of “[[Principles of European Tort Law]]”, which provide a foundation for discussing a future harmonisation of the law of tort in the European Union. Further, the "Principles" shall form a stimulus for both academics and practitioners and could serve as a guideline for national legal systems, thereby leading to gradual legal harmonisation. Finally, the present isolated tort law regulations, which are at times themselves contradictory, require a uniform concept from the European Union.

The [[European Group on Tort Law]] spent more than a decade on preparatory works for the "Principles". These studies have been published in the series "Principles of European Tort Law". The “[[Principles of European Tort Law]]” themselves have also already been released in print, accompanied by a commentary and several translations. The online version of the "Principles" in several languages can be found on the Group's website at [www.egtl.org.]

==Other research projects==

In addition to the "Principles", ECTIL has also undertaken several projects of its own. The topics range from fundamental questions, e.g. non-pecuniary or pure economic loss, to the relationship between tort law and related schemes such as liability insurance or social security, from several studies in the health-care sector to compensation for victims of terrorism.

The results are published in ECTIL's series "Tort and Insurance Law". Most projects are also discussed at international conferences at various European locations.

==Collaboration==

Due to the international nature of the research undertaken by ECTIL, close bonds have been formed with both academics and practitioners whose contributions are vital to the study of the respective legal system. While ECTIL co-operates with several other European research institutions, its closest partner is the [[Institute for European Tort Law (ETL)]], founded in 2002 as a Research Unit of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] and converted into an Academy Institute in 2008. Not only do both institutions share offices and library, but they also draw from their mutual network of researchers built up over the years. ECTIL and ETL have thereby established a think tank of more than 160 researchers in over 40 countries, including all jurisdictions of the European Union, as well as Norway, Switzerland, Israel, South Africa, Japan and the United States of America.

==Annual Conference on European Tort Law (ACET)==

The Annual Conference on European Tort Law (ACET) is held in [[Vienna]] every year and provides both practitioners and academics with the opportunity to learn of the most significant recent developments in tort law within Europe in each calendar year preceding the conference.

Experts from all over Europe present the highlights of their contributions to the European Tort Law Yearbook, which is published after each conference. The reporters provide a comprehensive overview of the previous year's court practice and legislation in the respective jurisdictions. Furthermore, an overview of the developments in the field of EU law is provided. A comparative analysis reviews the essential aspects of all reports. In addition to those national reports, the conference features special presentations on current issues of tort law.

[[File:FEWoodbridge.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick E. Woodbridge]] was a major proponent of the Expatriation Act of 1868]]

The '''Expatriation Act of 1868''' was an act of the [[40th United States Congress]] regarding the right to [[renunciation of citizenship|renounce one's citizenship]]. It states that "the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people" and "that any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government".&lt;ref name="Rice51"&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|2011|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intent was to counter other countries' claims that U.S. citizens owed them allegiance; it was an explicit rejection of the feudal [[common law]] principle of perpetual allegiance.&lt;ref name="Erler"&gt;{{harvnb|Erler|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCwvLfKT9qMC&amp;pg=PA191 191]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Expatriation Act of 1868 was codified at 25 [[Revised Statutes of the United States|Rev. Stat.]] [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=018/llsl018.db&amp;recNum=0422 § 1999], and then by 1940 had been re-enacted at {{USC|8|800}}.&lt;ref name="Yoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|7 FAM|1280|p=14|ref=7 FAM}}; the source does not specify the exact date of re-enactment&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the last note to {{USC|8|1481}}.

==Background==
The United States had, since its early days, implicitly denied the doctrine of perpetual allegiance through its naturalization laws. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Albert Gallatin]] that "I hold the right of expatriation to be inherent in every man by the laws of nature … the individual may [exercise such right] by any effectual and unequivocal act or declaration". Other countries, however, did not recognise this position; indeed, the British [[Royal Navy]]'s [[impressment]] of American sailors was one of the ''[[casus belli]]'' provoking the U.S. to join the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name="Rice50"&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|2011|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those countries' non-recognition of renunciation of their citizenship continued to cause problems for naturalized Americans during the course of the century. In the 1860s, France as well as various German and Scandinavian states attempted to conscript their natives who had become U.S. citizens when they went back to their homelands for short visits.&lt;ref name="Rice50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guild"&gt;{{harvnb|Guild|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2c6ifbjx2wMC&amp;pg=PA148 148]}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Italy, and Switzerland however at least had procedures for abjuring one's original allegiance; Greece, Russia, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] did not have such procedures at all, and even sometimes punished their natives for acquiring U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, President [[Andrew Johnson]] called on Congress in his Second Annual Message in December 1866 to assert "the principle so long maintained by the executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempts the native-born subject of any other state from the performance of military service under any foreign government".&lt;ref name="Rice51"/&gt; The problem was illustrated more acutely the following year when Britain charged naturalized Americans John Warren and Augustine Costello of the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] under the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]].&lt;ref name="Rice51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schuck|Smith|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson used this example to illustrate the urgency of the problem in his Third Annual Message in December 1867, stating that it "perplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens and impairs the national authority abroad".&lt;ref name="Rice51"/&gt;

==Debate and enactment==
In January 1868, the month after Johnson's Third Annual Message, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] issued a report on nationality issues; their report argued against the doctrine of perpetual allegiance, stating that countries which permitted emigration implicitly recognized the right to renounce one's citizenship as well. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], head of the Committee, introduced the bill that would become the Expatriation Act on that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bill's major proponents was [[Frederick E. Woodbridge]] of Vermont.&lt;ref name="Erler"/&gt; The initial version of the bill had harsh provisions for retaliation against the countries which refused to recognize the right to renounce one's citizenship; for example, if an American was arrested by his native country, the bill would have given the President the power to order the arrest of any of the subjects of that country living in the United States. An amendment added the preamble; the bill as amended was adopted in the House by a vote of 104 to 4. The bill then came before the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]; the major amendment in the Senate was to ensure that the retaliatory measures taken by the President would be limited to those "not amounting to acts of war". The Senate passed the amended bill 39-7; the amended bill was concurred in by the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Expatriation Act came into law one day before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which introduced the principle of [[birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright citizenship]] into the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Pickus"/&gt; The attitude towards emigration and loss of citizenship expressed in the Expatriation Act of 1868 was echoed by the contemporaneous [[Burlingame Treaty]] between the United States and China's [[Qing Dynasty]], which stated that both signatory parties recognized  "the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of ... free migration and emigration ... for purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents".&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;{{harvnb|Yoo|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other migrant-sending countries also moved towards the principle of recognition of renunciation of citizenship as well, for example through the [[Bancroft Treaties]].&lt;ref name="Pickus"&gt;{{harvnb|Pickus|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I0YsR8RzWl8C&amp;pg=PA66 66]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late nineteenth century, the doctrine of perpetual allegiance had died a "surprisingly speedy and unlamented death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp05/martin_lecture.htm|first=David A.|last=Martin|title=Dual Nationality: TR’s 'Self-Evident Absurdity'|journal=UVA Lawyer|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of United States citizenship under the Act==
===Early policies===
The Expatriation Act of 1868 did not explicitly create any procedure by which a U.S. citizen might exercise his or her right to give up citizenship. Existing law — namely, the [[Enrollment Act of 1865]] § 21&lt;ref&gt;[[Long title]]: the Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed to provide for the Enrolling and Calling out the National Forces, and for other Purposes, passed on March 3, 1865; the relevant section can be found at {{USStat|13|490}}&lt;/ref&gt; — provided only two grounds for loss of citizenship, those being [[draft evasion]] and [[desertion]].&lt;ref name="Pickus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAM1240"&gt;{{harvnb|7 FAM|1240|p=5|ref=7 FAM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bancroft Treaties also had provisions that naturalized U.S. citizens would be deemed to have renounced their U.S. citizenship and resumed their original citizenship if they returned to their native countries and remained there for a certain period of time. Finally, in 1873, Attorney-General [[George Henry Williams]] wrote that "the affirmation by Congress, that the right of expatriation is 'a natural and inherent right in all people' includes citizens of the United States as well as others, and the executive should give to it that comprehensive effect." However, William's statement was mostly used to justify the denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="Tsiang97"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a naturalized American who took up a position in the government or military of his native country was considered to have given up his U.S. citizenship and resumed his original one; however, naturalized Americans who did these same acts in other countries which were not their native countries were seen as having given up their right to U.S. protection, but not to U.S. citizenship itself. In particular, the State Department did not consider that mere establishment of non-U.S. domicile was sufficient grounds for revoking U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There would be no legislation regarding grounds for loss of U.S. citizenship by native-born citizens until the [[Expatriation Act of 1907]] ({{USStat|34|1228}}).&lt;ref name="Pickus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAM1240"/&gt; Before then, the State Department and the courts seemed to agree that the only act which would cause a native-born citizen to lose U.S. citizenship was voluntary acquisition of citizen or subject status in a foreign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even foreign military service was not necessarily held to result in loss of U.S. citizenship; the precedent pointed out by [[Thomas F. Bayard]], Secretary of State during the late 1880s, was that the U.S. did not consider the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French who joined the American Revolution]] to have thus acquired U.S. citizenship. Similarly, voting in a foreign election was not held as definitive evidence of intent to give up citizenship, in the absence of an express acquisition of foreign citizenship and renunciation of the U.S. one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Expatriation Act of 1907 and subsequent legislation would thenceforth broaden the number of actions which, if undertaken voluntarily, would be considered by the U.S. government to prove the intent to lose U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later case law===
In the 1950 case ''Savorgnan v. United States'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that a woman who applied for [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizenship]] by virtue of her marriage to her husband had voluntarily given up her U.S. citizenship. Associate Justice [[Harold Hitz Burton]] wrote that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/338/491|litigants=Savorgnan v. United States|reporter=338 U.S. 491|accessdate=2012-05-12|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Traditionally the United States has supported the right of expatriation as a natural and inherent right of all people. Denial, restriction, impairment or questioning of that right was declared by Congress, in 1868, to be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this Government. From the beginning, one of the most obvious and effective forms of expatriation has been that of naturalization under the laws of another nation. However, due to the common-law prohibition of expatriation without the consent of the sovereign, our courts hesitated to recognize expatriation of our citizens, even by foreign naturalization, without the express consent of our Government. Congress finally gave its consent upon the specific terms stated in the Citizenship Act of 1907 and in its successor, the Nationality Act of 1940. Those Acts are to be read in the light of the declaration of policy favoring freedom of expatriation which stands unrepealed.

And, in his footnote:

:The above language ''[i.e. the preamble of the Expatriation Act, which he quoted]'', when enacted, was intended to apply especially to immigrants into the United States. It sought to emphasize the natural and inherent right of such people to expatriate themselves from their native nationalities. It sought also to secure for them full recognition of their newly acquired American citizenship. The language is also broad enough to cover, and does cover, the corresponding natural and inherent right of American citizens to expatriate themselves.

In the 1957 case ''Briehl v. Dulles'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit]] held that the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] could lawfully deny issuance of a [[United States passport]] to an applicant who refused to execute an affidavit regarding his political affiliations. However, in a dissenting opinion, Judge [[David L. Bazelon]] argued that "[s]ince expatriation is today impossible without leaving the country, the policy expressed by Congress in 1868 and never repealed precludes a reading of the passport and travel control statutes which would permit the Secretary of State to prevent citizens from leaving". Chief Judge [[Henry White Edgerton]] concurred with Bazelon's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/248/248.F2d.561.13317_1.html|litigants=Briehl v. Dulles|reporter=248 F.2d 561, 583|date=1957|accessdate=2012-06-12|pinpoint=113|court=U.S.App.D.C.}} The ruling in ''Briehl v. Dulles'' was reversed by the Supreme Court, but the reversal made no reference to the Expatriation Act of 1868. See {{cite case|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/357/116|litigants=[[Kent v. Dulles]]|reporter=357 U.S. 116|date=1958|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress's power to legislate for implicit expatriation of Americans was later heavily restricted by the 1967 case ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', which concluded that [[natural-born]] Americans cannot be deprived of citizenship by any means except a voluntary renunciation in the presence of a consular official. Associate Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s majority opinion extensively discussed the Expatriation Act of 1868, including the history of proposed amendments to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0387_0253_ZS.html|litigants=[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]|reporter=387 U.S. 253|date=1967|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Hague''' (January 17, 1876 – January 1, 1956) was an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politician who served as the [[Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey]] from 1917 to 1947, Democratic National Committeeman from New Jersey from 1922 until 1949, and Vice-Chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]] from 1924 until 1949.

Hague has a widely known reputation for [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[bossism]] and has been called "the grandaddy of Jersey bosses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ingle|first=Bob |author2=Sandy McClure|title=The Soprano State: New Jersey's Culture of Corruption|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|year=2008|page=74|isbn=978-0-312-36894-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]].&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{citation | title = Hague's End | newspaper = [[TIME]] | date = 1949-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his "guests" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Powell | first = Michael | title = Menendez Seeks to Bury Image of a Shady Dealer | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2006-11-03 | page = A02 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/02/AR2006110201457_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/11/nation/la-na-new-jersey-politics-20140112|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 11, 2014|author=Joseph Tanfani|title=Chris Christie bridge scandal looks to many like Jersey as usual}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallanan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century [[partners desk]]s and that "[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally."

During the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as "the organization," was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv | Erie | 1988 | p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hague's personal influence extended to the national level, influencing federal patronage &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv | Erie | 1988 | p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presidential campaigns.&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;{{citation | title = Congress Hotel Deal | newspaper = [[TIME]] | date = 1932-07-11 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743952,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Francis "Frank" Hague, born in Jersey City, was  the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (née Fagen), immigrants from [[County Cavan]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Leinwand|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as [[Horseshoe, Jersey City|The Horseshoe]] due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop.&lt;ref name="time3"&gt;{{cite news | title = When the Big Boy Goes... | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861807,00.html |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| quote= As the eight professional pallbearers hefted the 700-lb., hammered copper casket out of Lawrence Quinn's Funeral Home in Jersey City, a solemn voice called out to the pressing crowd: "Hats, men." Of the hundreds on the sidewalk, only four men were seen to lift their hats as a final gesture of respect toward Frank Hague, who died last week at 81. He was the last of the great machine bosses and the most absolute of them all. On a salary that never exceeded $8,500 a year during his eight terms as mayor of Jersey City, he came to reckon his personal fortune at more than $2,000,000, his homes at four (in Jersey City, on Manhattan's Park Avenue, on Miami's Biscayne Bay and on the Jersey coast at Deal).| date = 1956-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv | Smith | 1982 | pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Van Devander | 1974 | p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked briefly as a blacksmith's apprentice for the [[Erie Railroad]]. While training at a local gym for his own potential debut as a prizefighter, he arranged to become manager for Joe Craig, a professional lightweight boxer. Craig was successful enough to allow Hague to buy a few suits that made him appear successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Hague's apparent prosperity gained him the attention of local tavern owner "Nat" Kenny who was seeking a candidate for [[constable]] in the upcoming primary to run against the candidate of a rival tavern owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny provided Hague with $75 to "spread around", and Frank Hague quickly won his first election by a ratio of three-to-one.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 35"&gt;{{Harv | Smith | 1982 | p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Early success===
Hague's victory in the Constable election brought him to the attention of Hudson County Democratic [[political boss]] "Little Bob" Davis, and Davis asked Hague to help get out Democratic votes for the upcoming 1897 Mayoral election.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 35"/&gt; Hague's efforts were credited with generating large voter turnout in the Second Ward for the 1897 and 1899 elections. As a reward for his work, Hague was appointed as a [[Deputy Sheriff]] at a salary of $25 per week.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 36"&gt;{{Harv | Smith | 1982 | p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over this time, Hague took a leadership role in the Second Ward Democratic club.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 36"/&gt;

In the 1901 Mayoral election, Republican [[Mark M. Fagan]] was elected. Hague's second ward was one of only two that voted Democratic. Hague survived a Republican challenge for a third term as Constable the following year.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 36"/&gt;

===The "Red Dugan" affair===
As a ward leader, Hague was approached by a woman to provide assistance for her son, who had been arrested for passing a forged check. The son, Red Dugan, had been a classmate of Hague's in school. According to the ''Boston Evening Transcript'' of October 4, 1904, Dugan had deposited a forged check for $955 in the Peoples Bank of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], and convinced the bank manager to let him withdraw $500. Hague ignored a subpoena to testify in Hudson County Court and traveled to Massachusetts to provide an alibi for Dugan. Hague and another deputy sheriff,  Thomas "Skidder" Madigan, claimed that they had seen Dugan in [[Jersey City]] on the day of the alleged offense. Both were threatened with perjury charges.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 38"&gt;{{Harv | Smith | 1982 | p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Jersey City, Hague was found guilty of [[contempt of court]] for ignoring the subpoena. He was fined $100 and stripped of his duties as Deputy Sheriff.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 38"/&gt;

In spite of the resulting press coverage of the event, Hague was more deeply embraced by his constituency. Thomas Smith wrote: "But to the residents of the Horseshoe, Frank Hague had gone out of his way to help a friend - had practically given his livelihood to aid a brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the succeeding municipal election of 1905, which saw the return of incumbent Fagan to the office of mayor, Hague was elected to a fourth term as constable.

===Ward leader===
Hague rose through the Democratic [[Political machine|machinery]] of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]], which drew much of its strength by providing newly arrived immigrants with the rudimentary social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Hart | 2007 | pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hague took a job as a collector for a local brewery, leaving him with time to spend in the streets and the local taverns which were hubs of political activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent his time cleaning up the loose ends of the Second Ward's south-end Democratic Club to consolidate his power.

As a reward for his efforts in turning out votes in the 1905 election, Bob Davis named Hague as the party leader for the Second Ward and arranged for Hague to be appointed as [[Sergeant at Arms]] for the New Jersey State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Annual Report, Treasurer of the State of New Jersey | publisher=State Gazette Publishing Company | location=Trenton, NJ | year=1908 | page=477 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7pJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA477&amp;lpg=PA477&amp;dq=1907+Frank+Hague+%22New+Jersey%22+legislature | author1=Treasury Dept, New Jersey | author2=Joint Committee On Treasurer's Accounts, New Jersey. Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reformer===
Hague broke ties with "Boss" Davis in 1906 over a difference of opinion on a candidate for appointment to the city Street and Water Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Hague supported [[H. Otto Wittpenn]] for mayor in the 1907 election. Wittpenn was a reformer who opposed the control Davis held over Hudson County politics. Over the objections of Davis, newly elected Mayor Wittpenn appointed Hague as chief custodian of City Hall - a "cushy" job with plenty of [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Hart | 2007 | p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Wittpenn administration, Hague also became friendly with Wittpenn's secretary - a Presbyterian Sunday school teacher named [[A. Harry Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting battle for control of the [[Hudson County]] Democratic machine would ironically result in one of the greatest boosts to Hague's rise to power - the [[Walsh Act (New Jersey)|Walsh Act of 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Hart | 2007 | pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Davis, seeing support for Hague increasing, supported Wittpenn's re-election against former mayor Fagan. Hague's second ward produced the largest plurality of Wittpenn votes of any of Jersey City's 12 wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis then arranged the appointment of Fagan to the Hudson County Tax Board. When Wittpenn's administration began facing troubles, including Fagan's discovery of a [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] property that had paid no taxes for four years, Wittpenn blamed Davis.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 41"&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to curb the influence of Davis, Wittpenn announced his candidacy for Governor, stating "I have endured the machine as long as possible, but patience is no longer a virtue."&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 41"/&gt; Davis, in turn, prevailed upon [[Woodrow Wilson]], then President of [[Princeton University]], to oppose Wittpenn's candidacy.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 41"/&gt; Wilson's victory was overwhelming even in Hague's ward, despite heavy-handed tactics used there. ''[[The Jersey Journal]]'' wrote: "Cops on duty were using clubs and blackjacks to assist Mayor Wittpenn and Frank Hague defeat the Davis men."&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 41"/&gt;

Wilson's reform-minded term as Governor saw the establishment of Presidential primary elections, introduced [[workers' compensation]], and brought about passage of the Walsh Act which provided for a non-partisan [[City commission government|commission form]] of municipal government that was greatly reflective of his academic writings in ''[[Woodrow Wilson#Congressional Government|Congressional Government]]''.

"Little Bob" Davis died of cancer shortly after the 1910 gubernatorial election leaving a vacuum in the power structure of the Hudson County Democrats.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 42"&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittpenn quickly endorsed the idea of converting Jersey City to a commission form of government, but was opposed by forces, including Hague, attempting to take control of the party. Hague campaigned heavily against the idea in the Horseshoe, claiming that such a system of citywide elected commissioners would erode the influence of the working-class and consolidate power among the city's elite.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 42"/&gt; Wittpenn's opponents successfully petitioned for a change in the date of the vote on the charter change, moving it from September to mid-July, and the proposal was defeated. As a result of this campaign, Hague came under the scrutiny of ''The Jersey Journal'', which had supported the proposed charter change. It was reported that Hague's older brother, a battalion chief on the city fire department, had been on "sick leave" for three years at full pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hague reconciled with Wittpenn to support his re-election in 1911. Wittpenn then supported Hague's nomination for Commissioner of Streets and Water. Both were elected. The new position greatly expanded Hague's patronage authority. While City Hall employed a few dozen custodians, there were hundreds of workers in the Street and Water Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hague's work as head of the Department of Street Cleaners even convinced ''The Jersey Journal'' to endorse him as a "reform candidate" in the next election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fleming|first=Thomas|title=New Jersey: A History|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York, NY|year=1984|page=174|isbn=978-0-393-30180-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1913, having gained confidence in his own ability to assure himself a place on the commission, Hague supported the renewed effort to change the Jersey City government from the [[Mayor-council government|Mayor-Council]] model to a [[city commission government|commission model]] under the recently adopted [[Walsh Act]].  This act would place all executive and legislative powers in a five-man commission, each of whom would head a city department.  The five commissioners would choose one of their colleagues to be mayor.  The vote for charter change passed, and the stage was set for Frank Hague's rise to power.

===Commissioner===
In 1913, the first election for the city commission saw 91 men on the ballot competing for five available seats on the commission. Hague finished fourth with 17,390 votes and was elected to the five-man commission. The only Wittpenn-supported candidate, [[A. Harry Moore]], was also elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Wittpenn Men Lose in Jersey City Vote | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1913-06-11 | page=1 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/06/11/100628776.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of having garnered the most votes (21,419) former mayor Fagan became the first mayor under this new form of government, and the only Republican to hold that title in Jersey City for the following 75 years.  Hague was named public safety commissioner, with control over the police and fire departments. In the same year, Hague cemented his control of the Hudson County political machine by securing for himself the leadership of the Hudson County Democratic Organization Executive Committee.
[[Image:Black Tom pier.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Aftermath of the [[Black Tom explosion]], an act of sabotage on American ammunition supplies by German agents which took place on July 30, 1916, in Jersey City]]

Hague immediately set about reshaping the corrupt Jersey City police force with tough Horsehoe recruits.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{Harv | Hart | 2007| p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hague spearheaded crackdowns on [[prostitution]] and [[narcotics trafficking]], earning him favor with religious leaders.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; These enforcement acts went as far as Hague himself marching across local [[Vaudeville]] stages personally directing the shut down of "girlie shows."&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; At the heart of this change was an inner cadre of officers known as the Zeppelin Squad or "zepps" who were personally loyal to Hague alone.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; The "zepps" would spy on, and report back to Hague about other members of the department.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 55"&gt;{{Harv | Smith | 1982 | p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city's once-astronomical crime rate.&lt;ref name="NJCU"&gt;[http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/H_Pages/Hague_Frank.htm Frank Hague] at [[New Jersey City University]]'s Jersey City history page&lt;/ref&gt;

Hague took steps to curb the police department's lackadaisical work ethic, punishing offenses that had gone unpunished for years.  He also made much-needed improvements to the fire department; at the time he took office Jersey City's fire insurance rates were among the highest in the nation.&lt;ref name="EarlyCareer"&gt;Foster, Mark.  [http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/hague/earlycareer/index.shtml The Early Career of Mayor Frank Hague].  GET NJ, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon discovering in early 1916 that millions of pounds of munitions were being stockpiled on the Jersey City waterfront, Hague travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to register concerns for the safety of his constituents.&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 55"/&gt; His meetings with Congressmen resulted in no action, Congress having decided that Jersey City was an "appropriate port."&lt;ref name="Smith 1982 55"/&gt; Hague's concerns were shown to be valid in July 1916 when the [[Black Tom explosion]] sent shrapnel flying across the city.

In 1917, Hague, with his reputation as the man who cleaned up the police force, ran for reelection.  He put together a commission ticket called "The Unbossed."&lt;ref name="NJCU"/&gt;  The ticket consisted of him, Parks Commissioner Moore, Revenue Commissioner George Brensinger, ex-judge Charles F.X. O’Brien and City Clerk Michael I. Fagan.  It swept all five spots on the commission.  Moore topped the poll, and traditional practice called for him to be appointed mayor.  However, when the commission met for the first time on May 11, Hague was chosen as the new mayor.&lt;ref name="EarlyCareer"/&gt;

===Boss of Jersey City===
[[File:The Hague Apartment building.jpg|thumb|Building at 2600  Hudson (now Kennedy) Boulevard, one of Hague's residences]]
Technically, Hague's only responsibility as mayor was to appoint the school board.  Otherwise, he was merely first among equals, with no powers over and above the other four commissioners. However, soon after taking office, he wrested control of the Hudson County Democratic Party from Wittpenn.&lt;ref name="EarlyCareer"/&gt;  This allowed him to significantly influence the makeup of the commission in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. He soon built the organization into one of the most powerful political machines in the country. Hague himself became very wealthy, owning a $125,000 summer home in [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], living in a large apartment in the best building in the city, and able to give a $50,000 altar to a local Catholic church.{{r|life1938020745}}

He also had the support of a significant faction of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] which dated to his initial election as mayor, when he cut a deal with then-[[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] [[Walter Edge]] in which Edge effectively ceded North Jersey to Hague in return for keeping South Jersey for himself.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;Grundy, J. Owen. [http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/hague/thirtyyears1.shtml Before 1949: Thirty Years War on Hagueism].  Get NJ, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as public safety commissioner (a post he held throughout his entire tenure), he controlled the two departments with the most [[patronage]] appointments in the city.  This post also placed responsibility for maintaining public order in his hands.&lt;ref name="EarlyCareer"/&gt;

Hague soon extended his influence statewide by helping to elect his "puppets" as governor.{{r|life1938020745}} In the 1919 gubernatorial election, Hague endorsed [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] [[Edward I. Edwards]] and aggressively campaigned for him.  Edwards carried Hudson County by 50,000 votes, which was enough for him to win statewide by just under 15,000 votes.  Hague proclaimed himself leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, and Edwards allowed him to recommend dozens of appointments to high state offices.  Democrats won five out of eight gubernatorial races between 1919 and 1940, more often than not due to massive landslides in Hudson County.  However, he was never able to extend his dominance to the state legislature.&lt;ref name="NJCU"/&gt;

Hague was able to stay in power despite a nearly constant effort to turn him out of office from 1921 onward.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;  He was also able to avoid prosecution despite numerous federal and state investigations in part due to the fact he took most of his kickbacks in cash.  However, from the early 1940s onward, many of the older ethnic groups started moving to the suburbs.  They were replaced by Poles, Italians, Eastern Europeans and African-Americans.  Hague never adapted his methods to the new groups.&lt;ref name="NJCU"/&gt;

Hague had little tolerance for those who dared oppose him publicly.  He relied on two ordinances of dubious constitutionality to muzzle critics.  A 1920 ordinance effectively required people making political speeches to obtain clearance from the chief of police.  A 1930 ordinance gave the public safety commissioner—Hague himself—the power to turn down permits for meetings if he felt it necessary to prevent "riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage."  The latter ordinance was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], but continued to be enforced for several years after that decision.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, David. [http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/hague/boss/theboss13.shtml The Manufacture of Consent in Jersey City Machine].  Get NJ, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The police were also allowed to stop and search anyone without [[probable cause]] or a [[search warrant|warrant]] after 9 pm.&lt;ref name="life1938020745"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=life%20magazine%20feb%207%201938&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Jersey City's Mayor Hague: Last of the Bosses, Not First of the Dictators | work=Life | date=1938-02-07 | accessdate=November 25, 2011 | page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President maker===
In 1932, Hague, a friend of Al Smith, backed Smith against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the race for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination. When Roosevelt won the nomination, Hague offered to organize the biggest political rally anyone had ever seen if Roosevelt would launch his presidential campaign in New Jersey. When Roosevelt formally began his campaign with an event at the Jersey Shore town of Sea Girt, Hague's machine made sure there were several thousand Hudson County voters looking on and cheering.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, James. Behind the Ballots: The Personal History of a Politician, Harcourt Brace, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;  Hague’s support was rewarded with funding for a [[Beacon, Jersey City|massive medical center complex]] complete with a maternity hospital named after his mother, Margaret Hague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/M_pages/Medical_Center_Complex.htm  New Jersey History]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1936 campaign Hague provided 150,000 adults and children to cheer Roosevelt during a visit.{{r|life1938020745}}

===Accusations of voter fraud===

Hague's use of voter fraud is the stuff of legend.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Steal an Election'', [[John Fund]], [[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]], Autumn 2004. [http://www.city-journal.org/printable.php?id=1701]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937, for instance, Jersey City had 160,050 registered voters, but only 147,000 people who were at least 21 years old—the legal voting age.&lt;ref name="NJCU"/&gt;

In 1932, Governor Moore appointed a lawyer named [[Thomas J. Brogan]], who had served as Hague's personal attorney in corruption hearings, to an associate Justice seat on the state's Supreme Court.  Less than a year later Brogan was named as Chief Justice.  In at least two instances of alleged voting fraud in the 1930s ''(Ferguson v. Brogan, 112 N.J.L. 471; Clee v. Moore, 119 N.J.L. 215; In re Clee, 119 N.J.L. 310)'', Brogan's court issued extraordinary rulings in favor of the Democratic machine, in one case asserting that the district superintendent of elections had no authority to open ballot boxes, and in another case ruling that the boxes could be opened, but no one had the right to look inside.&lt;ref&gt;The Boss: The Hague Machine in Action, Dayton David McKean, page 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;  Brogan also assigned himself to the Hudson County jurisdiction, thereby controlling the local grand jury process and squelching other election fraud cases.&lt;ref&gt;New York Post, January 20, 1938, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hague, like other political bosses of the time, was not above outright fraud at the polls, the keys to Hague's success were his matchless organizational skills and demand for complete loyalty from his subordinates.  His command over the Democratic voters of Hudson County, a densely populated urban area in a state that was still mostly rural, made him a man to reckon with among state Democrats and Republicans alike. He was a close friend of [[Al Smith]], the New York governor who would become the first Irish-American presidential candidate in 1928. In addition, Hague’s  support of Roosevelt for President was rewarded with a steady stream of perks that sustained Hague's organization throughout the Depression.

===Retirement from politics===
The beginning of the end for Hague came in 1943, when former governor Walter Edge was returned to office.  Edge's attorney general, Walter Van Riper, initiated several prosecutions of Hague cronies.  Hague retaliated by having his handpicked [[U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey]] bring federal indictments against Van Riper, but Van Riper was acquitted.  Edge also initiated reforms in the civil service, freeing it from Hague's control.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;

Edge's successor, fellow Republican [[Alfred Driscoll]], succeeded in further curbing Hague's power over state government.  He led the effort to implement a [[New Jersey State Constitution|new constitution]], which streamlined state government and made it less vulnerable to control by locally based bosses like Hague.  For example, county prosecutors were now directly accountable to the state attorney general.  It also set up a new [[New Jersey Supreme Court|state Supreme Court]], which was given supervision over the state's judges.  As the first Chief Justice, Driscoll appointed an old Hague foe, [[Arthur T. Vanderbilt]].  Driscoll also installed voting machines throughout the state, which made it harder for corrupt politicians to steal elections.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;

Seeing the writing on the wall, Hague abruptly announced his retirement in 1947.  However, he was able to have his nephew, [[Frank H. Eggers|Frank Hague Eggers]], chosen as his successor. It was generally understood that Hague still held the real power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | newspaper=[[TIME]] | date = 1954-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended in 1949 when [[John V. Kenny]], a former Hague ward leader alienated by the appointment of Eggers, put together his own commission ticket.  Due to the presence of a "third ticket," Kenny's ticket was able to oust the Hague/Eggers ticket from power, ending Hague's 32-year rule.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;  Kenny soon set up a machine which proved every bit as corrupt as Hague's, but far less efficient at providing services.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news |first= Robert|last= Hanley|authorlink= |title=Ex-Mayor John V.

===Friend and foe to labor===

Hague was accommodating to [[Labour union|labor unions]] during the first half of his mayoral career. For instance, Jersey City police were known for turning back strikebreakers, something unheard of during the 1920s. However, he became a savage opponent of labor organizers in the 1930s. The turnaround came about during a dispute with labor boss and former supporter Theodore "Teddy" Brandle, whose attempts to organize the work crews on the [[Pulaski Skyway]] construction project (1930–32) touched off a labor war so intense that local newspapers called it "the war of the meadows."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Hart | 2007 | p=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] in the mid-1930s represented a threat to Hague's policy of guaranteeing labor peace to the sweatshop type industries that might otherwise have fled Jersey City's high property taxes. When Socialist presidential candidate [[Norman Thomas]] came to speak on behalf of the CIO during a [[May Day]] rally in Journal Square, Hague's police swept Thomas and his wife into a car, took them to the Pavonia ferry and sent them back to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Smith | 1982 | p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hague spent much of the decade inveighing against Communists and labor unions,{{r|life1938020745}} and his attempts to suppress the CIO's activities in Jersey City led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]] [[Case citation|307 U.S. 496]] (1939), that is a cornerstone of law concerning public expression of political views on public property.

==Death==
Hague died on New Year's Day in 1956 at his 480 Park Avenue duplex apartment in [[Manhattan, New York City]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= | title=Frank Hague Is Dead Here at 79.

Hague was interred in a large mausoleum at [[Holy Name Cemetery, Jersey City|Holy Name Cemetery]] in Jersey City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NJ/HU.html#RBE0UG7DM Holy Name Cemetery], [[The Political Graveyard]]. Accessed August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hague's pride and joy was the [[Jersey City Medical Center]], which he began creating almost as soon as he became mayor. By the 1940s it had grown into a 10-building complex that provided virtually free medical care to Jersey City residents.  At the time of its completion, the Medical Center was one of the biggest medical facilities in the country and included the Medical Center Hospital, Pollak Chest Diseases Hospital, Murdoch Hall, and Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, named in honor of Hague's mother. The buildings, funded in part through federal funds obtained by Hague, are known for their Art Deco details, including marble walls, terrazzo floors, etched glass, and decorative moldings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampson|first1=Rick|title=Model of urban future: Jersey City?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-15-jersey-city_N.htm|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=USA Today|date=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the time the Medical Center was too large to operate cost-effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/M_Pages/Medical_Center_Complex.htm  Jersey City – Past and Present - Carmela Karnoutsos - 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the 14 acre complex (much of which had fallen into disuse) was sold to a private developer who began converting two towers into a luxury condominium complex called the [[Beacon, Jersey City|Beacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Renshaw|first1=Jarrett|title=Once a modern marvel, Beacon of Jersey City sold after hitting rough times|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/once_a_modern_marvel_beacon_in.html|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=The Star-Ledger|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Generally recognized as safe and effective}}
{{food safety}}
'''Generally recognized as safe''' ('''GRAS''') is an [[United States|American]] [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts, and so is exempted from the usual [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements.&lt;ref name="GRASfda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/ucm2006850.htm|title=Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of food additives being "generally recognized as safe" was first described in the [[Food Additives Amendment of 1958]], and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards.

==History==
On January 1, 1958, the FDA established the [[Food Additives Amendment of 1958]], with a list of 700 food substances that were exempt from the then new requirement that manufacturers test food additives before putting them on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diet.com/g/generally-recognized-as-safe-gras |title=GRAS history |publisher=diet.com |accessdate= 2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 1960, William W. Goodrich, assistant general counsel of the FDA, addressed the annual meeting (16 Bus. Law. 107 -1960-1961) of the FFDCA. The purpose of the meeting was the forthcoming March 6, 1961, effective date of the enforcement provisions of the "Food Additives Amendment of 1958", referred to as GRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/busl16&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=Address to the FFDCA concerning GRAS |publisher=heinonline.org |accessdate= 2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GRAS designation and listing==
A GRAS determination can be self-affirmed or the FDA can be notified of a determination of GRAS by qualified non-governmental experts:
# '''Self-affirmed.''' The manufacturer of this chemical or substance had performed all necessary research, including the formation of an expert panel to review safety concerns, and is prepared to use these findings to defend its product's GRAS status.
# '''FDA Response to GRAS notification.'''&lt;ref name="fda"/&gt; The manufacturer has performed all the aforementioned due diligence, and submitted a GRAS notification to inform the Food &amp; Drug Administration of a determination that the use of a substance is GRAS. Following evaluation the FDA provides three possible responses: 1. FDA does not question the basis for the notifier's GRAS determination,&lt;ref name="fda"/&gt; 2. the notification does not provide a sufficient basis for GRAS determination, or 3. the FDA has, at the notifier's request, ceased to evaluate the GRAS notice.

{{as of|2015|June}} (beginning in 1998), 572 ingredient or food substances have been filed with the [[FDA]].&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=GRASNotices|title=GRAS Notices, US Food and Drug Administration|publisher=FDA|date=June 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These petitions, submitted by sponsors or manufacturers, are reviewed for the safety evidence contained in the document. FDA posts status of the review as either without further questions or the petition is withdrawn by the applicant.&lt;ref name="fda"/&gt;

For substances used in food prior to January 1, 1958, a [[grandfather clause]] allows experience based on common use in food to be used in asserting they are safe under the conditions of their intended use.

The FDA can also explicitly withdraw the GRAS classification, as it did for [[trans fat]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/06/16/fda-tells-food-industry-phase-out-artificial-trans-fats/UAiibLOV27UY1iOWGQC4HJ/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of Regulations==
The [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Revised {{as of|2010|April|1|lc=y|df=US}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=50&amp;showFR=1 |title=CRF revised statutes |publisher=accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate= 2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes (CFR) title 21 170.30(b) that provides general recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodIngredientsandPackaging/ucm054658.htm |title=Summary Table of Recommended Toxicological Testing for Additives Used in Food |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-09-06}} - broken link&lt;/ref&gt; and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.

==Intended use==
The substance must be shown to be "generally recognized" as safe under the conditions of its intended use. The proponent of the exemption has the burden of proving that the use of the substance is "generally recognized" as safe.&lt;ref name="fda"/&gt; To establish such recognition, the proponent must show that there is a consensus of expert opinion regarding the safety of the use of the substance. The existence of a severe conflict among experts regarding the safety of a substance precludes a finding of general recognition.

==Failure to qualify==
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}

When a use of a substance does not qualify for the GRAS exemption, that use of the substance is subject to the premarket approval mandated by the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In such circumstances, the FDA can take enforcement action to stop distribution of the food substance and foods containing it on the grounds that such foods are or contain an unlawful food additive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr970417.html |title=Federal Register Proposed Rules - 62 FR 18937 April 17, 1997 - Substances Generally Recognized as Safe |publisher=cfsan.fda.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916234121/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr970417.html |archivedate=September 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gun legislation in Germany''' is regulated by the German Weapons Act ({{lang-de|Waffengesetz}}) which adheres to the [[European Firearms Directive]], first enacted in 1972, and superseded by the law of 2003, in force {{As of|2016|lc=y}}. This federal statute regulates the handling of knives, firearms and ammunition as well as acquisition, storage, commerce and maintenance of weapons. It also defines certain forbidden items, including [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]], [[switchblade]] knives and [[brass knuckles]], and bans their possession and distribution.

In a recent debate on guns in Germany after a school shooting that killed 15, one weapons expert said that Germany's [[Gun control|weapons laws]] were among the world's strictest, and sufficient for safety. Others argued that more control was needed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/german-group-denounces-weapons-law-as-unconstitutional/a-5822589|title=German group denounces weapons law as unconstitutional|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While gun ownership is widespread, and associations and ranges for shooting sports and the use of historical guns and weapons in festivals are not forbidden, the use of guns for private self-defence is restricted. The German Ministry of the Interior estimated in 2009 that the number of firearms in circulation, legally and illegally, could be up to 45 million.&lt;ref name="Zeitung" /&gt; Germany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms in use, which are legally owned by 1.4 million people in the country.  About 1.5 Million [[Shooting sport|sport shooters]] in several thousand [[Schützenverein]]en own and use guns for sport, about  400,000 hunters have a licensed gun, about 300,000 collect guns and about 900,000 own an inherited gun.&lt;ref name="Zeitung"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deutschland: Deutsches Waffenrecht: 45 Millionen Waffen sind im Umlauf - badische-zeitung.de|url = http://www.badische-zeitung.de/deutschland-1/45-millionen-waffen-sind-im-umlauf--12577725.html|website = www.badische-zeitung.de|date=11 March 2009|access-date = 2016-01-23|first = Badische|last = Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of firearms restrictions in Germany ==
''The [[Ewiger Landfriede|Ewige Landfriede]]'' (Perpetual Public Peace) ruling of 1495 banned the medieval right of vendetta (''Fehderecht'') in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (which encompassed what is now Germany). It passed at the [[Diet of Worms]] and was enacted by the German king and emperor Maximilian I. In the Holy Roman Empire claims were henceforth no longer to be decided in battle, but through legal process. It established a certain monopoly of the state in the use of organized armed force. The German nationalist movement asked for ''Volksbewaffnung,'' a militia system according to the Swiss role model, but failed with those requests in the [[German revolutions of 1848–49]]. However, possession of guns and weapons was not generally restricted, but regulations about carrying arms in public came into use.

The general disarming of citizens and a generic gun law was imposed by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies after World War I]]. The law was introduced by the [[Weimar Republic]]; actual enforcement was not stringent, and there was no general disarmament immediately after the war. After incidents including the 1920 [[Kapp Putsch]] and the 1922 assassination of [[Walther Rathenau]], the law was enforced more strictly. The Weimar Republic saw various ''[[Freikorps]]'' and paramilitary forces like the [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|SA]].

The requirement for ''trustworthiness'' of the owner and ''need'' for the special purpose of the user (e.g. hunting, sport or self-defence) has been included in German gun laws since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polizei-nrw.de/moenchengladbach/Waffenrecht/article/Historie_des_Waffenrechts.html Historie des Waffenrechts] (History of gun law in Germany, website of Mönchengladbach Police)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles ===
The [[Treaty of Versailles]] included firearm reducing stipulations. Article 169 targeted the state: "Within two months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, German arms, munitions, and war material, including anti-aircraft material, existing in Germany in excess of the quantities allowed, must be surrendered to the Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to be destroyed or rendered useless."&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/text/versaillestreaty/ver159.html Treaty of Versailles: Articles 159-213; Military, Naval, and Air Clauses]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 the German government passed the ''Regulations on Weapons Ownership'', which declared that "all [[firearm]]s, as well as all kinds of firearms [[ammunition]], are to be surrendered immediately."&lt;ref&gt;''Verordnung des Rates der Volksbeauftragen über Waffenbesitz, Reichsgesetzblatt 1919'', Volume I, § 1, page 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the regulations, anyone found in possession of a firearm or ammunition was subject to five years' imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 marks.

On August 7, 1920, rising fears whether or not Germany could have rebellions prompted the government to enact a second gun-regulation law called the ''Law on the Disarmament of the People.'' It put into effect the provisions of the Versailles Treaty in regard to the limit on military-type weapons.

In 1928 the ''Law on Firearms and Ammunition'' was enacted. It relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme. Under this scheme, Germans could possess firearms, but were required to have separate permits to do the following: own or sell firearms, carry firearms (including handguns), manufacture firearms, and professionally deal in firearms and ammunition. Furthermore, the law restricted ownership of firearms to "... persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a (gun) permit." 

Especially car associations lobbied for an easy gun permit for car owners&lt;ref&gt;Allgemeinen Automobil-Zeitung, Jg. 89, 1928, Nr. 49, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; which was granted by the government for drivers traveling often in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Fraunholz: ''Motorphobia.''

=== {{anchor|The 1938 German Weapons Act}}Gun regulation of the Third Reich ===
{{see also|Disarmament of the German Jews}}
[[File:Reichsgesetz 1938.jpg|thumb|Nazi law to disarm Jews]]
The 1938 ''German Weapons Act'', the precursor of the current weapons law, superseded the 1928 law. As under the 1928 law, citizens were required to have a permit to carry a firearm and a separate permit to acquire a firearm. 
But under the new law:
* Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns or ammunition. The 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, and the possession of ammunition.&lt;ref name="NRA"&gt;Harcourt, Bernard E (2004) [https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4029&amp;context=flr "On the NRA, Adolph Hitler, Gun Registration, and the Nazi Gun Laws: Exploding the Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)"] p 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18.&lt;ref name="Lie"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/2013/01/11/stop_talking_about_hitler/ |title=The Hitler gun control lie |author=Alex Seitz-Wald |work=salon.com |date=January 11, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Permits were valid for three years, rather than one year.&lt;ref name="Lie"/&gt;
* Holders of annual hunting permits, government workers, and [[NSDAP]] (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Prior to the 1938 law, only officials of the central government, the states, and employees of the German [[Reichsbahn]] Railways were exempted.&lt;ref name="NRA"/&gt;
* Manufacture of arms and ammunition continued to require a permit, with the proviso that such permits would no longer be issued to any company even partly owned by [[Jew]]s; Jews could not manufacture or deal in firearms or ammunition.&lt;ref name="NRA"/&gt;

Under both the 1928 and 1938 acts, gun manufacturers and dealers were required to maintain records about purchasers of guns, with serial numbers. These records were to be delivered to a police authority for inspection at the end of each year.

The 1938 ''Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons'', which came into force the day after [[Kristallnacht]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpfo.org/images02/NaziWeaponLaw1800x2667.gif |title=Nazi Weapon Law (GIF Image)|website=Jpfo.org |date=11 November 1938|author=[[Wilhelm Frick|Frick]], Minister of the Interior|accessdate= 3 January 2017}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpfo.org/filegen-n-z/NaziLawEnglish.htm |title=Nazi Weapons Law of November 11, 1938 |website=Jpfo.org |date=11 November 1938|author=Frick, Minister of the Interior|accessdate= 3 January 2017}} (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; effectively deprived all Jews living under the Third Reich within the occupied Sudetenland and Austria of the right to possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. Exceptions were made for Jews and Poles who were foreign nationals under §3 of the act. &lt;ref&gt;Halbrook, Stephen P. (2000) [http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/article-nazilaw.pdf "Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews."] ''Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law,'' Vol 17.

(2000) [http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/article-nazilaw.pdf "Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews."] ''Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law,'' Vol 17. No. 3. p.528.&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, some police forces used the pre-existing "trustworthiness" clause to disarm Jews on the basis that "the Jewish population 'cannot be regarded as trustworthy'".&lt;ref name="NRA"/&gt;

== Current laws ==
After 1945, even German police officers were initially not allowed to carry firearms. Private ownership of firearms was not allowed until 1956. The legal status returned essentially to that of the ''Law on Firearms and Ammunition'' of 1928. The law was thoroughly revised in 1972, when the new restrictive Federal Weapons Act (''Bundeswaffengesetz'') became effective, partly as a reaction to the terror of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;ref&gt;Police of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] [http://www1.polizei-nrw.de/moenchengladbach/Waffenrecht/article/Historie_des_Waffenrechts.html on History of German Weapons Law (german)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the Federal Weapons Act of 2002 and by amendments in 2008 and 2009. These laws were the result of a chain of [[school shooting]]s [[Erfurt massacre|in Erfurt]], [[Emsdetten#Emsdetten school shooting|Emsdetten]] and [[Winnenden school shooting|Winnenden]]. They led to a public debate, in which blame was attributed to various elements of [[youth culture]] and society, including violent [[computer game]]s, [[television program]]s, [[rock music]] and private gun ownership.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Der Spiegel]]'': [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,613618,00.html Winnenden Commentary – Do You Know What Your Children Are Doing?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weapons Act of 2002 increased the age requirements for licensed [[Hunting|hunters]] and [[Shooting sport|competition shooters]]. It also introduced the requirement of a [[psychological evaluation]] for persons under the age of 25 to fulfil the requirement of personal adequacy for large-bore firearms.

The first amendment became effective on April 1, 2008. The intention of that amendment was to ban certain kinds of weapons like [[airsoft]]-guns, [[taser]]s, imitation firearms (''Anscheinswaffen'') and knives with blades longer than 12&amp;nbsp;cm from public places. They may still be carried in sealed wrappings and for professional or ceremonial purposes. Their use on private premises and in non-public places like gun clubs is not restricted.

The second amendment became effective on July 17, 2009. It introduced routine verifications of safe firearms storage by local firearms control offices at the homes of licensees. It also tightened the conditions for continuous necessity. A constitutional complaint (''[[Verfassungsbeschwerde]]'') was launched against the law, alleging a violation of the inviolability of the home, guaranteed by Art. 13 of the [[German constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fvlw.de/2010/07/presseerklarung-der-fvlw-e-v-zur-verfassungsbeschwerde/ Presseerklärung der FvLW e.V. zur Verfassungsbeschwerde] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727171741/http://www.fvlw.de/2010/07/presseerklarung-der-fvlw-e-v-zur-verfassungsbeschwerde/ |date=July 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapons law does not apply to military use of weapons within the [[Bundeswehr]] or to the [[Law enforcement in Germany|police]]. The identity cards of German troops and police officers contain a term allowing them to carry weapons. Nonetheless – within the military – issuance of guns and especially ammunition is very strictly controlled.

In Germany the possession of any firearm with a [[muzzle energy]] exceeding 7.5&amp;nbsp;Joule (~5.5&amp;nbsp;ft·lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;; for comparison, a [[.22LR]] cartridge has a muzzle energy of 159 J) requires a valid firearms ownership license for any particular weapon. The current Federal Weapons Act adopts a two-tiered approach to firearms licensing.

The law on possession of [[suppressor]]s follows the firearms they are designed for; if a firearm does not require a license, neither does its suppressor.

The only restriction on [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines for firearms]] in Germany applies to sports shooters: it is unlawful to ''use'' a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition when sports shooting with long weapons in Germany. The ''acquisition'' and ''possession'' of any magazine of any size for any firearm is legal without a license.

=== Firearms ownership license ===
A firearms ownership license (''Waffenbesitzkarte'' or ''WBK''), or an entry to an existing WBK, is mandatory for each weapon purchased. It entitles owners to purchase firearms and handle them on their own property and any private property with the property owner's consent. On public premises, a licensed firearm must be transported unloaded and in a stable, fully enclosing, locked container. A weapons ownership license does not entitle the owner to shoot the weapon or carry it on public premises without the prescribed container. Owners must obtain mandatory insurance and a means to securely store the weapon on their premises (a weapons locker). Blanket ownership licenses are issued to arms dealers, firearms experts and – with limitations – to collectors. In 2010 there were about four million legal private gun owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/45_min/hintergrund/waffenbesitz106.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216013151/http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/45_min/hintergrund/waffenbesitz106.html|title=Grundwissen privater Waffenbesitz|language=german|website=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]]|date=10 August 2010|
archivedate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of criteria must be met before a firearms ownership license is issued:
* age 18 years (§ 4 [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/waffg_2002/BJNR397010002.html WaffG])
* trustworthiness (§ 5 WaffG)
* personal adequacy (§ 6 WaffG)
* expert knowledge (§ 7 WaffG) and
* necessity (§ 8 WaffG).

Inheritors of legal firearms can obtain a permit without having to demonstrate expert knowledge or necessity, but without them the firearm has to be blocked by an arms dealer (§ 20 WaffG). An inheritor's license does not include the right to acquire or handle ammunition.

Persons who
* are convicted felons
* have a record of mental disorder or
* are deemed unreliable (this includes people with drug or alcohol addiction histories, and known violent or aggressive persons)
are barred from obtaining a firearms ownership license.

Firearms ownership licenses are issued in three color-coded varieties, depending on the applicants' necessity. While self-defence is usually not accepted as a reasonable grounds for such a license, the following ones are:

* '''Competitive shooting:''' Members of registered gun clubs who the club attest have been practising at least once a month for at least a year can apply for a '''green license'''. These holders may purchase two handguns and three semi-automatic rifles compliant with the club rules. All firearms purchased must be pre-approved beforehand. Shooters wishing to purchase further firearms must acquire another approval from their association for each firearm, stating that the person participated in competitions regularly and is in need of the firearm. Additionally, persons who are members of a gun club that is a member of a shooting association, are issued a '''yellow License''', with which the holder is allowed to own an unlimited number of single-shot and bolt- or lever-action long guns, and single-shot handguns, without having to obtain prior approval or demonstrate individual necessity. However, no more than two firearms may be purchased in any six-month period by a competitive shooter.
* '''Hunting:''' People who have passed the German hunter's exam and purchased a hunters' license may purchase an unlimited number of long guns not banned for hunting use, which mostly only applied to fully automatic rifles.{{Clarify|date=January 2017|reason="fully automatic" is a (sub)machine-gun; is this what is meant, rather than self-loading/semi-automatic?}} Hunters do not need prior approval, but have to register the firearm within two weeks from purchase. They are also allowed two handguns, whose purchase has to be pre-approved. More handguns may be purchased if the person provides a genuine reason.
* '''Collecting and firearms' experts:''' A '''red license''' is issued to collectors and firearms experts. With this type of license, all kinds of firearms except "forbidden firearms" may be purchased without prior approval. While an expert's license is valid for all guns, collectors have to provide a "theme" of firearms they want to acquire, and are limited to those. Before you get a collectors license in Germany you have to explain to the state why you want to collect those kinds of guns and specifically tell them what kinds of guns you want to collect. Two examples would include WWII guns and guns made by Colt's Manufacturing Company.

=== Firearms banned from sporting use ===
The following firearms are banned from sporting use in Germany, and may not be purchased with a license issued for sporting use, but are allowed on hunters' and collectors' licenses:

* Handguns with a barrel length of less than 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm (3 inches)
* Semi-automatic long guns with a built-in magazine with a capacity of more than 10 rounds 
* Semi-automatic firearms that closely resemble a prohibited firearm (see below), if
** the barrel length is less than 42&amp;nbsp;cm, or
** the weapon is a bullpup design, or
** the shell casing of the ammunition the firearm is designed for is less than 40mm

=== Firearms that do not require a license ===
For persons over 18 years of age, a license is not required to own a single-shot percussion firearm developed before January 1, 1871, or to own and carry any muzzle-loader with a flintlock or earlier design. However, the purchase of [[black powder]] or similar in order to actually use the firearms requires a license.&lt;ref name="27SprengG"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sprengg_1976/__27.html |title=§27 SprengG |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibited firearms ===
Firearms that are prohibited in Germany may not be owned by anyone except with a special license from the Federal Criminal Police Office, which is only given to manufacturers, exporters, and, on rare occasions, collectors. The most important ones are:

* Firearms defined as "war weapons" by the law (tanks, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns)
* Fully automatic firearms
* Pump-action shotguns, if
** the stock has been replaced by a pistol grip or 
** the overall length is less than 95&amp;nbsp;cm, or 
** the barrel length is less than 45&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Firearms designed to look like an everyday object in order to conceal their nature
* Handguns made after January 1, 1970 that fire ammunition with a caliber of less than 6.3mm, except those for rimfire ammunition.

=== Firearms carry permit ===
Firearms carry permits (''Waffenschein'') entitle licensees to publicly carry legally owned weapons, whether concealed or not. A mandatory legal and safety class and shooting proficiency tests are required to obtain such a permit. Carry permits are usually only issued to persons with a particular need for carrying a firearm. This includes some private security personnel and persons living under a raised threat level like [[celebrity|celebrities]] and [[politician]]s. They are valid up to three years and can be extended. Carrying at public events is prohibited. Licensed hunters do not need a permit to carry loaded weapons while hunting, and unloaded weapons while directly traveling to and from such an activity.

=== Small firearms carry permit ===
A small firearms carry permit (''Kleiner Waffenschein'') was introduced in 2002. It can be obtained without having to demonstrate expert knowledge, necessity or a mandatory insurance. The only requirements are that the applicant be of legal age, trustworthy and personally adequate. It entitles the licensee to publicly carry [[gas pistol]]s (both of the [[Blank (cartridge)|blank]] and irritant kind) and [[flare gun]]s. These types of firearms are freely available to adults; only the actual carrying on public property requires the permit. Similar to the full permit, carrying at public events is prohibited.

'''Harold Pitney Brown''' (September 16, 1857, Janesville, Wisconsin &amp;ndash; 1944 Volusia, Florida){{dubious|date=May 2015}} was an American [[electrical engineer]] and inventor known for his [[activism]] in the late 1880s against the use of [[alternating current]] for [[electric lighting]] in New York City and around the country (during the "[[War of Currents]]").

Brown was mostly self-educated, working for several companies in the fledgling electrical field before striking out on his own, working on his own inventions as well as hiring himself out as a consultant.

After several deaths were caused by alternating current arc lighting lines in New York City, Brown came to prominence in June 1888, claiming in the press and then in public meetings that AC was more deadly than [[direct current]] and that the arc lighting companies were cutting corners and using AC to save money at the cost of public safety. He conducted public demonstrations (electrocuting animals with AC) then lobbied around the country trying to limit AC transmission line voltages to 300 volts, tactics which had him using the press to directly attack the country's largest AC equipment manufacturer, [[Westinghouse Electric]]. He also pushed to have the first [[electric chair]], which was being developed by the state of New York, be powered with AC current, provided by Westinghouse generators he had surreptitiously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/library/execution/electrocution.html |title=Electrocution |publisher=Crimemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519181253/http://www.crimemuseum.org/library/execution/electrocution.html |archivedate=2013-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His involvement in these events is controversial since he was working parallel with (some documents show colluded with) [[Thomas Edison]], showing a preference for Edison's [[direct current]] power system and advocating for severe restrictions on AC power systems that would put Edison's competitors at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House - 2004, page 165-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Harold P Brown was born in Janesville, Wisconsin on September 16, 1857, the son of General Theodore F. Brown and Frances Brown.  His father was in the [[American Civil War]] and received an honorary rank of brigadier general for his role in the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]].

Harold Brown graduated [[Chicago High School]] in 1876 and prepared to enroll in mining engineering courses at [[Harvard]] but was unable to since the [[great Chicago fire]] of 1871 had left his family in reduced circumstances. After high school he was employed at the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago]] working on development and manufacturing of electrical devices, including Edison's [[electric pen]] duplicating machine, from 1876 to 1879. From 1879 to 1884 he worked for [[Brush Electric Company]] in charge of designing and installing their [[Arc lamp|arc light]]ing systems. From 1884 to 1887 he operated his own electrical consulting business, Brown Electric Company, where he worked in inventing improved arc lighting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ukE_AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;ots=ouQ8DuTr3q&amp;dq=%22harold%20p%20brown%22%20brush%20born&amp;pg=PA742#v=onepage&amp;q=%22harold%20p%20brown%22%20brush%20born&amp;f=false Electric Railway Review, Volume, 1895, "Harold P Brown", page 742-743]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown moved to New York in 1887 and worked as consultant for the New York and Westchester Railroad, Edison General Electric, and consulted on the development of the electric chair with Governor [[David B. Hill]] and the State of New York. He also did consulting work for the City of Newark, Dayton Ohio Buffalo Electric Rail Line, and the Louisville Electric Rail Line. Up through 1912 he invented and manufactured a plastic rail bond electric contact alloy and went on to invent and manufactured a method of applying concrete with compressed air or steam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ukE_AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;ots=ouQ8DuTr3q&amp;dq=%22harold%20p%20brown%22%20brush%20born&amp;pg=PA742#v=onepage&amp;q=%22harold%20p%20brown%22%20brush%20born&amp;f=false Electric Railway Review, Volume, 1895, "HAROLD P BROWN" page 742-743]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-AC crusade ==
{{further|War of Currents}}
[[File:Blizzard 1888 01.jpg|thumb|right|The myriad of telephone, telegraph, and AC power lines over the streets of New York City in the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. A boy killed by a shorted AC line caused by this storm was one of the cases cited by Brown.]]
After a series of deaths in New York caused by the tangle of pole mounted high voltage (up to 6000 volt) alternating current lines Brown came to public prominence when he wrote a letter to the ''[[New York Post]]'' on June 5, 1888 describing the overhead lines as a public menace stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only excuse for the use of the fatal alternating current is that it saves the company operating it [AC] from spending a larger sum of money for the heavier copper wires which are required by the safe incandescent systems. That is, the public must submit to constant danger from sudden death, in order that a corporation may pay a little larger dividend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His crusade brought him to the attention of inventor [[Thomas Edison]] who was becoming engaged in a [[propaganda]] campaign against alternating current companies including [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] in what would come to be called the [[War of currents]]. Edison lent Brown the uses of his [[West Orange, New Jersey]] laboratory to prove his claims against alternating current.

After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley - 2004, page 469&lt;/ref&gt; where he demonstrated that up to 1000 volts of DC would not kill a dog while 300 volts of AC would kill. He went on to support legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system). The legislation was unsuccessful but another bill to move AC lines underground in New York City, put forward before Brown's campaign, passed in 1889 after a further series of highly publicized deaths that year caused by alternating current.

===Involvement in the electric chair===

At the same time that Brown was campaigning against alternating current a New York state bill replacing [[hanging]] with electrocution was signed into law (June 4, 1888) and set to go into effect on January 1, 1889. A [[Buffalo, New York]] dentist named [[Alfred P. Southwick]] had been developing a method using a device similar to a dental chair, an execution device referred to as the [[electric chair]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 24&lt;/ref&gt; The law did not specify the type of current to use, or the means, so the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details. Committee head [[Frederick Peterson]], a [[neurologist]] who had assisted in the dog electrocutions at Columbia College, enlisted Brown's services as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2007, page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Brown set up an experiment at Edison's West Orange laboratory on December 5, 1888 with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA - 2009, pages 152-155&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000-1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.

Westinghouse criticized this test as a skewed self-serving demonstration by Brown, who was again accused of being in the employ of Edison. Brown refuted the claims and even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical "duel," with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse would submit himself to the same amount of increasing AC power (first to quit loses).&lt;ref&gt;Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 82&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse declined the offer.

Neither Edison, Westinghouse, nor Westinghouse's chief AC rival, [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], wanted their equipment to be used in an execution but Brown colluded with Edison Electric and Thomson-Houston to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators to power the first electric chair.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1EOgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=harold+brown++%22edison+and+Thomson-Houston%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MCyHZu6jpl&amp;sig=HFWkiD5BYg36i6IDKUe4t1KwyIE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JwDtVMGWNcucgwS24oCQCQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harold%20brown%20%20%22edison%20and%20Thomson-Houston%22&amp;f=false Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2005, pages 190-195]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown would continually claim he had no actual association with Edison although an August 1889 ''New York Sun'' story published letters stolen from Brown's office that seemed to show Brown was receiving directions from, and being paid by, the Edison company as well as Thomson-Houston, including the story on the acquisition of the Westinghouse AC generators.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1?page=show James F.

The '''International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic''' is a series of anti–[[human trafficking]] treaties, the first of which was first negotiated in Paris in 1904. It was one of the first multilateral treaties to address issues of slavery and human trafficking.  The [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery, Servitude, Forced Labour and Similar Institutions and Practices Convention of 1926]] and the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age]] of 1933 are similar documents.

==1904 treaty==
The initial treaty was concluded in Paris on 18 May 1904 and came into force on 18 July 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/whiteslavetraffic1904.html umn.edu: Text of 'INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE "WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC"'] at the [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/ University of Minnesota Human Rights Library]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 26 states ratified the original 1904 treaty.

==1910 treaty==
Five years after the treaty came into force, it was re-negotiated in Paris and concluded on 4 May 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/whiteslavetraffic1910.html umn.edu: Text of 'INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC']&lt;/ref&gt; The 1910 treaty came into force on 5 July 1920. A total of 41 states ratified the 1910 treaty.

==1949 Protocol==
In 1949 in [[Lake Success, New York]], a Protocol was negotiated which amended and updated both the 1904 and the 1910 treaties. The Protocol was concluded on 4 May 1949 and came into force on the same date. The resulting amended treaties came into force on 21 June 1951 (1904 version) and 14 August 1951 (1910 version) and . As of 2013, 33 states have ratified the amending Protocol and the amended 1949 versions of the treaties have 54 state parties.

On April 9, 2008, Riches filed a request for a temporary [[restraining order]] in a US District Court against ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' publisher [[Take-Two]], developer [[Rockstar Games]], FCI Williamsburg, and ''Grand Theft Auto'' itself, claiming that the defendants "put me in prison." The inmate stated, "Defendants contributed to Plaintiff committing identity theft. Defendant's games show sex, drugs and violence which offends me." Riches continued, "Defendants put me in prison. I face imminent danger from violent inmates who played Grand Theft Auto who will knock me out and take my gold Jesus cross."&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351896,00.html Inmate Files Restraining Order Against 'Grand Theft Auto' Makers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424003949/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351896,00.html |date=2008-04-24 }} ''[[FoxNews.com]]''. Accessed April 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riches attempted to intervene as a plaintiff in the [[Madoff investment scandal]], claiming that he "met Bernard Madoff on [[eharmony.com]] in 2001" and taught Madoff [[identity theft]] skills.&lt;ref name="madoff"&gt;[http://www.madofftrustee.com/DownloadDocketImage.aspx?Docket=48 Motion to Authorize to intervene under Rule 7042 &amp; Rule 24(A)2, 24(B) filed by Jonathan Lee Riches.]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Madoff Trustee Site''. Accessed March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Riches filed for an injunction against the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], seeking to stop them from listing him as "the most litigious individual in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/may/23/man-sues-book-over-most-litigious-crown/|title=Man sues book over most-litigious crown|last=Clouse|first=Thomas|publisher=The Spokesman-Review|date=May 23, 2009|accessdate=25 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083941/http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/may/23/man-sues-book-over-most-litigious-crown/|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guinness spokesperson Sara Wilcox told ''The Huffington Post'' that there was no such listing, and no plan to create one.  "'Most litigious man' is not something Guinness World Records has ever monitored as a record category," she said.   The action—like the vast majority of Riches' filings—was dismissed.&lt;ref name="sandy hook"/&gt;

[[File:Sarcofago avvocato Valerius Petrnianus-optimized.jpg|thumb|Detail from the [[sarcophagus]] of Roman jurist [[Valerio Petroniano]] (315–320 AD)]]
A '''jurist''' (from [[medieval Latin]]) is someone who researches and studies [[jurisprudence]] (theory of law).&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=Jurist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person can [[Jurisprudence|work]] as an academic, legal writer or law lecturer.  In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and in many other Commonwealth countries, the word ''jurist'' sometimes refers to a [[barrister]], whereas in the United States of America and Canada it often refers to a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minn.|isbn=0314199497|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus a ''jurist'', someone who studies, analyses and comments on law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vieto Piergiovanni|title=Comparative Studies in Continental and Anglo-American Legal History|location=Germany|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|page=236 |date=2000 |isbn=978-3428097562}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands in contrast with a ''[[lawyer]]'', someone who applies law on behalf of clients and thinks about it in practical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cusack|first=Warren|title=Literature and the Law of Nations|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0198719342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fundamental difference between the work of a lawyer and that of a jurist.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Madison Bigelow, ''Centralization and the Law: Scientific Legal Education'' (1906), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal scholars and authors have explained that a person may be both a lawyer and a jurist, but a jurist is not necessarily a lawyer, nor a lawyer necessarily a jurist. Both must possess an acquaintance with the term "law". The work of the jurist is the study, analysis and arrangement of the law—work which can be done wholly in the seclusion of the library. The work of the lawyer is the satisfaction of the wishes of particular human beings for legal assistance—work which requires dealing to some extent therefore with people in the office, in the court room, or in the market-place.

The term ''jurist ''has another sense, which is wider, synonymous with [[Legal profession|''legal professional'']], i.e. anyone professionally involved with [[law]] and [[justice]].&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt; In some other European languages, a word resembling ''jurist'' (such as [[Italian language|Italian]] ''giurista'', [[German language|German]] ''Jurist'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]/[[Danish language|Danish]]/[[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jurist'', [[French language|French]] ''juriste'',  [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''jurista'', [[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|юрист}} etc.) is used in this major sense.

==Writings==
''From Apology to Utopia; The Structure of International Legal Argument'' (first published 1989) presents a critical view of international law as an argumentative practice that attempts to remove the political from [[international relations]]. It asserts that international law is vulnerable to criticisms of being either an irrelevant moralist [[utopia]] or an apology for [[Realpolitik]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

''The Gentle Civilizer of Nations: The Rise and Fall of International Law 1870-1960'' (2001) has two agendas.  The first of these is to develop an intellectual history of international law, and to offer a critique of that history. The second is to offer a sociology of the profession of international law, using biographical studies of [[Hersch Lauterpacht]], [[Carl Schmitt]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]].

A '''natural building''' involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on [[sustainability]].  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on "local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "The Case for Natural Building," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek (2002), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials.  The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[Image:timber frame detail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|&lt;center&gt;Porch of a modern timber framed home&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Materials==
The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand.  When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form ''[[cob (material)|cob]]'' or ''[[adobe]]'' (clay blocks).  Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as [[rammed earth]] or [[Earthbag construction|earth bag]]), wood ([[cordwood construction|cordwood]] or [[timber frame]]/post-and-beam), [[straw-bale construction|straw]], rice-hulls, [[bamboo]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]]. A wide variety of reused or [[recycled]] non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.

Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts.  These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, [[portland cement]]-based mixes and derived products such as [[Autoclaved aerated concrete]], paints and other coatings that off-gas [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC or "vinyl") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Techniques==
Many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials.

===Adobe===
{{Main|Adobe|Mudbrick}}

One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=127–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=adobe%20bricks%20walls&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Scott|title=The Workshop: Celebrating the Place Where Craftsmanship Begins|year=2003|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newton, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-575-5|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJJYdkQw_uYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=adobe%20floor%20oil&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Anthony, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection.  Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between.  The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cob===
{{Main|Cob (building)}}
[[File:Cob with living roof.jpg|thumb|A small cob building with a [[living roof]]]]
The term ''cob'' is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of "mud" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form.  While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in [[Devon]], England alone).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today.  Although typically associated with "low-rise" structures, in [[Yemen]] and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in "apartment" buildings of eight stories and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ianto|title=The Hand-sculpted House|year=2002|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub. Co.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-34-7|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGEmmolyeSUC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=yemen%20cob%20apartment&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cordwood===
{{Main|Cordwood construction}}
[[Image:Cordwoodhouse.jpg|150px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A section of a cordwood home.]]
'''Cordwood construction''' is a term used for a natural building method in which "cordwood" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with [[masonry]] or [[Cob (building)|cob]] mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a [[timber frame]] structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods  (e.g., [[rammed earth]], cob or [[light clay]]) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high [[thermal mass]], which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=178–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=cordwood%20thermal%20mass&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthbag===
{{Main|Earthbag construction|Super Adobe}}

Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques.  This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use.  However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (''see also'' [[Rice-hull bagwall construction]]).{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}

=== Hempcrete ===
[[Hempcrete]] or Hemplime is bio-composite material, a mixture of [[hemp hurds]] (shives) and [[Lime (material)|lime]] (possibly including [[hydraulic lime|natural hydraulic lime]],&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-0-0}}. (p. 146, 1st Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sand]], [[pozzolan]]s) used as a material for construction and [[Building insulation|insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/0604/hemphouse.htm |title=Hemp For Houses |first=Rolf B. |last=Priesnitz |work=Natural Life Magazine |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the [[brittleness]] of concrete and consequently does not need [[expansion joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"/&gt; The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Like other plant products, [[hemp]] absorbs [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the [[carbon]] and releasing the [[oxygen]].  Theoretically 165&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hempcrete wall during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlimetec.com/tradical-hemcrete/|title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack|publisher=American Lime Technology|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minoeco.com/en/constructions/hempcrete|title=Minoeco - Natural Plasters &amp; Bioclimatic Design, Hempcrete|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[compressive strength]] is around 1&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1/20 that of residential grade [[concrete]]. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's [[density]] is 15% that of traditional concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Rammed earth===
{{Main|Rammed earth}}
Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pise Pisé terminology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.

Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10&amp;nbsp;inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Stone===


Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.

Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. 

Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the [[natural landscape]], and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.

===Straw bale===
{{Main|Straw bale construction}}
[[Image:strawbaleconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Straw bale construction in Santa Cruz, CA&lt;/center&gt;]]

Although [[grasses]] and [[straw]] have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular [[Baler|bales]] seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of [[Nebraska]], where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality [[sod]]s) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.  Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as "infill", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as "[[load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style", or a combination of [[framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a "hybrid" straw bale.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used ("field-bales"), but recently higher-density "recompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.

===Timber frame===
{{Main|Timber frame}}
[[Image:timber frame.jpg|thumb|right|The completed frame of a modern timber frame home]]

The basic elements of timber frame building&amp;mdash;joined timbers, clay walls and [[Thatched roof|thatch roofs]] were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century.  Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building.  The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of [[Scandinavia]]) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing typically uses a "[[Bent (structural)|bent]]."  A bent is a structural support, like a [[truss]], consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent.  This, along with a knowledge of [[joiner]]y, are the basis of timber frame building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern [[lime render]]s, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many&amp;mdash;the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Nominative use''', also "nominative fair use", is a legal [[doctrine]] that provides an [[affirmative defense]] to [[trademark]] infringement as enunciated by the [[United States]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]],&lt;ref name=Doellinger&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v1/n1/5/Doellinger.pdf |first=Chad J. |last = Doellinger|title=Nominative Fair Use: Jardine and the Demise of a Doctrine | year= 2003|volume=1|issue=1|accessdate=2007-12-02 |format= pdf|journal=Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property|publisher=Northwestern University}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which a person may use the trademark of another as a reference to describe the other product, or to compare it to their own. Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of "trademark fair use" (sometimes called "classic fair use" or "statutory fair use").  All "trademark fair use" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the [[fair use|fair use doctrine in copyright law]].  However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.&lt;ref name='Pratt'&gt;Pratt, Jacqueline Levasseur.

The nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:

# The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).
# The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).
# The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.  This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for [[metatags]].

Furthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57018-313-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=David S. Welkowitz |title=Trademark Dilution: Federal, State, and International Law |publisher=BNA Books (Bureau of National Affairs) |location= |year= 2002|isbn=1-57018-313-9 |quote=Since nominative fair uses are nontrademark uses, no dilution can occur|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominative use does ''not'' require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as "UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of [[passing off]].

==History of the doctrine==
The nominative use doctrine was first enunciated in 1992 by the U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in ''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|971 F.2d 302]] ([[9th Cir.]] 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''New Kids on the Block'', the court had examined a "[[New Kids on the Block]] [[opinion poll|survey]]" performed by the [[defendant]], and found that there was no way to ask people their opinion of the band without using its name.  For instance, one could refer to the Minnesota Twins as "that professional baseball team from Minnesota," but it is much more acceptable to just refer to them by their trade name.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt;

ITn ''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'', [[Case citation|279 F.3d 796]] ([[9th Cir.]] 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Terri Welles]] was sued for using the trademarked term "Playmate of the Year" in a [[Meta keywords|meta keyword]] within the [[HTML]] code of her [[website]]. The court found that Welles had to use the term to completely describe herself, as she had been given that title by the trademark holder. In other words, individuals are not compelled by trademark law to use "absurd turns of phrase" simply to avoid trademark liability.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt; 

In ''New Kids'' and in ''Playboy v. Welles'', the courts examined older cases, identifying a unifying principle that they then named "nominative use".  Among the older cases cited by the Court in ''Playboy v. Welles'' was ''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'',&lt;ref&gt;''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'', 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Ninth Circuit had ruled that an independent auto repair shop that specialized in repairing Volkswagen cars and mentioned that fact in their advertising was not liable for trademark infringement so long as they did not claim or imply that they had any business relationship with the Volkswagen company. In the case of ''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'', Case No. 15-cv-5526-PJH  (N.D. Cal. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
the Northern District of California held that the nominative fair use defense is a burden-shifting defense properly decided at the summary judgment stage and would be premature to raise in a motion to dismiss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8918">'''Postsecularism''' refers to a range of theories regarding the persistence or [[Growth of religion|resurgence of religious beliefs]] or practices in the present. The "post-" may refer to after the end of secularism or after the beginning of secularism.

The term “postsecular” has been used in sociology, political theory,&lt;ref&gt;Kyrlezhev, Aleksandr. “The Postsecular Age: Religion and Culture Today.” Trans. Joera Mulders and Philip Walters.

[[Jürgen Habermas]] is widely credited for popularizing the term,&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. "Secularism's Crisis of Faith: Notes on Post-Secular Society". ''New perspectives quarterly''. vol. 25 (2008) p.&amp;nbsp;17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reder, Michael and Josef Schmidt. “Habermas and Religion.” An Awareness of What Is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-Secular Age. Jürgen Habermas, et al. Trans. Ciaran Cronin. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2010. 1-14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as failing and, at times, morally unsuccessful, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and tolerant coexistence between the spheres of faith and reason&lt;ref&gt;The title of a very recent book of [[Jean-Marc-Ferry]] is ''La Raison et la foi''&lt;/ref&gt; must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''[«El Estado debe proteger a la religión»]''. El Comercio. Date access: January 10, 2015: ''"Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad. Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Habermas insists that both religious people and secularist people should not exclude each other, but to learn from one another and coexist tolerantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] by Jurgen Habermas June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Javier Espinosa. ''[http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf The religion in the public sphere. Habermas, Toland and Spinoza]''. Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha&lt;/ref&gt; Massimo Rosati says that in a post secular society, religious and secular perspectives are on even ground, meaning that the two theoretically share equal importance. Modern societies that have considered themselves fully secular until recently have to change their value systems accordingly as to properly accommodate this co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of a Postsecular Society: A Durkheimian Approach to Memory, Pluralism and Religion in Turkey (Classical and Contemporary Social Theory)|last = Rosati|first = Massimo|publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1472423122|location = |pages = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Taylor’s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' is also frequently invoked as describing the postsecular,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James K. A. “Secular Liturgies and the Prospects for a ‘Post-Secular’ Sociology of Religion.” The Post-Secular in Question: Religion in Contemporary Society. Ed. Philip S. Gorski, et al. New York, NY: New York UP 2012. 159-184. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though there is sometimes disagreement over what each author meant with the term. Particularly contested is the question of whether “postsecular” refers to a new sociological phenomenon or to a new awareness of an existing phenomenon—that is, whether society was secular and now is becoming post-secular or whether society was never and is not now becoming secular even though many people had thought it was or thought it was going to be.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Rhonda Hustedt, and Douglas G. Jacobsen. “Postsecular America: A New Context for Higher Education.” The American University in a Postsecular Age. Ed. Rhonda Hustedt Jacobsen and Douglas G. Jacobsen. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. 3-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Jeffrey K. “Toward Desacralizing Secularization Theory.” Social Forces 65.3 (1987): 587-611. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the term is so conflicted as to be of little use.&lt;ref&gt;Beckford, James A. “Public Religions and the Postsecular: Critical Reflections.” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 51.1 (2012): 1-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that the flexibility of the term is one of its strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Allen. “The Precarious Integrity of the Postsecular.” Boundary 2: An International Journal of Literature and Culture 37.3 (2010): 91-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literary studies, the term has been used to indicate a sort of postmodern religious or spiritual sensibility in certain contemporary texts.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, John A..  Partial Faiths: Postsecular Fiction in the Age of Pynchon and Morrison. Athens, GA: U of Georgia P, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">The '''Protecting Internet Freedom Act''' was introduced in June 2016 by United States [[Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] in order to "prohibit the National Telecommunications and Information Administration from allowing the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions contract to lapse unless specifically authorized to do so by an Act of Congress."

==Background==
United States government oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ([[NTIA]]) was scheduled to end in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/technology/us-to-give-up-role-in-internet-domain-names.html|title=U.S. to Cede Its Oversight of Addresses on Internet|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|date=14 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prior agreement had ensured that the United States government must be consulted on any "modifications, additions, or deletions" to the [[DNS root zone|root zone file]] which is maintained under subcontract by ICANN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/amend11_052206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2016, NTIA announced that ICANN's plan for replacing its oversight with a "multi-stakeholder model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization|title=NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization - National Telecommunications and Information Administration|website=www.ntia.doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California non-profit has a board of 20 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/board-of-directors|title=Board of Directors - ICANN|website=www.icann.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisory committee made up of representatives of 171 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yVvuUIGcbTN5xfCfLbtpK36B-2Uc12m6EcaVQHOilk/edit?usp=sharing&amp;usp=embed_facebook|title=091316 Members list GAC Sept 2016|website=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a recommendation to the board, all countries must agree unanimously. The board can then reject their recommendations.

The goal of the Protecting Internet Freedom Act is to disallow the transition to the multi-stakeholder model in favor of continued US government oversight. However, the NTIA argued that the opposite is true, and preventing privatization would in fact lead to "the United Nations...or another intergovernmental organization to take over stewardship of the DNS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/other-publication/2016/q-and-iana-stewardship-transition-0|title=Q and A on IANA Stewardship Transition - National Telecommunications and Information Administration|website=www.ntia.doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Restructuring}}

'''Reconstruction''' in [[law]] refers typically to the transfer of a company's (or several companies') business to a new company. The old company will get put into liquidation, and shareholders will agree to take shares of equivalent value in the new company.

In [[UK company law]], the governing provisions are in the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], ss. 110–111. The sanction of a court is not required (unlike under a so-called "[[scheme of arrangement]]", which could or creditors). Yet if a shareholder objects, he or she may require a cash payment instead of shares. Creditors who object to have their debts transferred to a new company can demand satisfactions during the old company's liquidation.

Small private companies, family companies and investment trusts often use the procedure. The purposes can vary, from changing the objects of the business, varying share class rights, or reorganize before a [[demerger]] takes place.

{{good article}}
[[File:Joao Candido.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|The leader of the Revolt of the Lash, [[João Cândido Felisberto]] (front row, directly to the left of the man in the dark suit), with reporters, officers and sailors on board ''Minas Geraes'' on 26 November 1910.]]
The '''Revolt of the Lash'''{{efn-ua|The revolt's English translation has also been rendered as "Revolt of the Whip" and "Revolt against the Lash."|group=upper-alpha}} ({{lang-pt|Revolta da Chibata|link=no}}) was a naval [[mutiny]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in late November 1910. It was the direct result of the use of [[whip]]s ("lashes") by white naval officers when [[corporal punishment|punishing]] [[Afro-Brazilian]] and [[mulatto]] enlisted sailors.

In 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery. The move was opposed by Brazilian elites, and they led a successful ''coup d'état'' in 1889. The resulting instability contributed to several revolts and rebellions, but at the beginning of the new century rising demand for coffee and rubber enabled Brazilian politicians to begin plotting the country's transformation into an international power. A key part of this would come from modernizing the [[Brazilian Navy]], which had been neglected since the revolution, by [[South American dreadnought race|purchasing battleships of the new "dreadnought" type]].  While enormously expensive, these two dreadnoughts garnered [[South American dreadnought race#Catalyst: Brazil's opening salvo|much international attention]] before their delivery in 1910.

Social conditions in the Brazilian Navy, however, were not keeping pace with the new technology. Elite white officers were in charge of mostly black and mulatto crews, many of whom&lt;!--only if the crews signed the contracts, not the individuals--&gt; had been forced into the navy on long-term contracts. These officers frequently utilized corporal punishment on their crewmen for even minor offenses, something that had been banned in most other countries and in the rest of Brazil. In response, sailors used the new warships for a carefully planned and executed mutiny on 22 November 1910. They took control of both new dreadnoughts, one of the cruisers and an older warship—a total that gave the mutineers the kind of firepower that dwarfed the rest of the Brazilian Navy. Led by [[João Cândido Felisberto]], the mutineers sent a letter to the government that demanded an end to what they called the "slavery" being practiced by the navy.

While the executive branch of the Brazilian government plotted to retake or sink the rebelling warships, they were hampered by personnel distrust and equipment problems; historians have since cast doubt on their chances of successfully accomplishing either. At the same time, Congress—led by [[Rui Barbosa]], a senator—pursued a route of amnesty, appointing a former navy captain as their liaison to the rebels. This latter route was successful, and a bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment passed the lower house by a veto-proof margin. However, many of the sailors were quickly discharged from the navy, and after an unrelated second rebellion took place a few weeks later, many of the original mutineers were rounded up and thrown into jail or sent to work camps on the rubber plantations to the north.

== Background ==
{{See also|Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|South American dreadnought race}}
In the years preceding the revolt, the Brazilian populace saw frequent changes in the country's political, economic, and social climate. For example, in May 1888, slavery in Brazil was abolished with the enactment into law of the ''[[Lei Áurea]]'', a law vehemently opposed by the Brazilian upper class and plantation owners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This discontent among the upper parts of society directly led to a [[nonviolent revolution#Peaceful revolution|peaceful ''coup d'état'']] spearheaded by the army and led by [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] and Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]. Pedro II and his family were quickly and quietly sent into exile in Europe; they were replaced with a [[First Brazilian Republic|titular republic]] with Fonseca as president.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Rulers, Guns, and Money, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro II of Brazil - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Pedro II, the emperor of Brazil, was deposed in 1889, setting off a decade of unrest in the country]]

The next decade was marked by several rebellions against the new political order, including [[Revolta da Armada|naval revolts]] (1891, 1893–94), the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Rebellion]] (1893–95), the [[War of Canudos]] (1896–97), and the [[Vaccine Revolt]] (1904), during which the quality of the Brazilian Navy severely declined relative to its neighbors thanks to an [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 148; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 56, 67; Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240.&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the twentieth century, an antiquated Brazilian naval fleet with just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel (in 1896) and only two modern armored warships could be faced by Argentine and Chilean navies filled with ships ordered in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 16; Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216; Scheina, "Brazil," 403.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In 1893, Rear Admiral [[Custódio José de Mello]], the minister of the navy, revolted against President [[Floriano Peixoto]], bringing nearly all of the Brazilian warships currently in the country with him. Mello's forces took [[Florianópolis|Desterro]] when the governor surrendered, and began to coordinate with secessionists in the southern province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], but loyal Brazilian forces overwhelmed them both. Most of the rebel naval forces were sailed to Argentina, where their crews surrendered; the flagship, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidabã||2}}, held out near Desterro until it was sunk by a torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 67–76, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also at the dawn of the new century, however, [[Economic history of Brazil#Coffee economy, 1840-1930|rising demand for coffee]] and [[Amazon rubber boom|rubber]] gave the Brazilian government an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, "Coffee 'Valorization'," 528–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably [[Pinheiro Machado (politician)|Pinheiro Machado]] and the [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|Baron of Rio Branco]], moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 14; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Congress of Brazil]] drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''Dreadnought'']]—which heralded a [[dreadnought|new and powerful type of warship]]—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts. These ships would be named {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|São Paulo||2}}, and would be accompanied by two smaller [[cruiser]]s, {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, and ten [[destroyer]]s of the [[Pará-class destroyer (1908)|''Pará'' class]].&lt;ref&gt;Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 80, Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Scheina, "Brazil," 403; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240–46.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|A third dreadnought was to follow them, but it was [[Brazilian battleship Rio de Janeiro|canceled and reordered several times]].&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240–46.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Conditions in the navy ===
This technological modernization in the Brazilian Navy was not matched by social change, and tensions between the Brazilian Navy's officer core versus the regular crewmembers kindled much unrest. A quote from the Baron of Rio Branco, the esteemed politician and professional diplomat, shows one of the sources of tension: "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless [[lumpenproletariat|lumpen]], without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos."&lt;ref&gt;[[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]], in Edmar Morel, ''A Revolta da Chibata'' 4th ed. (Rio de Janeiro: Edições Graal, 1986), 13, in Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|'Dregs' in this context is a translation of the Portuguese ''fezes'', which literally means [[feces]].&lt;ref name=Love22&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Racial differences in the Brazilian Navy would have been immediately apparent to an observer at the time: the officers in charge of the ship were nearly all white, while the crews were heavily black or, to a lesser extent, [[mulatto]].&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20; Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The visual differences belied deeper distinctions: darker-skinned crewmen, who by the time of the revolt would have been older slaves freed under the ''Lei Áurea'' (or sons born free under the 1871 [[Law of the Free Womb]]), were almost universally less educated than their white overseers.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20–21; Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The navy, along with other military branches, served as dumping grounds for thousands of young, poverty-stricken, sometimes orphaned black individuals who were stuck in the 'dregs' of Brazil's cities. Many had committed or were suspected of committing crimes—though those not in legal trouble were far from safe, as some recruits were [[Shanghaiing|seized off the streets]] or simply on the losing end of settling a personal score. Such measures served as a "perfect marriage of punishment and reform": people who had or were likely to commit crimes would be removed from society and trained in skills that would benefit the country.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, "Amnestied in Brazil," 117.&lt;/ref&gt; These men were commonly sent to the navy, apprenticed around the age of 14, and bound to the navy for fifteen years.&lt;ref name=Love22/&gt; [[João Cândido Felisberto]], a leader in the later Revolt of the Lash, was apprenticed at age 13 and joined the navy at 16.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, "Amnestied in Brazil," 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals forced into the navy served for twelve years. Volunteers, who perhaps unsurprisingly made up a very low percentage of recruits, signed on for nine years.&lt;ref name=Love22/&gt;{{efn-ua|In 1910, the navy reported receiving only 49 volunteers. In the same year, the navy received 924 new sailors from the apprentice schools.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, "Amnestied in Brazil," 118.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another point of contention came from the navy's heavy use of [[corporal punishment]] for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned in the general population since the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Imperial Constitution (1824)|Imperial Constitution of 1824]] and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law less than a year later amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a ''Companhia Correcional'' (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the ''Companhia Correcional'' but not have any change in their daily routines.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Brazilian Navy's officer corps believed that corporal punishment was an essential tool in maintaining discipline on their ships. An anonymous Brazilian admiral, representative of his time, wrote in 1961 that "...&amp;nbsp;our seamen of that time, lacking the moral and intellectual requirements for appreciating the debasing aspects of the punishment [whipping], accepted it naturally, as an opportunity to show their physical and moral superiority.&amp;nbsp;... All this is&amp;nbsp;... understandable in the face of the backward mentality and ignorance of the personnel that composed the ship's crews."&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 79, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebellion ==
=== Preparations and prelude ===
Crewmen aboard ''Minas Geraes'' began planning for a revolt years before 1910, according to [[João Cândido Felisberto]], an experienced sailor who would later become the leader of the Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of [[beriberi]]. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [in Brazil]. We did this so that when we arrive, we would be prepared to act"—they were just "waiting for a date and for power," referring to the brand-new warships.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 191–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of these crewmen in the UK was such that historian Zachary Morgan believes that it was a pivotal formative period in shaping the later mutiny. The sailors were paid on time, in cash, and received extra money because they had to buy their own meals; because of the vital role these sailors played in Newcastle's local economy, they faced comparatively little racism; and the [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong shipyard]] workers [[trade union|unionized]] and even successfully went on [[strike action|strike]] during this time, delaying the completion of the new Brazilian warships.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 180–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they were able to observe their British [[Royal Navy]] counterparts—an experience that Morgan says would have been "jarring" because these sailors "were no longer [[impressment|impressed]], no longer lashed, [and] were accepted as citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt started shortly after the brutal 250 lashes given to [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]], a regular Afro-Brazilian enlisted sailor, for deliberately injuring a fellow seaman with a shaving razor. There is some scholarly disagreement on if this number is correct and exactly when this sentence was carried out, but all agree that it was the immediate catalyst.{{efn-ua|Morgan covers the debate over the number in a lengthy footnote. This figure comes from Morel's ''A Revolta da Chibata'', the foundational Portuguese-language study on the Revolt of the Lash, but João Roberto Martins Filho's ''A Revolta dos Marinheiros, 1910'' argues that such a figure would have killed him. Others have suggested that it was a clerical error of one decimal place. In the absence of stronger evidence, Morgan accepts the number.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 284–85.&lt;/ref&gt; On the exact date of the lashing, Morgan says that it happened on the morning of 16 November, and the mutiny was delayed to avoid unintended political connotations stemming from the presidential inauguration on 15 November—theirs was to be an attack against their treatment by the navy, not on the Brazilian political system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Joseph Love, however, states that Menezes was whipped on the night of 21 November, with the revolt starting around 10 p.m. on the 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 28–29; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}} A later Brazilian government observer, former navy captain [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], told the president of Brazil that Menezes' back looked like "a [[mullet (fish)|mullet]] sliced open for salting."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutiny ===
{{quotebox|align=right|width=33%|{{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|São Paulo||2}}, and {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} represented the newest and largest ships in the Brazilian Navy. The first three had been completed and commissioned only months before; the two dreadnoughts were possibly the most powerful commissioned warships of their type in the world, while ''Bahia'' held a record for being the fastest [[scout cruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Brazil," 404.&lt;/ref&gt; {{ship|Brazilian coastal defense ship|Deodoro||2}} was just over a decade old, but it had recently been [[wikt:refit|refitted]].&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20, 28–31, 35–36; Morgan, ''Legacy'', 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A significant percentage of the naval crewmen stationed in Rio de Janeiro, perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 out of 4,000, revolted at around 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 November.{{efn-ua|The most-cited number is 2,379 out of 5,009 total naval crewmen, but Morgan notes that these figures have significant limitations, such as the rates of desertion, the navy-wide manpower shortage, and the men actually involved versus hiding onshore to preserve their lives. He estimates that in actuality, the number of participating mutineers was between 1,500 and 2,000 and the total number of crewmen present that night at around 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}} They began aboard ''Minas Geraes'', where the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were killed, and the gunfire on board the dreadnought alerted the other ships in the harbor that the revolt had begun. By midnight, the rebels had ''São Paulo'', the new cruiser ''Bahia'', and the coast-defense ship {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}} all under control, with the "Admiral" João Cândido Felisberto in overall command.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crews aboard the smaller [[minelayer]] {{ship|Brazilian minelayer|República||2}}, the [[training ship]] {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Benjamin Constant||2}}, and the [[torpedo boat]]s {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Tamoio||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Timbira||2}} all revolted as well, but they made up only two percent of the overall mutineers. The majority of ''República''{{'}}s crew left to bolster ''São Paulo'' and ''Deodoro''; those aboard the other ships either joined with the rebels or fled ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20, 28–31, 35–36; Morgan, ''Legacy'', 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

While officers were typically allowed to leave their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on ''Minas Geraes'', whose officers were surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, {{Interlanguage link multi|João Batista das Neves|pt}}, was killed in the fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser ''Bahia'', the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on ''São Paulo'' killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 197–200; Love, ''Revolt'', 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the evening, key warships that remained in government hands included ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, the aging cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Barroso|1896|2}}, and the new destroyers of the [[Pará class destroyer (1908)|''Pará'' class]]. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's [[torpedo]]es, which could not be fired without [[Percussion cap|firing cap]]s, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 30–31, 35–36; Morgan, ''Legacy'', 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before midnight on 22 November, the rebels sent a telegraph to the president, reading "We do not want the return of the ''chibata'' [lash]. This we ask the President of the republic and the Minister of the Navy. We want an immediate response. If we do not receive such a response, we will destroy the city and the ships that are not revolting." Fonseca, however, refused to allow any direct contact between himself and the mutineers. Instead, the rebel force moved to Ilha do Viana at 1&amp;nbsp;am on 23 November to coal and take on supplies to guard against the possibility of an extended siege. After the sun rose, the bodies of the dead sailors from ''Minas Geraes'' were sent on a launch to [[Ilha das Cobras]], along with a letter from João Cândido Felisberto—who was in command of the rebel armada—and his fellow sailors to the Brazilian president [[Hermes da Fonseca]], the nephew of the first president who had been in office for only one week.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 201, 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; It included a demand for the end of the 'slavery' being practiced by the navy—most notably the continued use of the lash despite its ban in every other Western nation:

[[File:Sailors taking coal aboard Minas Geraes.jpg|thumb|right|Sailors help refill ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} coal bunkers]]
{{quote|We, as sailors, Brazilian citizens, and supporters of the republic, can no longer accept the slavery as practiced in the Brazilian Navy, we do not receive—and have never received—the protection guaranteed us by this Nation, we are tearing away the black veil which covers the eyes of this patriotic but misled population. With all the ships under our control, with the officers prisoners, those same officers who made the Brazilian Navy weak by continuing, twenty years after the founding of the Republic, to withhold the treatment we have earned, that of citizens working in defense of our country. We are sending this message in order that his honor the president can grant Brazilian sailors the sacred rights guaranteed us by the laws of the Republic, end the disorder, and grant us some favors to better our Brazilian Navy: such as, to remove incompetent and indignant officers from serving the Brazilian nation. Reform the immoral and shameful code under which we serve, end the use of the whip, the ''bôlo'' [the beating of the hand with a ferule] and other similar punishments, raise our pay according to the plan of Dep. José Carlos de Carvalho, educate those seamen who lack the competence to wear our proud uniform, and put a limit on our daily service and see that it is respected. Your Excellency has the pleasure of 12 hours in order to send us a satisfactory response, or else you will see the nation annihilated.

Sent from the Battleship ''São Paulo'' on November 22, 1910

Note: The comings and goings of the messengers shall not be interrupted.

''Marinheiros''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the Portuguese by Morgan, ''Legacy'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the same morning, the rebel ships fired on several army forts located around [[Guanabara Bay]], along with the naval arsenal and bases on Ilha das Cobras and [[Villegagnon Island]], [[Niterói]], and the presidential palace. One shell hit a home on [[Castelo, Rio de Janeiro|Castello Hill]], killing two children; while there may have been other casualties, the deaths of these children clearly weighed on the rebels' consciences. Felisberto still remembered them decades later, where in an interview he stated that he and his crewmen collected money from their "miserable pay" to pay to bury the children.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 205–07; Love, ''Revolt'', 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, however, it appears that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary observers were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 206–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore, civilians woke on the morning of 23 November to find that the most powerful ships in their navy, crewed by the lowest of the underclass, were firing on the city. Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonseca and the navy's high command were faced with two extremely unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a [[South American dreadnought race|crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power.]] Worse, there was a significant chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began negotiating with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option would be unlikely to succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 213–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Main deck of Minas Geraes.jpg|thumb|right|The main deck onboard ''Minas Geraes'']]
Pressed by his navy minister, Forseca did not yet give up on the military option. On the same afternoon, the rebels received an illicit telegram warning from the government-held [[destroyer]] {{ship|Brazilian destroyer|Paraíba||2}} that they were planning to attack. In response, the rebels moved outside of the bay for the evening in an attempt to make any torpedo-led assault more difficult. They returned on 24 November at 10&amp;nbsp;am, a day where ''Correio da Manhã'' was the first press source to refer to Felisberto as the "admiral" of the rebel fleet. They later noted:

{{quote|[It had] become evident that, in express opposition to the determination of Brazil's highest law, the general use and abuse of corporeal punishment continues aboard our ships. That, as in the time of the slave quarters and the plantation overseer, the ''chibata'' cuts the skin of our sailors, consonant with the whims of more or less vitriolic officers. It is also verified, by the laments of the revolting men, that the meals offered in the sailors mess halls are pernicious, prepared with adulterated and rotten produce, not suitable for dogs. These facts constitute abundant motivation for the government to energetically and firmly proceed in establishing a respect for the equity and justice that is now demanded.&lt;ref&gt;''Correio da Manhã'', 26 November 1910, excerpted and translated in Morgan, ''Legacy'', 215–16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Congress, the influential senator and losing presidential candidate [[Rui Barbosa]] championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric against them in arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly not be able to force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, so much so that the body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 217–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval leaders disagreed and continued planning for a military confrontation. Zachary Morgan writes that "naval leaders believed that only a military confrontation with the rebels would restore their lost honor," and that any such action would have to take place before an amnesty was approved. That left very little time. The aforementioned armament and personnel problems handicapped the government ships; an attempt to procure the necessary torpedoes were foiled by ''Deodoro''{{'}}s guns. When night fell on 23 November, radio messages about available torpedoes to the government destroyers, huddled for protection, did not reach the ships. They were only able to obtain these weapons on 24 November, and during that night, Fonseca ordered them to attack the rebel ships. However, they were not given the chance to attack, as the rebel armada did not return to Guanabara Bay until the amnesty was passed by Congress. It is not known if the rebels were warned or were simply taking defensive precautions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 219–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amnesty was passed by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 125–23. Under the threat of having a veto overridden, Fonseca signed the amnesty. The rebels returned on 26 November after a short period of consternation—additional demands, such as an increase in salary, had yet to be proposed in Congress, much less passed—with their ships in formation, ''Minas Geraes'' leading ''São Paulo'', with ''Bahia'' and ''Deodoro'' to each side. By 7&amp;nbsp;pm, the mutineers officially accepted the amnesty provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 224–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{see also|South American dreadnought race#Decline: instability and public unrest}}
[[File:Rui barbosa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bust of Rui Barbosa in [[the Hague]]]]
In the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' [[breechblock]]s. The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, ''[[Jornal do Commercio]]'', to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|On the status of ''Jornal do Commercio'' within Brazil, see Love, ''Revolt'', 3.}} The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D. Haggard, was ecstatic at Rio Branco's about-face, saying "This is indeed a wonderful surrender on the part of the man who was answerable for the purchase and who looked upon them as the most cherished offspring of his policy."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Office, British National Archives, 371/1051, Haggard to [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]], 3 February 1911, in Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Rui Barbosa was emphatic in his opposition to the ships in a speech given shortly before the vote on the amnesty bill:

{{quote|Let me, in conclusion, point out two profound lessons of the bitter situation in which we find ourselves. The first is that a military government is not one whit more able to save the country from the vicissitudes of war nor any braver or resourceful in meeting them than a civil government. The second is that the policy of great armaments has no place on the American continent. At least on our part and the part of the nations which surround us, the policy which we ought to follow with joy and hope is that of drawing closer international ties through the development of commercial relations, the peace and friendship of all the peoples who inhabit the countries of America.

The experience of Brazil in this respect is decisive. All of the forces employed for twenty years in the perfecting of the means of our national defense have served, after all, to turn upon our own breasts these successive attempts at revolt. International war has not yet come to the doors of our republic. Civil war has come many times, armed by these very weapons which we have so vainly prepared for our defense against a foreign enemy. Let us do away with these ridiculous and perilous great armaments, securing international peace by means rather of just and equitable relations with our neighbors. On the American continent, at least, it is not necessary to maintain a 'peace armada'; that hideous cancer which is devouring continuously the vitals of the nations of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Rui Barbosa, 24 November 1910, in Lambuth, "Naval Comedy," 1433.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the end, the president and cabinet decided against selling the ships because of a fear of a consequent negative effect in domestic politics—even though they agreed that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers.&lt;ref name="Grant159"&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government—what he called the "brutal militaristic regime."&lt;ref&gt;Lambuth, "Naval Comedy," 1433.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down a third ''Minas Geraes''-class dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought. The United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, although this [[South American dreadnought race#Riachuelo|proved to be short-lived]].&lt;ref name="Livermore45"&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imprisonment ===
[[File:JCandido.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Monument to Felisberto in Brazil, overlooking Ilha das Cobras]]
Meanwhile, the decision to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes. As historian Zachary Morgan put it, "for the elite, the intention of the naval renovation itself was to fix their institution, propelling Brazil to the front of a South American arms race, and to make their navy competitive with that of any Western nation. Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite. The ships were saved, but at what cost?"&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 229.&lt;/ref&gt; These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November). In the next days, the ships were disarmed to prevent a recurrence of events, and the rebels were discharged from the navy as threats to the service's discipline—nearly 1,300 of them, a drop so drastic that the Brazilian Navy was forced to pay for Portuguese merchant crewmen to fill the gaps. The government later claimed that over 1,000 of the dismissed sailors were given tickets to their home states to get them out of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 235–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These rapid changes raised tensions between officers and their charges, and over thirty sailors were arrested in early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion. On 9 December, crewmen onboard ''Rio Grande do Sul'', the only one of Brazil's major new warships to not take part in the Revolt of the Lash, mutinied but did not gain enough traction to take the ship. Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on [[Ilha das Cobras]] revolted.&lt;ref name="Morgan239"&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 239.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Morgan notes that while planned independently, the Ilha das Cobras garrison had gotten word of the revolt on ''Rio Grande do Sul'' before starting their own.&lt;ref name="Morgan239"/&gt;}} The government acted quickly and put down both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro was in a state of siege, thereby giving President Fonseca a suite of tools to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 96; Morgan, ''Legacy'', 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians now hold that there was likely no cross-pollination between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous ''Minas Geraes'', under the command of João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 241–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sailors that did not escape, over 600 of them, were imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras, where João Cândido and seventeen others were transferred to an isolation cell. Of the eighteen, only two were left alive the next morning—the victim of a heat-producing chemical reaction between [[quicklime]], used to disinfect the cell, and [[carbon dioxide]]. On the same day, a steamship named ''Satelite'' left Rio de Janeiro for the rubber plantations in the Amazon with over a hundred former sailors and nearly three hundred "vagabonds" on board. Nine were executed by the crew along the way, and many of the rest died shortly after while working in the hot tropical climate, conditions described by Rui Barbosa as "a place where one only dies."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 245–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital. It took eighteen months before he and nine sailors faced trial for their supposed anti-government actions taken during the December 9–10 revolts; the judges found them not guilty, and all were discharged from the navy.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the sailors that remained in or were joining the navy, conditions did not immediately change. Training programs had been instituted, especially in the maligned naval apprenticeship schools, that had started graduating literate sailors—a large step above previous practices. But these did not include the sailors already in the navy. An ambitious program was planned in 1911, not long after the revolt, but it was shelved when a new administration was put into place in 1912. The navy was instead left to fall into disrepair, not unlike what had happened in 1893. "Rather than starting over by raising the level of sailors and officers to that of their technically advanced warships," Morgan writes, "the ships that offered the promise of modernity to the Brazilian nation were allowed to deteriorate—as did the navy alongside them."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Legacy'', 255–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to personal identity''' is recognised in international law through a range of declarations and conventions. From as early as birth, an individual’s identity is formed and preserved by registration or being bestowed with a name. However, [[personal identity]] becomes more complex as an individual develops a conscience. But [[human rights]] exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/people/jill-marshall Professor Jill Marshall]: "Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement."&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression.

==Concept and history==

The right to personal identity begins with the [[right to life]]. It is only through existing that individuals can cultivate their identity. Nevertheless, since ancient Greek philosophy, humans have been recognised with a "soul", making them more than physical bone and flesh. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] was created to preserve the biological and philosophical elements of human beings since its establishment in 1948. Therefore, the notion of individual identity and personality has been encouraged and preserved from the birth of human rights. However, throughout the years there have been developments towards the protection of personal identity through avenues that manifest identity such as private life, expression rights, personality rights and the right to know your biological origin.

==Private life==

Article 8 of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has been interpreted to include "personal identity" within the meaning of "private life." &lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space. Professor Marshall explains that this is important to be uninterrupted and to "think reflectively without interference is to be in control of one’s own faculties,"&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "Human Rights Law and Personal Identity", ''Taylor and Francis'', 2014 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; as Macklem puts it: "independence of mind."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem,"Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This protection of inner privacy allows individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity. "Private life" has also be interpreted to protect the development of relationships.The ECHR highlighted in the case of ''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' the significance of relationships concerning the "emotional field" and "the development of one’s own personality."&lt;ref&gt;''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' XIX [1976] at 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect of privacy comes respect for personal autonomy, which Article 8 has also been interpreted to protect.&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://echr-online.info/article-8-echr/ ECHR Online] states that the scope of Article 8 is to "embrace personal autonomy" and the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state to develop one’s own personal life. As illustrated by the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy], through protecting a person’s autonomy,  a person’s identity is also protected, as both are integral to each other.

==Expression rights==

The Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 and Article 10 of the ECHR give everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Macklem explains that "[[freedom of expression]] is not merely the freedom to communicate one’s voice to others. It is more importantly the freedom to develop a distinctive voice of one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem, "Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Articles 19 and 10 encourage the manifestation of personal identity. In the case of ''Handyside v UK'' the court stated "Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of such a society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man."&lt;ref&gt;''Handyside v United Kingdom'' (App 5493/72) ECHR 7 December 1976 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of expression not only endorses individuals to participate and contribute to public life but it also gives them the opportunity to discover who they personally are.

Article 9 of the ECHR also provides the right to freedom (and the manifestation) of thought, conscience and religion. According to [[John Locke|Locke]], thought and consciousness establish personal identity, for these are the foundations of who a person is. In addition, a person’s beliefs also contribute to internal and external identity.&lt;ref&gt;S Weinberg, "Locke on Personal Identity", ''Philosophy Compass'' University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at 399.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some believe women who have freely chosen to wear the Islamic headscarf or full-face veil are expressing their religious beliefs and personal identity. This has led to much debate and controversy within states which have banned the wearing of full-face veils in public.

===Full-face veils===

As of 2011, both Belgium and [[French ban on face covering|France]] have banned the full-face Islamic veil in public places. The ban occurred under the administration of [[President Sarkozy]], who stated that veils oppressed women and were [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13038095 "not welcome"] in France. But Marshall highlights that the ban is disproportionate and it is not government's place to determine what women should wear especially when it misrecognises her and disrespects her identity and personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; While France explains that the intentions of the ban were to promote public order and secularism, ''Arslan v Turkey'' held that Article 9 had been violated&lt;ref&gt;''Arslan and Others'' v Turkey Application. 41135/98 Judgement 23 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and that France has failed to recognise the intrinsic worth of women who freely choose to wear such veils.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated under Article 1 of the Declaration of Human Rights, all beings are born equal and therefore have equal worth. Finally, [[Amnesty International]] has repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The issue of the full-face veil ban in France and Belgium illustrates the extent of legal protection an individual has on their personal identity. Being empowered to make self-determined choices, such as freely choosing to wear a full-face veil to illustrate beliefs, Marshall believes, is an interpreted concept of human dignity and human freedom, allowing each woman's identity to be legally recognised.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in the ECHR are protected under Article 14, and "shall be secured without discrimination regardless of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."

However, these are the opinions of only some scholars. This is a contested issue and others believe that the banning of full-face veils is about liberating females to express their sexuality and providing them the opportunity to show the world who they truly are.&lt;ref&gt;J Selby, "Un/veiling Women’s Bodies: Secularism and Sexuality in Full-face Veil Prohibitions in France and Quebec" ''SAGE Journals'' Vol. 43(3) 2014 at 441.&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects also promote and encourage personal identity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Personality rights===
The right to have and develop a personality is addressed in Article 22 of the UDHR: "Everyone is entitled to the realisation of the rights needed for one’s dignity and the free development of their personality." Article 29 also protects the right to develop one’s personality: "[e]veryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible." Manuc explains that personality rights can be defined as those expressing the quintessence of the human person, and are intrinsic to being human.&lt;ref&gt;L Manuc "Features and Evolution References to Personality Rights" ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' Vol 4(1) 2012 at 362.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights recognise the "spirit" within an individual and have developed from the issues of privacy. Personality rights emerged from the German legal system in the late twentieth century to seek distance from the horrors of Naziism.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a mechanism to improve tort law surrounding privacy, as illustrated in the ''Criminal Diary''&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; case.

The case concerned the issue of personality structure and having the right to determine oneself. Ederle explained this as a right individuals have to choose how to be related in the world. Through the help of the [[German Constitutional Court]], an individual can actively seek and create an intimate sphere so his personality can develop and be protected. Some states see no need for a specific law to personality, as their system of law possesses a different foundation for personality protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989) at 381.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, France, South Africa and England have an all-embracing law that protects an individual’s interest concerning physical integrity, feelings, dignity and privacy and identity.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 213.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in addition to substantial protection to personality through privacy, the Netherlands and Austria also recognise a general right to personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood and biological right===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx Convention on the Rights of the Child]&lt;/ref&gt; stresses the value and importance of a child’s identity. Giroux and De Lorenzi separate the understanding of identity into two parts: static and dynamic. The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, name, genetics, and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 7, a child has a right to have a "legal" identity by being registered, and has a right to a name and a nationality. These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the child’s dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to nationality, name and family relations. Article 8 illustrates the state’s duty to protect this right, both passively and actively.&lt;ref&gt;J Doek, "Article 8: The Right to Preservation of Identity" ''A Commentary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoof Publishers, 2006) at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 7 and 8 developed to confront the issues of children in political struggles and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;K O’Donovan, "Real" Mothers for Abandoned Children" ''Law Society Review'' 2002 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Gelman v Urugnay''&lt;ref&gt;''Gelman v Urugnay'', Series C No. 221 (IACrtHR), 24 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; concerned the kidnapping of Maria Gelman which prevented her from developing relationships with her parents and concealing her true identity from her. 193 states have ratified the convention, making it the most-ratified convention in history, including all United Nation members except the United States, Somalia and South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;TEACHUnicef, "The Convention on the Rights of a Child" ''TeachUNICEF Debate Source Book'' at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity is also within people's genes as evidenced by debates concerning anonymity for gamete donation.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, in the UK, donor-received people can contact their donor once over 18 to find out where they have come from and prevent genealogical bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority'' Act 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are global differences towards the debate; for example, in Canada and the United States there are no regulations, whereas in Switzerland the donor must be willing to be identified, and in France, anonymity is forced.&lt;ref&gt;T Hampton, "Anonymity of Gamete Donations Debated" ''JAMA'' Vol. 294, No. 21 2005 at 2681.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
There are some scholars who believe the right to identity must be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;L Bently, "Identity and the Law" in G Walker and E Leedham-Green (eds) ''Identity: The Darwin College Lecture Series'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) at 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosemary Coombe expressed her concerns of personal identity becoming property as there is the belief that through marginalising identity, it could be accepted as private and exclusive property.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Bently is also concerned with this idea and highlights his worry through a quote from the ''Du Boulay'' case: "Property rights in 'identity'… have the potential to curtail the liberties of those who wish to build their own identities, in whatever way, and for whatever reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Belisle Du Boulay v Jules Rene Hermenegilde Du Boulay '' (1869) LR 2 PC 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe that enshrining personal identity into the law is restricting people's choices and flexibility to transform and change who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 237.&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights can also perform the contrary and protect individuals' choices on personal identity. While developing personal identity comes down to the individual to manifest character and work out 'who they are,' Marshall highlights that jurisprudence has evolved to create a positive obligation on states to provide social conditions such as private and personality rights to be respected, demonstrating that the international audience  acknowledges that legal recognition is necessary to allow individuals to choose how they want to live and who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shared National Credit Program''' is a review of large syndicated bank loans in the [[United States]] conducted by the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], and the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]]. The review covers all loans of $100 million or greater that are shared by three or more institutions. The review is annually beginning in 1977, and typically starts in March with results published around the beginning of the third quarter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14636">To determine whether the '''[[Sherman Antitrust Act]] preempts a state law''', courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in [[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]].
*First, they will inquire whether the state legislation "mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases, or ... places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute." [[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]], 458 U.S. 654, 661; see also [[324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy]], 479 U.S. 335 (1987) ("Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.")
*Second, they will consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the [[state action immunity doctrine]] (aka Parker immunity).  In ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'', 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-part test for applying the doctrine: "First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself." Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).

The antitrust laws allow coincident state regulation of competition.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Exxon Corp. v. Governor of MD., 437 U.S. 117, 130-34 (1978) (state law with anticompetitive effect upheld to avoid destroying the ability of the states to regulate economic activity); Conant, ''supra'' note 1, at 264., Werden &amp; Balmer, ''supra'' note 1, at 59. ''See generally'' 1 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, ''Antitrust Law'' P208 (1978) (discussing the interaction of state and federal antitrust laws); ''id.'' P210 (discussing areas where federal law expressly defers to state law).&lt;/ref&gt;   The Supreme Court enunciated the test for determining when a state statute is in irreconcilable conflict with Section 1 of the Sherman Act in [[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]. Different standards apply depending on whether a statute is attacked on its face or for its effects.
*A statute can be condemned on its face only when it mandates, authorizes or places irresistible pressure on private parties to engage in conduct constituting a per se violation of Section 1.&lt;ref&gt;''Rice,'' 458 U.S. at 661. If a statute does not require a per se violation, then it cannot be preempted on its face. ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:If the statute does not mandate conduct violating a per se rule, the conduct is analyzed under the rule of reason, which requires an examination of the conduct's actual effects on competition.&lt;ref&gt;''See ''[''Rice,'' 458 U.S. at 661.]&lt;/ref&gt; If unreasonable anticompetitive effects are created, the required conduct violates Section 1&lt;ref&gt;National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-90 (1978); Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and the statute is in irreconcilable conflict with the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;See Battipaglia v. New York State Liquor Auth., 745 F.2d 166, 175 (2d Cir. 1984) (while declining to decide whether a statute required an antitrust violation in a facial attack, the court left open the possibility of preemption based on the statute's operation), cert. denied, 105 S. Ct. 1393 (1985); Lanierland Distribs. v. Strickland, 544 F. Supp. 747, 751 (N.D. Ga. 1982) (plaintiff failed to show anticompetitive effects sufficient to violate the rule of reason); Wine &amp; Spirits Specialty, Inc. v. Daniel, 666 S.W.2d 416, 419 (Mo.) (en banc) (declining to decide whether the rule of reason might invalidate a law on the record before them), Appeal dismissed, 105 S. Ct. 56 (1984); United States Brewers Ass'n v. Director of N.M. Dept' of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 100 N.M. 216,    , 668 P.2d 1093, 1099 (1983) (rejecting a facial attack on a statute but reserving a decision on whether the actual application of the statute might violate the antitrust laws), appeal dismissed, 104 S. Ct. 1581 (1984). But see infra note 149 for a discussion on the possibility of a much more limited rule of reason preemption analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Then statutory arrangement is analyzed to determine whether it qualifies as "state action" and is thereby saved from preemption.&lt;ref&gt;See Rice, 458 U.S. at 662-63 n.9 ("because of our resolution of the pre-emption issue, it is not necessary for us to consider whether the statute may be saved from invalidation under the [state action] doctrine"); Capitol Tel. Co. v New York Tel. Co., 750 F.2d 1154, 1157, 1165 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that the state action doctrine protected the conduct of a private party after assuming that it violated the federal antitrust laws), cert. denied, 105 S. Ct. 2325 (1985); Allied Artists Picture Corp. v. Rhodes, 679 F.2d 656, 662 (6th Cir. 1982) (even if conduct violated Sherman Act, the statute is saved by the state action doctrine); Miller v. Hedlund, 579 F. Supp. 116, 124 (D. Or. 1984) (statute violating Section 1 saved by state action); Flav-O-Rich, Inc. v. North Carolina Milk Comm'n, 593 F. Supp. 13, 17-18 (E.D.N.C. 1983) (though conduct violates Section 1, state action saves statute).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice sets out guidelines to aid in preemption analysis.  Preemption should not occur "simply because in a hypothetical situation a private party's compliance with the statute might cause him to violate the antitrust laws."&lt;ref&gt;Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 659 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; This language suggests that preemption occurs only if economic analysis determines that the statutory requirements create "an unacceptable and unnecessary risk of anticompetitive effect,"&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 668 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).&lt;/ref&gt; and does not occur simply because it is possible to use the statute in an anticompetitive manner.&lt;ref&gt;See Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Goodwin, 662 F.2d 88, 100 n.15 (1st Cir.) (power to control others not sufficient for facial preemption where party had no institutional reason to make anticompetitive decisions especially likely), aff'd on other grounds, 662 F.2d 102 (1st Cir. 1981) (en banc), aff'd sub nom. Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116 (1982); Flav-O-Rich, Inc. v. North Carolina Milk Comm'n, 593 F. Supp. 13, 15 (E.D.N.C. 1983) (in an oligopolistic market, price posting would result in an antitrust violation).&lt;/ref&gt; It should not mean that preemption is impossible whenever both procompetitive and anticompetitive results are conceivable.&lt;ref&gt;But cf. Allied Artists Pictures Corp. v. Rhodes, 496 F. Supp. 408, 449 (S.D. Ohio 1980) (indicating that a statute neither requiring nor permitting an anticompetitive collaboration gives the private party enough freedom of choice to preclude preemption), aff'd in part and remanded in part, 679 F.2d 656 (6th Cir. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The per se rule "reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them."

Another important, yet, in the context of Rice, ambiguous guideline regarding preemption by Section 1 is the Court's statement that a "state statute is not preempted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect."&lt;ref&gt;Rice, 458 U.S. at 659.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of this statement is clarified by examining the three cases cited in Rice to support the statement.&lt;ref&gt;Id. (citing [[New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co.]], 439 U.S. 96, 110-11 (1978); [[Exxon Corp. v. Governor of MD.]], 437 U.S. 117, 129-34 (1978); [[Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons v. Hostetter]], 384 U.S. 35, 45-46 (1966)).&lt;/ref&gt;

:In [[New Motor Vehicle Board v. Orrin W. Fox Co.]], automobile manufacturers and retail franchisees contended that the Sherman Act preempted a statute requiring manufacturers to secure the permission of a state board before opening a new dealership if and only if a competing dealer protested. They argued that a conflict existed because the statute permitted "auto dealers to invoke state power for the purpose of restraining intrabrand competition."

:In [[Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland]], oil companies challenged a state statute requiring uniform statewide gasoline prices in situations where the [[Robinson-Patman Act]] would permit charging different prices. They reasoned that the Robinson-Patman Act is a qualification of our "more basic national policy favoring free competition" and that any state statute altering "the competitive balance that Congress struck between the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Acts" should be preempted.

:In both New Motor Vehicle and Exxon, the Court upheld the statutes and rejected the arguments presented as

::&lt;small&gt;Merely another way of stating that the . . . statute will have an anticompetitive effect. In this sense, there is a conflict between the statute and the central policy of the Sherman Act -- 'our charter of economic liberty'. . . . Nevertheless, this sort of conflict cannot itself constitute a sufficient reason for invalidating the . . . statute. For if an adverse effect on competition were, in and of itself, enough to render a state statute invalid, the States' power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 110-11 (1978) (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Governor of MD., 437 U.S. 117, 133 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt;

:This indicates that not every anticompetitive effect warrants preemption.  In neither Exxon nor New Motor Vehicle did the created effect constitute an antitrust violation.  The Rice guideline therefore indicates that only when the effect unreasonably restrains trade, and is therefore a violation, can preemption occur.

:The third case cited to support the "anticompetitive effect" guideline is [[Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons v. Hostetter]], in which the Court rejected a facial Sherman Act preemption challenge to a statute requiring that persons selling liquor to wholesalers affirm that the price charged was no higher than the lowest price at which sales were made anywhere in the United States during the previous month. Since the attack was a facial one, and the state law required no per se violations, no preemption could occur.  The Court also rejected the possibility of preemption due to Sherman Act violations stemming from misuse of the statute.  The Court stated that rather than imposing "irresistible economic pressure" on sellers to violate the Sherman Act, the statute "appears firmly anchored to the assumption that the Sherman Act will deter any attempts by the appellants to preserve their . . . price level [in one state] by conspiring to raise the prices at which liquor is sold elsewhere in the country." Thus, Seagram indicates that when conduct required by a state statute combines with other conduct that, taken together, constitutes an illegal restraint of trade, liability may be imposed for the restraint without requiring preemption of the state statute.

Rice v. Norman Williams Co. supports this misuse limitation on preemption.  Rice states that while particular conduct or arrangements by private parties would be subject to per se or rule of reason analysis to determine liability, "[t]here is no basis . . . for condemning the statute itself by force of the Sherman Act."&lt;ref&gt;Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 662 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, when a state requires conduct analyzed under the rule of reason, a court must carefully distinguish rule of reason analysis for preemption purposes from the analysis for liability purposes. To analyze whether preemption occurs, the court must determine whether the inevitable effects of a statutory restraint unreasonably restrain trade. If they do, preemption is warranted unless the statute passes the appropriate state action tests. But, when the statutory conduct combines with other practices in a larger conspiracy to restrain trade, or when the statute is used to violate the antitrust laws in a market in which such a use is not compelled by the state statute, the private party might be subjected to antitrust liability without preemption of the statute.

==Evidence from legislative history==
The Act was not intended to regulate existing state statutes regulating commerce within state borders.  The House committee, in reporting the bill which was adopted without change, declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No attempt is made to invade the legislative authority of the several States or even to occupy doubtful grounds. No system of laws can be devised by Congress alone which would effectually protect the people of the  [322  U.S. 533, 575]    United States against the evils and oppression of trusts and monopolies. Congress has no authority to deal, generally, with the subject within the States, and the States have no authority to legislate in respect of commerce between the several States or with foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;H.R.Rep. No. 1707, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See also the statement on the floor of the House by Mr. Culberson, in charge of the bill,
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no attempt to exercise any doubtful authority on this subject, but the bill is confined strictly and alone to subjects over which, confessedly, there is no question about the legislative power of Congress. ... &lt;ref&gt;21 Cong.Rec. 4089.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And see the statement of Senator Edmunds, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill in the form in which it passed, that in drafting that bill the committee thought that "we would frame a bill that should be clearly within our constitutional power, that we would make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its particular definitions as applicable to each particular case as the occasion might arise." &lt;ref&gt;21 Cong.Rec. 3148&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly Senator Hoar, a member of that committee who with Senator Edmunds was in charge of the bill, stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now we are dealing with an offense against interstate or international commerce, which the State cannot regulate by penal enactment, and we find the United States without any common law. The great thing that this bill does, except affording a remedy, is to extend the common-law principles, which protected fair competition in trade in old times in England, to international and interstate commerce in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;21 Cong.Rec. 3152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''sound trademark''' is a [[trademark]] where [[sound]] is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2013/04/28/michael-boumendil-la-boite-a-musiques_899641|title=Michaël Boumendil, la boîte à musiques|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2017-07-13|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707050742/http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2013/04/28/michael-boumendil-la-boite-a-musiques_899641|archivedate=2015-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, sounds have been increasingly used as trademarks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect sounds as trademarks through registration, as a sound was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;TRIPs is an international [[treaty]] which sets down minimum standards of protection and regulation for most forms of [[intellectual property]] in all [[World Trade Organization#Membership|member countries of the WTO]].&lt;/ref&gt; which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertaking" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to sound trademarks in most countries, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

==Sound branding==
''Sound branding'' (also known as  ''audio branding'', ''music branding'', ''sonic branding'', ''acoustic branding'')&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/02/what-does-your-brand-sound-like/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010142750/http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/02/what-does-your-brand-sound-like/ |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is “the strategic use of sound … in positively differentiating a product or service, enhancing recall, creating preference, building trust, and even increasing sales.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/02/what-does-your-brand-sound-like/|title=What Does Your Brand Sound Like?|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010142750/http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/02/what-does-your-brand-sound-like/|archivedate=2014-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio branding can tell you whether the brand is romantic and sensual, family-friendly and everyday, indulgent and luxurious, without ever hearing a word or seeing a picture. And it gives a brand an additional way to break through audiences’ shortened attention spans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/11/audio-enhances-brand-content-signature-sound/|title=How Audio Enhances Your Brand Content: Find Your Signature Sound|date=2013-11-08|work=Content Marketing Institute|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730161214/http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/11/audio-enhances-brand-content-signature-sound/|archivedate=2017-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sound logos===
The sound logo (or audio mnemonic) is one of the tools of sound branding, along with the [[jingle]], brand music, and brand theme. A sound logo (or audio logo or sonic logo) is a short distinctive [[melody]] or other sequence of sound, mostly positioned at the beginning or ending of a commercial. It can be seen as the acoustic equivalent of a visual logo. Often a combination of both types of logo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/|title=Sixième Son USA|website=Sixième Son Audio Branding|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713220347/https://www.sixiemeson.com/en/|archivedate=2017-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to enforce the recognition of a brand. An example is the [[T-Mobile]] logo and ringtone composed by Lance Massey, the [[Intel]] logo composed by [[Walter Werzowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musikvergnuegen.com/|title=Musikvergnuegen|website=www.musikvergnuegen.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708182038/http://www.musikvergnuegen.com/|archivedate=2017-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Michelin]] logo composed by Sixième Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/clients/sound-identity-michelin/|title=Michelin audio identity - Sixième Son Audio Branding|work=Sixième Son Audio Branding|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305055506/http://sixiemeson.com/en/clients/sound-identity-michelin/|archivedate=2015-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sound logo leads to learning effects on consumer's perception of a certain product. A melody is the most memorable sequence of sound, since, when a melody starts, the human brain automatically expects the ending. However, some brands realize the importance the sound their brand can make and attempt to capitalize on its own uniqueness. A good example is  the motorcycle brand [[Harley-Davidson]], which, in 1994, filed a sound trademark application for its distinctive V-twin engine sound. It realized that if it could capture its own sound, it could distinguish the brand at every point of customer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/currentissuemenu/1660-sonic-branding |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408064030/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/currentissuemenu/1660-sonic-branding |archivedate=2013-04-08 }} Communicate magazine 'Sonic Branding' July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Just like a visual logo, the most essential qualities of a sound logo are uniqueness, memorability, and relevancy to the brand promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/8/19/audio_branding_music.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222151323/http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/8/19/audio_branding_music.html |archivedate=2015-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio and television stations create their own audio identities using  melodic themes to strengthen their brand. Notable  examples include the short variations of the [[BBC Radio 2]] or [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] [[jingle]]s. In recent years, television station [[Station identification|idents]] have also introduced their own audio identities to strengthen their brand recognitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/46 Audio Identities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214015912/http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/46 |date=2013-02-14 }} at ''imagedissectors.com'', URL accessed September 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are typically fours  to six steps involved in creating a sound logo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/07/six-steps-to-getting-sponsorsh/|title=Six Steps to Successful Sponsorships|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818030957/http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/07/six-steps-to-getting-sponsorsh/|archivedate=2014-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logo-sound.com/blog/the-4-steps-to-getting-a-brilliant-sound-logo/|title=The 4 Steps To Getting A Brilliant Sound Logo {{!}} The Sound Logo Blog|website=www.logo-sound.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908144938/http://www.logo-sound.com/blog/the-4-steps-to-getting-a-brilliant-sound-logo/|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

# The audio strategy development phase where the brand essence and other foundational elements is confirmed.  
# The audio touch point analysis phase where all places the brand will come in contact with customers and other stakeholders is identified.  
# The concept phase where an audio collage is created to help define texture, rhythm, melody, harmony, and instrumentation that best convey the brand values and then the unique sound or piece of music is composed to convey the distinctive brand essence and values. 
# The test and refine phase to where the combination of sound elements are optimized to ensure that they communicate essence, values, and promise of the brand.  In this phase, psycho-acoustic research would be conducted, if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713220347/https://www.sixiemeson.com/en/ |archivedate=2017-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The implementation stage to create the adaptations for each touch point. 
# The handover phase where an audio style guide is developed to help the supervisor or manager of the brand recommend, plan, and supervise the installation of the audio brand elements into devices, expo booths, displays, call centers, and other places where it will be used. Additionally, the licensing or ownership of the branding elements or all applicable usage rights, depending on the agreement, are formally transferred to brand.

Once completed, the audio elements should be managed just like the rest of a company’s brand assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/simplify-communications-audio-branding-042943136.html|title=News and Advice {{!}} Yahoo's Aabaco Small Business Advisor|website=Small Business|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812194811/https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/simplify-communications-audio-branding-042943136.html|archivedate=2014-08-12|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental sound design===

Creating a brand experience using sound is also within the area of sound branding. The opportunities for creating a sound branding experience that conveys a brand essence and soul is possible. Bentley Motors, for instance, recently looked to create a unique brand experience by replacing all interior mechanical sounds with sound that had been created for their Continental GT car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radium-audio.com/Bentley-Continental-GT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403010000/http://radium-audio.com/bentley-continental-gt/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roland Garros, home of the French Open created an audio identity that is used in its facilities and played during award ceremonies as well as opening and closing ceremonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportbuzzbusiness.fr/identite-sonore-roland-garros-agence-sixieme.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801204115/http://www.sportbuzzbusiness.fr/identite-sonore-roland-garros-agence-sixieme.html |archivedate=2014-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/clients/roland-garros-the-french-open-sound-identity/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607214046/http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/clients/roland-garros-the-french-open-sound-identity/# |archivedate=2014-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retail environments, sound branding extends to the use of sound in order to enhance the consumer experience and influence behavior .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data-driven-marketing.net/articles/organization/sounds-speeds-sight{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  “For instance, an academic study that took place in a Scotland supermarket found that sales of wines displayed side-by-side and priced similarly responded to music. On days when French music played, French wines outsold German wines. German wines, however, outsold French ones on days when typical German music was playing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data-driven-marketing.net/articles/organization/sounds-speeds-sight{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British department store chain [[Selfridges]] is one of the notable brands to have enjoyed success with this approach, creating distinct consumer ‘zones’ within its stores, which change visually and sonically so customers know they have passed into a new department. These zones are often tailored to suit a particular product, customer profile, season or even times of the day and week.&lt;ref&gt; Article {{cite web|url=http://www.themarketer.co.uk/trends/audio-branding-the-sound-of-success/ |title=Audio branding: the sound of success |publisher=The Marketer |date=2012-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226223517/http://www.themarketer.co.uk/trends/audio-branding-the-sound-of-success/ |archivedate=2012-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish Mall, Emporia, has also found success using soundscapes to help guide customers.&lt;ref&gt;http://data-driven-marketing.net/articles/organization/six-steps-creating-successful-audio-brand{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unibail Rodamco upscale malls have an audio identity that is adapted to their parking lots, entryways, walkways, even chairs and plant walls and extends into their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/clients/sound-identity-unibail-rodamco/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301214840/http://www.sixiemeson.com/en/clients/sound-identity-unibail-rodamco/# |archivedate=2014-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding sound technology and devices===

Sound design for mobile phones, ATMs, laptop computers, PDAs, and countless other devices can improve the user experience by making tasks easier and more enjoyable. These sounds can also reveal something about the company that created the experience (and, in the case of personalized ringtones, something about the user him/herself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.womenonbusiness.com/how-audio-branding-can-help-define-your-business-culture/|title=How Audio Branding Can Help Define Your Business Culture|date=2013-08-21|work=Women on Business|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324195929/http://www.womenonbusiness.com/how-audio-branding-can-help-define-your-business-culture/|archivedate=2016-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/audio-branding-and-its-importance-to-your-personal-brand/|title=Audio Branding and Its Importance to Your Personal Brand {{!}} Personal Branding Blog - Stand Out In Your Career|website=www.personalbrandingblog.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109073546/http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/audio-branding-and-its-importance-to-your-personal-brand/|archivedate=2016-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sound branding also encompasses the use of targeted audio messages by organizations to communicate with customers over the telephone, known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging. These messages are typically deployed on an organizations interactive voice response (IVR) switchboard system or when customers are placed on hold and incorporate short, informative voice messages often accompanied by music.

A study commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)|PHMG]] provided insight into consumer perceptions of on-hold marketing. It revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls and 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute. When on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence and 76% preferred to hear something other than muzak.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web |url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626051217/http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web |url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703013307/http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |archivedate=2012-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of sound in branding===

Sound branding encompasses many other tactics intended to convey organizational or product identity (who an organization is and what it stands for); enhance consumers' experience of a product or service; or extend an organization's relationship with its audience.
Another form of sound branding involves an organization's public association with or sponsorship of a musical enterprise—a non-profit music organization, for instance, or perhaps a music artist or group of artists. For example, some companies completely unrelated to music offer free music downloads on their websites. Ostensibly intended to demonstrate the sponsoring organization's good will from a cultural patronage stand point, practices like these also brand the organization by calling public attention to its beliefs, its values, and its aesthetic sensibilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/07/six-steps-to-getting-sponsorsh/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818030957/http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/07/six-steps-to-getting-sponsorsh/ |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's arguable that sound branding is now using ‘subliminal’ brand placement in pop song lyrics to echo a corporate slogan, a company’s ‘Unique Selling Point’ or ‘brand values’ (rather than the ‘old fashioned’ mentioning of brands / products directly). An example of this would be [[Pharrell Williams]]’ 2005 song ‘Can I Have It Like That’ (featuring Gwen Stefani), with the chorus which echoed the Burger King advertising slogan "Have It Your Way”. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/go/kids/soundex/75332744.mp3 MP3 file of sound logo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510215923/http://www.uspto.gov/go/kids/soundex/75332744.mp3 |date=2009-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio marketing===

Audio marketing, also known as on-hold marketing or [[on-hold messaging]], is increasingly being seen as an important element of audio branding. It involves the creation of brand-congruent voice and music tracks, which are used by companies to communicate marketing messages to customers over the telephone. Typically, these messages are played while a customer is waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. They are also frequently used as part of [[interactive voice response]] systems designed to handle large volumes of calls.

Different attributes of voice and music, including tempo, tone, pitch and volume, are all taken into account in order to create messaging that reinforce the values conveyed through a company's visual branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/archive/194-julyaugust-2014/5667-heard-mentality-brands-must-be-both-seen-and-heard- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707181438/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/archive/194-julyaugust-2014/5667-heard-mentality-brands-must-be-both-seen-and-heard- |archivedate=2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in consumer perceptions towards audio marketing have played a large part in its adoption. Negative perceptions were traditionally attached to on-hold marketing but a more recent survey conducted by CNN found that 70% of callers in the United States who are made to hold the line in silence will hang up within 60 seconds, while further research by [[PHMG (company)|PHMG]] found 73% of consumers want to hear something more than beeps or silence on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/history-of-hanging-on-the-telephone-how-did-we-end-up-with-handel-tinkling-down-the-line-9727725.html|title=Hanging on the telephone: How did we end up with Handel tinkling down|date=2014-09-11|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307214940/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/history-of-hanging-on-the-telephone-how-did-we-end-up-with-handel-tinkling-down-the-line-9727725.html|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html|title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204064124/http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html|archivedate=2017-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/news/management/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml|title=Customers perennially on hold|date=2012-06-29|work=Small Business|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405052923/http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/news/management/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml|archivedate=2016-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Sixième Son’s work for SNCF indicate that an audio brand can become a significant asset for a company. With SNCF, for instance, they found that 92% of listeners can correctly identify the audio brand in testing — “and that 88% of these listeners correctly identified the brand upon hearing just two notes. And perhaps more significantly, 71% of them now see the brand as being ‘attractive’ or ‘very attractive,’ and SNCF has experienced an 18% increase in the perception of leadership.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Registration of sound marks in different jurisdictions==
{{globalize|date=December 2010}}

===Australia===
====Graphic representation====

In Australia, sound trademarks are generally acceptable if they can be represented by musical notation. According to the Australian trademarks Office, an application for a sound trademark which cannot be graphically represented with musical notation must include the following requirements.

* a graphic representation of the mark (e.g. "CLIP CLOP MOO");
* a clear and concise description of the trademark (examples are given below);
**''The trademark is a sound mark. It comprises the sound of dogs barking to the traditional tune "Greensleeves" as rendered in the audio tape accompanying the application.''
**''The trademark consists of the sound of two steps taken by a cow on pavement, followed by the sound of a cow mooing (clip, clop, MOO) as rendered in the recording accompanying the application.''
**''The trademark consists of the sound of a soprano voice singing wordlessly to the tune represented in the musical score attached to the application. The trademark is demonstrated in the recording accompanying the application form.''
**''The trademark consists of a repeated rapid tapping sound made by a wooden stick tapping on a metal garbage can lid which gradually becomes louder over approximately 10 seconds duration. The sound is demonstrated in the recordings accompanying the application.''
* a recording of the trademark which can be played back on media which is easily and commonly accessible.

Other requirements are set out in the ''trademarks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure'' issued by IP Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trade Marks Examiners Manual |url=http://manuals.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/trade_marks_examiners_manual.htm |website=manuals.ipaustralia.gov.au |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

In the European Union, Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community trademark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In [[Shield Mark BV vs Joost Kist]] (case C-283/01) the EcJ basically repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copat.de/markenformen/jj010283_en.pdf Shield mark B.V. v Joost Kist (case C-283/01)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050429145255/http://www.copat.de/markenformen/jj010283_en.pdf |date=2005-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf Sieckmann v German Patent Office  (case C-273/00)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210437/http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition generally encompasses sound marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use [[musical notation]] to graphically represent their trademark. A piece of [[music]]—a tune, or a ring tone on a [[telephone]]—can be easily registered as a trademark (provided, of course, that it meets the Community trademark tests for registrability and distinctiveness). While tunes are capable of registration, before 2005 noises were not. The sound of a dog barking or the crash of [[Breaking wave|surf]] cannot be recorded in musical notation and sonagrams were not accepted by the OHIM trademark registry. A change in legislation occurred in 2005 so that now the Office accepts sonograms as a graphical representation of a trademark if they are accompanied by an MP3 sound file when filing a trademark electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oami.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/contentPdfs/law_and_practice/trade_marks_practice_manual/WP/Part-B/04-part_b_examination_section_4_absolute_grounds_for_refusal/part_b_examination_section_4_absolute_grounds_for_refusal_en.pdf The Manual Concerning Proceedings Before the Office fort Harmonization in the Internal Market&amp;nbsp;– Part B&amp;nbsp;– Examination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403012213/https://oami.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/contentPdfs/law_and_practice/trade_marks_practice_manual/WP/Part-B/04-part_b_examination_section_4_absolute_grounds_for_refusal/part_b_examination_section_4_absolute_grounds_for_refusal_en.pdf |date=2015-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, the test for whether a sound can serve as a trademark "depends on [the] aural perception of the listener which may be as fleeting as the sound itself unless, of course, the sound is so inherently different or distinctive that it attaches to the subliminal mind of the listener to be awakened when heard and to be associated with the source or event with which it struck".

This was the fairly strict test applied by the US [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] in the case of [[General Electric]] Broadcasting Co., 199 [[United States Patents Quarterly|USPQ]] 560, in relation to the timed toll of a [[ship]]'s bell clock.

More famously, [[Harley-Davidson]] attempted to register as a trademark the distinctive "chug" of a Harley-Davidson [[motorcycle]] [[engine]]. On February 1, 1994, the company filed its application with the following description: "The mark consists of the [[exhaust system|exhaust]] sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by [[V-twin]], common [[crankpin]] motorcycle engines when the goods are in use."  Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed oppositions against the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin [[V-twin engine]] which produces the same sound.  After six years of [[litigation]], with no end in sight, in early 2000, Harley-Davidson withdrew their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/21/business/fi-43145|title=Harley-Davidson Quits Trying to Hog Sound|last=O'DELL|first=JOHN|date=2000-06-21|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912140410/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/21/business/fi-43145|archivedate=2016-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies have been more successful in registering their distinctive sounds: [[MGM]] and their lion's roar; the [[NBC chimes]]; famous basketball team the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and their theme song "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]"; [[Intel]] and the three-second chord sequence used with the [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processor; [[THX]] and its "[[Deep Note]]"; Federal Signal Corporation and the sound of their "[[Q2B]]" fire truck siren; [[AT&amp;T]] and the spoken letters "AT&amp;T" accompanied by music; [[RKO]] with a combined moving image and sound mark depicting the RKO Pictures radio tower transmitting a Morse-code like signal; and [[20th Century Fox]] with the very famous fanfare composed by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]].

A '''status offense''' is an action that is prohibited only to a certain class of people, and most often applied only to [[offence (law)|offenses]] committed by [[Minor (law)|minors]]. 

In the [[United States]], the term '''status offense''' also refers to an offense such as a traffic violation where motive is not a consideration in determining guilt. In the United Kingdom and Europe, this type of status offense may be termed a [[regulatory offences|regulatory offense]].

==Usage==
Definitions of status offense vary. A neutral definition may be "[a] type of crime that is not based upon prohibited action or inaction but rests on the fact that the offender has a certain personal condition or is of a specified character."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.enotes.com/wests-law-encyclopedia/status-offense Definition of status offense] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116154123/http://law.enotes.com/wests-law-encyclopedia/status-offense |date=2006-11-16 }} Enotes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] states that a [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] status offense is a crime which cannot be committed by an adult.&lt;ref&gt;U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, possession of a firearm ''by a minor'', by definition, cannot be done by an adult. In some states the term "status offense" does not apply to adults at all; according to Wyoming law, status offenses can be committed only by people under 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;(2002)[http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2006/interim/jud/BILLS/07lso-0076w2.pdf Working Draft.] State of Wyoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juvenile status offenders are distinguished from [[juvenile delinquent|juvenile delinquent offenders]] in that status offenders have not committed an act that would be considered a crime if it were committed by an adult, whereas delinquent youths have committed such an act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/1543/Juvenile-Status-Offenders.html Juvenile Status Offenders.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some [[sexting]] laws and broadly interpreted child pornography laws have effectively made sexting by a minor into a status offense, but it is treated by the legal system as a criminal offense, punishable by long prison terms and large fines. It is de facto a status offense since an adult is allowed to possess a nude image of themselves but a minor is not allowed to possess or distribute a nude image of themselves.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Examples==
Status offenses may include [[Legal drinking age|consumption of alcohol]], [[truancy]], and [[Runaway youth|running away]] from home. These acts may be illegal for persons under a certain age, while remaining legal for all others, which makes them status offenses.

Status offense may also apply to other classes, including laws forbidding ownership of [[firearm]]s by [[felony|felons]], where such ownership is otherwise legal.

Laws that prohibit certain actions to certain persons based on their sex, race, nationality, religion, etc., are also status offenses. A law that prohibits men from using [[toilet|public toilets]] intended for women, as well as a law that sets a [[curfew]] for people below a certain age, are examples of status offenses.

Status offenses from the past that are no longer operative include:
*The [[Nuremberg Laws]] (Germany, 1935-1945) banned sexual relations between Jews and non-Jewish Germans.
*[[Miscegenation#United States|Various laws in the United States]] prohibited marriage (and, in some cases, sexual relations) between white people and African-Americans (and, in some cases, Asians and Native Americans). These were enacted at the [[U.S. state|state]] level; some states had anti-miscegenation laws and some did not. The first of these laws was enacted in 1691 in Virginia and the last were voided in 1967 in the ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' case.
*South Africa's [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949|Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] (1949-1985) prohibited sexual relations (as well as marriages) between people of different races.
*Various other places, at other times, have promulgated [[anti-miscegenation laws]] prohibiting sexual relations between members of specified different races.

A '''straw donor''' is a person who illegally uses another person's [[money]] to make a [[political contribution]] in their own name.&lt;ref&gt;NewsOn6, The Associated Press, "Stipe Investigated In Alleged 'Straw Donor' Scheme," http://kotv.com/news/local/story/?id=122067#, Accessed 8/6/2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

==United States==
In the United States, making a political contribution in another person's name is illegal, as is agreeing to be the named donor with someone else's money.&lt;ref&gt;NewsOK.com, Tony Thornton and Nolan Clay, "FBI says straw donors backed others," http://newsok.com/article/3024944?pg=2, Accessed 8/10/08&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a straw donor may contribute to a political campaign before being reimbursed by another, who is using that person as a conduit to exceed the limits on campaign contributions under the laws of a jurisdiction.

In federal elections in the United States, straw donor schemes are illegal under [[Title 52 of the United States Code|52 U.S.C.]] § 30122, which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to be used to effect such a contribution, and no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Title 52 of the United States Code|52 U.S.C. § 30122]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This section was enacted as part of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] in 1971.

===Massachusetts 2016===
{{POV section|date=February 2017}}
A Massachusetts law firm,  Thornton Law, has been accused of funneling funds to the Democrats through a massive and illegal straw-donor scheme.

Law firm partners donated nearly $1.6 million to mostly Democratic candidates and committees between 2010 through 2014. They were reimbursed ten days later $1.4 million listed as '''bonuses,''' including more than 280 in amounts that precisely matched their donations.

The case was closed without any prosecution. “While our investigation did not find sufficient evidence to support a criminal charge, we are recommending enhancements to current state campaign finance laws to address the ambiguities in the law that gave rise to these allegations,”  Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said.

The small firm made donations to Democrats [[Barack Obama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[ Elizabeth Warren]] and Sen. [[Harry Reid]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3899648/Massachusetts-law-firm-reimbursed-partners-political-donations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dinesh D'Souza===
In 2014, [[Dinesh D'Souza]], an outspoken political commentator, author, and filmmaker was charged and convicted for reimbursing others $20,000 for donations to 2012 Senate candidate Wendy Long, a New York Republican.

President Trump pardoned D'Souza May 31, 2018.

===Jeffrey E. Thompson===
In 2016, Jeffrey E. Thompson, was sentenced to three months in prison, 3 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine for the illegal funding through straw donors of several political candidates, including Hilary Clinton in her 2008 presidential bid and Vincent Gray in his 2010 run for mayor of Washington, D.C. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/shadow-campaign-donor-and-mastermind-set-for-sentencing-in-federal-court/2016/08/13/66df47a6-5a52-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Succession to the Crown Act 2013''' (c. 20) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which altered the laws of [[succession to the British throne]] in accordance with the 2011 [[Perth Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/successiontothecrown.html |title=Bills before Parliament |publisher=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act repealed the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], replacing [[male-preference primogeniture]] with [[absolute primogeniture]] for those born in the line of succession after 28 October 2011, which meant the eldest child, regardless of sex, would precede his or her brothers and sisters. The act also ended the historical disqualification of a person who married a [[Roman Catholic]] from the line of succession, and removed the requirement of those outside the [[Perth Agreement#First six in line|first six persons]] in line to the throne to seek the Sovereign's approval to marry. It came into force on 26 March 2015,&lt;ref name=commencement/&gt; at the same time as the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s implemented the Perth Agreement in their own laws.&lt;ref name=inforce&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-03-26/HCWS490/ Statement by Nick Clegg MP, UK parliament website], 26 March 2015 (retrieved on same date).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Perth Agreement}}
Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] the throne of the [[Kingdom of England]] was settled on the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]] and the "[[heirs of the body|heirs of her body]]", this phrase being understood under English [[common law]] to imply [[Primogeniture#Male-preference cognatic primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]],&lt;ref name="bodganor_42"&gt;{{cite book |page=42 |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |year=1995 |title=The Monarchy and the Constitution |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ISBN=978-0-19-829334-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that brothers would precede sisters in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession]]. The Act also prevented a "[[papist]]" (Roman Catholic) from inheriting the English throne and removed those who had married Roman Catholics from the line of succession.

The treaties that created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801 specifically applied these provisions to the new British throne. Article II of the [[Acts of Union 1707]] stated that the "Succession of the Monarchy" is settled by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], and the ban of "Papists" from inheriting the throne was to continue according to that Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=[[Union with Scotland Act 1706]] |periodical=Acts of the English Parliament |volume=Ann 6 |issue=7 |at=Sect. II|quote=That the Succession to the Monarchy of the united Kingdom of Great Britain [...] is settled by an Act of Parliament made in England in the Twelfth year of the reign of His late Majesty King William the Third intituled [long title of the Act of Settlement] And that all Papists and persons marrying Papists shall be excluded from and for ever incapable to inherit possess or enjoy the Imperial Crown of Great Britain [...] according to the Provision for the descent of the Crown of England made by another Act of Parliament in England in the first year of the reign of Their late Majesties King William and Queen Mary intituled [long title of Bill of Rights 1689].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 2 of [[Acts of Union 1801]], again maintained that the succession rules in place in the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland should be "continued limited and settled in the same manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=[[Union with Ireland Act 1800]] |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain|volume=Geo. 3 39 &amp; 40 |issue=67 |at=Section 2 |quote=[T]he succession to the imperial crown of the said United Kingdom [...] shall continue limited and settled in the same manner as the succession to the imperial crown of the said kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland now stands limited and settled, according to the existing laws and to the terms of union between England and Scotland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Acts of Union 1707, male preference primogeniture has operated twice to displace a female by a younger brother: when [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Princess Augusta]]'s younger brother became [[King George III]] on the death of their grandfather [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] (1760); and when [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]]'s younger brother became [[King Edward VII]] on the death of their mother [[Queen Victoria]] (1901).

[[Princess Anne]] is the younger sister of the [[heir apparent]], [[Prince Charles]]. Her place in the line of succession is not affected by the provisions of the Act relating to male preference, in that she remains head of the line following those headed by her younger brothers, whose lines continue to precede hers under male preference.&lt;ref name="Sec1-1"&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 1 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after 28 October 2011 does not give that person, or that person's descendants, precedence over any other person (whenever born).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agreement in principle (2011) and final consent (2012)===
In December 2011 the Statement of Friday 28 October 2011 issued at Perth was published in a House of Commons committee report. It stated that the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth nations "of whom Her Majesty the Queen is Head of State" had "agreed in principle to work together towards a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns", and that they would wish "unanimously to advise The Queen of their views and seek her agreement." The statement continued:

{{quote|All countries wish to see change in two areas. First, they wish to end the system of male preference primogeniture under which a younger son can displace an elder daughter in the line of succession. Second, they wish to remove the legal provision that anyone who marries a Roman Catholic shall be ineligible to succeed to the Crown. There are no other restrictions in the rules about the religion of the spouse of a person in the line of succession and the Prime Ministers felt that this unique barrier could no longer be justified. The Prime Ministers have agreed that they will each work within their respective administrations to bring forward the necessary measures to enable all the realms to give effect to these changes simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Official statement 28 October 2011 issued at Perth, as printed in UK House of Commons Committee report: ''Rules of Royal Succession'', p. 10 (Annex 1), published 7 December 2011 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpolcon/1615/1615.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcgirlsequal&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607 |title=Girls equal in British throne succession |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter to the other realms' heads of government, prior to the Perth Agreement, British Prime Minister David Cameron had additionally proposed to limit the requirement to obtain the monarch's permission to marry to the first six people in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8822447/Royal-family-Cameron-begins-process-to-allow-first-born-daughters-to-accede-throne.html |title=Royal family: Cameron begins process to allow first born daughters to accede throne |publisher=The Telegraph |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2012, Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] announced:
{{quote|[T]he Government has received final consent from all the Commonwealth realms to press ahead with a landmark bill to end the centuries-old discrimination against women in line to the British throne at the soonest possible opportunity. This confirmation means that the Government will seek to introduce the Succession to the Crown Bill in the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity allowed by the parliamentary timetable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/royal-succession-rules-will-be-changed |title=Royal succession rules will be changed |publisher=Deputy Prime Minister's Office |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Progress in Parliament===
The bill was published on 13 December 2012, and after passing both Houses of Parliament it received [[royal assent]] on 25 April 2013, immediately before the [[Legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]] of Parliament that day.&lt;ref name="UK Parliament website"&gt;{{Ukhansard|house=HL|date=25 April 2013|vol=744|c=1563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/successiontothecrown/stages.html Bill stages – Succession to the Crown Act 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose of the Succession to the Crown Act is to give effect in the United Kingdom to the Perth agreement. The British government announced that the Act's provisions were not intended to come into force before the appropriate domestic arrangements were in place in the other Commonwealth realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2012-12-13|title=Succession to the Crown Bill--Explanatory Notes.|author=The Cabinet Office|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0110/en/130110en.htm|accessdate=2014-04-07|at=para. 10|quote=It was agreed that the United Kingdom would be the first to draft legislation, but that this would not be introduced until the Government had secured the agreement of the other Commonwealth Realms to the terms of the Bill, and would not be commenced until the appropriate domestic arrangements were in place in the other Commonwealth Realms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==

===Gender===
Males born after 28 October 2011 no longer precede their elder sisters in the line of succession.&lt;ref name="Sec1-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2012-12-13|title=Succession to the Crown Bill--Explanatory Notes.|author=The Cabinet Office|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0110/en/130110en.htm|accessdate=2014-04-07|at=Para. 26|quote=An effect of the proposed change is that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a daughter and then a son, the daughter would precede the son in the line of succession.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first people in the line of succession to be affected by the changes on the date they came into force were the children of [[Lady Davina Lewis]], her son Tāne (born 2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010), who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.&lt;ref name=royalcentral&gt;[http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/what-do-the-new-royal-succession-changes-mean-46610 "What do the new royal succession changes mean?"] at ''Royal Central'' website, 26 March 2015 (retrieved 30 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Act came into force, the Duchess of Cambridge was expecting [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge|Princess Charlotte]], upon whom the Act had no immediate practical effect; from her birth on 2 May 2015 she was fourth in line to the Throne, after Prince George of Cambridge and ahead of [[Prince Harry]], just as she would have been had the Act not been passed.  However, due to the provisions of the Act, she has retained her place in the succession ahead of [[Prince Louis of Cambridge]], her younger brother.

===Marriage to Roman Catholics===
Marrying a Roman Catholic no longer disqualifies a person from succeeding to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 2 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=(1) A person is not disqualified from succeeding to the Crown or from possessing it as a result of marrying a person of the Roman Catholic faith. (2) Subsection (1) applies in relation to marriages occurring before the time of the coming into force of this section where the person concerned is alive at that time (as well as in relation to marriages occurring after that time).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Succession to the Crown Bill, Schedule paragraph 5 (as introduced)&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation published when the bill had been introduced mentioned that those who had lost their places in the line of succession by marrying a Roman Catholic would regain their places, but that those "with a realistic prospect of succeeding to the Throne" would not be affected. The first person in the new line of succession to be affected by this change when it came into effect was [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], who had married a Roman Catholic in 1988, and was restored to the line of succession in 34th place, after his father the Duke of Kent.&lt;ref name=royalcentral/&gt; The provision of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues, as the monarch remains the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

===Consent to marriages===
The [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] is repealed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 3(4) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=The Royal Marriages Act 1772 [...] is repealed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, only the [[Succession to the British throne#Current line of succession|first six persons in line]] to the throne require the Sovereign's approval to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 3(1) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=A person who (when the person marries) is one of the 6 persons next in the line of succession to the Crown must obtain the consent of Her Majesty before marrying.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage without the Sovereign's consent would disqualify the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 3(3) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=The effect of a person's failure to comply with subsection (1) is that the person and the person's descendants from the marriage are disqualified from succeeding to the Crown.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the marriage would still be legally valid.

Marriages legally void under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 will be treated as never having been void, except for purposes relating to the succession to the Crown, provided all the following conditions are met:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 3(5) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Neither party to the marriage was one of the six persons next in the line of succession to the Crown at the time of the marriage.
# No consent was sought under section 1 of that Act, or notice given under section 2 of that act, in respect of the marriage.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, this section does not apply to marriages for which prior consent was asked, but not given.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In all the circumstances it was reasonable for the person concerned not to have been aware at the time of the marriage that the act applied to it.
# No person acted before the coming into force of the 2013 Act on the basis that the marriage was void.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, the section does not re-establish a marriage as valid if somebody already litigated on the grounds that the marriage was void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequential amendments===

However, the sections that ban Catholic succession were not repealed. Catholics are still officially termed as being "naturally dead and deemed to be dead" in terms of succession. This distinction was first legislated in the Bill of Rights 1689.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/england.asp|title=Text of Bill of Rights|publisher=Avalon Law. Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Con]]) also confirmed "the Act of Settlement deems somebody who has been a Catholic for a minute to be 'dead' in terms of the succession, and it passes over them 'as if they were dead'. It is an absolute. If at any moment in their whole life they were in communion with Rome, they are excluded from the throne, deemed to be dead." [[Mark Durkan]] ([[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]]) tried to make an incorrect comparison of this with [[McCarthyism]], "In effect, it is the McCarthyite question: 'Are you now or have you ever been a Catholic?'”. He then went on with a summary of the proviso that was more accurate, “For anybody who has ever been a Catholic in any shape or form, that is it, they are out; they count as dead for these purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-01-28c.695.2&amp;s=privy+council#g701.0|title=House of Commons Debates. 28 January 2013, c695|publisher=Parliament UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban continues, although it is not only a ban on Catholics but on any religion other than Protestant, since the [[Acts of Union 1707]] require the monarch to be a Protestant.

As the monarch's eldest son will no longer automatically be [[heir apparent]], the [[Treason Act 1351]] was also amended, so that encompassing the death of the monarch's eldest son is now extended to murdering the heir apparent, whatever the sex. Another amendment to the Treason Act is that, whereas it had been treason to "violate" the monarch's eldest son's wife, it is now only treason if the eldest son is also the eldest child.

The [[Regency Act 1937]] was amended to require the regent to be a person who had not been disqualified from the succession by marrying without the monarch's permission under the 2013 Act.&lt;ref name="schedule"/&gt;

===Commencement===
None of the provisions of the act altering the law, including those which will or may affect any direct or collateral [[line of succession to the British throne]], were to come into force until a day appointed for it by a commencement order made by the [[Lord President of the Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2013 |title=Succession to the Crown Act |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=2013 |issue=20 |at=Section 5(1)-5(2) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/ |accessdate=2014-04-07|quote=(1)This section comes into force on the day on which this Act is passed.(2)The other provisions of this Act come into force on such day and at such time as the Lord President of the Council may by order made by statutory instrument appoint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Section 5 only involves commencement and the [[short title]] and does not include any clause about succession. The person who will actually succeed will continue to be the person who at the time of the next [[demise of the Crown]] is the [[heir apparent]] or presumptive, and the act does not alter the [[Accession Council]]'s responsibility to meet for the purposes of the Act of Settlement and Acts of Union and to direct a proclamation of accession to be read in public places, as in the case of the [[proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II]].&lt;/ref&gt; When publishing the bill the government had announced that it was expecting to bring the provisions into force at the same time as the other realms would be bringing into force any changes to their legislation or other changes necessary for them to implement the Perth Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2012-12-13|title=Succession to the Crown Bill--Explanatory Notes.|author=The Cabinet Office|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0110/en/130110en.htm|accessdate=2014-04-07|at=para. 42|quote=The government expects to bring the rest of the Bill into force at the same time as the other Realms bring into force any changes to their legislation or other changes which are necessary for them to implement the Perth agreement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done on 26 March 2015.&lt;ref name=inforce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, Lord President of the Council (Cabinet Office) (with special responsibility for political and constitutional reform) [http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-nick-clegg/1563]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 5(2) conferred on the Lord President of the Council power to bring the principal provisions of the Act into force by commencement order, enabling the new rules on succession to come into force at the same time throughout the realms.

The Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories do NOT have (and do NOT get to have, or get to decide) their own (separate) laws on British Royal succession anyway (until they actually have their own Independence within the Commonwealth with the Queen as their Heads of State and also as Queen, as Commonwealth Realms), thus unnecessary to extend the Act to the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories, "by necessary implication" or otherwise; "by necessary implication" as a legal concept is not anyway allowed under the English Common law as it currently stands (and has not been so since the year 1722), as far as legal extent (outside of the United Kingdom, for Acts of Parliament ) is concerned anyway.

==External reference==
The legislation passed in the realms of Australia, Barbados, and Canada make reference to the United Kingdom legislation in different ways. The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2015]], passed by the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, is expressed to be for changing "the law relating to the effect of gender and marriage on royal succession, consistently with changes made to that law in the United Kingdom, so that the Sovereign of Australia is the same person as the Sovereign of the United Kingdom". The [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]], passed by the parliament of Canada, refers to the bill (not the act): "The alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne set out in the bill laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to Make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes is assented to." The parliament of Barbados' Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, uses similar wording to Canada's law: "The Parliament of Barbados acquiesces to the alteration in the law relating to the Succession to the Throne set out in the Bill laid before the
Parliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=

==Commentary==

===Royal family===
On 6 January 2013, the ''Daily Mail'' reported that the Prince of Wales had "serious concerns" about the proposed legislation:

{{quote|[I]n a meeting with Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, the Prince is said to have raised concerns about what will happen if his grandchild is allowed to marry a Roman Catholic (under [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] 1125 of the Catholic Church)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/the-duchess-of-cambridge-and-the-right-royal-baby-battle-8445750.html| title=The Duchess of Cambridge and the right royal baby battle| date=10 January 2013| newspaper=London Evening Standard| accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;...

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office and a spokesman for the Prince declined to comment on the ''Daily Mail'' report.&lt;ref name="dailymailcharles"/&gt; On 9 January 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron said in regard to the proposals that "there has been very thorough contact between No. 10 Downing Street and the palace, and all the issues are settled and agreed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= United Kingdom| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130109/debtext/130109-0001.htm#13010946000010 | house= House of Commons| date= 9 January 2013| column= 310|title=Prime Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of England===
On 21 January 2013, the Church of England published a briefing endorsing the bill's provisions and stating, "The use of fast-tracking procedures [for the bill] is acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/the-church-in-parliament/briefing-bills/succession-to-the-crown-bill.aspx |title=Church of England Briefing – Succession to the Crown Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, the ''Telegraph'' reported that the Church of England had written to MPs to express its official backing for the proposed changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9816620/Nick-Clegg-urges-equal-rights-for-royal-girls-as-MPs-prepare-to-debate-rules-of-succession.html |title=Nick Clegg urges 'equal rights' for royal girls as MPs prepare to debate rules of succession |publisher=The Telegraph |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Commons===
A report on the rules of royal succession was prepared by the [[Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], chaired by [[Graham Allen (politician)|Graham Allen]], and was published in December 2011. The report welcomed the proposals, but drew attention to "connected issues that may be raised when the proposals are debated, depending on the scope of the bill, especially the future role of the Crown in the Church of England, and the continued ineligibility of women to succeed to the majority of [[hereditary peerage]]s, which remains a matter of public interest for as long as it has an impact on gender balance in the House of Lords".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpolcon/1615/1615.pdf House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, ''Rules of Royal Succession: Eleventh Report of Session 2010–12'', 7 December 2011]. Retrieved 3 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2012, the British government published a response to the report, reiterating that it intended to implement the [[Perth Agreement]] but had no plans to change the laws of succession to peerages or the established status of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;''Rules of Royal Succession: Government Response to the Committee's Eleventh Report of Session 2010–12''. Mark Harper MP, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
On 21 January 2013, the House of Lords Constitution Committee published a report opposing the Government's plan to fast-track the bill, citing the legislation's "constitutional significance" and "possible unintended consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/ldconst/106/10603.htm |title=11th Report: The Succession to the Crown Bill |author=Constitution Committee |publisher=House of Lords}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the Government expanded the time allocated for the bill's debate in the House of Commons from one day to two days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= United Kingdom| url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012253000001| house= House of Commons| date= 22 January 2013| column= 201|title=Succession to the Crown Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it decided not to fast-track the bill in the House of Lords, where the normal time limits were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= United Kingdom| url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm| house= House of Lords| date= 14 February 2013| column= 829|title=Succession to the Crown Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Takahashi Ujibumi'''''|高橋氏文|}} is a historical clan record of the Takahashi clan. It served as an appeal for court arbitration between two fighting clans.

The author(s) is unknown, but the contents suggest that it was composed prior to 789. The text only survives today in fragments quoted in other texts such as {{Nihongo|''Honchō Gatsuryō''|本朝月令||extra=c. 930-946}}, {{Nihongo|''Seiji Yōryaku''|政事要略||extra=1002}}, and {{Nihongo|''Nenjū Gyōji Hishō''|年中行事秘抄||}}.

Both the Takahashi and Azumi clans served in the [[Royal Table Office]]. Conflict between the two clans erupted with many conflicts occurring after 716. Seeking arbitration and a resolution to the conflict, both clans submitted their clan records to the imperial court. This is the Takahashi record; the Azumi clan record is unknown.

==Contents==

Pieced together, the text consists of three major sections:
*Takahashi clan ancestor Iwakamutsukari no Mikoto served [[Emperor Keikō]] meals and received the title "Kashiwade" (chief).
*The imperial proclamation after Iwakamutsukari died.
*A record of the 792 arbitration by the [[Daijō-kan|Department of State]] regarding the conflicts between the two clans.

==Value==

The text is highly valued as the oldest existing clan record. In addition, the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720) makes reference to the Kashiwade clan,&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Tarō ''et al.'' (1965). ''Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei: Nihon Shoki,'' p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; a title bestowed up the Takahashi clan. This suggests the possibility that the Takahashi clan record, at least in part, was used as a reference in compiling ''Nihon Shoki'' while also suggesting that parts of it may be even older.

Linguistically, the text includes a number of passages utilizing the archaic [[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai]] spellings. However, there are some inconsistencies which indicate that parts of it date to a late 8th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">The discovery of [[tetracycline]] engendered an enormous amount of litigation.  In late 1958, the U.S. government charged [[Pfizer]] and [[American Cyanamid]] with price fixing in connection with tetracycline. &lt;ref&gt; “Government: Dissent on the Wonder Drugs,” Aug. 11, 1958, 	http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825466,00.html and Pub Policy: Pricing Fixing.&lt;/ref&gt; That and other related litigation lasted until 1982.  Often, the series of cases is referred to as the “antibiotics litigation.”

==Background==

The focal point of the case was the two companies’ settlement of an interference proceeding before the PTO (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) over the priority of their respective applications for tetracycline.  Under the settlement, American Cyanamid, which had acquired Heyden Chemicals‘s pending tetracycline application, conceded the priority of Pfizer’s application, withdrew its own application and exchanged cross licenses with Pfizer. According to the indictment of American Cyanamid,  Bristol Myers, Pfizer, and Cyanamid knew that tetracycline represented a threat to the continuation of their dominant positions and unreasonably high profits. To keep that threat in check, the indictment alleges, Cyanamid bought out Heyden's rights to the development and agreed to help Pfizer get the tetracycline patent. In return, charges the Justice Department. Pfizer licensed Cyanamid to produce the drug.  Later, to avoid a court fight that might have nullified the patent, Pfizer and Cyanamid let Bristol-Myers in. &lt;ref&gt; “Public Policy: Antitrust and &amp; Antibiotics, August 25, 1961. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895666,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Trade Commission found that the cross-license, combined with the fact that Pfizer had withheld information that it knew or should have known was relevant to the patentability of tetracycline, constituted an attempt by Pfizer and American Cyanamid to share in an unlawful monopoly. &lt;ref&gt; Cacciapaglia and Rockman, “Proposed Drug Industry Antitrust Act--Patents, Pricing, and the Public “ 30 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 875, 894 (1961-1962); Kennedy, “Patent and Antitrust Policy--Acquisition of Patents by Fraud or by Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices,” 35 George Washington Law Review 512, 531 (1966-1967)
 For an early discussion, see Costello, “The Tetracycline Conspiracy: Structure, Conduct and Performance in the Drug Industry,” Antitrust L. &amp; Economic Rev. 12 (1967-1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the government lost. &lt;ref&gt; State of North Carolina v. Chas Pfizer &amp; Co Inc.  537 F. 2d 67 (4th Cir. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also sought to cancel the Pfizer patent on tetracycline, alleging fraud and the concealment of information that would have been relevant to the patent examiner. The government lost the final appeal of that case in 1982. &lt;ref&gt; U.S.  v. Pfizer,, 676 F.2d 51 (1982).  &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">'''Valuation using the Market Penetration Model''' ('''MPM''') or the growth potential of a company&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | authorlink =  | title = The Business Value Myth | publisher = Canopy Law Books | series = | year = 2012  | doi =   | url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Business-Value-Myth-ebook/dp/B009XB91CU  | asin = B009XB91CU }}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of estimating the value of a company by calculating the depth of its [[market penetration]] as evidenced by its [[customer base]] and industry niche.

The process consists of:

* profiling a company's type of customer and analysing which complementary companies share these customers.&lt;ref&gt;How to sell your business for maximum value: Part 1 http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=12&lt;/ref&gt;
* valuing the barriers to entry into the industry niche that the company operates in.

== Valuation overview ==

The Market Penetration Model focuses on the synergy and opportunities for fast growth between the target company and the acquiring company. It prioritises ability to exploit future customer opportunities over previous financial performance.&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

Many of the [[web 2.0]] start up successes are valued using this method, due to the perceived value of customer attention over past profit.&lt;ref&gt;How the sale of Instagram shows that the value of a business is not based on profit http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages/disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===

MPM has some advantages over other valuation methods:

* Values intangible factors: such as customer attention, which are not otherwise reflected in financial data.
* Modern: MPM is relevant to web based businesses whose value is not accurately portrayed in financial figures and hard assets.

=== Disadvantages ===

The main criticisms can be summarised as:

* Intangible: the assessment of the value of particular customer segmentation and industry niches is highly subjective.
* Reliance on competition between buyers: a buyer will not need to pay a premium for future growth potential if there is no competitive bidding process.

== Examples ==

[[Facebook]]'s purchase of [[Instagram]] was based on MPM.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/04/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/ |title=Facebook Buys Instagram for $1 Billion |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |first=Joanna |last=Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instagram]] was a relatively small company, employing 13 programmers and was just two years old at the time of the sale. It had no revenue, but was initially valued at $1 billion on account of it highly desirable customer base ([[social media]] fanatics, [[smart phone]] users) and its attractive industry niche (smart phone space).

Several other high-profile tech companies have had a valuation based on MPM including: [[Google]]'s purchase of Snapseed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/17/3346182/google-acquires-snapseed-nik-software|title=Google takes on Instagram and Facebook by acquiring top iOS photo app Snapseed|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Money Supermarket's purchase of MoneySavingExpert.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/site/2012/06/moneysavingexpertcom-to-join-the-moneysupermarketcom-group|title=MoneySavingExpert.com to join the MoneySupermarket.com group|publisher=MoneySavingExpert.com|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($120million).

A '''vehicle-ramming attack''' is a form of [[mass murder]] in which a perpetrator deliberately [[Ramming|rams]] a [[motor vehicle]] into a building, crowd of people,&lt;ref name="ufouo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Issued 13 December 2012|title=Department of Homeland Security-FBI Warning: Terrorist Use of Vehicle Ramming Tactics|url=https://publicintelligence.net/ufouo-dhs-fbi-warning-terrorist-use-of-vehicle-ramming-tactics/|publisher=FBI and Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=6 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028004254/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140721-gaza-strip-tunnels-israel-hamas-palestinians/|archivedate=28 October 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapoport2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=David C.

The earliest known use of a vehicle-ramming attack took place in 1973 in [[Prague]], former [[Czechoslovakia]], when [[Olga Hepnarová]] killed 8 people. According to [[Stratfor]] Global Intelligence analysts, this attack represented a new militant tactic which is less lethal but could prove more difficult to prevent than [[suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="stratfor"/&gt;

Simon &amp; Liza H. Gold), pp. 551-52: "An automobile is a potentially lethal machine. Litigation involving psychiatrists has resulted when a hospitalized patient, after discharges, caused a two-person vehicle accident with death or injuries to one or more victims ... Such cases involve three different types of scenarios. One is the vehicular crash that results from the patient's medication-induced drowsiness at the wheel ... The second scenario is a true accident but is unrelated to any prescribed medication. Rather, the patient's driving is impaired by the disabling effects of mental illness [or] recent consumption of nonprescribed drugs or alcohol. The third situation is when the patient deliberately crashes into another vehicle. Neuropsychiatric conditions that can be associated with an increased risk of vehicular crash include psychotic exacerbation of schizophrenia, profound or suicidal depression, dementia, and disturbances in consciousness, such as epilepsy and narcolepsy."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Accidental vehicle ramming causing multiple deaths or injuries to pedestrians or others also occurs, although rarely.&lt;ref name="nolorare"/&gt; Causes of such accidental mass-casualty vehicular ramming include [[drunk driving|drunk]] and [[drug–impaired driving]] or driver error by elderly drivers.&lt;ref name="Felthouse"/&gt; See also [[sudden unintended acceleration]].&lt;ref name="nolorare"/&gt;}}

Vehicles have also been used by attackers to breach buildings with locked gates, before detonating explosives, as in the [[Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack]].

==Causes propelling the rise of the tactic==
According to the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the tactic has gained popularity because "Vehicle ramming offers terrorists with limited access to explosives or weapons an opportunity to conduct a homeland attack with minimal prior training or experience."&lt;ref name=ufouo/&gt; Counterterrorism researcher [[Daveed Gartenstein-Ross]] of the [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]] told ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' that the tactic has been on the rise in [[Israel]] because, "[[Israeli West Bank barrier|the security barrier]] is fairly effective, which makes it hard to get bombs into the country."&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/11/05/car_attack_in_jerusalem_why_are_terrorists_ramming_vehicles_into_crowds.html|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=Slate|date=5 November 2014|title=Why Terrorists Use Vehicles as Weapons|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106024619/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/11/05/car_attack_in_jerusalem_why_are_terrorists_ramming_vehicles_into_crowds.html|deadurl=no|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', the online, English-language magazine produced by [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] urged mujahideen to choose "pedestrian only" locations and make sure to gain speed before ramming their vehicles into the crowd in order to "achieve maximum carnage".&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;

Vehicle attacks can be carried out by [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf terrorists]] who are inspired by an ideology, but who are not actually working within a specific political movement or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daly|first1=Brian|title=Lone wolf terrorists hard to stop|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/10/21/soldier-dead-after-radicalized-quebec-man-ran-him-down-with-a-car|accessdate=6 November 2014|agency=[[Québecor Média|QMI]]|publisher=Edmonton Sun|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', Jacob Siegel suggests that the perpetrator of [[2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack|the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack]] may be "the kind of terrorist the West could be seeing a lot more of in the future", a kind that he describes, following Brian Jenkins of the [[Rand Corporation]], as "stray dogs", rather than [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]], characterizing them as "misfits" who are "moved from seething anger to spontaneous deadly action" by exposure to [[Islamist]] propaganda.&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Jacob|title=Lone Wolves, Terrorist Runts, and the Stray Dogs of ISIS Why ISIS and al Qaeda rely on loners and losers to carry out their terrorist agenda in the West|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html|accessdate=7 November 2014|work=[[Daily Beast]]|date=24 October 2014|deadurl=no|archivedate=7 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107133653/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 propaganda video by [[ISIL]] encouraged French sympathizers to use cars to run down civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-al-qaeda-car-attacks-nice-france-2016-7|title=ISIS and Al Qaeda have specifically called for the type of attack that just happened in France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Clint Watts]], of the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]], where he is a senior fellow and expert on terrorism, the older model where members of groups like [[al-Qaeda]] would "plan and train together before going to carry out an attack, became defunct around 2005", due to increased surveillance by Western security agencies.&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"/&gt; Watts says that [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], the American born al-Qaeda [[imam]], as a key figure in this shift, addressing English-speakers in their own language and urging them to "Do your own terrorism and stay in place."&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"/&gt;

Jamie Bartlett, who heads the Violence and Extremism Program at [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], a British think tank, explains that "the internet in the last few years has both increased the possibilities and the likelihood of lone-wolf terrorism," supplying isolated individuals with ideological motivation and technique.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bajekal|first1=Naina|title=The Rise of the Lone Wolf Terrorist|url=http://time.com/3533581/canada-ottawa-shooting-lone-wolf-terrorism/|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=23 October 2014|deadurl=no|archivedate=14 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114150324/http://time.com/3533581/canada-ottawa-shooting-lone-wolf-terrorism/|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For authorities in Western countries, the difficulty is that even in a case like that of the perpetrator of the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack, where Canadian police had identified the attacker, taken away his passport, and were working with his family and community to steer him away from [[jihad]], vehicle attacks can be hard to prevent because, "it's very difficult to know exactly what an individual is planning to do before a crime is committed. We cannot arrest someone for thinking radical thoughts; it's not a crime in Canada."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mataconis|first1=Doug|title=The attack on Canada's Parliament and the 'lone wolf' terrorist|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Voices/2014/1023/The-attack-on-Canada-s-Parliament-and-the-lone-wolf-terrorist|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=23 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106160115/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Voices/2014/1023/The-attack-on-Canada-s-Parliament-and-the-lone-wolf-terrorist|archivedate=6 November 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stratfor]], the American global intelligence firm, "while not thus far as deadly as [[suicide bombing]]", this tactic could prove more difficult to prevent. No single group has claimed responsibility for the incidents.&lt;ref name=stratfor&gt;Israel: Vehicle Attacks – A New Militant Tactic?.

Vehicular ramming has sometimes been advocated as a means to deal with [[protester]]s who block public roadways in the United States. Two police officers were suspended and fired in January and June 2016, respectively, for tweeting such advice in relation to [[Black Lives Matter]] rallies, which have sometimes been broken up by cars. [[North Dakota]] state legislator [[Keith Kempenich]] tried and failed to pass a law granting civil immunity to drivers who accidentally hit activists, after his mother-in-law was stopped by [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|Dakota Access Pipeline protesters]], and [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Bill Ketron]] did likewise after a man hit an [[Protests against Donald Trump|anti-Trump]] group.

On 23 October 2014, the US [[National Institute of Building Sciences]] updated its Building Design Guideline on ''Crash- and Attack-Resistant Models'' of [[bollard]]s, a guideline written to help professionals design bollards to protect facilities from vehicle operators, "who plan or carry out acts of property destruction, incite terrorism, or cause the deaths of civilian, industrial or military populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oakes|first=Charles|title=The Bollard: Crash- and Attack-Resistant Models|journal=Whole Building Design Guide, National Institute of Building Sciences|date=23 October 2014|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/bollard_arm.php|accessdate=7 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107170018/http://www.wbdg.org/resources/bollard_arm.php|archivedate=7 November 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Bar Association]] recommends bollards as effective protection against car ramming attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest B.
