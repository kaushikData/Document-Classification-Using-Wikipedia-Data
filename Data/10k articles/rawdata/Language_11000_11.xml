'''Active shooter''' or '''active killer''' names the perpetrator of a type of [[mass murder]] marked by rapidity, scale, randomness, and often suicide. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines an ''active shooter'' as "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims."&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf |format=PDF |work=Active Shooter Booklet |title= U.S. Department of Homeland Security Active Shooter Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most incidents occur at locations in which the killers find little impediment in pressing their attack. Locations are generally described as ''soft targets'', that is, they carry limited security measures to protect members of the public. In most instances, shooters commit suicide, are shot by police, or surrender when confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, and active shooter events are often over in 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="dhs"/&gt; According to [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) statistics, 46{{nbsp}}percent of active shooter incidents are ended by the application of force by police or security, 40{{nbsp}}percent end in the shooter's suicide, 14{{nbsp}}percent of the time the shooter surrenders and, in less than 1{{nbsp}}percent of cases, the violence ends with the attacker fleeing.&lt;ref name="The Active Shooter Threat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msasecurity.net/Portals/91068/docs/MSA%20Special%20Analysis%20-%20Active%20Shooter%20Threat%208.20.12.pdf |format=PDF |work=MSA Special Analysis |title= The Active Shooter Threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
In police training manuals, the police response to an active shooter scenario is different from [[hostage]] rescue and barricaded suspect situations.&lt;ref&gt;https://info.publicintelligence.net/LAactiveshootertactics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbrt.lsu.edu/images/news/tacticalmagazine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers responding to an armed barricaded suspect often deploy with the intention of containing the suspect within a perimeter, gaining information about the situation, attempting negotiation with the suspect, and waiting for specialist teams like [[SWAT]].

If police officers believe that a gunman intends to kill as many people as possible before committing suicide, they may use a tactic like [[Immediate Action Rapid Deployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=240814|title=Abstracts Database - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/fs-fd/iard-drai-eng.htm|title=Immediate Action Rapid Deployment (IARD) Program|first=Government of Canada, RCMP, Public Affairs and Communication Services Directorate, Corporate|last=Communications|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology "active shooter" is critiqued by some academics. There have been several mass stabbings that have high casualty counts, for instance in Belgium ([[Dendermonde nursery attack]]), Canada ([[2014 Calgary stabbing]]), China ([[2008 Beijing Drum Tower stabbings]]), Japan ([[Osaka School Massacre]] and [[Sagamihara stabbings]]), and Pennsylvania ([[Franklin Regional High School stabbing]]). Ron Borsch recommends the phrase "rapid mass murder". Due to a worldwide increase in firearm and non-firearm based Mass Casualty Attacks (including attacks with [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicles]], [[Improvised explosive device|explosives]], [[incendiary device]]s, [[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|stabbings]], [[Slashing (crime)|slashing]], [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]]), Dr. Tau Braun and the Violence Prevention Agency (VPA) has encouraged the use of the more accurate descriptor Mass Casualty Attacker (MCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eventscribe.com/2016/NACCHOSummit/QRcode.asp?Pres=134403|title=2016 Preparedness Summit|website=eventscribe.com|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical implications ==
Active shooters do not negotiate, killing as many people as possible, often to gain notoriety. Active shooters generally do not lie in wait to battle responding law enforcement officers. Few law enforcement officers have been injured responding to active shooter incidents; fewer still have been killed.&lt;ref name="Borsch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ron |first1=Borsch |title=Solo Officer Entry for Active Shooters: Ron Borsch Q&amp;A Part 1 |url=http://www.spartancops.com/solo-officer-entry-active-shooters-ron-borsch-qa-part-1/ |website=Spartan Cops |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403072901/http://www.spartancops.com/solo-officer-entry-active-shooters-ron-borsch-qa-part-1/ |archivedate=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted, more often than not, when the prospect of confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, the active shooter commits suicide. And when civilians—even unarmed civilians—resist, the active shooter crumbles.

Borsch's statistical analysis recommends a tactic: aggressive action. For law enforcement, the tactical imperative is to respond and engage the killer without delay{{nsmdns}}the affected [[orthodoxy]] of cumbersome team formations fails to answer the rapid temporal dynamics of active shooter events and fails to grasp the nature of the threat involved. For civilians, when necessity or obligation calls, the tactical mandate is to attack the attacker—a strategy that has proved successful across a range of incidents from Norina Bentzel ([[William Michael Stankewicz]]) in Pennsylvania and Bill Badger in Arizona ([[2011 Tucson shooting]]) to David Benke in Colorado.

== Taxonomy ==
{{original research|date=May 2018}}
The active shooter incidents do not always meet the classification of a mass murder.  Mass murders result when three or more individuals are killed. The definition of an active shooter does not require that victims are killed, only that they are injured or wounded by the act.  Not all mass murderers are active shooters. Noting the similarities and differences among several types of mass murder will help to isolate and define what is meant by the term "active shooter".

Mass murderers defy traditional criminal categorization. The goal of the mass murderer is neither to defend nor appropriate turf or territory, neither to initiate himself into nor elevate his status within a criminal organization. The mass murderer does not kill for drugs or money. The [[serial killer]] is one kind of mass murderer. He claims many lives in multiple events across time. The events are discontinuous, punctuated by "a cooling-off period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last1=Morton|editor-first1=R. |title=Serial Murder: Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives for Investigators|journal=Federal Bureau of Investigation|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the active shooter claims many lives in a single event along a compressed frame of time. In practice, this appears to carry a corollary: broadly, the serial killer seeks anonymity; the active shooter, notoriety. Repetition through multiple events across time answers the pathology of the serial killer. Savage as they are, his acts are not designed to excite publicity. The serial killer will conceal a corpse or bury evidence. He wants to kill again. By contrast, the active shooter seeks infamy through slaughter. He means to fuse his name forever to a place, a date, an event. Thus, his acts are designed to maximize publicity. Accordingly, he (generally) plans no escape.

The serial killer murders at close quarters, delighting in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. In his distorted estimation, his victims "mean" something to him, and he may secure keepsakes from victims to memorialize the "relationship". The active shooter also murders at close quarters. He delights in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. Crucially, however, while the victims of the serial killer "mean" something to him, to the active shooter they mean nothing. The active shooter moves rapidly from one victim to the next.

Modell speculates that the contrast is rooted in the peculiar form of abuse each suffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modell|first1=Daniel|title=The Psychology of the Active Killer|journal=Law Enforcement Executive Forum|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serial killer is a victim of physical/sexual/emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=DeBecker&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeBecker|first1=Gavin|title=The Gift of Fear|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such abuse is administered at length, over time, by those who, by relation or connection, should care for the abused. The serial killer, after a manner, models this behavior. The active shooter is a victim of bullying.&lt;ref name=Vossekuil&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vossekuil|first1=B.|last2=Fein|first2=R.|last3=Reddy|first3=M.|last4=Borum|first4=R.|last5=Modzeleski|first5=W.|title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative|journal=US Secret Service and US Department of Education|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though bullying may persist over time, it is delivered in discrete, relatively short-lived acts, often by multiple actors with no special relation or connection to the abused. The active shooter, after a manner, models this behavior.

A portrait of the active shooter may be sharpened by contrasting him with another type of mass murderer, the ideological killer.  The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] exemplifies the type: in 1995, a man with ties to a disorganized [[militia]] movement detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and the resulting blast ended 168{{nbsp}}lives while wounding{{nbsp}}680.

The ideological killer is driven by adherence to ethico-political or religious orthodoxy. His actions are an expression of that orthodoxy. By contrast, while the active shooter may conceive of himself as "making a statement" of sorts, his motives appear more personal and desultory.

Like the active shooter, the ideological killer plans multiple murders within the confines of a single event. But the active shooter seeks to experience the horror of his victims at close quarters. The ideological killer does not. He kills at a distance. He plants explosive devices or takes up position as a sniper. Killing at a distance suits his primary motive—the expression of adherence to an abstract orthodoxy. For the ideological killer, victims are of incidental significance. He need not "know" them, as the serial killer must, nor experience their horror, as the active shooter must. For the ideological killer, abstraction is reality, the individual but a construct in an interminable struggle of dogmas.

Since he is motivated by adherence to orthodoxy, the ideological killer typically seeks notoriety for his cause through carnage. While the active shooter too seeks notoriety, and while he too maps a careful plan of the event, there is a crucial difference in the pursuit. The ideological killer generally means to elude capture, to live beyond the event (as does the serial killer). The active shooter merges his identity with the event and sees nothing beyond.

Integrating the elements elicited by comparison and contrast, the "active shooter (killer)" may be defined as a mass murderer who kills (or attempts to kill) at close-quarters, in multiples, at random in a single, planned event.

== Causation ==

Accounts of why active shooters do what they do vary. Some contend that the motive, at least proximately, is vengeance.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGee |first1=J.P. |last2=DeBernardo |first2=C.R. |title=The Classroom Avenger |url=http://www.sheppardpratt.org/Documents/classavenger.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030111558/https://www.sheppardpratt.org/Documents/classavenger.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that bullying breeds the problem, and sometimes the active shooter is a victim of bullying, directly or derivatively.&lt;ref name=Vossekuil /&gt; Still others such as Grossman and DeGaetano argue that the pervasiveness of violent imagery girding modern culture hosts the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=D.|last2=DeGaetano|first2=G.|title=Stop Teaching our Kids to Kill|date=1999|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that a particular interpretation of the world, a conscious or subconscious ontology, accounts for the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Modell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modell|first1=Daniel|title=The Psychology of the Active Killer|journal=Law Enforcement Executive Forum|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the active shooter lives in a world of victims and victimizers, that [[splitting (psychology)|all are one or the other]]. The ontology accommodates no nuance, no room between the categories for benevolence, friendship, decency, nor indeed, for a mixture of good and bad. His interpretation of the world may grow out of or be fed by bullying or violent imagery (hence the common obsession with violent movies, books or video games), but it is the absolutist interpretation of his world that drives him both to kill and to die.

In ''The Psychology of the Active Killer'', [[Daniel Modell]] writes that "The world conceived by the active killer is a dark dialectic of victim and victimizer. His impoverished [[ontology]] brooks no nuance, admits no resolution. The [[false dichotomy|two categories]], isolated and absolute, exhaust and explain his world. And the peculiar logic driving the dialectic yields a fatal inference: in a world of victims and victimizers, success means victimization."&lt;ref name=Modell /&gt;

Many government installations, businesses, campuses have camera and sensor based security systems, some analog and, more recently, digital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some also include formal Command Centers or at least are monitored by personnel in any organization.{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}  These provide very good forensic support in documenting an active shooter. However they offer only mixed results in the timely interdiction of an active shooter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Alfred Wright''' (1788–1853) was born in Connecticut in 1788. His parents could not afford to send him to school, so he worked on the family farm until he was 17 years old and could support his own education. He studied medicine at Williams College, then studied theology at Andover Seminary. After graduating from Andover, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. Soon, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent him to establish missions for the Choctaw tribe in Mississippi, where he met and married Harriet Bunce. 

In 1831, all mission activity ceased while the Choctaws fulfilled an agreement with the United States government to sell their Mississippi homeland and relocate to Indian Territory (the present state of Oklahoma). Late in 1832, the Wrights decided to locate a new mission near present-day Eagletown, Oklahoma. From then until 1846, they built and operated a church and a school to minister to Choctaws living in the surrounding area. Wright named the mission Wheelock, in honor of Eleazar Wheelock, a friend and first president of Dartmouth College.

Trained in medicine, Alfred Wright often needed to tend Choctaw patients who lived some distance from the mission. Harriet took on both teaching and administrative duties for the school, with only one other teacher to assist her. When Alfred was at the mission, he was often busy either preparing sermons or translating religious texts from English to the Choctaw language. Moreover, his physical health was compromised by illnesses through much of his life. Attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, but he maintained a hectic pace as much as possible. He died on March 31, 1853, and was buried near the mission. Harriet tried to keep the mission going throughout the next year, but soon found her own health was failing. She returned to the East to live with members of her own family, and died in Florida in 1863.

==Early life and education==
Alfred Wright was born in [[Columbia, Connecticut]] on March 1, 1788. His parents were Jeriah (1788-1828) and Temperance (d. 1832) Wright, who were both professors of religion. The family owned a small farm and had eleven children, so could not afford to send Alfred to school. Instead he worked on the family farm until the age of seventeen. By then, he decided to earn his own education. His parents consented to his enrolling in Bacon Academy in Colchester, Massachusetts. Despite his frail health, he was also able to obtain a job teaching school part-time. He enrolled at [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] in 1810. Although he initially intended to study medicine and become a doctor, before he finished at Williams, he felt the call to study theology. After graduating from Williams College in September, 1812, he was employed as a [[preceptor]] of an academy at [[Hadley, Massachusetts]] until November, 1813, when he enrolled at [[Andover Seminary]].&lt;ref name="AndoverTS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GdkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Alfred Wright." In:''Memoirs of American Missionaries formerly connected with the Society of Inquiry Respecting Missions in the Andover Theological Seminary''. Published by Pierce and Parker. Boston. 1833.] Available on Google Books. pp. 162-164. Accessed October 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination and start of missionary career==
Alfred was ordained as a Presbyterian minister at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on December 17, 1819.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Pittman"&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=WR003 Pittman, Kitty. "Wright, Alfred (1788-1853). ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.] Accessed October 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his ordination, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] assigned him to establish a Presbyterian mission with the Choctaws in [[Goshen, Mississippi]]{{efn|No information found about a community with this name. Possibly the source refers to present day [[Goshen Springs, Mississippi|Goshen Springs]] in [[Rankin County, Mississippi]].}} where he remained until 1823, when he was sent to the [[Mayhew Mission]].&lt;ref name="EOHC-Pittman"/&gt; While at Mayhew, Alfred met Harriet Bunce (1779-1863).&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt; They married in 1825.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Pittman"/&gt;

In 1826, Alfred's sister and two of his brothers died of [[typhus]]. Their father contracted the same disease, but his case was not fatal.&lt;ref name="AndoverTS"/&gt; 

===Move to Indian Territory===
All mission operations ceased in 1831, as the inhabitants of the Choctaw Nation were required to move to their newly designated land in Indian Territory (present-day Southeastern Oklahoma). Alfred and Harriet, along with another missionary, Rev. Loring S. Williams, joined a group of Choctaws led by Thomas LeFlore to make the trip. The party did not reach Indian Territory until September 14, 1832, where they stopped overnight at the Bethabara Mission, near the community of Eagle (now known as [[Eagletown, Oklahoma]], in present-day [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]]. Alfred had taken ill again, and could not continue to travel the next day.{{efn|Alfred was never in robust health. He had a chronic heart condition and also suffered from malaria and [[bursitis]].&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt;}} Deciding to remain at Bethabara Mission, he told Harriet to go ahead with the rest of the party, and he would catch up with them later. The McCurtain party moved out as planned along the Military Trace toward [[Fort Towson]]. After the group crossed what is now called the [[Little River (Red River tributary)|Little River]] (known to the Choctaws as ''Boklusa'' or "Black River"), they found a piece of land about a mile beyond the river and above the flood level, which also had a spring flowing generously with cold water. Harriet decided to camp there with Anna and other travelers who wished to stay with her. The others helped Harriet build a cabin. This would become the site for the Wright's mission.&lt;ref name= "Green"&gt;[https://mike-boucher.com/wordpress/?page_id=247 Green, Len. "Wheeler Academy" Mike Boucher's Web Page. 1979.] Accessed October 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the first Wheelock School===
Alfred recovered slowly, and finally caught up with Harriet and her companions in late November, 1832. He conducted his first service at the new site on December 9, 1832. Since there was no church building yet, the service was held outdoors under a large oak tree. The congregation sat on logs that had been arranged in rows, and Rev. Wright used an empty 100 gallon barrel, turned upside down, as his pulpit.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt; Concurrently, the Wright party decided to build a small log church and a larger log house for the family. Harriet insisted that a large room be attached to the house to serve as a day school.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt;{{efn|Since no one else at the mission was trained in medicine, Alfred frequently had to be absent, either to preach or to heal the sick. Thus Harriet became responsible for operating the school, assisted by Anna Burnham.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt;}} Rev. Wright decided to name the new mission church and school Wheelock, in honor of [[Eleazar Wheelock]], who was not only a friend of Alfred, but, years later, also the first president of [[Dartmouth College]].&lt;ref name="EOHC-Pittman"/&gt;

===Conversion to boarding school===
The day school operated until 1839. By then, Harriet realized that this mode was failing to enough Choctaw children who needed and wanted to pursue an education. She persuaded Alfred that Wheelock should become a boarding school because many of the potential students lived at such a distance that it was impractical to attend daily classes on foot. In bad weather, travel became nearly impossible, even on horseback. A log dormitory building was erected in 1839, then expanded over the next three years. A separate classroom building was also built. Instead of paying tuition, the children performed many of the chores need to operate the school: cooking, cleaning, providing firewood, etc. Class time was devoted to learning English, arithmetic, reading, writing and studying the Bible. In 1842, the Choctaw Nation adopted Wheelock into its school system, designating it as Wheelock Seminary, a school exclusively devoted to teaching Choctaw girls.{{efn|A similar school for boys was built at Clear Creek, but later moved about two miles from Wheelock and renamed Norwalk Academy.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt; }}

===Rock Church===
Rev. Wright began building a new Wheelock Rock Church in 1845. Stones were dragged by from the banks of Little River by teams of oxen. These were used to make the church walls {{convert|20|inch|mm}} thick. The floor and belfry were made from cypress wood and the roof was covered with sun-cured oak shakes. Wright carved a slogan, "Jehovah Jireh" (meaning "the Lord will provide") into the gable of the church. Rev. Wright delivered the first sermon in the new church during the late spring or early summer of 1846.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt;

==Deaths of Alfred and Harriet==
Rev. Alfred Wright's attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, yet he persisted in maintaining a hectic pace. He died on March 31, 1853, and was buried very near Wheelock church. Harriet tried to keep on with the school during 1854, but found her own health failing rapidly by the end of the school year. She went back east to live the rest with members of her own family, and died on October 3, 1863 in Madison, Florida.&lt;ref name= "Green"/&gt;

An '''alumni magazine''' is a [[magazine]] published by a [[university]], [[college]], or other school or by an [[Alumni association|association of a school's alumni]] (and sometimes current students) in order to keep alumni abreast of fellow alumni and news of their university, often with an implicit goal of [[Fundraising#Relationship building|fundraising]].

An emerging version of alumni magazines are unrelated to educational institutions. Instead the intended readers are former employees of a company. An example of this type of alumni magazine is ''MoForever'' magazine of the [[law firm]] of [[Morrison &amp; Foerster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agendanyc.com/work/morrison-foerster-mofo-alumni-magazine|title=Morrison-Foerster-(MoFo) alumni magazine|website=agendanyc.com|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="Note"|The emerging type of alumni magazines for former employees of a company should not be confused with any fictional alumni magazines whose intended readers are former customers of the company (for example, the ''Flown'' magazine, with former passengers of [[Delta Air Lines]] as the target readership, as reported in [[Satire|satirical]] [[newspaper]] ''[[The Onion]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theonion.com/article/delta-launches-alumni-magazine-for-people-who-flew-36639|title=Delta Launches Alumni Magazine For People Who Flew Airline Previously|newspaper=[[The Onion]]|location=Chicago|date=7 Aug 2014|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The oldest alumni magazine in the [[United States]] is ''[[Yale Alumni Magazine]]'', founded in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/about-us|title=About Us|website=yalealumnimagazine.com|publisher=[[Yale University]]|location=New Haven, Connecticut|accessdate=27 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of alumni magazines==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">'''Batticaloa Tamil dialect''' ({{Lang-ta|மட்டக்களப்புப் பேச்சுத் தமிழ்}}) is one of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects]], which uses in Eastern provinces [[Batticaloa Territory|Batti - Ampara]] districts of Sri Lanka. Batticaloa Tamil dialect slightly differs from other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects such as Jaffna Tamil dialect, Negombo Tamil dialect, Estate Tamil dialects, Colombo, Trincomalee &amp; Vanni Tamil dialects. 

Batticaloa Tamil dialect has the unique feature. Even though, it has inner different. Commonly, the village dialect slightly differ from urban &amp; suburb dialect, which is amalgamated with significant numbers of [[English language|English]] words.  

Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamils]], [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]], [[Vedar|Veddhas]] and [[Portuguese Burghers]] in the eastern province. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the [[Trincomalee]] district has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.&lt;ref name=kuiper&gt; {{cite journal  | last = Kuiper  | first = L.B.J  | title = Note on Old Tamil and Jaffna Tamil   | journal = Indo-Iranian Journal  | volume = 6 | issue = 1  | pages = 52–64  | publisher = Springer Netherlands  | location =   | date = March 1964  | accessdate =  | doi = 10.1007/BF00157142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]] a [[linguist]], the Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary like of all spoken dialects of Tamil, and it has preserved  several very antique features, and  has remained more true to the literary norm than any other form of Tamil while developing  a few striking innovations. Although Batticaloa Tamil has some very specific features of vocabulary, it is classified with other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects as it is related to them by characteristic traits of its [[phonology]]. It also maintains some words that are unique to present day.&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, ''Folk traditionas and Songs...'', p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the dialect has less influence of [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanthru.com/2012/02/blog-post_05.html மட்டக்களப்பு மாநாட்டு நினைவு மலர்-1996 (பேராசிரியர் ஆ.வேலுப்பிள்ளை)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berta languages''', or '''Wetawit''', traditionally considered dialects of a single language, are [[Berta language|Gebeto]] (Berta proper), [[Fadashi language|Fadashi]], and [[Undu language|Undu]]. They are either a small family (or [[language isolate]]) of their own, or a primary branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] language family.

Berta has the typical word order [[subject–verb–object]].  It is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language.  It has significantly influenced some of the [[Eastern Jebel languages]].  The Arabic name "Beni-Shangul" (as in the Ethiopian province of [[Benishangul-Gumuz]]) derives from a Berta expression (with ''bele'' "rock/stone" misanalyzed as Arabic ''beni'' "sons").

A '''blockchain''',{{R|te20151031|fortune20160515|nyt20160521}} originally '''block chain''',{{R|primer|obmh}} is a growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked using [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name="te20151031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Narayanan|first1= Arvind|last2= Bonneau|first2= Joseph|last3= Felten|first3= Edward|last4= Miller|first4= Andrew|last5= Goldfeder|first5= Steven|title= Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction|date= 2016|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton|isbn= 978-0-691-17169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block contains a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt; a [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]], and transaction data (generally represented as a [[merkle tree]] root hash).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, [[distributed ledger]] that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;{{cite news |last= Iansiti |first= Marco |last2= Lakhani |first2= Karim R. |url= https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |title= The Truth About Blockchain |work= [[Harvard Business Review]] |publisher= [[Harvard University]] |date= January 2017 |accessdate =2017-01-17 |quote =The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. |deadurl= no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052537/https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |archivedate= 18 January 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For use as a distributed [[ledger]], a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network collectively adhering to a [[Protocol (communication)|protocol]] for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [[secure by design]] and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. [[Decentralized]] consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.&lt;ref name="decapp"&gt;{{cite book |title =Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |last =Raval |first=Siraj |year =2016 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |oclc =968277125 |isbn =978-1-4919-2452-5 |chapter =What Is a Decentralized Application? |chapter-url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} |pages =[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} 1]–[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =2|plainurl =yes}} 2] |url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl =yes}} |accessdate =6 November 2016 |via =Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockchain was invented by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 to serve as the public transaction [[ledger]] of the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]].{{R|te20151031}} The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the [[double-spending]] problem without the need of a trusted authority or central [[Server (computing)|server]]. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,{{R|te20151031|nyt20160521}} and blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by [[cryptocurrencies]]. Blockchain is considered a type of [[payment rail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailyfintech.com/2018/02/10/bitcoin-will-finally-disrupt-the-credit-card-rails/|title=Blockchain may finally disrupt payments from Micropayments to credit cards to SWIFT  |website=dailyfintech.com |date=2018-02-10 |accessdate=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as the ''Computerworld'' called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)]]
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haber|first1=Stuart|last2=Stornetta|first2=W. Scott|title=How to time-stamp a digital document|journal=Journal of Cryptology|date=January 1991|volume=3|issue=2|pages=99–111|doi=10.1007/bf00196791|citeseerx=10.1.1.46.8740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [[Merkle tree]]s to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bayer|first1=Dave|last2=Haber|first2=Stuart|last3=Stornetta|first3=W. Scott|title=Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping|journal=Sequences|date=March 1992|volume=2|pages=329–334|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-9323-8_24|isbn=978-1-4613-9325-2|citeseerx=10.1.1.71.4891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [[Hashcash]]-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.{{r|cryptocurrencytech}} The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [[bitcoin]], where it serves as the public [[ledger]] for all transactions on the network.{{R|te20151031}}

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20&amp;nbsp;GB ([[gigabyte]]s).&lt;ref name="hadi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |editor-last=Chuen |editor-first=David LEE Kuo |year=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802351-8 |chapter=A Light Touch of Regulation for Virtual Currencies |last1=Nian |first1=Lam Pak |last2=Chuen |first2=David LEE Kuo |page=319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30&amp;nbsp;GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50&amp;nbsp;GB to 100&amp;nbsp;GB in size.

The words ''block'' and ''chain'' were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, ''blockchain,'' by 2016.  The term ''blockchain 2.0'' refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with "a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level."{{R|te20151031}}

{{asof|2016}}, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to require an off-chain [[Oracle (computer science)|oracle]] to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions [that need] to interact with the blockchain."&lt;ref name=bletchleyWP201609&gt;[https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md Project Bletchley Whitepaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111135615/https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md |date=11 January 2017 }}, Microsoft, 2016-09-19.

According to [[Accenture]], an application of the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [[early adopter]]s phase.&lt;ref name="tfob"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |title=The future of blockchain in 8 charts |accessdate=3 December 2016 |date=27 June 2016 |work=Raconteur |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234125/http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |archivedate=2 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [[Chamber of Digital Commerce]].

In May 2018, [[Gartner]] found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/05/04/hype-killer-only-1-of-companies-are-using-blockchain-gartner-reports/|title=Hype Killer - Only 1% of Companies Are Using Blockchain, Gartner Reports {{!}} Artificial Lawyer|date=2018-05-04|work=Artificial Lawyer|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

A blockchain is a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]], [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved [[Storage_record|record]] cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.{{R|te20151031}}&lt;ref name="wired20161107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |title=Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108130946/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |archivedate=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Gans|first2=Joshua S.|date=23 November 2016|title=Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain|ssrn=2874598|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2874598|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [[peer-to-peer]] network and a distributed timestamping server.

The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [[Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility]] from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [[double spending]]. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |first=Kariappa |last=Bheemaiah |date=January 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.&lt;ref name="cbh"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |title=Can blockchain help the cards and payments industry? |first=Michele |last=Tucci |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=29 November 2015 |website=Tech in Asia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120304/https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain can maintain [[title (property)|title rights]] because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [[offer and acceptance]].

===Blocks===
Blocks hold batches of valid [[Transaction processing|transactions]] that are hashed and encoded into a [[Merkle tree]].&lt;ref name="te20151031"/&gt; Each block includes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.&lt;ref name=te20151031 /&gt; This [[Iteration|iterative]] process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt;

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time.  They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks.  Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially&lt;ref name="bsm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, in a blockchain using the [[proof-of-work system]], the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of [[computation]]. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and [[Parallel computing|parallel]] manner.&lt;ref name="permbloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |title=Permissioned Blockchains |website=Explainer |publisher=Monax |accessdate=20 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120154948/https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |archivedate=20 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Block time====
The ''block time'' is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-does-Block-Time-mean-in-cryptocurrency|title=What does "Block Time" mean in cryptocurrency?|author=Muhammad Ghayas|website=[[Quora]]|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.&lt;ref name="drd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |title=Disney Reveals Dragonchain, an Interoperable Ledger |first=Jamie |last=Redman |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=25 October 2016 |website=Bitcoin.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102001523/https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |archivedate=2 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|title=Why is Ethereum different to Bitcoin?|author=Antonio Madeira|website=CryptoCompare|date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072118/https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|archivedate=22 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hard forks ====
{{Transcluded section|Fork (blockchain)}}
{{trim|{{#section-h:Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}}}

=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad-hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}

Every [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [[Data quality]] is maintained by massive database [[Replication (computing)|replication]]&lt;ref name="decapp"/&gt; and [[computational trust]]. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.{{r|primer}} Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a [[Best-effort delivery|best-effort]] basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; add them to the block they are building, and then [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] the completed block to other nodes.{{R|t12|p=ch. 08}} Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as [[Proof-of-work system|proof-of-work]], to serialize changes.{{r|kopstein}} Alternative consensus methods include [[proof-of-stake]].&lt;ref name="hadc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |last=Bhaskar |first=Nirupama Devi |first2=David Lee Kuo |last2=Chuen |year=2015 |chapter=3 – Bitcoin Mining Technology |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802117-0 |pages=47–51 |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021170000035 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128021170 |url-access=subscription |via=ScienceDirect |editor-first=David Lee Kuo |editor-last=Cheun |accessdate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025155909/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128021170 |archivedate=25 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of [[Centrality|centralization]] because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervais|first1=Arthur|last2=Karame|first2=Ghassan O.|last3=Capkun|first3=Vedran|last4=Capkun|first4=Srdjan|title=Is Bitcoin a Decentralized Currency?|url=https://www.infoq.com/articles/is-bitcoin-a-decentralized-currency/|accessdate=11 October 2016|website=InfoQ|publisher=InfoQ &amp; IEEE computer society|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010042659/https://www.infoq.com/articles/is-bitcoin-a-decentralized-currency/|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more [[usability|user-friendly]] than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.&lt;ref name="tapscott201605" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarTech"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Permissionless ====
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt; This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt;

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [[Hashcash]] puzzles.  While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [[Adam Back]], the original idea was first proposed by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

Financial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.&lt;ref name="trtb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |title=The Road To Bitcoin Adoption Passes Through Many Stages |first=J.P. |last=Buntinx |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=1 May 2016 |website=News BTC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220062128/http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, [[venture capital]] investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.&lt;ref name="btt17"/&gt; Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. {{asof|2018|04}}, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====
{{main|Distributed ledger}}
Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.&lt;ref name="btit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |title=Blockchain: The Invisible Technology That's Changing the World |author=Bob Marvin |accessdate=25 September 2017 |date=30 August 2017 |newspaper=PC MAG Australia |publisher=ZiffDavis, LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925180800/http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |archivedate=25 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks "with private blockchains, independent of the public system."&lt;ref name=nyt20160327/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|title=Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum|first=Nathaniel|last=Popper|date=27 February 2017|via=''The New York Times''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620134100/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=this claim does not seem to make sense knowing that Ethereum blockchain is public, not private|date=September 2017}}

==== Disadvantages of private blockchain====
Nikolai Hampton pointed out in ''[[Computerworld]]'' that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [[financial crisis]] or [[debt crisis]] like the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,&lt;ref name="SalsmanTheFinancial13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |title=The Financial Crisis Was A Failure Of Government, Not Free Markets |author=Salsman, R.M. |website=Forbes |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeeffeThePolitical15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |title=The political economy of financial crisis policy |author=O'Keeffe, M.; Terzi, A. |website=Bruegel |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power—it's time consuming and expensive."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors.

== Uses ==
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a [[distributed ledger]] for [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], most notably [[bitcoin]]. There are a few operational products maturing from [[proof of concept]] by late 2016.&lt;ref name="btt17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |title=Blockchain Top Trends In 2017 |first=James |last=Ovenden |publisher=The Innovation Enterprise |accessdate=4 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130143727/https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, some observers remain skeptical. Steve Wilson, of Constellation Research, believes the technology has been [[media circus|hyped]] with unrealistic claims.&lt;ref name="almeve"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |title=Blockchain: Almost Everything You Read Is Wrong |first=Steve |last=Wilson |date=3 May 2016 |publisher=Constellation Research Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002256/https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate [[risk management|risk]], businesses are reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.&lt;ref name="clsdips"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |title=CLS dips into blockchain to net new currencies |author=Katie Martin |accessdate=7 November 2016 |date=27 September 2016 |newspaper=Financial Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152317/https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptocurrencies ===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the [[bitcoin network]] and [[Ethereum]] network are blockchain-based. On May 8, 2018 [[Facebook]] confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Kurt |title=Facebook is making its biggest executive shuffle in company history |url=https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain |website=Recode |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be headed by [[David A.

According to [[The Verge]] Facebook is planning to launch its own [[cryptocurrency]] for facilitating payments on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gartenberg |first1=Chaim |title=Facebook reportedly plans to launch its own cryptocurrency |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344318/facebook-cryptocurrency-token-blockchain-report-david-marcus |website=The Verge |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart contracts ===
{{main|Smart contract}}
Blockchain-based [[smart contract]]s are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.&lt;ref name="unbi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics |last=Franco |first=Pedro |year=2014 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-119-01916-9 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=4 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214204859/https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |archivedate=14 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of a smart contract is [[automation|automated]] [[escrow]]. An [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce [[moral hazard]]s and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged."

===Blockchain with video games===
Some [[video game]]s are based on blockchain technology. The first such game, ''Huntercoin'', was released in February, 2014.&lt;ref name="gomedici1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gomedici.com/huntercoin-worlds-first-peer-peer-massively-multiplayer-online-cryptocurrency-game/|title=Huntercoin is the World’s First Peer to Peer Massively Multiplayer Online Cryptocurrency Game|author=Chiraag Patel|first=|date=2014-02-26|work=Medici|accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=consulting house's marketing blog|certain=y|date=November 2018}} Another blockchain game is ''[[CryptoKitties]]'', launched in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/internet-firms-try-luck-blockchain-games/|title=Internet firms try their luck at blockchain games|author=|date=2018-02-22|accessdate=2018-02-28|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an-in game [[virtual pet]] - was sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html|title=Meet CryptoKitties, the $100,000 digital beanie babies epitomizing the cryptocurrency mania|author=Evelyn Cheng|date=2017-12-06|accessdate=2018-02-28|work=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Irrelevant citation|date=November 2018}} ''CryptoKitties'' illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/13/cryptokitties-ethereum-ios-launch-china-ether/|title=CryptoKitties is Going Mobile.

Cryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ([[digital asset]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|date=2017-05-12|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the video game industry, while blockchain use is seen as part of a marketplace mechanism, such as with [[Robot Cache]], blockchain is also postulated as a way to share video game assets between various games. The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of [[Ubisoft]] and [[Fig (company)|Fig]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/leading-blockchain-and-gaming-companies-form-blockchain-game-alliance/ | title=  Leading Blockchain and Gaming Companies Form Blockchain Game Alliance | first = Jimmy | last = Aki | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[Bitcoin Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blockchains==
Currently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and [[consortium]] blockchains.

===Public blockchains===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}} to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]).&lt;ref name=Perfectial&gt;{{cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

===Private blockchains===
A private blockchain is permissioned.&lt;ref name="btit"/&gt; One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.

===Consortium blockchains===
A consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single [[organization]] controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a [[Node (networking)|node]] on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Tucker|first2=Catherine E.|date=11 August 2016|title=Seeding the S-Curve?

The '''Cabécar language''' is an indigenous American language of the  [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]] which is spoken by the [[Cabécar people]] in Costa Rica. Specifically, it is spoken in the inland Turrialba Region of the Cartago Province.  80% of speakers are monolingual;&lt;ref name=e10/&gt; as of 2007, it is the only indigenous language in Costa Rica with monolingual adults.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;  The language is also known by its dialect names Chirripó, Estrella, Telire, and Ujarrás.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; 

== History ==
Cabécar is considered to be one of a few "Chibcha-speaking tribes," categorized by similarities in the languages that they speak. Other Chibcha speaking tribes include the [[Bribri people|Bribri]] and the [[Boruca]], also of Costa Rica. It is believed that the languages of the Chibcha speaking tribes shared a common ancestor around 8,000 years ago. However, differences in the languages are thought to have come about from the influence of outside people, including influences from [[Mesoamerica]]. &lt;ref name= "journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrantes|first1=R.|last2=Smouse|first2=P.E.|last3=Mohrenweiser|first3=H.W.|last4=Gershowitz|first4=H.|last5=Azofeifa|first5=J.|last6=Arias|first6=T.D.|last7=Neel|first7=J.V.|title=Microevolution in Lower Central America: Genetic Characterization of the Chibcha-Speaking Groups of Costa Rica and Panama, and a Consensus Taxonom Based on Genetic and Linguistic Affinity|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=1990|volume=43|pages=63-84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article discusses the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of [[verb]]s in a number of varieties of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], including [[Old Catalan]]. Each verbal form is accompanied by its phonetic transcription. Widely used dialectal forms are included, even if they are not considered standard in either of the written norms: those of the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] (based on central Catalan) and the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] (based on common [[Valencian]]). Other dialectal forms exist, including those characteristic of minor dialects such as [[Ribagorçan dialect|Ribagorçan]] and [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]] and transitional forms of major dialects (such as those spoken in the lower [[Ebro]] basin area around [[Tortosa]] and in the [[Empordà]]).

=={{anchor|The Catalan verb system in context}}Verb system in context==

The Catalan verb system has grammatical categories similar to those of neighbouring Romance languages such as Spanish, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], French, and Italian. The [[Occitan conjugation|formal similarities with Occitan]] are most noticeable. There is a visible divergence between Catalan and Occitan in Catalan second-person plural endings: ''-au, -eu, -iu'', instead of the Occitan ''-atz, -etz, -itz''.

One feature of Catalan is the periphrastic preterite tense for referring to the remote past, which is constructed with characteristic present-tense forms of the verb ''anar'' (to go) and the infinitive of a verb (''vaig parlar, vas/vares parlar, va parlar, vam/vàrem parlar, vau/vàreu parlar, van/varen parlar''). This tense, rare in [[Romance languages]] and shared  only with some [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] ([[Benasque]], [[Gistaín]]) dialects, seems to have existed in Catalan since at least the 13th century.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The simple preterite indicative, descending from the Latin perfect indicative, is primarily used in contemporary written Catalan. Although it has been largely replaced by the periphrastic preterite in the spoken language, the simple preterite indicative is still used in dialects such as central Valencian and the Catalan spoken on [[Ibiza]].

Another difference between contemporary and Old Catalan is the shift in simple preterite indicative endings from an etymological to an analogous pattern in third-person plural: from the Old Catalan -''é'', -''ast'', -''à'', -''am'', -''às'', and -''aren'' to the contemporary -''í'', -''ares'', -''à'', -''àrem'', -''àreu'', and -''aren''. This change occurred between the 13th and 15th centuries.

Finite Catalan verbs have an imperfective or perfective [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

Regular Catalan verbs have the following imperfective tenses:
* Simple present (''present d'indicatiu''), e.g. ''parlo'' ("I speak, I'm speaking")
* Imperfect preterite (''pretèrit imperfet d'indicatiu''), e.g. ''parlava'' ("I spoke, I was speaking")
* Simple future (''futur simple''), e.g. ''parlaré'' ("I will speak, I will be speaking")
* Simple conditional (''condicional simple''), e.g. ''parlaria'' ("I would speak, I would be speaking")
* Subjunctive simple present (''present de subjuntiu''), e.g. ''parli'' ("that I speak, me to speak")
* Subjunctive simple preterite (''pretèrit imperfet de subjuntiu''), e.g. ''parlés'' ("that I spoke")

Tenses in the [[subjunctive mood]] usually imply dependence on a subordinate clause and might express uncertainty or supposition.

Regular Catalan verbs have the following perfective tenses (formed with the auxiliary verb ''haver'' and the past participle of the conjugated verb), which correspond with those above:
* Indefinite preterite (''pretèrit indefinit'') (recent past, analogous to the English present perfect), e.g. ''he parlat'' ("I have spoken")
* Pluperfect (''pretèrit plusquamperfet d'indicatiu'') (analogous to the English past perfect), e.g. ''havia parlat'' ("I had spoken")
* Future perfect (''futur compost''), e.g. ''hauré parlat'' ("I will have spoken")
* Past conditional (''condicional compost''), e.g. ''hauria parlat'' ("I would have spoken")
* Subjunctive preterite perfect (''pretèrit perfet de subjuntiu''), e.g. ''hagi parlat'' ("that I have spoken, me to have spoken")
* Subjunctive pluperfect (''pretèrit plusquamperfet de subjuntiu''), e.g. ''hagués parlat'' ("that I had spoken, me to had spoken")

The perfective tense in the indicative mood has two remote-past forms, analogous to the English simple past. The most common is the periphrastic preterite (''pretèrit perfet perifràstic''), a compound tense formed with conjugations of a special present indicative of ''anar'' ("go", used exclusively in the formation of this tense) followed by the infinitive of the conjugated verb (''vaig parlar'', "I spoke"; ''vas parlar'' or ''vares parlar'', "you [singular informal] spoke"). This special form of ''anar'' always uses the stem ''va-'' and can also use the [[affix]] -''re-'' when the regular preterite suffix corresponding to the desired person has it. As a consequence of always using ''va-'', ''vau''/''vàreu'' and ''vam''/''vàrem'' are used to form the periphrastic past, instead of ''aneu'' and ''anem''. The periphrastic preterite may also be used in the subjunctive mood, but this only occurs as a literary tense and sporadically in any case; instead, the simple past subjunctive is normally used.{{fact|date=July 2016}} The normative Central Catalan and Valencian forms of ''anar'' used to form this tense are outlined in the table below.

The other tense expressing the remote past is the simple preterite (''pretèrit perfet simple''), now used almost exclusively in writing: ''parlí'' ("I spoke"), ''parlares'' ("you (singular informal) spoke").

The [[Imperative mood|imperative present]] (''present d'imperatiu''), with two forms, exists outside the imperfective–perfective contrast: one for second-person singular and the other for second-person plural (''parla!'', "you [singular] speak!"; ''parleu!'', "you [plural] speak!"). For other persons, the subjunctive present is used: ''parli!'' ("let him/her speak!"), ''parlem!'' ("let us speak!"), ''parlin!'' ("let them speak!"). The imperative is used for positive commands; negative commands use the present subjunctive preceded by ''no'': ''no parlis!'' ("don't (you) (singular informal) speak!"), ''no parlem!'' ("let us not speak!"), ''no parleu!'' ("don't (you) (plural) speak!").

The differences in meaning and usage distribution of the Catalan recent past (indefinite preterite or present perfect) and remote past (periphrastic past and synthetic preterite) are similar to those of the British English present perfect and simple past.{{cn|date=July 2016}} Using the recent past implies that the action was performed sometime in the past, completed during the period of speech and its effects are still present; the remote past implies that action was performed in the past and its effects are no longer present.

In conditional clauses, verb tenses are used in these pairs:
* Subordinate clause with subjunctive perfect preterite and main clause with perfect conditional to express a condition which did not happen: ''si hagués arribat abans, l'hauria trobat a casa'' ("if I had arrived earlier, I would have met him at home")
* Subordinate clause with subjunctive imperfect preterite and main clause with simple conditional to express an unreal condition in the present or the future: ''si l'estimés no se n'aniria'' ("if he loved her, he would not leave")
* Subordinate clause with indicative present and main clause with simple future to express a possible condition in the present or the future: ''si fas bondat, anirem al parc'' ("if you behave, we will go to the park")

Other tense combinations are also possible: ''si heu vist el que ha passat, ens ho heu d'explicar'' ("if you have seen what has happened, you must tell us"). Temporary and relative subordinate clauses are formed in the future tense: ''quan vindràs, en parlarem'' ("when you will come, we will speak about it"), ''els qui vindran d'hora podran seure'' ("those arriving early will be able to sit"); though, in the contemporary language, the present subjunctive is used as well, ''quan vinguis ...'' ("when you come ..."), ''els qui vinguin ...'' ("those who come ...").

==={{anchor|Non-finite forms}}Non-finite===

Catalan verbs have three non-finite forms: an [[infinitive]], a [[gerund]], and a [[past participle]].

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" 
|+Non-finite forms of ''cantar'' ("to sing")
! !! Simple !! Composite
|-
! Infinitive 
| cantar || haver cantat
|-
! Gerund 
| cantant || havent cantat
|-
! Participle 
| cantat || &amp;mdash;
|-
|}

The infinitive is used with present-indicative forms of ''anar'' (to go) to form the periphrastic preterite: ''vaig parlar'' ("I spoke"). A gerund, which is unvarying, functions as an adverb; it is used to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to the present participle in English.

The past participle, a verbal adjective, may inflect for gender and number in certain constructions. It is used with the auxiliary ''haver'' ("to have") to form the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] of the simple tenses: simple present ''parlo'' ("I speak, I'm speaking") and present perfect ''he parlat'' ("I've spoken"). In the compound perfect tenses of [[transitive verb]]s (those with a [[Object (grammar)#Types of objects|direct object]]), a past participle may inflect to match gender and number of the object.

In Old Catalan and some modern varieties{{which|date=July 2015}} the compound perfect tenses of [[intransitive verb]]s (those without a direct object) can also be formed with the auxiliary ''ser'' ("to be") and the past participle, inflected for gender and number of the subject: ''som arribats'' ("we have arrived", switching to masculine plural); the typical contemporary construction is ''hem arribat'', with an invariable participle. This construction remains in only a few vestigial forms: ''és mort/és morta'' ("he's dead/she's dead").

==={{anchor|Other periphrastic finite forms}}Periphrastic finite===

Infinitives can be used to make the periphrastic near future with the present of ''anar'' (to go) plus the preposition ''a'' (to): ''vaig a parlar'' ("I am going to speak"). This near future is used less often than it is in Spanish or French, because it may be confused with the Catalan periphrastic past. Infinitives can also be used to make periphrastic forms with a range of [[modal verb]]s: ''puc parlar'' ("I can speak"), ''he/haig de parlar'' ("I must/have to speak"), ''necessito parlar'' ("I need to speak"), ''vull parlar'' ("I want to speak"), ''solia parlar'' ("I used to speak"). Gerunds can be used to make periphrastic forms analogous to continuous tenses in English: ''estic parlant'' ("I'm speaking"), ''estava parlant'' ("I was speaking"), ''estaré parlant'' ("I will be speaking"). Past participles are also used with the auxiliary ''ser'' ("to be") to form the [[Passive voice|passive]] forms for all active tenses of transitive verbs: active present ''veig'' ("I see, I'm seeing") in relation to passive present ''sóc vist'' ("I'm seen, I'm being seen"), recent past ''he vist'' ("I've seen") in relation to passive recent past ''he estat vist'' ("I've been seen").

Catalan uses the passive voice less often than English does because it has syntactic alternatives; instead of ''la vaca ha estat vista'' ("the cow has been seen"), other constructions could be used such as changing word order and using a redundant weak pronoun to mark object case: ''la vaca, l'han vista'' ("the cow, [they] have seen it"); using the third-person reflexive weak pronoun ''es'' (''s'ha vist la vaca'', literally "the cow has seen itself"); using the pronoun ''hom'', one or someone (''hom ha vist la vaca'', "one has seen the cow"), or using an elliptic plural subject (''han vist la vaca'', "they have seen the cow").

=={{anchor|1st conjugation (-ar) verbs}}First-conjugation (-ar) verbs==

About 86 percent of Catalan verbs belong to this group. Examples include ''estimar'' ("to love"), ''esperar'' ("to wait" and "to hope"), ''menjar'' ("to eat") and ''pensar'' ("to think"). This is the only open verb class; new verbs incorporated into the language are likely to follow this conjugation model. The only [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] in this class are the idiosyncratic ''anar'' ("to go") and ''estar'' ("to be, to stay"), which often act as [[auxiliary verb]]s.

=={{anchor|2nd conjugation (-re, -er) verbs}}Second-conjugation (-re, -er) verbs==

This is the third-largest group of verbs in Catalan, encompassing about four percent of the verbs in the dictionary. It includes most of the irregular verbs, the most-frequently-used: ''ser'' ("to be"), ''haver'' ("to have"), ''fer'' ("to do"), ''veure'' ("to see"), ''poder'' ("can"), ''voler'' ("to want"), ''caldre'' ("must"), ''dir'' ("to say") and ''dur'' ("to take/get").

In verbs whose infinitive ends in -''re'', the letter preceding -''re'' is always a consonant (''b, d, p, t'') or a consonantal ''u''. Examples include ''beure'' ("to drink"), ''caure'' ("to fall"), ''coure'' ("to cook"),''deure'' ("to owe", also modal "might"), ''fotre'' ("fuck"), ''jeure'' ("to lay down"), ''perdre'' ("to lose"), ''rebre'' ("to receive"), ''rompre'' ("break"), ''valdre'' ("to be worth"), ''vendre'' ("to sell"), and ''viure'' ("to live").

The final consonantal ''u'' in infinitive roots of this verb class is a characteristic Catalan evolution of several consonantal clusters from [[Vulgar Latin]]: CÁDERE &gt; *cad're &gt; caure, DÉBERE &gt; *dev're &gt; deure, VÍVERE &gt; *viv're &gt; viure, CÓQUERE &gt; *cog're &gt; coure. The clusters -''ldr''-, -''ndr''- in infinitive roots of this verb class have an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''d'' as the result of the evolution of consonantal clusters from Vulgar Latin: VÁLERE &gt; val're &gt; valdre, VÉNDERE &gt; *ven're &gt; vendre. If the root consonant in the infinitive is ''b'', the third-person singular indicative present will be spelt with a ''p''; ''rebre'' becomes ''rep''.

Some verbs in this group have a [[Suppletion|suppletive]] root with a velar augment (adding -''g''- {{IPA|[ɣ]}} or -''c'' {{IPA|[k]}} to the basic root) in some forms, most frequently past participle, first person of indicative present, and all forms of indicative preterite, subjunctive present and subjunctive preterite: ''valdre'' gives ''valgut'', ''valc'', ''valguí'', ''valgui'', ''valgués''; ''voler'' gives ''volgut'', ''vull'' or ''vullc'', ''volguí'', ''vulgui'', ''volgués''.

=={{anchor|3rd conjugation (-ir) verbs}}Third-conjugation (-ir) verbs==

This is the second-largest group of regular verbs in the Catalan language (about 10 percent of verbs in the dictionary). Most regular verbs in the group (about 91 percent) are [[Inchoative verb|inchoative]], deriving from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[Inchoative aspect|inchoative]] suffix -''ESC''-. The varied [[suffix]]es (''eix''-, -''ix''-, -''esc''-, -''isc''- {{IPA|[ˈɛʃ}}, {{IPA|ˈiʃ}}, {{IPA|ˈɛsk}}, {{IPA|ˈisk]}}), depending on tense and dialect), which carry the [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], is added to the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] in the imperative second-person singular and the first-, second- and third-person singular and third-person plural of the indicative and subjunctive present: ''servir'' gives the imperative second-person singular ''serveix!'', third-person singular indicative present ''serveix'' and the third-person singular subjunctive present ''serveixi''.

==={{anchor|Two-stemmed "inchoatives": ''servir'' ("to serve")}}Two-stemmed inchoatives: ''servir'' ("to serve")===

These verbs have basic (''serv-'') and extended stems (''serveix-'', ''servix-'', ''servesc-'' or ''servisc-''), used in particular tenses. Examples of inchoative verbs include ''patir'' ("to suffer/endure") and ''partir'' ("to divide"), which give the third-person singular indicative present of ''pateix'' and ''parteix'' respectively.

===''anar'' ("to go")===

''Anar'' has two roots: ana-, ani- (from Latin AMBULARE, the second a mix with Latin IRE) and va-, vag- {{IPA|[baʒ]}} (from Latin VADERE). The present of ''anar'' is used as an auxiliary verb to form the periphrastic preterite with the infinitive of the verb being conjugated. The forms of ''anar'' as an auxiliary verb are slightly different from the normal present tense. The first- and second-person plural forms are different; the auxiliary verb forms are ''vam'' and ''vau'' (or ''vem'' and ''veu'', depending on dialect), and the full verb forms are ''anem'' and ''aneu'' (or ''anam'' and ''anau'', depending on dialect).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3647">'''Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1630) was a 17th-century [[Irish language]] [[poet]] and [[harp]]ist, who composed the song "''[[Eileanóir a Rún]]''".

Cearbhall was a common name amongst people of the [[Ó Dálaigh]] (O'Daly, [[Daly (surname)|Daly]]) surname, and more than one poet of that surname bore the name Cearbhall. The Cearbhall Óg  who composed 'Eileanóir a Rún' was from Pallas, near [[Gorey]] in County [[Wexford]]. The Eileanóir of the poem was the daughter of Sir Morgan Kavanagh of  Poll an Mhóintigh in [[County Wexford]]. In folklore Cearbhall is commonly depicted as a womanizer{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

== Eileanóir a Rún ==
Irish folklore recounts how Eileanóir Chaomhánach eloped with Cearbhall the day she was about to marry another man. Cearbhall arrived at the wedding to play music at the wedding feast, and fell in love with the bride. He composed the song Eileanoir a Rún to woo the bride.
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Mo ghrá thú, den chéad fhéachaint, Eileanóir a Rún
Is ort a bhím ag smaoineadh, tráth a mbím i mo shuan
A ghrá den tsaol, is a chéad searc, is tú is deise ná ban Éireann.}}
|
From the moment I saw you I loved you, Eileanóir my love
It is of you I think when I’m resting
O love of life and my first love, you are fairer than all the women of Ireland.}}

== Other Songs and Poems ==
Another song, in the style of the crosántacht, ''Seachrán Chearbhaill'',  is ascribed to Cearbhall Óg. Both, a poem by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Pádraigín Haicéad]]. addressed to Cearbhall, and Cearbhall's poem in response, survive in a 17th-century manuscript. The story ''Mac na Míchomhairle'' (The Son of Poor Council) has been ascribed to him in [[folklore]], but current scholarship casts doubt on this ascription.

== Cearbhall Óg Ó Dálaigh in Recordings ==
A version of Seachrán Chearbhaill by Joe Éinniu [[Seosamh Ó hÉanaí]] is available on a CD with the book ''Joe Éinniu: Nár fhágha mé Bás Choíche'' by [[Liam Mac Con Iomaire]] (Cló Iarchonnachta 2007); and a later recording of an earlier version of the song on [[Peadar Ó Ceannabháin]]'s CD, ''Mo Chuid den tSaol'' (Cló-Iarchonnachta). There are many commercially available recordings of Eleanór a Rún.

Both songs are recognised as part of the traditional Irish language repertoire of unaccompanied ballads known as '[[Sean-nós song|sean-nós]] song'.

== Cearbhall Óg Ó Dálaigh in Literature ==
Cearbhall Óg Ó Dálaigh appears as an historical character in [[Darach Ó Scolaí]]'s Irish language novel [[An Cléireach]], as a soldier in the Royalist army in 1650 and in the Spanish [[Netherlands]] as late as 1662.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
In biology, '''coevolution''' occurs when two or more [[species]] reciprocally affect each other's [[evolution]].

[[Charles Darwin]] mentioned evolutionary interactions between [[flowering plants]] and [[insect]]s in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). The term coevolution was coined by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Peter H. Raven]] in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution can play an important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nuismer|first=Scott |date=2017 |title=Introduction to coevolutionary theory|url=http://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontocoevolutionarytheory-firstedition-nuismer/valueoptions|location=New York|publisher=W.F. Freeman |page=395 |isbn=978-1-319-10619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nuismer|first=Scott |date=2017 |title=Introduction to coevolutionary theory|url=http://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontocoevolutionarytheory-firstedition-nuismer/valueoptions|location=New York|publisher=W.F. Freeman |page=395 |isbn=978-1-319-10619-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts [[Selection (biology)|selective pressures]] on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[host–parasite coevolution|host-parasite]], and [[predation|predator-prey]] relationships between species, as well as [[intraspecific competition|competition within]] or [[interspecific competition|between species]]. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an [[evolutionary arms race]] between the species involved. '''Pairwise''' or '''specific coevolution''', between exactly two species, is not the only possibility; in '''guild''' or '''diffuse coevolution''', several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and [[pollinator|pollinating]] insects such as [[bee]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[beetle]]s.

Coevolution is primarily a biological concept, but researchers have applied it by analogy to fields such as [[computer science]], [[sociology]], and [[astronomy]].

==Mutualism==
{{main|Mutualism (biology)}}

Coevolution is the [[evolution]] of two or more [[species]] which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution |author=[[Douglas J. Futuyma|Futuyma, D. J.]] and M. Slatkin (editors) |year=1983 |publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] |isbn=0-87893-228-3 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Coevolutionary Process |author=Thompson, J. N.|year=1994 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-79759-7 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flowering plants ===

Flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record, creating what [[Charles Darwin]] described as the "abominable mystery" of how they had evolved so quickly; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation.&lt;ref name="CardinalDanforth2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedman,  W.

====Insects and entomophilous flowers====

[[File:Apis mellifera - Melilotus albus - Keila.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Honey bee]] taking a reward of [[nectar]] and collecting pollen in its [[pollen basket]]s from [[Melilotus albus|white melilot]] flowers]]

Modern [[entomophily|insect-pollinated (entomophilous) flowers]] are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the [[pollinator]]s with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted.&lt;ref name=Lunau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lunau |first1=Klaus |title=Adaptive radiation and coevolution — pollination biology case studies |journal=Organisms Diversity &amp; Evolution |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1016/j.ode.2004.02.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204000388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pollan, Michael |title=[[The Botany of Desire|The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-eye View of the World]] |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=0-7475-6300-4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term coevolution was coined by [[Paul R.

Several highly successful [[insect]] groups—especially the [[Hymenoptera]] (wasps, bees and ants) and [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies) as well as many types of [[Diptera]] (flies) and [[Coleoptera]] (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with [[flowering plants]] during the [[Cretaceous]] (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=Bristol&gt;{{cite web |title=Coevolution of angiosperms and insects |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Angiosperms/coevolution.htm |publisher=University of Bristol Palaeobiology Research Group |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of wasps [[sister clade|sister]] to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera.&lt;ref name=Bristol/&gt; Further, all the major [[clade]]s of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the [[eudicots]] (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world's dominant plants on land.&lt;ref name="CardinalDanforth2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cardinal |first1=Sophie |last2=Danforth |first2=Bryan N. |title=Bees diversified in the age of eudicots |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2013 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2686 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1755/20122686 |volume=280 |issue=1755 |pages=20122686 |pmid=23363629 |pmc=3574388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as [[Ophrys|some orchids]] mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into [[pseudocopulation]].&lt;ref name=Bristol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pijl&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Leendert |last1=van der Pijl |first2=Calaway H. |last2=Dodson |title=Orchid Flowers: Their Pollination and Evolution |chapter=Chapter 11: Mimicry and Deception |publisher=[[University of Miami]] Press |location=Coral Gables |year=1966 |pages=129–141 |isbn=0-87024-069-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birds and ornithophilous flowers====
{{further|Ornithophily}}
[[File:Purple-throated carib hummingbird feeding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Purple-throated carib]] feeding from and pollinating a flower]]

[[Hummingbird]]s and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers have evolved a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship. The flowers have [[nectar]] suited to the birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The blooming times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers also tend to be more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kay |first1=Kathleen M.|last2=Reeves |first2=Patrick A. |last3=Olmstead |first3=Richard G. |last4=Schemske|first4=Douglas W. |title=Rapid speciation and the evolution of hummingbird pollination in neotropical Costus subgenus Costus (Costaceae): evidence from nrDNA ITS and ETS sequences |journal=American Journal of Botany |date=2005 |volume=92 |issue=11|pages=1899–1910 |doi=10.3732/ajb.92.11.1899 |pmid=21646107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This meets the birds' high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; In ''[[Mimulus]]'', an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination.

Following their respective breeding seasons, several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in [[North America]], and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have [[convergent evolution|converged]] to a common [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the [[Corolla (flower)#Corolla|corolla]] tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place [[pollen]] on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological [[co-adaptation]]s.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt;

Ornithophilous flowers need to be conspicuous to birds.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; Birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the [[visual spectrum]],&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may also be able to see ultraviolet "colors". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the [[Phaethornithinae]] (hermits) and the [[Trochilinae]], has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large [[monocotyledon]]ous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer [[dicotyledon]]ous plant species.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt;

===Fig reproduction and fig wasps===
{{main|Reproductive coevolution in Ficus}}

The genus ''[[Ficus]]'' is composed of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their [[syconium]]s, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own [[fig wasp]] which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.&lt;ref name=Suleman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suleman |first1=Nazia |last2=Sait |first2=Steve |last3=Compton |first3=Stephen G. |title=Female figs as traps: Their impact on the dynamics of an experimental fig tree-pollinator-parasitoid community |journal=Acta Oecologica |volume=62 |year=2015 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.actao.2014.11.001 |bibcode=2015AcO....62....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot keep up with the other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the [[Red Queen hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Valen, L. |date=1973 |title=A New Evolutionary Law |journal=Evolutionary Theory |volume=1 |pages=1–30}} cited in: [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REDQUEEN.html The Red Queen Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the [[Red Queen's race]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'': "it takes all the running ''you'' can do, to keep in the same place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carroll | first=Lewis| authorlink=Lewis Carroll| origyear=1871 | title=Through the Looking-glass: And what Alice Found There| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJJZAAAAYAAJ | publisher=Macmillan | date=1875 | page=42| quote=it takes all the running ''you'' can do, to keep in the same place.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep10004 |last=Rabajante |first=J.| display-authors=etal |title=Red Queen dynamics in multi-host and multi-parasite interaction system |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |year=2015 |volume=5 |pages=10004 |pmid=25899168 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150422/srep10004/full/srep10004.html |pmc=4405699|bibcode=2015NatSR...510004R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parasite/host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual reproduction works thanks to ever-evolving host, parasite relationships |website=PhysOrg |url=http://phys.org/news/2011-07-sexual-reproduction-ever-evolving-host-parasite.html |date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morran, L.T. |author2=Schmidt, O.G. |author3=Gelarden, I.A. |author4=Parrish, R.C.

===Brood parasites===
{{main|Brood parasitism}}

[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite, for example in [[cuckoos]]. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.&lt;ref name=Weiblen&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiblen |first1=George D. |title=Interspecific Coevolution |url=http://geo.cbs.umn.edu/Weiblen2003.pdf |publisher=Macmillan |date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rothstein | first1=S.I | year=1990 | title=A model system for coevolution: avian brood parasitism | url=| journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=21 | issue=| pages=481–508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.21.1.481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antagonistic coevolution===

Antagonistic coevolution is seen in the [[harvester ant]] species ''[[Pogonomyrmex barbatus]]'' and ''[[Pogonomyrmex rugosus]]'', in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic. The queens are unable to produce worker ants by mating with their own species. Only by crossbreeding can they produce workers. The winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids. But because the colonies are fully dependent on these hybrids to survive, it is also mutualistic. While there is no genetic exchange between the species, they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible.&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cahan pp. 20141771–20141771"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Herrmann | first=M. | last2=Cahan | first2=S.

==Predators and prey==
[[File:Leopard kill - KNP - 001.jpg|thumb|left|Predator and prey: a [[leopard]] killing a [[bushbuck]]]]
{{main|Predation}}

[[Predator]]s and prey interact and coevolve, the predator to catch the prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes [[selective pressure]]s. These often lead to an [[evolutionary arms race]] between prey and predator, resulting in [[antipredator adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predator-Prey Relationships|url=http://necsi.edu/projects/evolution/co-evolution/pred-prey/co-evolution_predator.html|publisher=New England Complex Systems Institute|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same applies to [[herbivore]]s, animals that eat plants, and the plants that they eat. In the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[red squirrel]]s and [[crossbill]]s (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the [[lodgepole pine]]. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it more difficult for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Coevolution |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_33 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=17 January 2017}} and the two following pages of the web article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of [[flowering plant]], such as offering its [[nectar]] at the end of a long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including [[bee]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[beetle]]s, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.&lt;ref name=Juenger&gt;Juenger, Thomas, and Joy Bergelson.

==Outside biology==

Coevolution is primarily a biological concept, but has been applied to other fields by analogy.

===In algorithms===
{{See also|Evolutionary computation}}

Coevolutionary algorithms are used for generating [[artificial life]] as well as for optimization, game learning and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter M. and K. De Jong, Evolving Complex Structures via Cooperative Coevolution, Fourth Annual Conference on Evolutionary Programming, San Diego, CA, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter M., The Design and Computational Model of Cooperative Coevolution, PhD thesis, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=Mitchell A.|last2=De Jong|first2=Kenneth A.|title=Cooperative Coevolution: An Architecture for Evolving Coadapted Subcomponents|journal=Evolutionary Computation|date=2000|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.1162/106365600568086|pmid=10753229|citeseerx=10.1.1.134.2926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigand P., Liles W., De Jong K., An empirical analysis of collaboration methods in cooperative coevolutionary algorithms.

===In architecture===
The concept of coevolution was introduced in architecture by the Danish architect-urbanist [[Henrik Valeur]] as an antithesis to the concept of "star-architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://henrikvaleur.dk/biography/ |title=Henrik Valeur's biography |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the curator of the Danish Pavilion at the [[10th International Architecture Exhibition|2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture]] he conceived and orchestrated an exhibition project named 'Co-evolution', awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/exhibitions/2006/co-evolution/about-co-evolution/ |title=About CO-EVOLUTION |publisher=Danish Architecture Centre |accessdate=2015-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120011414/http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/exhibitions/2006/co-evolution/about-co-evolution/ |archivedate=2015-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition included urban planning projects for the cities of [[Beijing]], [[Chongqing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Xi'an]], which had been developed in collaboration between young professional Danish architects and students and professors and students from leading universities in the four Chinese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movingcities.org/interviews/henrik-valeur_domuschina |title= An interview with Henrik Valeur |publisher=Movingcities |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate "creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Valeur|first= Henrik|title= CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China|publisher= Danish Architecture Centre|year= 2006|location= Copenhagen|isbn= 87-90668-61-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valeur later argued that: "As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valeur |first=Henrik |title=[[India: the Urban Transition|India: the Urban Transition - a Case Study of Development Urbanism]] |publisher=Architectural Publisher B |year=2014 | isbn=978-87-92700-09-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--===In cosmology and astronomy===
In his book ''The Self-organizing Universe'', [[Erich Jantsch]] attributed the entire evolution of the [[cosmos]] to coevolution.
In [[astronomy]], an emerging theory proposes that [[black holes]] and [[galaxies]] develop in an interdependent way analogous to biological coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gnedin |first=Oleg Y.| display-authors=etal|title=Co-Evolution of Galactic Nuclei and Globular Cluster Systems |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/785/1/71 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=785 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/785/1/71 |bibcode=2014ApJ...785...71G |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===In technology===
{{further|Software ecosystem}}

[[Computer software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] can be considered as two separate components but tied intrinsically by coevolution. Similarly, [[operating system]]s and computer [[Application software|applications]], [[web browser]]s and [[web application]]s.

All of these systems depend upon each other and advance step by step through a kind of evolutionary process. Changes in hardware, an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside.&lt;ref&gt;Theo D'Hondt, Kris De Volder, Kim Mens and Roel Wuyts, Co-Evolution of Object-Oriented Software Design and Implementation, TheKluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, 2002, Volume 648, Part 2, 207–224 {{DOI|10.1007/978-1-4615-0883-0_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is closely related to the concept of "joint optimization" in [[sociotechnical system]]s analysis and design, where a system is understood to consist of both a "technical system" encompassing the tools and hardware used for production and maintenance, and a "social system" of relationships and procedures through which the technology is tied into the goals of the system and all the other human and organizational relationships within and outside the system. Such systems work best when the technical and social systems are deliberately developed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cherns | first1=A. | year=1976 | title=The principles of sociotechnical design | url=| journal=Human Relations | volume=29 | issue=8 | page=8 | doi=10.1177/001872677602900806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In sociology===

Models of coevolution have been proposed for [[sociology]] and [[international political economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jessop | first1=Bob | year=2004 | title=Critical Semiotic Analysis and Critical Political Economy | journal=Critical Discourse Studies | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1080/17405900410001674506}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Norgaard]]'s 2006 book ''Development Betrayed'' proposes a "Co-Evolutionary Revisioning of the Future" of social and economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norgaard |first=Richard B. |title=Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Co-Evolutionary Revisioning of the Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9yKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-91564-4 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contact sports''' are [[sport]]s that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as [[mixed martial arts]], are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including [[rugby football|rugby]]  require [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]] of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact. Other sports have contact, but such events are illegal under the rules of the game or are accidental and do not form part of the sport.

The contact in contact sports can also include impact via a piece of [[sporting equipment]], such as being struck by a [[hockey stick]] or [[football (ball)|football]]. Non-contact sports are those where participants should have no possible means of touching, such as sprinting, swimming, darts or snooker, where players use separate lanes or take turns of play. Consideration should also be given to other sports such as Moto-cross and Bicycle Moto-cross (BMX) and [[cycling]] which all involve riding/racing in packs of riders.  This often results in brushing and bumping off other riders.

==Terminology in the United States==
Current medical terminology in the United States uses the term '''collision sport''' to refer to sports like [[rugby football|rugby]], [[roller derby]], [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], and [[lacrosse]], the term '''contact sport''' to refer to sports such as [[Association football]] and [[basketball]], and the term '''limited-contact sport''' to sports like [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="ncbi-pubmed-18381550"&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Medical conditions affecting sports participation.
| author=Rice SG.
| year=2008
| pmid=18381550
| doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0080
| volume=121
| journal=Pediatrics
| pages=841–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] policy statement revised in 2008 included the following definitions:

{{quote|In collision sports (eg, boxing, roller derby, ice hockey, [American] football, lacrosse, and rodeo), athletes purposely hit or collide with each other or with inanimate objects (including the ground) with great force. In contact sports (eg, basketball and soccer), athletes routinely make contact with each other or inanimate objects but usually with less force than in collision sports. In limited-contact sports (eg, softball and squash), contact with other athletes or with inanimate objects is infrequent or inadvertent.&lt;ref name="ncbi-pubmed-18381550"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Injuries==
Many sports will penalize contact with rules for certain situations or instances to help reduce the incidence of [[physical trauma]] or [[litigation]] for [[assault]] or [[grievous bodily harm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.
Many sports involve a degree of player-to-player or player-to-object contact. The term "contact sport" is used in both team sports and combat activities, medical terminology and television game shows, such as American Gladiators and Wipeout, to certain degrees. Contact between players is often classed by different grades ranging from non-contact, where there is no contact between players, to full-contact or collision sports, where the rules allow for significant physical contact.

Injuries in some contact sports [[List of sportspeople who died during their careers|have been fatal]]. Injury rates in professional rugby league are higher than in some other contact sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | journal=Sports Med
 | pages=211–6
 | doi=10.2165/00007256-200232030-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
As a result of the risk of injury, some sports require the use of [[protective equipment]], for example [[American football protective equipment]] or the gloves and helmets needed for [[underwater hockey]]. Some sports are also played on soft ground and have padding on physical obstacles, such as [[goal posts]].

Most contact sports require any male players to wear a [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|Abdominal Guard]] to protect their [[human male genitalia|male genitalia]].

The cost of equipment can be an obstacle to participating in many sports.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Trends==
Because of issues involved with any sport that involves rapid contact, many sports governing bodies are changing their rules to decrease the incidence of serious injury. An example of this is the NFL banning concussed players from re-entering the same game in which they were injured in order to decrease further damage.

==Grades==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

===Full-contact===
A '''(full) contact sport''' is any sport for which significant physical [[impact force]] on players, either deliberate or incidental, is allowed or within the rules of the game.

Contact actions include [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]], [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]] and a whole range of other moves that can differ substantially in their rules and degree of application.

Examples of contact sports are [[roller derby]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[American football]], [[Canadian football]], [[water polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[hurling]], [[shinty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Innes |first1=Gary |title=How do we teach people about shinty? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/garyinnes/2011/10/how_do_we_teach_people_about_s.html |website=BBC |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Australian rules football]], [[ice hockey]], [[wheelchair rugby]] and [[Combat football]].

Full-contact [[martial arts]] include [[wrestling]], [[Sanshou]], [[sumo]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Muay Thai]], [[judo]], various forms of [[full contact karate]], and some forms of [[World Taekwondo Federation#Sparring|Taekwondo]].
{{main|combat sport}}

===Semi-contact===
A '''semi-contact sport''' is typically a [[combat sport]] involving [[strike (attack)|striking]] and containing physical contact between the combatants simulating full-power techniques. The techniques are restricted to limited power, and rendering the opponent [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] is forbidden.

Some semi-contact sports use a point system to determine the winner and use extensive [[protective gear]] to protect the athletes from injury. Examples of semi-contact sports include [[karate]], [[kalaripayattu]], [[kickboxing]], various [[Chinese martial arts]] that incorporate contact rules sparring, [[kendo]] and [[taekwondo]]

Another indicator of a semi-contact martial arts competition system is that after a point is rewarded the adversaries will be separated and resume the match from safe distance, but often it is possible to argue if some martial arts sports belong in one contact group or another.

===Limited-contact===
'''Limited-contact sports''' are sports for which the rules are specifically designed to prevent contact between players either intentionally or unintentionally. Contact can still happen, but penalties are often used to disallow substantial contact between players. These penalties, including physically removing players from the field of play, mean that contact is moderate or rare.

Examples include [[association football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[field hockey]], [[women's lacrosse]], [[netball]], [[korfball]], [[Gaelic football]], [[polo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[bandy]], and [[underwater hockey]].

===Non-contact sports===
'''Non-contact sports''' are sports where participants compete alternately in lanes or are physically separated such as to make it nearly impossible for them to make contact during the course of a game without committing an [[out-of-bounds]] offense or, more likely, disqualification. Examples include [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[Howden Clough 6-A-Side Football]], [[golf]], [[ten-pin bowling|bowling]], [[bowls]], [[croquet]], [[pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[snooker]], [[darts]], [[curling]], [[bodybuilding]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[Running#Running as a sport|running]], [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]], [[gymnastics]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]].

'''Cumbric''' was a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the [[Common Brittonic]] language spoken during the [[Early Middle Ages]] in the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' or "Old North" in what is now [[Northern England]] and southern [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="CelticCulture"&gt;{{cite book |last= Koch|first= John T.|title= Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA515&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=515&amp;output=html|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|isbn= |pages=515–516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was closely related to [[Old Welsh]] and the other [[Brittonic languages]]. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as [[Borough of Pendle|Pendle]] and the [[Yorkshire Dales]]. The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] into the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].

==Problems with terminology==

Dauvit Broun sets out the problems with the various terms used to describe the Cumbric language and its speakers.&lt;ref name=Broun&gt;Broun, Dauvit (2004): 'The Welsh identity of the kingdom of Strathclyde, ca 900-ca 1200', Innes Review 55, pp 111–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The people seem to have called themselves ''*Cumbri'' the same way that the Welsh call themselves ''Cymry'' (most likely from Brittonic ''*kom-brogī'' meaning "fellow countrymen"). The Welsh and the Cumbric-speaking people of what are now southern Scotland and northern England likely felt they were actually one ethnic group. Old Irish speakers called them "Britons", ''Bretnach'', or ''Bretain''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]], Royal Irish Academy, 1983. [http://www.dil.ie/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse called them ''Brettar''.&lt;ref name="PNCu"/&gt; In Medieval Latin, the English term Wales and the term ''Cumbri'' were Latinised respectively as ''Wallenses'' "of Wales" and ''Cumbrenses'' "of [[Cumbria]]". The usual English usage was to call them Welsh.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, A. P. (1874) Lives of St. Ninian and St. Kentigern: compiled in the twelfth century&lt;/ref&gt; In Scots, a Cumbric speaker seems to have been called ''Wallace'', from the Scots ''Wallis/Wellis'' "Welsh".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Cumbric region.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The Cumbric region: modern counties and regions with the early mediæval kingdoms]]

{{quote|''In Cumbria itaque: regione quadam inter Angliam et Scotiam sita'' &amp;ndash; "Cumbria: a region situated between England and Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Cosmo Nelson, (ed). (1843), Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis; Munimenta Ecclesie Metropolitane Glasguensis a Sede Restaurata Seculo Incunte Xii Ad Reformatam Religionem, i, Edinburgh: The Bannatyne Club&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Latinate term [[Cambria]] is often used for Wales; nevertheless, the ''Life of St Kentigern'' by [[Jocelyn of Furness]] has the following passage:

{{quote|When King Rederech ''([[Rhydderch Hael]])'' and his people had heard that Kentigern had arrived from Wallia [i.e. Wales] into Cambria [i.e. Cumbria], from exile into his own country, with great joy and peace both king and people went out to meet him.&lt;ref name=Kentiger&gt;(1989) ''Two Celtic Saints: the lives of Ninian and Kentigern'' Lampeter: Llanerch Enterprises, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John T. Koch]] defines the specifically Cumbric region as "the area approximately between the line of the [[River Mersey]] and the Forth-Clyde Isthmus", but goes on to include evidence from the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in his discussion and does not define its easterly extent.&lt;ref name="CelticCulture" /&gt; [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] describes Cumbric as "the Brittonic dialect of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], northern [[Lancashire]], and south-west Scotland..." and goes on to define the region further as being bound in the north by the Firth of Clyde, in the south by the [[River Ribble]] and in the east by the Southern Scottish Uplands and the Pennine Ridge.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

==Available evidence==
The evidence from Cumbric comes almost entirely through secondary sources, since no contemporary written records of the language are known. The majority of evidence comes from place names of the extreme northwest of England and the south of Scotland. Other sources include the personal names of Strathclyde Britons in Scottish, Irish, and Anglo-Saxon sources, and a few Cumbric words surviving into the [[High Middle Ages]] in southwest Scotland as legal terms. Although the language is long extinct, traces of its vocabulary arguably have persisted into the modern era in the form of "counting scores" and in a handful of dialectal words.

From this scanty evidence, little can be deduced about the singular characteristics of Cumbric, not even the name by which its speakers referred to it. What is generally agreed upon by linguists is that Cumbric was a [[Western Brittonic languages|Western Brittonic language]] closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and, more distantly, to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John (ed), Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Ball, James Fife (eds.), The Celtic Languages, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth H. Jackson, Language and history in early Britain, Edinburgh University press, 1953, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the battle described in the poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', [[Common Brittonic]] was believed to be  transitioning into its daughter languages: Cumbric in [[North Britain]], [[Old Welsh]] in [[Wales]], and [[Southwestern Brittonic languages|Southwestern Brittonic]], the ancestor of Cornish and Breton.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2005), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] concludes that the majority of changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the fifth to the end of the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1953), pp 3–11; 690.&lt;/ref&gt; This involved [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (2005), p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson suggested the name "Primitive Cumbric" for the dialect spoken at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1969), pp. 86, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place names===
Cumbric place names are found in Scotland south of the firths of Forth and Clyde. Brittonic names north of this line are [[Pictish language|Pictish]]. They are also found commonly in the historic county of Cumberland and bordering areas of Northumberland. They are less common in Westmorland, with some in Lancashire and the adjoining areas of North Yorkshire. Approaching Cheshire, late Brittonic placenames are probably better described as being Welsh rather than Cumbric. As noted below, however, any clear distinction between Cumbric and Welsh is difficult to prove. For references see Armstrong et al.,&lt;ref name="PNCu" /&gt; Watson&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt; and Jackson.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;  Many Brittonic place-names remain in northern England, which should not be described as Cumbric because they originated from a period before Brittonic split into its daughter dialects e.g. Welsh, Cornish, Breton and&amp;nbsp;– arguably&amp;nbsp;– Cumbric.

Some of the principal towns and cities of the region have names of Cumbric origin, including:
*'''[[Bathgate]]''', West Lothian. Meaning 'boar wood' (Welsh ''baedd'' "wild boar" + ''coed'' "forest, wood").
*'''[[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]''', Cumbria. recorded as ''Luguvalium'' in the Roman period; the word ''caer'' "fort" was added later.&lt;ref name="Ekwall"&gt;Ekwall, E. (1960) 'The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names' 4th edn. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The Welsh form ''Caerliwelydd'' is derived by regular sound changes from the Romano-British name.

Some Cumbric names have historically 
been replaced by Gaelic or English equivalents and in some cases the different forms occur in the historical record.
*[[Edinburgh]] occurs in early Welsh texts as ''Din Eidyn'' and in medieval Scottish records as ''Dunedene'' (Gaelic ''Dùn Èideann''), all meaning "fort of Eidyn".&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;
*[[Falkirk]] similarly has several alternative medieval forms meaning "speckled church": ''Eglesbreth'' etc. from Cumbric (Welsh ''eglwys fraith''); ''Eiglesbrec'' etc. from Gaelic (modern Gaelic ''eaglais bhreac''); ''Faukirk'' etc. from Scots (Old English ''fāg cirice'').&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen" /&gt;
*[[Kirkintilloch]] began as a Cumbric name recorded as ''Caerpentaloch'' in the 10th century, but was partly replaced by the Gaelic words ''ceann'' "head" + ''tulach'' "hillock" later on.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;
*[[Kinneil House#Early history|Kinneil]] derives from Gaelic ''ceann fhàil'' "head of the [Antonine] Wall" but it was recorded by [[Nennius]] as ''Penguaul'' (Welsh ''pen gwawl'') and by [[Bede]] as ''Peanfahel'', which appears to be a merger of British and Gaelic.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

Among the evidence that Cumbric served as a [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] that influenced local English dialects are a group of [[counting]] systems, or scores, recorded in various parts of northern England. Around 100 of these systems have been collected since the 18th century; the scholarly consensus is that these derive from a Brittonic language closely related to Welsh.&lt;ref name=Filppula&gt;Filppula, Klemola, and Paulasto, pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they are often referred to as "sheep-counting numerals", most recorded scores were not used to count sheep, but in [[knitting]] or for [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]] or [[nursery rhyme]]s.&lt;ref name=Filppula/&gt; These scores are often suggested to represent a survival from medieval Cumbric, a theory first popularized in the 19th century. However, later scholars came to reject this idea, suggesting instead that the scores were later imports from either [[Wales]] or [[Scotland]], but in light of the dearth of evidence for any of these theories, Markku Filppula, Juhani Klemola, and Heli Paulasto note that it remains plausible that the counting systems are indeed of Cumbric origin.&lt;ref name=Filppula/&gt;

===Scots and English===
A number of words occurring in the [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England|Northern English]] variants of English have been proposed as being of possible Brittonic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ Dictionary of the Scots Language&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascertaining the real derivation of these words is far from simple, due in part to the similarities between some cognates in the Brittonic and [[Goidelic languages]] and the fact that borrowing took place in both directions between these languages. Another difficulty lies with other words which were taken into [[Old English]], as in many cases it is impossible to tell whether the borrowing is directly from Brittonic or not (see '''Brogat''', '''Crag'''). The following are possibilities:
*'''Bach'''&amp;nbsp;– cowpat (cf Welsh ''baw'' "dung", Gaelic ''buadhar'')
*'''Baivenjar'''&amp;nbsp;– mean fellow (Welsh ''bawyn'' "scoundrel")
*'''Brat'''&amp;nbsp;– apron. The word is found in Welsh ("''rag, cloth; pinafore''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Convery (ed.)|first=Anne|title=Collins Spurrell Pocket Welsh Dictionary|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Scots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northern English dialects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollinson|first=William|title=The Cumbrian Dictionary|year=1997|publisher=Smith Settle|location=Otley, UK|isbn=1-85825-067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may be an Old English borrowing from [[Old Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacBain|first=Alexander|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Brogat'''&amp;nbsp;– a type of [[mead]] (Welsh ''bragod'' "[[wikt:bragget|bragget]]"&amp;nbsp;– also found in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]])
*'''Coble'''&amp;nbsp;– small, flat-bottomed boat (also in Northeast England), akin to Welsh ''[[wikt:ceubal|ceubal]]'' "a hollow" and Latin ''[[wikt:caupulus|caupulus]]''
*'''Crag'''&amp;nbsp;– rocks. Either from Brittonic (Welsh ''craig'') or Goidelic ([[Scottish Gaelic]] ''creag'').
*'''Croot'''&amp;nbsp;– a small boy (Welsh ''crwt'', Gaelic ''cruit'' "someone small and humpbacked")
*'''Croude''' &amp;nbsp;– type of small harp (as opposed to a [[clàrsach]]; Welsh ''[[crwth]]'' "[[fiddle]]", Gaelic ''croit'')
*'''Lum'''&amp;nbsp;– Scottish word for chimney ([[Middle Welsh]] ''llumon'' "chimney")

==Equivalence with Old Welsh==
The linguistic term '''Cumbric''' is defined according to geographical rather than linguistic criteria: that is, it refers to the variety of Brittonic spoken within a particular region of [[North Britain]]&lt;ref name=CelticCulture/&gt; and implies nothing about that variety except that it was geographically distinct from other varieties. This has led to a discussion about the nature of Cumbric and its relationship with other Brittonic languages, in particular with [[Old Welsh]].

Linguists appear undecided as to whether Cumbric should be considered a separate language, or a dialect of Old Welsh. Koch calls it a dialect but goes on to say that some of the place names in the Cumbric region "clearly reflect a developed medieval language, much like Welsh, Cornish or Breton".&lt;ref name=CelticCulture/&gt;  Jackson also calls it a dialect but points out that "to call it Pr[imitive] W[elsh] would be inaccurate",&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;Jackson, K. H. (1956): Language and History in Early Britain, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly views it as distinct in some meaningful respect.

It has been suggested that Cumbric was more closely aligned to the [[Pictish language]]&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; than to Welsh, though there is considerable debate regarding the classification of that language. On the basis of place name evidence it has also been proposed that all three languages were very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. and Markus, G. (2006) The Place-names of Fife: West Fife between Leven and Forth: v.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole question is made more complex because there is no consensus as to whether any principled distinction can be made between [[Dialect#"Dialect" or "language"|languages and dialects]].

Below, some of the proposed differences between Cumbric and Old Welsh are discussed.

===Retention of Brittonic ''*rk''===
In Welsh, Cornish, and Breton, the Common Brittonic cluster ''*rk'' was [[lenition|spirantized]] to {{IPA|/rx/}} (Welsh ''rch'', Cornish ''rgh'', Breton ''rc'h'') but a number of place names appear to show Cumbric retained the [[stop consonant|stop]] in this position. [[Lanark]] and [[Lanercost]] are thought to contain the equivalent of Welsh ''llannerch'' 'clearing'.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, A.D. (2003): Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford: OUP&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence to the contrary, however, including the place names Powmaughan and Maughanby (containing Welsh ''Meirchion'')&lt;ref name=Ekwall/&gt; and the word ''kelchyn'' (related to Welsh ''cylch'').&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Jackson concludes that the change of Common Brittonic ''*rk'' &gt; /rx/ "''may'' have been somewhat later in Cumbric".&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;

===Retention of Brittonic ''*mb''===
There is evidence to suggest that the consonant cluster ''mb'' remained distinct in Cumbric later than the time it was assimilated to ''mm'' in Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. The cluster remains in:
* Old English ''Cumbraland'' "land of Cumbrians" (from Common Brittonic ''*kombrogi'', whence Welsh ''Cymru'' "Wales" also originates).
* ''Crombocwater'' and ''Crombokwatre'',&lt;ref name=Ekwall/&gt; two 14th-century records of [[Crummock Water]] and ''Crombok'' an 1189 record for Crummack Dale in [[Yorkshire]]&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; (from Common Brittonic ''*Crumbāco-'' "curved one" (W ''crwm'' "curved")).
* Cam Beck, the name of a stream in north Cumbria recorded as ''Camboc'' (1169) and believed to be from Common Brittonic ''*Cambāco-'' "crooked stream" (W ''cam'', CB ''kamm'').&lt;ref name=Ekwall/&gt;
* Crimple Beck, Yorkshire, which is said to derive from Common Brittonic. ''*Crumbopull-'' "crooked pool".&lt;ref name=Ekwall/&gt;  Here the ''b'' is assumed to have survived late enough to cause [[fortition|provection]].

Jackson notes that only in the north does the cluster appear in place names borrowed after ''circa'' 600AD and concludes that it may have been a later dialectal survival here.

===Syncope===
Jackson notes the legal term ''galnys'', equivalent to Welsh ''[[galanas]]'', may show syncope of internal syllables to be a feature of Cumbric. Further evidence is wanting, however.

===Devoicing===
James&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, A. G. (2008): 'A Cumbric Diaspora?' in Padel and Parsons (eds.) A Commodity of Good Names: essays in honour of Margaret Gelling, Shaun Tyas: Stamford, pp 187–203&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that devoicing appears to be a feature of many Cumbric place names. Devoicing of word final consonants is a feature of modern Breton&lt;ref&gt;Hemon, R. &amp; Everson, M. (trans.) (2007): Breton Grammar, Cathair na Mart, Éire: Evertype: p79&lt;/ref&gt; and, to an extent, Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish Language Partnership (2007): 'A Proposed Standard Written Form of Cornish' available at http://kernowek.net/&lt;/ref&gt; Watson&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, W. J. (1926): History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; notes initial devoicing in Tinnis Castle (in [[Drumelzier]]) (compare Welsh ''dinas'' 'fortress, city') as an example of this, which can also be seen in the Cornish [[Tintagel]], ''din'' 'fort'. Also notable are the different English names of two Welsh towns named ''Dinbych'' ('little fort'); [[Denbigh]] and [[Tenby]].

There is also a significant number of place names which do not support this theory. Devoke Water and Cumdivock (&amp;lt; ''Dyfoc'', according to Ekwall) and Derwent (&lt; [[Common Brittonic]] ''Derwentiō'') all have initial /d/. The name Calder (&amp;lt; Brit. ''*Caletodubro-'') in fact appears to show a voiced Cumbric consonant where Welsh has ''Calettwr'' by [[Fortition|provection]], which Jackson believes reflects an earlier stage of pronunciation. Jackson also notes that Old English had no internal or final /g/, so would be borrowed with /k/ by sound substitution. This can be seen in names with ''c, k, ck'' (e.g. Cocker &amp;lt; Brittonic ''*kukro-'',&lt;ref name=Ekwall/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=How is that an example? k to c and k to ck are not examples of g to k.}} Eccles &amp;lt; Brittonic ''eglēsia''&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;).

===Loss of /w/===
The Cumbric personal names Gospatrick, Gososwald and Gosmungo meaning 'servant of St...' (Welsh, Cornish, Breton ''gwas'' 'servant, boy') and the Galloway dialect word ''gossock'' 'short, dark haired inhabitant of Wigtownshire' (W. ''gwasog'' 'a servant'&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;) apparently show that the Cumbric equivalent of Welsh and Cornish ''gwas'' &amp; B ''gwaz'' 'servant' was ''*gos''.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;  Jackson suggests that it may be a survival of the original [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] form of the word in –o- (i.e. ''*uɸo-sto''&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;).

This idea is disputed by the ''Dictionary of the Scots Language'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the occurrence in Gospatrick's Writ of the word ''wassenas'' 'dependants',&lt;ref name="PNCu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phythian /&gt; thought to be from the same word ''gwas'', is evidence against Jackson's theory. Koch notes that the alternation between ''gwa-'' and ''go-'' is common among the Brittonic languages and does not amount to a systematic sound change in any of them.

===Semantics of ''Penn''===
In the ''[[Book of Aneirin]]'', a poem entitled '' "Peis Dinogat" '' (possibly set in the [[Lake District]] of [[Cumbria]]), contains a usage of the word ''penn'' "head" (attached to the names of several animals hunted by the protagonist), that is unique in medieval Welsh literature and may, according to Koch, reflect Cumbric influence ("[r]eferring to a single animal in this way is otherwise found only in Breton, and we have no evidence that the construction ever had any currency in the present-day Wales").&lt;ref name=CelticCulture/&gt; The relevant lines are:

:Pan elei dy dat ty e vynyd
:Dydygei ef penn ywrch penn gwythwch penn hyd
:Penn grugyar vreith o venyd
:Penn pysc o rayadyr derwennyd

Translated as:

: When your father went to [the] mountain
: He brought a head of buck, head of wild pig, head of stag
: Head of speckled grouse from [the] mountain
: Head of fish from [the] falls of Derwent

The form ''derwennydd'' however, is at odds with the absence of the ending ''-ydd'' noted below.

===Definite article===
The modern Brittonic languages have different forms of the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]]: Welsh ''yr, -'r, y'', Cornish ''an'', and Breton ''an, ar, al''. These are all taken to derive from an unstressed form of the Common Brittonic [[demonstrative]] ''*sindos'', altered by assimilation (compare the [[Irish declension#Articles|Gaelic articles]]).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; Throughout Old Welsh the article is ''ir'' (or ''-r'' after a vowel),&lt;ref&gt;Morris-Jones, J. (1913): A Welsh Grammar Historical and Comparative, Oxford: OUP, p192&lt;/ref&gt; but there is evidence in Cumbric for an article in ''-n'' alongside one in ''-r''. Note the following:

*Tallentire, Cumbria (''Talentir'' 1200–25): 'brow/end of the land' (Welsh ''tal y tir'')&lt;ref name=Ekwall /&gt;
*Triermain, Cumbria (''Trewermain, Treverman'' c 1200): 'homestead at the stone' (Welsh ''tre(f) y maen'')&lt;ref name=Ekwall /&gt;
*Treales, Lancashire (''Treueles'' 1086): possibly 'village of the court' (Welsh ''tre(f) y llys'').&lt;ref name=Ekwall /&gt;  But note [[Treflys]], [[Powys]] which has no article.
*Pen-y-Ghent, Yorkshire (''Penegent'' 1307):  'hill of the border country' (Welsh ''pen y gaint'').&lt;ref name=Ekwall /&gt;  The final element is disputed. Ekwall says it is identical to [[Kent]] (&amp;lt; Br ''*Kantion''), which is related to Welsh ''cant'' 'rim, border', though Mills&lt;ref name=Mills /&gt; gives 'coastal district' or 'land of the hosts or armies' for the county.
*Traquair, Borders (''Treverquyrd'' 1124):  'homestead on the River Quair' (Welsh ''tre(f) y Quair'').&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;Mackay, George (2002): Scottish Place Names, New Lanark: Lomond Books&lt;/ref&gt;
*Penicuik, [[Midlothian]] (''Penicok'' 1250):  'hill of the cuckoo' (Welsh ''pen y cog'')&lt;ref name=Mackay /&gt;
*Liscard, [[Wirral Peninsula]] (''Lisenecark'' 1260): possibly 'court of the rock' (Welsh ''llys y garreg''),&lt;ref name=CelticCulture /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekwall /&gt; but also suggested is Irish ''lios na carraige'' of identical meaning.&lt;ref name=Mills /&gt;  Although Koch cites this as an example of Cumbric, it lies outside his own definition of the Cumbric region.

===Absence of ''-ydd''===
Of all the names of possible Cumbric derivation, few are more certain than [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and [[River Derwent, Cumbria|Derwent]] which can be directly traced back to their Romano-British recorded forms ''Luguvalium'' and ''Derventio''.

The modern and medieval forms of Carlisle (''Luel'' c1050, ''Cardeol'' 1092, ''Karlioli'' c1100 (in the [[Medieval Latin]] [[genitive case]]), ''Cærleoil'' 1130) and Derwent (''Deorwentan stream'' c890 (Old English), ''Derewent'') suggest derivations from Br *''Luguvaljon'' and ''*Derwentjō''. But the Welsh forms ''Caerliwelydd'' and ''Derwennydd'' are derived from alternative forms ''*Luguvalijon, *Derwentijō''&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; which gave the ''-ydd'' ending. This appears to show a divergence between Cumbric and Welsh at a relatively early date.

If this was an early dialectal variation, it can't be applied as a universal sound law, as the equivalent of W ''mynydd'' 'mountain' occurs in a number of Cumbric names with the spirant intact: E.g. Mindrum (''Minethrum'' 1050) from 'mountain ridge' (Welsh ''mynydd trum'').&lt;ref name=Mills /&gt;  It might also be noted that Medieval Welsh forms of ''Caerliwelydd''&lt;ref&gt;Morris-Jones, J. (1918): Taliesin, London: Society of Cymmrodorion p209&amp;nbsp;– ''Chaer Liwelyd'' in ''Marwnad Rhun'' (''[[Book of Taliesin]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;
and ''Derwennydd''&lt;ref&gt;see extract from ''Peis Dinogat'' above&lt;/ref&gt; both occur in poems of supposed Cumbrian origin whose rhyme and metre would be disrupted if the ending were absent.

===Use of the name element ''Gos-''===
One particularly distinctive element of Cumbric is the repeated use of the element ''Gos-'' or ''Cos-'' (W. ''gwas'' 'boy, lad; servant, attendant') in personal names, followed by the name of a saint. The practice is reminiscent of Gaelic names such as ''Maol Choluim'' "Malcolm" and ''Gille Crìosd'' "Gilchrist", which have [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''maol'' (Old Irish ''máel'' 'bald, tonsured; servant') and ''gille'' (''servant, lad', &lt; Old Irish ''gilla'' 'a youth').

The most well-known example of this Cumbric naming practice is ''Gospatric'', which occurs as the name of several notable Anglo-Scottish noblemen in the 11th and 12th centuries. Other examples, standardised from original sources, include ''Gosmungo'' ([[Saint Mungo]]), ''Gososwald'' ([[Oswald of Northumbria]]) and ''Goscuthbert'' ([[Cuthbert]]).&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;Koch, J. T. (1983) 'The Loss of Final Syllables and Loss of Declension in Brittonic' in [Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 30: 214-220]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of extinction==
It is impossible to give an exact date of the extinction of Cumbric. However, there are some pointers which may give a reasonably accurate estimate. In the mid-11th century, some landowners still bore what appear to be Cumbric names. Examples of such landowners are Dunegal (Dyfnwal), lord of Strathnith or [[Nithsdale]];&lt;ref&gt;Oram, R.(2000): The Lordship of Galloway, Edinburgh: John Donald&lt;/ref&gt; Moryn (Morien), lord of Cardew and Cumdivock near Carlisle; and Eilifr (Eliffer), lord of Penrith.&lt;ref name="Phythian"&gt;Phythian-Adams, Charles (1996): Land of the Cumbrians, Aldershot: Scolar Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a village near Carlisle called [[Cumwhitton]] (earlier Cumquinton). This appears to contain the Norman name Quinton.&lt;ref name=PNCu&gt;Armstrong, A. M., Mawer, A., Stenton, F. M. and Dickens, B. (1952) The Place-Names of Cumberland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no Normans in this area until 1069 at the earliest.

In the [[Battle of the Standard]] in 1138, the Cumbrians are noted as a separate ethnic group. Given that their material culture was very similar to their Gaelic and Anglian neighbours, it is arguable that what set them apart was still their language.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, Richard (2004), David: The King Who Made Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; Also the castle at [[Castle Carrock]]&amp;nbsp;– Castell Caerog – dates from around 1160–1170. [[Barmulloch]], earlier Badermonoc (Cumbric "monk's dwelling"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Simon. "The Glasgow Story&amp;nbsp;– Early Times to 1560". {{cite web |url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSAG |title = The Glasgow Story: Beginnings: Early Times to 1560 |author = Taylor, Simon |publisher = The Glasgow Story |work =  |accessdate= 2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), was given to the church by [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] between 1153 and 1165.

A more controversial point is the surname Wallace. It means "Welshman". It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but given that the term was also used for local Cumbric speaking Strathclyde Welsh it seems equally if not more likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being "Welsh" due to their Cumbric language. Surnames in Scotland were not inherited before 1200 and not regularly until 1400. [[William Wallace]] (known in Gaelic as Uilleam Breatnach&amp;nbsp;– namely William the Briton or Welshman) came from the Renfrew area&amp;nbsp;– itself a Cumbric name. Wallace slew the sheriff of Lanark (also a Cumbric name) in 1297. Even if he had inherited the surname from his father, it is possible that the family spoke Cumbric within memory in order to be thus named.

There are also some historical pointers to a continuing separate ethnic identity. Prior to being crowned king of Scotland in 1124, [[David I of Scotland|David I]] was invested with the title Prince of the Cumbrians. [[William the Lion]] between 1173–1180 made an address to his subjects, identifying the Cumbrians as a separate group.&lt;ref name="Broun" /&gt; This does not prove that any of them still spoke Cumbric at this time.

The legal documents in the Lanercost Cartulary, dating from the late 12th century, show witnesses with Norman French or English names, and no obvious Cumbric names. Though these people represent the upper classes, it seems significant that by the late 12th century in the Lanercost area, Cumbric is not obvious in these personal names.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;Todd, J. M. (ed.) (1991) The Lanercost Cartulary, Carlisle: CWAAS&lt;/ref&gt; In 1262 in Peebles, jurymen in a legal dispute over peat cutting also have names which mostly appear Norman French or English,&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;Chambers, W. (1864) A History of Peebleshire, Edinburgh: W &amp; M Chambers&lt;/ref&gt; but possible exceptions are Gauri Pluchan, Cokin Smith and Robert Gladhoc, where ''Gladhoc'' has the look of an adjective similar to Welsh "gwladog" = "countryman".&lt;ref name=GPC&gt;Prifysgol Cymru. (2002) Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru: Caerdydd: Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru&lt;/ref&gt; In the charters of [[Wetherall]] Priory near Carlisle there is a monk called Robert Minnoc who appears as a witness to 8 charters dating from around 1260.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, J. E. (ed.) (1897) Register of Wetheral Priory, Carlisle: CWAAS&lt;/ref&gt; His name is variously spelled Minnoc/Minot/Mynoc and it is tempting to see an equivalent of the Welsh "mynach"&amp;nbsp;– "Robert the Monk" here.

Given that the Anglicisation of the upper classes in general has happened before the Anglicisation of the peasantry in other areas which have given up speaking Celtic languages it is not implausible that the peasantry continued to speak Cumbric for at least a little while after. Around 1200 there is a list of the names of men living in the area of [[Peebles]].&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt; Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of [[Saint Patrick]], Gosmungo: servant of [[Saint Mungo]], Guososwald: servant of [[Oswald of Northumbria]] and Goscubrycht: servant of [[Cuthbert]]. Two of the saints&amp;nbsp;– Oswald and Cuthbert&amp;nbsp;— are from [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.

The royal seal of [[Alexander III of Scotland]] (who reigned 4 September 1241&amp;nbsp;– 19 March 1286) bore the title "Rex Scotorum et Britanniarum", or "King of Scots and Britons".

In 1305 [[Edward I of England]] prohibited the ''[[Leges inter Brettos et Scottos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, G. W. S. (2005) Robert Bruce &amp; the Community of the Realm of Scotland, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The term Brets or Britons refers to the native, traditionally Cumbric speaking people of southern Scotland.

It seems that Cumbric could well have survived into the middle of the 12th century as a community language and even lasted into the 13th on the tongues of the last remaining speakers. Certain areas seem to be particularly dense in Cumbric place-names even down to very minor features. The two most striking of these are around [[Lanercost]] east of Carlisle and around [[Torquhan]] south of Edinburgh. If the 1262 names from Peebles do contain traces of Cumbric personal names then we can imagine Cumbric dying out between 1250 and 1300 at the very latest.

==Modern Revival==
In the 2000s, a group of enthusiasts proposed a revival of the Cumbric language and launched a social networking site and a "revived Cumbric" guidebook to promote it, but with little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= New website launched for people who want to talk in Cumbric|author= Meg Jorsh|url= http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/new_website_launched_for_people_who_want_to_talk_in_cumbric_1_568605|newspaper= News and Star|date= 16 June 2009|accessdate= 8 December 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120322012011/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/new_website_launched_for_people_who_want_to_talk_in_cumbric_1_568605|archivedate= 22 March 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title= Cumbraek: A modern reinvention of the lost Celtic language of Cumbric |author= |url= https://cumbraek.wordpress.com/|website= Cumbraek|date= |accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Carn]]'' magazine, Colin Lewis noted that there was disagreement in the group about whether to base "revived Cumbric" on the surviving sources for the language or try to reconstruct the form Late Cumbric may have taken after the attested period, but his own suggestion was simply to use [[Modern Welsh]], with its rich literature, culture and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lewis|first1= Colin|last2= |first2= |year= 2009|title= Cumbrian Welsh – an update|journal= [[Carn]]|volume= 144 |pages= 10|url= http://www.celticleague.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/CARN-144-October-2009.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curry's paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in which an arbitrary claim F is proved from the mere existence of a sentence C that says of itself "If C, then F", requiring only a few apparently innocuous logical deduction rules. Since F is arbitrary, any logic having these rules [[principle of explosion|proves everything]]. The paradox may be expressed in natural language and in various [[logic]]s, including certain forms of [[set theory]], [[lambda calculus]], and [[combinatory logic]].

The paradox is named after the logician [[Haskell Curry]]. It has also been called '''Löb's paradox''' after [[Martin Hugo Löb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barwise |first1=Jon |authorlink1=Jon Barwise |last2=Etchemendy |first2=John |authorlink2=John Etchemendy |title=The Liar: An Essay on Truth and Circularity |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0195059441 |page=23 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/LogicMathematics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195059441 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its relationship to [[Löb's theorem]].

==In natural language==

Claims of the form "if A, then B" are called [[indicative conditional|conditional]] claims.  Curry's paradox uses a particular kind of self-referential conditional sentence, as demonstrated in this example:

:If this sentence is true, then Germany borders China.

Even though [[Germany]] does not border [[China]], the example sentence certainly is a natural-language sentence, and so the truth of that sentence can be analyzed. The paradox follows from this analysis. The analysis consists of two steps.

# First, common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true. 
# Second, the truth of the example sentence can be used to prove that Germany borders China. Because Germany does not border China, this suggests that there has been an error in one of the proofs.

The claim "Germany borders China" could be replaced by any other claim, and the sentence would still be provable. Thus every sentence appears to be provable.  Because the proof uses only well-accepted methods of deduction, and because none of these methods appears to be incorrect, this situation is paradoxical.&lt;ref&gt;A parallel example is explained in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. See {{Cite SEP |url-id=curry-paradox|title=Curry's Paradox|first=Lionel|last=Shapiro|last2=Beal|first2=Jc|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal proof===

The standard method for proving [[conditional sentence]]s (sentences of the form "if A, then B") is called a "[[conditional proof]]".   In this method, in order to prove "if A, then B", first A is assumed and then with that assumption B is shown to be true.

To produce Curry's paradox, as described in the two steps above, apply this method to the sentence "if this sentence is true, then Germany borders China".  Here A, "this sentence is true", refers to the overall sentence, while B is "Germany borders China".  So, assuming A is the same as assuming "If A, then B". Therefore, in assuming A, we have assumed both A and "If A, then B".  Therefore B is true, by [[modus ponens]], and we have proven "If this sentence is true, then 'Germany borders China' is true." in the usual way, by assuming the hypothesis and deriving the conclusion.

Now, because we have proved "If this sentence is true, then 'Germany borders China' is true", then
we can again apply modus ponens, because we know that the claim "this sentence is true" is correct. In this way, we can deduce that Germany borders China.

== Formal proof ==
===Sentential logic===
The example in the previous section used unformalized, natural-language reasoning. Curry's paradox also occurs in some varieties of [[formal logic]]. In this context, it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence (X → Y), where X itself is equivalent to (X → Y), then we can prove ''Y'' with a formal proof. One example of such a formal proof is as follows. For an explanation of the logic notation used in this section, refer to the [[Logic notation|list of logic symbols]].

# X := (X → Y)
#: ''assumption'', the starting point, equivalent to "If this sentence is true, then Y"
# X → X
#: ''[[law of identity]]''
# X → (X → Y)
#: ''substitute right side of 2'', since X is equivalent to X → Y by 1
# X → Y
#: from 3 by ''[[rule of contraction|contraction]]''
# X
#: ''substitute 4'', by 1
# Y
#: from 5 and 4 by ''[[modus ponens]]''

An alternative proof is via ''[[Peirce's law]]''. If X = X → Y then (X → Y) → X. This together with Peirce's law ((X → Y) → X) → X and ''[[modus ponens]]'' implies X and subsequently Y (as in above proof).

Therefore, if Y is an unprovable statement in a formal system, there is no statement X in that system such that X is equivalent to the implication (X → Y). By contrast, the previous section shows that in natural (unformalized) language, for every natural language statement Y there is a natural language statement Z such that Z is equivalent to (Z → Y) in natural language. Namely, Z is "If this sentence is true then Y".

In specific cases where the classification of Y is already known, few steps are needed to reveal the contradiction. For example, when Y is "Germany borders China," it is known that Y is false.

# X = (X → Y)
#: assumption
# X = (X → false)
#: substitute known value of Y
# X = (¬X ∨ false)
#: ''[[logical implication|implication]]''
# X = ¬X
#: identity

=== Naive set theory ===

Even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences, certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to Curry's paradox. In set theories that allow [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|unrestricted comprehension]], we can nevertheless prove any logical statement ''Y'' by examining the set

: &lt;math&gt;X \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \left\{ x \mid x \in x \to Y \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; [[order of operations|takes precedence]] over both &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, the proof proceeds as follows:
# &lt;math&gt; X = \left\{ x \mid x \in x  \to Y \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
#: Definition of X
# &lt;math&gt; x = X \to (x \in x \leftrightarrow X \in X) &lt;/math&gt;
#: Substitution of equal sets in membership 
# &lt;math&gt; x = X \to ( (x \in x \to Y) \leftrightarrow (X \in X \to Y) ) &lt;/math&gt;
#: Addition of a consequent to both sides of a biconditional (from 2)
# &lt;math&gt; X \in X \leftrightarrow (X \in X \to Y) &lt;/math&gt;
#: Law of concretion (from 1 and 3)
# &lt;math&gt; X \in X \to (X \in X \to Y) &lt;/math&gt;
#: Biconditional elimination (from 4)
# &lt;math&gt; X \in X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;
#: Contraction (from 5)
# &lt;math&gt;(X \in X \to Y) \to X \in X &lt;/math&gt;
#: Biconditional elimination (from 4)
# &lt;math&gt; X \in X                       &lt;/math&gt;
#: Modus ponens (from 6 and 7)
# &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt;
#: Modus ponens (from 8 and 6)

Step 4 is the only step invalid in a consistent set theory. In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], an extra hypothesis stating the sethood of ''X'' would be required, which is provable in neither ZF nor in its extension ZFC (with the [[axiom of choice]]).

Therefore, in a consistent set theory, the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ x \mid x \in x \to Y \right\}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist for false ''Y''. This can be seen as a variant on [[Russell's paradox]], but is not identical. Some proposals for set theory have attempted to deal with [[Russell's paradox]] not by restricting the rule of comprehension, but by restricting the rules of logic so that it tolerates the contradictory nature of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The existence of proofs like the one above shows that such a task is not so simple, because at least one of the deduction rules used in the proof above must be omitted or restricted.

=== Lambda calculus ===

Curry's paradox may be expressed in [[Lambda calculus]].  Consider a function ''r'' defined as
: ''r'' = (λ''x''. ((''x'' ''x'') → ''y'')).

Then (''r'' ''r'') [[Lambda calculus#β-reduction|β-reduces]] to
: (''r'' ''r'') → ''y''.

If (''r'' ''r'') is false, then (''r'' ''r'') → ''y'' is true by the [[principle of explosion]], which is a contradiction of the equivalence of the β-reduction.  So (''r'' ''r'') is true, so its reduct (''r'' ''r'') → ''y'' is also true, and, by [[modus ponens]], so is ''y''.  As ''y'' can be any statement, any statement may be proved true.

Thus (''r'' ''r'') is a non-terminating computation.  Considered as logic, (''r'' ''r'') is an expression for a value that does not exist.

In [[simply typed lambda calculus]], such terms, like any [[Lambda calculus#Recursion and fixed points|fixed-point combinators]], cannot be [[simply typed lambda calculus#Typing rules|typed]] and hence are not admitted.

=== Combinatory logic ===

Curry's paradox may also be expressed in [[combinatory logic]], which has equivalent expressive power to [[lambda calculus]]. Any lambda expression may be translated into combinatory logic, so a translation of the implementation of Curry's paradox in lambda calculus would suffice.

If ''m'' is the implication function taking two parameters (that is m A B is equivalent to A → B), then r in combinatory logic is
: r = S (S (K m) (S I I)) (K y),
then
: r r = m (r r) y.

The paradox may also be produced using the [[Fixed-point combinator|Curry's paradoxical combinator]], where
: &lt;math&gt; f = \lambda x.x \to y &lt;/math&gt; = S m (K y).
Then
: Y f
is the solution of
: &lt;math&gt; x = x \to y, &lt;/math&gt;
so 
: Y f = m (Y f) y.

== Discussion ==

Curry's paradox can be formulated in any language supporting basic logic operations that also allows a self-recursive function to be constructed as an expression.  Two mechanisms that support the construction of the paradox are self-reference (the ability to refer to "this sentence" from within a sentence) and [[Unrestricted comprehension]] in naive set theory. Natural languages nearly always contain many of features that could be used to construct the paradox, as do many other languages. Usually the addition of meta programming capabilities to a language will add the features needed. Mathematical logic generally does not countenance explicit reference to its own sentences.  However the heart of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] is the observation that a different form of self-reference can be added; see [[Gödel number]].

The axiom of [[Unrestricted comprehension#Unrestricted comprehension|Unrestricted comprehension]] adds the ability to construct a recursive definition in set theory.  This axiom is not supported by [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|modern set theory]].

The logic rules used in the construction of the proof are [[natural deduction|rule of assumption]] for conditional proof, the rule of [[rule of contraction|contraction]], and [[modus ponens]].  These are included in the most common logical systems, such as first-order logic.

=== Consequences for some formal logic ===

In the 1930s, Curry's Paradox and the related [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]] played a major role in showing that formal logic systems based on self-recursive expressions are [[Consistency|inconsistent]].
These include some versions of [[lambda calculus]] and [[combinatory logic]].

Curry began with the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=S. C. |last=Kleene |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J. B. |last2=Rosser |title=The inconsistency of certain formal logics |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=630–636 |year=1935 |doi=10.2307/1968646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and deduced that the core problem could be expressed in this simpler Curry's paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Inconsistency of Certain Formal Logics |first=Haskell B. |last=Curry |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1942 |pages=115–117 |jstor=2269292 |doi=10.2307/2269292}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion may be stated as saying that combinatory logic and lambda calculus cannot be made consistent as deductive languages, while still allowing recursion.

In the study of illative (deductive) [[combinatory logic]], Curry in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curry |first=Haskell B. |authorlink=Haskell Curry |title=The Paradox of Kleene and Rosser |journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society |year=1941 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=454–516 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1941-0005275-6 |mr=0005275  |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1941-050-03/S0002-9947-1941-0005275-6/ |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the implication of the paradox as implying that, without restrictions, the following properties of a combinatory logic are incompatible:

# ''Combinatorial completeness''. This means that an abstraction operator is definable (or primitive) in the system, which is a requirement on the expressive power of the system.
# ''Deductive completeness''.  This is a requirement on derivability, namely, the principle that in a formal system with material implication and modus ponens, if Y is provable from the hypothesis X, then there is also a proof of X → Y.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stenlund |first=Sören |title=Combinators, λ-terms, and Proof Theory |year=1972 |publisher=[[D. Reidel]] |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-9027703057 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==

Note that unlike the liar paradox or Russell's paradox, Curry's paradox does not depend on what [[law of non-contradiction|model of negation]] is used, as it is completely negation-free. Thus [[paraconsistent logics]] can still be vulnerable to this paradox, even if they are immune to the liar paradox.

=== No resolution in lambda calculus ===

The origin of [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] may have been, "How can you solve an equation, to provide a definition of a function?".  This is expressed in this equivalence,
: &lt;math&gt;f\ x = y \iff f = \lambda x.y. &lt;/math&gt;

This definition is valid if there is one and only one function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;f\ x = y &lt;/math&gt;, but invalid otherwise.  This is the core of the problem that [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] and then [[Haskell Curry]] discovered with combinatory logic and Lambda calculus.

The situation may be compared to defining
: &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 \iff x = \sqrt{y}. &lt;/math&gt;

This definition is fine as long as only positive values are allowed for the square root.  In mathematics an [[Existential quantification|existentially quantified]] variable may represent multiple values, but only one at a time.  Existential quantification is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of many instances of an equation.  In each equation is one value for the variable.

However, in mathematics, an expression with no [[Free variables and bound variables|free variables]] must have one and only one value.  So &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{4} &lt;/math&gt; can only represent &lt;math&gt;+2&lt;/math&gt;.  However there is no convenient way to restrict the lambda abstraction to one value or to assure that there is a value.

Lambda calculus allows recursion by passing the same function that is called as a parameter.  This allows situations where &lt;math&gt;f\ x = y &lt;/math&gt; has multiple or no solutions for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Lambda calculus may be considered as part of mathematics if only lambda abstractions that represent a single solution to an equation are allowed.  Other lambda abstractions are incorrect in mathematics.

Curry's paradox and other paradoxes arise in Lambda calculus because of the inconsistency of Lambda calculus considered as a [[deductive system]].  See also [[deductive lambda calculus]].

====Domain of lambda calculus terms====

Lambda calculus is a consistent theory in its [[Deductive lambda calculus#Domain of lambda calculus|own domain]].  However, it is not consistent to add the lambda abstraction definition to [[mathematics|general mathematics]].  Lambda terms describe values from the lambda calculus domain.  Each lambda term has a value in that domain.

When translating expressions from mathematics to lambda calculus, the domain of lambda calculus terms is not always [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the domain of the mathematical expressions.  This lack of isomorphism is the source of the apparent contradictions.

=== Resolution in unrestricted languages ===

There are many language constructs that implicitly invoke an equation that may have none or many solutions.  The sound resolution to this problem is to syntactically link these expressions to an existentially quantified variable.  The variable represents the multiple values in a way that is meaningful in common human reasoning, but is also valid in mathematics.

For example, a natural language that allows the ''Eval'' function is not mathematically consistent.  But each call to ''Eval'' in that natural language may be translated into mathematics in a way that is consistent. The translation of ''Eval(s)'' into mathematics is
: let x = Eval(s) in x.

So where s = "Eval(s) → y",
: let x = x → y in x.

If y is false, then the x = x → y is false, but this is a falsehood, not a paradox.

The existence of the variable x was implicit in the natural language.  The variable x is created when the natural language is translated into mathematics. This allows us to use natural language, with natural semantics, while maintaining mathematical integrity.

=== Resolution in formal logic ===

The argument in formal logic starts with assuming the validity of naming (X → Y) as X.  However, this is not a valid starting point.  First we must deduce the validity of the naming.  The following theorem is easily proved and represents such a naming:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall A, \exists X, X = A. &lt;/math&gt;

In the above statement the formula A is named as X.  Now attempt to [[Universal instantiation|instantiate]] the formula with (X → Y) for A.  However, this is not possible, as the scope of &lt;math&gt; \exists X &lt;/math&gt; is inside the scope of &lt;math&gt; \forall A &lt;/math&gt;.  The order of the quantifiers may be reversed using [[Skolem normal form|Skolemization]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists f, \forall A, f(A) = A. &lt;/math&gt;

However, now instantiation gives

:&lt;math&gt; f(X \to Y) = X \to Y, &lt;/math&gt;

which is not the starting point for the proof and does not lead to a contradiction.  There are no other instantiations for A that lead to the starting point of the paradox.

===Resolution in set theory===

In [[ZFC|Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] the [[Axiom schema of specification|axiom of unrestricted comprehension]] is replaced with a group of axioms that allow construction of sets.  So Curry's paradox cannot be stated in ZFC.  ZFC evolved in response to Russell's paradox.

In [[phonetics]], a '''diphone''' is an adjacent pair of [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]. It is usually used to refer to a recording of the transition between two phones.

In the following diagram, a stream of phones are represented by P1, P2, etc., and the corresponding diphones are represented by D1-2, D2-3, etc.:

 |P1===|P2===|P3===|P4===|P5===|P6===|
 |D1-2=|D2-3=|D3-4=|D4-5=|D5-6=|

If the number of phones in a language is P, then the theoretical number of possible diphones is P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although since all languages have restrictions about what sounds can occur next to each other (see ''[[phonotactics]]''), the number of diphones in each language is usually much smaller than P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has about 800 diphones and [[German language|German]] has about 2,500. 

Diphones are useful in [[speech synthesis]]: When pre-recorded diphones are combined to create synthesized speech, the resulting sounds are much more natural than combining just simple phones, because the pronunciations of each phone varies based on the surrounding phones.

| footer = Disciplining in BDSM may involve giving punishment when rules are broken, such as by [[whipping]] (''top left''), making the submissive stand motionless for long after [[spanking]] her buttocks (''top right''), or [[erotic humiliation|public humiliation]] by stripping her naked and putting her in [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] (''bottom'').
}}

'''Discipline''' in [[BDSM]] is the practice where the dominant sets rules for the submissive that he/she is expected to obey. When rules of expected behaviour are broken, punishment is often used as a means of [[Discipline|disciplining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|date=Oct 2012 |title=Bound and Shagged: Discipline |url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2012/10/05/bound-and-shagged-discipline/ |publisher=Swarthmore College Daily|access-date=27 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
In BDSM, rules can be made so that a submissive ("sub") knows how they should behave (so that the dominant is not displeased). Rules can also be for reminding subs of their inferior status, or for training a novice sub. When such rules are broken, punishment is often used as a means of discipline. Punishment itself can be physical (such as [[caning]]) or psychological (such as public [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]]) or a combination of both (i.e., through [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]). 

The goal of discipline is to teach the sub that they have made a mistake, so that they learn self-restraint and become a better sub in the future. The punishment is generally related to the mistake, and is generally proportionate to the severity and frequency of the mistake. For example, a punishment for speaking out of turn for the first time may be a simple restraint (such as being silenced using a [[gag]]). The sub may also be given the option of choosing a punishment (i.e., to be either caned on the [[buttocks]] or slapped on the face).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Social Deviance, page 75, SAGE Publications, 2017 {{ISBN|9781483364698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishments done on BDSM submissives, even very harsh ones, should not be confused with [[sadomasochism]]. S&amp;M involves giving pain/torture to a "sub" for the enjoyment of "sub" and/or "dom". Contrarily, punishments for disciplining are in response to violations of predetermined rules by a sub, or for otherwise displeasing the dominant. Punishment is considered a necessary evil in BDSM, as without it, a sub may repeat mistakes and thus not improve as a sub. 'BDSM punishment' is also not 'forced abuse' – in the former a sub must have granted the trainer prior authority to punish. Punishment should also not be confused with BDSM training which may involve giving pain just for increasing the endurance limit of the sub.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism: How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 71. Daedalus Publishing Company, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, disciplining may avoid punishment altogether, and just a hard glance or loud voice from the dominant may be effective. 

Contrary to [[Punishment (psychology)|punishments]], disciplining may also involve [[Reinforcement#Positive_reinforcement|positive reinforcement]]. This includes rewarding the slave for good behaviour (such as by calling the sub "loyal slave" or allowing them to sleep on bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|date=October 2015 |title=What is BDSM? |url=http://www.mensxp.com/dating/inner-game/7491-what-is-bdsm.html |publisher=MensXP|access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]] described his conversation about Felix Flying Hawk with the famous American writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher [[Elbert Hubbard]]:&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent public television documentary on the life of Elbert Hubbard see https://www.pbs.org/wned/elbert-hubbard/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Elbert Hubbard and the writer sat at the small table in [[The Pennsylvania Society]] rehearsing mutual old time experiences in the west, particularly, tales relating, and had himself been adopted into the tribe, but recently.  Memory may be slightly at fault, but as now recalled, there were a couple of champagne glasses, partly full, on the same table.  The letter from Felix, apologizing for the delay of repaying a $30 loan and explaining how he had made a trip to Rapid and found the letter which had lain in the post office for months, how he had corrected the address, got it on its way to discharge his obligation, this letter had just come in the afternoon mail; the writer drew it from his pocket and handed it to Hubbard to read.  When he had completed the reading, and asked a few pertinent questions about the author, he folded it and deliberately placed it in his own pocket, saying it would be the subject of a new [[A Message to Garcia]] which he was going to write.  Before he had accomplished this planned project for the thrill and edification of his world-wide fraternity of readers, the [[RMS Lusitania]] took America's greatest modern writer and philosopher to the bottom of the sea on May 17, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Major Israel McCreight, "The Story of Felix Flying Hawk: Rustler Victim"'' in ''"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe"'', p.36-38, Nupp Printing Co, Sykesville, Pa (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== David Flying Hawk ==
===A Horse Named "King Tut"===
David Flying Hawk was the eldest son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a performer with [[Wild West Shows]] and traveled with his grandfather [[Flying Hawk|Chief Flying Hawk]]. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named "King Tut."  "King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at [[Tribune, Kansas|Tribune]], Kansas.  The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying quite a bit of news about it, therefore the name King Tut.  The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse.  A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the [[Knights of Columbus]] rodeo with us in 1924.  This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders.  Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil.  The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in.  King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first.  There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works.  While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back.  When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk.  The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit.  It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild.  They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on.  That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo.  We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year.  I heard a few years ago that they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board." &lt;ref&gt;Bill King and Wanda Ellis, "Those Old King Bucking Horses", ''True West'', December 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Arrest of David Flying Hawk===
On March 25, 1927, [[Flying Hawk|Chief Flying Hawk]] wrote [[Major Israel McCreight]] for assistance, reporting that David had been arrested and jailed for horse stealing. McCreight well recalled the story of David’s father, Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight’s considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David’s family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix’s farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight.  "And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings." McCreight reported that, "My investigation shows that he was charged with stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands.  It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials.  There seems little or no legal remedy for it." David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;David Flying Hawk (June 5, 1903-April, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Felix Flying Hawk and Major Israel McCreight==
Felix Flying Hawk wrote letters on behalf of his father [[Flying Hawk|Chief Flying Hawk]] and corresponded with  [[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]] from 1912 until 1944. The letters are a part of the "Major Israel McCreight Archives" at the [http://duboishs.com/ Du Bois Area Historical Society]

'''Fernando Monteiro de Castro Soromenho''' ([[Chinde District]], [[Mozambique]], 31 January 1910 – [[São Paulo]], 18 June 1968) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] journalist and writer of fiction and ethnology. He is regarded both as a Portuguese [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realist]] and a novelist of [[Angola]]n literature.

==Biography==
Born in Mozambique, Castro Soromenho was the son of Artur Ernesto de Castro Soromenho, governor of Lunda, and Stela Fernançole de Leça Monteiro, a native of [[Porto]] from a [[Cape Verde]]an family. When he was one year old, they moved to Angola. Between 1916 and 1925, he attended primary and secondary school in [[Lisbon]]. He then returned to Angola, where he worked for an Angolan diamond company. Following that, he began an entry-level position in government administration, serving in the hinterlands in the eastern region of the colony. Later, he became an editor of the newspaper ''[[Diário de Luanda]]''. In 1937 he returned to Lisbon where he worked at several newspapers such as ''[[Humanidade]]'' (the weekly edition of the ''[[Diário Popular (Lisboa)|Diário Popular]]''), ''[[A Noite]]'', ''[[Jornal da Tarde (Lisboa)|Jornal da Tarde]]'', ''[[O Século]]'', ''[[Seara Nova]]'', ''[[O Diabo (jornal)|O Diabo]]'', ''[[O Primeiro de Janeiro]]'' and ''[[Dom Casmurro (jornal)|Dom Casmurro]]''. He also collaborated on an account of the Portuguese explorers in Africa, No. 12 of the magazine ''Mundo literário'' (1946–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/Periodicos/MundoLiterario/MundoLiterario.htm Mundo literário : semanário de crítica e informação literária, científica e artística  (1946–1948)  [cópia digital, Hemeroteca Digital&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, he married Mercedes de la Cuesta in Argentina. As a consequence of having criticized the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] regime in Portugal, he was forced to leave for exile in France in 1960. He later went to the United States, where he taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] for six months in 1961&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;Russell G.

He returned to France in August 1961 and worked at the magazines ''Présence Africane'' and ''Révolution''. In December 1965, he went to live in Brazil, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching courses in the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities at the [[University of São Paulo]] and at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities at Araraquara.

He also dedicated himself to the study of Angolan ethnography, having been one of the founders of the Center for African Studies at the University of São Paulo.

'''Formalism''' is a school of [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply "brackets" (''i.e.'', ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.

==In literary theory==
In [[literary theory]], formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] but also literary devices such as meter and [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.

Formalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against [[Romanticist]] theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, [[Russian formalism]], and soon after Anglo-American [[New Criticism]]. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in [[René Wellek]] and [[Austin Warren]]'s ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1948, 1955, 1962).

Beginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;“Formalism and its Malcontents: Benjamin and de Man on the Function of Allegory”, Jim Hansen, New Literary History, 2004, Vol. 35, No. 4, 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
William H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, WIlliam H. "Advocating Language: An Ethical Approach to Politics in the Classroom". ''The Ethics of Writing Instruction''. Michael Pemberton, ed. Stamford: Ablex Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"&gt;Cain, Mary Ann. "Problematizing Formalism: A Double-Cross of Genre Boundaries." ''College Composition and Communication''. 51:1 Sept 1999. 89-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a "natural" act, one not subject to instruction.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;
In regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;

==Research==
Formalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.

===Russian formalism===
{{Main|Russian formalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Russian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by [[Boris Eichenbaum]], [[Viktor Shklovsky]] and [[Yury Tynyanov]], and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by [[Roman Jakobson]]. (The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:
*The aim is to produce "a science of literature that would be both independent and factual," which is sometimes designated by the term ''[[poetics]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Since literature is made of language, linguistics will be a foundational element of the science of literature.
*Literature is autonomous from external conditions in the sense that literary language is distinct from ordinary uses of language, not least because it is not (entirely) communicative.
*Literature has its own history, a history of innovation in formal structures, and is not determined (as some crude versions of Marxism have it) by external, material history.
*What a work of literature says cannot be separated from ''how'' the literary work says it, and therefore the form and  of a work, far from being merely the decorative wrapping of an isolable content, is in fact part of the content of the work.

According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (''ostraneniye,'' more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (''[[syuzhet]]/fabula''). "Defamiliarization" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its "literariness." For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.

This emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was [[Leon Trotsky]]'s ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' (1924).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that "the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: "The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that "Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.

==The Prague Circle and structuralism==
{{Main|Prague linguistic circle}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''Fragmentology''' is the study of surviving fragments of medieval or renaissance manuscripts.  A manuscript fragment may consist of whole or partial leaves, typically made of [[parchment]], conjugate pairs or sometimes gatherings of a parchment book or [[codex]], or parts of single-leaf documents such as [[Act (document)|notarial acts]]. They are commonly found in book bindings, especially printed books from the 15th to the 17th centuries, used in a variety of ways such as wrappers or covers for the book, as endpapers, or cut into pieces and used to reinforce the binding.

In recent years, fragmentology has become an active part of scholarly [[medieval studies]] fuelled by the abundance in institutional libraries of binding fragments that have never been studied or even catalogued. A number of symposia, websites and projects have been formed to pursue the study.

==Fragments used in bookbindings==

Leaves and parts of parchment leaves have been used in bindings of manuscripts since the Middle Ages.  The use of manuscript fragments in bindings increased greatly at the end of the 15th century when printed books began to appear in increasing numbers, supplanting many older manuscripts.&lt;ref name="pickwoad"&gt;"{{cite conference

Removal of these fragments destroys important context and evidence and is strongly criticized by scholars.  Where it is necessary to remove such fragments, accepted practice requires they be preserved with the book and their original location recorded.

==Evidentiary value of fragments==

Manuscript fragments may provide a variety of useful evidence for [[medievalist]]s, [[bibliographer]]s and [[Palaeography|paleographers]], including:

* Preservation of a unique or rare text or other writing.
* Preservation of early or significant script.
* Evidence where a book was bound.  Since medieval manuscripts generally did not travel far from where they were produced, the fact that a binding incorporates fragments of a manuscript from a known location may be evidence that the book was bound there or nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hrc.utexas.edu/2014/01/20/cisiojanus/ Katz, Farley, Rare French "Cisiojanus" fragment identified in bookbinding through crowdsourcing project, Cultural Compass], [[Harry Ransom Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence concerning the book binder.  The fact that fragments of the same manuscript are found in various bookbindings may connect the bindings, perhaps to a specific binder.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Kidd, Review: Fragments of Medieval Manuscripts Used as Pastedowns in Oxford Bindings, with a Survey of Oxford Binding c. 1515-1620, The Library: The Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, Vol. 7, No. 4 (December 2006), pp. 459-461.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Evidence of ownership or [[provenance]].
* The internal and external structure of the [[bookbinding]].

==Modern breaking of manuscripts==
[[File:13th century cut out.jpg|thumb|Illuminated letter with painting of John, cut out from 13th century manuscript]]
[[File:MS Lat 171.jpg|thumb|Franciscan Breviary, Italy 1465, with illuminated letters cut out]]
Beginning in the nineteenth century, collectors cut ornamented initial letters and miniatures from illuminated manuscripts.  In the twentieth century some book dealers began removing leaves from manuscripts to be sold for greater profit as individual pages or keepsakes.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;"{{cite web |url=https://manuscriptroadtrip.wordpress.com/2015/07/13/manuscript-road-trip-the-promise-of-digital-fragmentology/ |title= Manuscript Road Trip: The Promise of Digital Fragmentology|last=Davis |first=Lisa Fagin |date=13 July 2015 |website= |publisher= |access-date=16 Jan 2017 |quote=}}"&lt;/ref&gt;  This "breaking" of manuscripts has been most common with [[book of hours|books of hours]] which contain illuminated pages, gilding and attractive decorations. "As a result, today there are tens of thousands of single leaves in several hundred U.S. collections."&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; This practice continues today and many individual leaves of books of hours and [[antiphonal]]s are available on eBay and from book and manuscript dealers.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Mauk, [http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/scattered-leaves/  "Scattered Leaves,"] The New Yorker (Jan. 6, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars strongly condemn this practice, even where the manuscript is incomplete to begin with, as it destroys the integrity and evidence of the entire manuscript.  The most famous or infamous manuscript breaker was [[Otto Ege]], who dismembered many complete and fragmentary manuscripts to sell the leaves individually or in large boxed collections.

==Digital fragmentology==
Scholars have studied Otto Ege's dismemberment and sale of manuscript leaves and have attempted to locate the present locations of the leaves of some of those manuscripts.  A number of online projects have been started to collect images of these and other manuscript leaves in a virtual reconstruction of the original manuscripts.  This has been referred to as "digital fragmentology."&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;  Websites have also been used to identify and date manuscript fragments through [[crowdsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hrc.utexas.edu/2014/01/20/archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success/ Erwin, Micah, Archivist declares medieval manuscript fragment crowdsourcing project success, [[Harry Ransom Center]]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frak licence plate.jpg|right|thumb|A [[vanity plate]] displaying the revised spelling]]

'''Frak''' or '''frack''' is a [[minced oath|fictional version]] of "[[fuck]]" first used in the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978-''Battlestar Galactica'']] television series. It continues to be used throughout different versions of the [[Battlestar Galactica|''Battlestar Galactica'' franchise]] as a [[profanity in science fiction]].

==Etymology==

"Frak" is a fictional censored version of "[[fuck]]" first used in the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978 ''Battlestar Galactica'']] series (with the spelling "frack"). In the [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|"re-imagined"]] version, and subsequently in [[Caprica (TV series)|''Caprica'']], it appears with greater frequency and with the revised spelling "frak", as the producers wanted to make it a [[four-letter word]].&lt;ref name="yn2"&gt;{{cite news |work=Associated Press|title=What the `frak'? Faux curse seeping into language |first=Chris |last=Talbott |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26510283/ns/today-entertainment/t/what-frak-faux-curse-sweeps-geek-nation/ |date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

"[[Frak!]]" was the title of a game released on the [[BBC Micro|BBC Micro B]] and [[Acorn Electron]] in 1984, and later the [[Commodore 64]]. The game saw the user controlling a caveman called Trogg, who had to navigate maze-like scenarios and dispose of deadly obstacles; when coming into contact with such an obstacle or falling a substantial distance, Trogg would cry "Frak!"

"Frak" is used in the same sense as in ''Battlestar'' by characters in the early 21st century "[[Ciaphas Cain]]" series of Games Workshop ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' novels by [[Sandy Mitchell (novelist)|Sandy Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For the Emperor (extract)|first=Sandy|last=Mitchell|format=PDF|url=http://www.blacklibrary.com/pdf/fortheemperor.pdf|publisher=[[Black Library]]|isbn=978-1-84416-050-1|oclc=52946642|year=2003|pages=13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518224926/http://www.blacklibrary.com/pdf/fortheemperor.pdf|archivedate=May 18, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Frak" is also used in the same sense as in ''Battlestar'' several times in the Warner Bros. / DC comics [[Arrow (TV series)]]. Specifically by the characters [[Felicity Smoak]] and Curtis Holt. An example can be seen in the season four episode "Lost in the Flood" at 22:05.

A campaign in the United Kingdom aimed at banning [[hydraulic fracturing]], the controversial method of shale gas extraction known as [[fracking]], have organised themselves under the name [[Frack Off]].

'''General Internet Corpus of Russian (GICR)''' is a corpus of Russian internet texts that has been accessible on request through an online query interface since 2013. The corpus includes rich text materials from the blogosphere, social networks, major news sources and literary magazines.

== Goals of the project ==

The project has the status of an educational and scientific one, and many tasks of computational linguistics are solved by independent researchers and research groups with the materials obtained by GICR. 
While other corpus projects of Russian are focused on fiction and edited texts, General Internet Corpus provides linguists timely opportunity to learn the language as it is, with all the slang and regional peculiarities.

Corpus gives the opportunity to carry out research in
* Linguistic research of a wide range: dialectological research, study of word distribution, study of the language of the social networks, study of the influence of gender, age and other factors on the language, frequency of words, fixed expressions and different constructions, stylistic features of texts of different segments of the Internet, etc.
* Social media analysis 
* Corpus-based machine learning for evaluating automatic tagging&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialog-21.ru/digests/dialog2015/materials/pdf/LagutinMBetal.pdf Automatic Classification of Web Texts Using Functional Text Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, student papers and independent researches were carried out on the project material by students, graduates and employees of MSU, MIPT, Russian State Humanitarian University, Novosibirsk State University, Higher School of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences, SFU, CSU, SGMP, IAAS of MSU.

Scientific project leaders:
*Belikov V. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia
*Selegey V. - RSUH, ABBYY, Moscow, Russia
*Sharoff S. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia; University of Leeds, UK&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/en/collective&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizations involved in support of GICR: 
* [[Russian State University of Humanities]]
* [[ABBYY|ABBYY Company]]
* [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]
* [[Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology]]

== Size and content of the corpus ==

Corpus size for the summer 2016 is 19.8 billion tokens, of which 49% are from [[VKontakte]], 40% are from [[LiveJournal]], another 4% - from [[Mail.ru]] Blogs and News, and 2% - from [http://magazines.russ.ru/ Russian Magazine Hall].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;
The sources collected in news segment are: [[RIA Novosti]], [[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]], [[Lenta.ru]], [http://www.rosbalt.ru/ Rosbalt].
Texts are provided with metamarkup (by date of creation of the text, sex, place and year of birth of the author, Internet genre, etc.); all texts are provided with automatic morphological tagging and lemmatization.&lt;ref&gt;://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the texts collected are of 2013–2014 years of creation, although in some segments, such as in Russian Magazine Hall, there are some texts collected since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Post in the blog: https://vk.com/wall-89094852_220&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grassfields languages''' (or '''Wide Grassfields languages''') are a branch of [[Benue–Congo]] spoken in the [[Western High Plateau]] of [[Cameroon]] and a sister group to the [[Bantu languages]]. Better known Grassfields languages include the [[Eastern Grassfields languages]] [[Bamun language|Bamun]], [[Yamba language|Yamba]] and [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] and the [[Ring language]] [[Kom language|Kom]]. The languages are closely related, sharing approximately half of their vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse &amp; Gérard Philippson, 2003, ''The Bantu Languages,'' p 227&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Grassfields languages were previously known as ''Grassfields Bantu'' and ''Semi-Bantu.'' They are sometimes classified on two levels, ''Wide Grassfields,'' which includes all the languages, and ''Narrow Grassfields,'' which excludes [[Menchum language|Menchum]], [[Ambele language|Ambele]] and sometimes the [[Southwest Grassfields languages]]. These may form a group of their own, which Nurse (2003) calls Peripheral Grassfields but rejects. 

Blench (2010) notes there is little evidence for the traditional assumption that the non-Western [[Momo languages]] belong in Grassfields and that they may actually be closer to the poorly established [[Tivoid languages|Tivoid]] group; Western Momo is therefore renamed Southwest Grassfields to avoid confusion, and only Menchum and Ambele are left out of Narrow Grassfields. The classification of Amebele is unclear, though it is clearly divergent, and Menchum may be closer to the [[Tivoid languages]] (Blench 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Bantoid/General/Blench%20Bantu%20IV%20Berlin%20Bantoid%202011.pdf|title='The membership and internal structure of Bantoid and the border with Bantu|last=Blench|first=Roger|date=2011|website=|publisher=Humboldt University|location=Berlin|pages=28, 30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blench (2012) suggests that [[Western Beboid]] may belong in Grassfields.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf Niger-Congo: an alternative view]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viti language|Viti]] (Vötö) is unclassified Narrow Grassfields.

The Eastern Grassfields languages share nasal [[noun class|noun-class]] prefixes with the [[Bantu languages]], which are not found in the other branches of Grassfields. However, they appear to be more closely related to the rest of Grassfields than they are to Bantu.

The '''Hani language''' (Hani: ''Haqniqdoq'' or ''{{IPA|xa˧˩ɲi˧˩}}''; {{zh|s=哈尼语|t=哈尼語|p=''Hāníyǔ''}}; {{lang-vi|Tiếng Hà Nhì}}) is a language of the Loloish (Yi) branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman linguistic group]] spoken in [[China]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] by the [[Hani people]].

==Distribution==
In China, Hani is spoken mostly in areas to the east of the [[Mekong]] River in south-central [[Yunnan]] province, mostly in [[Pu'er City|Pu'er]] and [[Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Honghe]] prefectures, as well as in parts of other surrounding prefectures. Hani is also spoken in [[Lai Châu Province|Lai Châu]] and [[Lào Cai Province|Lào Cai]] provinces of northwestern Vietnam and in [[Phongsaly Province]] of Laos along the border with Yunnan.

Edmondson (2002) reports that the Hani of Vietnam are distributed in 2 provinces of northwestern Vietnam where two distinct dialects are found, one east of [[Mường Tè District|Muong Te]] and the other to the west. The Hani of Vietnam claim to be able to communicate in the Hani language with ethnic Hani from different areas of Vietnam despite significant geographical barriers. Edmondson (2002), reported that the different Hani speech varieties in Vietnam differ mostly in lexicon.

==Phonology==
Hani has three main [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] and two types of short [[vowel]]s.

==Orthography==
[[File:Lihaozhai High School - P1360829.JPG|thumb|Sign for the Lihaozhai Township High School, in [[Jianshui County]], Yunnan, written in Hani (alphabetic), Yi (syllabic) and Chinese. The Chinese, if transcribed in [[Hanyu Pinyin]], would be ''Jianshuixian Lihaozhai zhongxue''.]]
Oral tradition tells of an ancient written script for Hani but says it was lost when the Hani migrated from [[Sichuan]]. In China, Standard Hani, which is based on the [[Lüchun County]] dialect, is written using a [[romanization|Romanized script]] developed by the Chinese government during the 1950s. As with the Latin-based scripts of the [[Zhuang alphabet|Zhuang]], [[Hmong alphabet|Hmong]] and [[Iu Mien language]]s, it uses final [[consonant]] letters to represent [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

Consonants in Hani orthography are pronounced the same as in [[pinyin]], with two additional [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s for [[voiced fricative]]s in Hani. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents for letters in Hani orthography are provided below (Zhang 1998).&lt;ref name="Zhang1998"&gt;Zhang Peizhi [张佩芝]. 1998.

'''Jad''' (Dzad), also known as ''Bhotia'' and ''Rongba'', is a language spoken by a community of about 300 in the states of [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]], in India.&lt;ref name=e18 /&gt; It is spoken in several villages, and the three major villages are Jadhang, [[Nelang]] and [[Pulam Sumda]] in the [[Harsil]] sub-division of the [[Uttarkashi District]].&lt;ref name="A Study on the Tibeto-Burman Languages of Uttar Pradesh" /&gt; Jad is closely related to the [[Lahuli–Spiti language]], which is another [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonnerjea|first=Biren|title=Phonology of Some Tibeto-Burman Dialects of the Himalayan Region|journal=T'oung Pao|date=1936|volume=32|series=Second|issue=4|pages=240–241|jstor=4527096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jad is spoken alongside [[Garhwali language|Garhwali]] and [[Hindi]]. Code switching between Jad and Garhwali is very common.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;{{cite web|title=Jad|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/jda|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language borrows some vocabulary from both Hindi and Garhwali.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue /&gt; It is primarily a spoken language.

==Naming==
The name Bhotia means "those from the north", referring to the geographical location of the population who speaks the language.&lt;ref name="The Bhotias of Uttarakhand" /&gt; The name Bhotia encompasses a large set of languages and is used to refer to multiple groups, Jad is specifically spoken by the Bhotias of Nelang. The term Bhotia is unrelated to the language of the people of Bhutan, which is an independent [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] state in the northeastern area of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="The Bhotias of Uttarakhand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Bishwa|title=The Bhotias of Uttarakhand|journal=India International Centre Quarterly|date=January 1976|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–15|jstor=23001864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Jad is derived from the summer village name, where the Jad people spend the summer season, which is called Jadhang.&lt;ref name="A Study on the Tibeto-Burman Languages of Uttar Pradesh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Suhnu Ram|title=A Study on the Tibeto-Burman Languages of Uttar Pradesh|journal=Research on Zhangzhung and Related Himalayan Languages|date=2001|volume=19|issue=19|pages=187–194|url=http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/handle/10502/1327?mode=full&amp;submit_simple=Show+full+item+record|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scholarship on Jad and people has been very limited. The population has not been subjected to a thorough study or survey. Work has been scattered and of uncertain quality. As of 1977, there were two reasons for the lack of scholarship on the language and people. First, the Bhotias reside in places which are difficult to reach geographically. Secondly, security clearance must be obtained from the Home Department and Defense Department of India before scholars are allowed to visit the border where the Jad live.&lt;ref name="Literature on Bhotias of Kumaun-Garhwal and a Bibliography"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Bishwa|title=Literature on Bhotias of Kumaun-Garhwal and a Bibliography|journal=Indian Anthropologist|date=December 1977|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–137|jstor=41919321}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the amount of research that has been conducted is limited in volume and scope.

==Phonetics==

===Vowels===
The following table describes the location in the mouth where vowels are pronounced in Jad.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Front !! Central !! Back
|-
! High 
| i ||  || u
|-

|}&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOErA8fRBscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage&amp;q=jad&amp;f=true|title=Tibeto-Himalayan Languages of Uttarakhand|last=Sharma|first=D.D.|date=1990|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=81-7099-171-4|location=New Delhi|pages=1–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the back u and o are rounded (see: [[roundedness]]) in context of lip positioning, all other vowels are unrounded. There are no [[diphthongs]] in Jad, but vowels frequently occur in sequence. There is no strong rule for which order the vowels must fall in when in a sequence, so many different orders are found in Jad.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

Vowels tend to be [[nasalized]] when they follow a nasalized consonant, and [[glottalized]] when they are placed before a glottal stop.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt; The pronunciation of the vowel is effected by the nearby consonant sounds.

===Consonants===
Most consonants can start a word, with the exception of ''ṇ'' and ''ṛ''. It is extremely rare for a consonant to end a word, with the exception of ''b'', ''d'', and ''g''. [[Voiced consonants]] are occasionally de-voiced, particularly when in the final position of a word or coming immediately before a voiceless sound. Unvoiced [[plositives]] tend to be voiced when coming after a voiced sound. Deaspiration also occurs. When an [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] consonant is followed by a back vowel, the aspiration of the consonant is significantly reduced.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt; Like vowels in Jad, pronunciation of consonant sounds shifts according to the sounds surrounding the consonants.

[[Consonant cluster]]s can be found in initial and middle sections of words. The first consonant must be a [[Plosive consonant|plosive]], a [[fricative consonant|fricative]], or a [[liquid consonant]]. The second consonant must be a [[semi-vowel]] or a [[liquid consonant]].&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

===Word structure===
Words may be mono[[morpheme|morphemic]] or polymorphemic. Words follow the following rule set:

# Words can start with any consonant but ṇ and ṛ.
# Native words end in a vowel, a [[Plosive consonant|plosive]], a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]], or a [[liquid consonant]].
# No native word begins or ends in a consonant cluster other than the exceptions mentioned above.
# Normally, no [[aspirate vocoid]] or a [[semivowel]] ends a native word.
# Words have a small amount of pause on either side of them in a slow tempo of speech.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

Word composition is also limited by a set of permissible [[syllables]]. Permitted syllables are /V/, /VC/, /CV/, /CCV/, /CVC/, /CCVC/, and /CVCC/. These syllables can be combined to make up longer words.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

==Nouns==
In Jad, nouns act as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] or [[object (grammar)|objects]] of verbs. Nouns are subject to number, gender, and cases. Inanimate nouns are genderless and also are not changed for plural number. Animate nouns and human nouns have distinct mechanisms for marking gender. Pluralization is marked for human beings only.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt; New nouns can be formed by adding new stems, reduplicating stems, or adding suffixes.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

Gender is denoted in two ways. Prefixes can be added to indicate gender of living creatures, or distinct words are used for female and male counterparts. Plurals are marked on animate nouns by adding plural suffixes. Plurals can be noted on inanimate nouns by using a descriptor word to provide details about the noun, but cannot themselves be changed to represent pluralization.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

Difference cases of nouns are used to describe a variety of functions. These include possession, subject, object, means, purpose, advantage, separation, origin, material composition, time, place, etc.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt;

==Word order==
Jad follows a structure of noun-adjective. An example is the phrase "a very black dog." In Jad, this phrase is "''khi nagpo məŋpo cig''",  or "dog black very one." This illustrates the noun-adjective word order. It also places adjectives before degree descriptors, following an adjective-degree syntactic form. For example, the phrase "very black" in Jad would be "''nagpo məŋpo''" where ''nagpo'' translates as black and ''məŋpo'' translates to very.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dryer|first=Matthew|title=Word Order in Tibeto-Burman Languages|journal=Linguistics of Tibeto-Burman Area|pages=1–78|url=http://www.linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/dryer/dryer/DryerTibetoBurmanWordOrder.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==
It is primarily a spoken language. All written communication is in Hindi. Attitudes toward Jad are negative with little institutional support. Education, media, television, and all other official sources of communication are in Hindi.&lt;ref name="A Study on the Tibeto-Burman Languages of Uttar Pradesh" /&gt;  There is no known literature, with the exception of a one page translation of a story about a prodigal son.&lt;ref name="Tibeto Himayalan Languages of Uttarakhand" /&gt; It is vigorously endangered and under severe threat, and it is unclear if the current state of bilingualism and code switching will continue or if Jad will be entirely replaced by either Hindi or Garhwali.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt;

'''Kituba''' is a widely used [[lingua franca]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is a [[creole language]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IGEiKkpNP-gC Pidgins and Creoles: an introduction by Jacques Arends, Pieter Muysken, Norval Smith] (page 17)&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Kikongo]], a family of closely related [[Bantu languages]]. It is an official language in [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

It is not entirely accurate to call Kituba a creole language as it lacks the [[Stratum (linguistics)|distinction between superstrate and substrate influence]] that is typical of creole development.

==Names==
Kituba is known by many names among its speakers. In the [[Republic of Congo]] it is called ''Munukutuba'' or ''Kituba''. The former is a grammatically incorrect phrase which means literally "I to speak". The latter means simply "speech". The name ''Kituba'' is used in the constitution of the Republic of Congo.

In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] it is called ''Kikongo ya leta'' (i.e. Kikongo of the state administration), but it is often called in short ''Kikongo'', especially out of the region of ethnic [[Bakongo]] people. The constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo lists Kikongo as one of the national languages. In fact, it refers to Kikongo ya leta (i.e. Kituba), because a translation of the constitution itself is written in Kituba but no translation exists in Kikongo.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{discuss}}

There are also other historical names such as ''Kibulamatadi'', ''Kikwango'', ''Ikeleve'' (literally: ''He is not here''), and ''Kizabave'' but they have largely fallen out of use. In the academic circles the language is called ''Kikongo-Kituba''.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:LanguageMap-Kikongo-Kituba.png|thumb|right|350px|Dialect map of Kikongo and Kituba]]
The majority of Kituba speakers live in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is spoken as the primary lingua franca in the provinces of [[Bas-Congo]], [[Kwango District|Kwango]] and [[Kwilu District|Kwilu]] and to a lesser extent in [[Kinshasa]], [[Mai-Ndombe District|Mai-Ndombe]] and [[Kasai-Occidental]].

Kituba is the largest language of the Republic of Congo. It is spoken in the southern half of the country, in regions of [[Kouilou Region|Kouilou]] (especially in [[Pointe-Noire]]), [[Niari Region|Niari]], [[Bouenza]], [[Lékoumou]], [[Pool Region|Pool]] and in the capital [[Brazzaville]]. [[Lingala]] is more popular in the north.

The status of Kituba in Angola is not known. It is probable that it is understood by some of the Bakongo people there, especially those who have lived in the Republic of Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo as refugees or otherwise.

==Official status==
Kituba is a national language in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In practice the term ''national language'' means that it is a language of regional administration and elementary education.

A national language is also one that is used for public and mass communication. National public radios and televisions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Republic of Congo use Kituba as one of their main languages for evening news.

==History==
First Kituba developed downriver [[River Congo|Congo]], an area which is inhabited by the [[Bakongo]].

There are several theories on how Kituba came into being. One theory claims that it had already evolved at the time of the [[Kongo Kingdom]] as a simplified interdialectal trade language, which the European colonists subsequently took into use for regional administration. Another theory claims that a simplified trade language called Kifyoti was developed at the Portuguese coastal trading 18
post and it was later spread upstream by the Christian missionaries to the region between the Kwango and the Kasai rivers where it evolved further (hence the name Kikwango). Yet another theory emphasizes the construction of the [[Matadi]]-[[Kinshasa]] railroad at the end of the 19th century, which involved forced labour from [[West Africa]], lower Congo, and the neighbouring [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]] region. The workers had diverse linguistic backgrounds which gave birth to a grammatically simplified language.

Regardless of the genesis, Kituba has established itself in the large towns that were found during the colonial period between 1885 and 1960. Kituba is spoken as the primary language in the large Bakongo cities of [[Moanda]], [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]], [[Matadi]], [[Pointe-Noire]], [[Dolisie]], [[Nkayi, Republic of the Congo|Nkayi]], and [[Brazzaville]] and also in large non-Bakongo cities of [[Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bandundu]], [[Kikwit]], and [[Ilebo]].

A translation of the [[New Testament]] in Kituba was completed and published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mkw Kituba ''[[Ethnologue]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Kituba has five vowel phonemes: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. They are very similar to the vowels of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. The vowels are pronounced as follows:
* /a/ is pronounced like the "a" in father
* /e/ is pronounced like the "e" in bed
* /i/ is pronounced like the "i" in ski or ring
* /o/ is pronounced like the first part of the "o" in home, or like a tenser version of "o" in "lot"
* /u/ is pronounced like the "oo" of fool

Notes:
* Word-initial voiceless prenasalized consonants are reduced to simple consonants in some dialects: ''mpimpa'' and ''nkento'' become ''pimpa'' and ''kento'' in Kituba of Pointe-Noire.
* Some dialects add stop to prenasalized alveolar fricatives: ''Kinsasa'' and ''nzila'' become ''Kintsasa'' and ''ndzila''.
* Alveolar fricatives may become postalveolar ({{IPAlink|ʃ}} or {{IPAlink|ʒ}}) before /i/.

== Grammar ==

=== Pronouns ===
Kituba has subject and object pronouns. The object pronouns are used in place of subject pronouns when the subject is being emphasized.

|}

=== Nouns ===
Kituba has kept by and large the noun classes of ethnic Kikongo with some modifications. The classes 9 and 11 have in effect merged with the singular class with zero prefix, and their plural is formed with generic plural class prefix ''ba-''.

|}

=== Verbs ===
Kituba has a well-developed verbal system involving [[grammatical tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Most verb forms have long and short versions. The long forms are used in formal written communication whereas the short forms have developed for spoken communication.

The irregular conjugation of the verb ''kuvanda'' or ''kuvuanda'' (to be) is presented in the table below. It is the only irregular verb in Kituba.

{| class="wikitable"
! Tense !! Long form !! Short form !! Example !! Translation

|-
| '''Future''' || kele/ata kuv(u)anda || ke/ta v(u)anda || ''Mu ta vuanda tata.'' || I will be a father.
|-
| '''Present progressive''' || kele kuv(u)andaka || ke v(u)andaka || ''Nge ke vuandaka zoba.'' || You are being stupid.

==Voice==

The suffix indicating [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] is adding after the verb root and before the suffix indicating tense.

The most common forms are "ila", indicating action to or toward someone, and "ana", indicating mutual or reciprocal action:

Kutanga "to read", Tangila "read to", Tangilaka "read to" (past)

Sadisa  "to help", Sadisana "help one another",  Sadisanaka "helped one another (past)&lt;ref&gt;Harold W. Fehdereau, Ph.D., Dictionnaire Kikonga (ya Leta)-Anglais-Francais, (Kinshasa: Editions LECO, 1969) p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Litema.png|thumb|Traditional Tema pattern with inversion and rotation of the model base]] 
'''Litema''' (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled ''Ditema''; Singular: '''Tema''', [[Sesotho]] for "text" or "ploughed land") is a form of [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sesotho]] [[mural]] art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with [[Sesotho]] tradition today practised in [[Lesotho]] and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls and inside of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and/or mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to clan totem animal. Litema are transient; they may desiccate and crumble or be washed away by heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition"&gt;Paulus Gerdes: ''On Mathematical Ideas in Cultural Traditions of Central and Southern Africa''. In: Helaine Selin (Hrsg.): ''Mathematics across cultures''. New York 2001, S. 329–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
As Gary van Wyk (1993:84) pointed out in his analysis of the etymology of the Sesotho noun denoting "Sesotho mural art," ''litema'' also refers to the associated concepts of "ploughed lands", &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bukantswe.sesotho.org/display.php?action=search&amp;word=ploughed+land&amp;type=full |title=Bukantswe dictionary search "ploughed land" |publisher=bukantswe.sesotho.org |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the decorative tradition is symbolically linked to cultivation in many ways. It is derived from the verb stem ''-lema'' (in the [[infinitive]], ''ho lema'' "to cultivate"), which is a reflex of the [[Proto-Bantu language|Proto-Bantu]] root ''*-dɪ̀m-'' "to cultivate (esp. with hoe)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goto.glocalnet.net/jfmaho/pbapp.pdf |title=Select Proto-Bantu Vocabulary |publisher=linguistics.africamuseum.be |date=29 May 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orthography|orthographic]] &lt;l&gt; in ''li-'' ([[Sesotho nouns#nc 10|Class 10]] [[noun class]] prefix for [[Sesotho nouns]]) is pronounced [d] in Sesotho since [d] is an [[allophone]] of /l/ occurring before the close vowels, /i/ and /u/. The orthographic &lt;e&gt; can have three possible values in Sesotho:  /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /e/. In &lt;litema&gt; is pronounced /ɪ/, as per the Proto-Bantu root.

==Design==
The litema patterns are characterised by a multi-stage [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]]. Patterns are generally arranged in square cells. A wall to be shaped is divided into a grid to form the cells. Each cell is applied with the same pattern, which is usually rotated or mirrored from cell to cell. The symmetry of the overall pattern thus depends on the symmetries present in the basic pattern. There are designs with only one mirror axis in the basic patterns that result in an overall impression of flowing in one direction. Other basic patterns have several axes of symmetry or a [[rotational symmetry]], and give the overall pattern a rather flat ornamental impression. The colour design is restrained, usually only two colours are used&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition" /&gt;

==History==
The tradition of mural art in Southern Africa is not of recent origins. While excavations at Sotho-Tswana archaeological sites have revealed hut floors that have survived the elements for as much as 1500 years, the earliest evidence of Sotho-Tswana mural painting stretches back about five centuries (Grant 1995:45 ; Van Wyk 1998:88). It long predates the tradition of Ndebele mural painting that has been globaly popularized. Begun in the 19th century, the [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndzundza Ndebele]] mural art tradition called ''igwalo'' (more widely known as [[Ndebele house painting]]), is said to be a synthesis of a [[Pedi people|Northern Sotho]] ''ditema'' tradition and the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] design traditions employed in beadwork, pottery and basket weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/role-decoration-ndebele-society |title=The role of decoration in Ndebele society |publisher=www.sahistory.org.za |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial record===

One of the earliest written accounts of Basotho mural art is by the missionary Rev. John Campbell. In his 1813 description of Batlhaping ([[Tswana people|South Tswana]]) art, Campbell stated the following:"Having heard of some paintings in Salakootoo's house, we went after breakfast to view them. We found them very rough representations of the camel-leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had drawn on the clay wall, with white and black paint. However, they were as well done as we expected, and may lead to something better" (Grant 1995:43).

On his second journey in 1820, Campbell, gave an enthusiastic account of what he saw at the house of a certain chief "Sinosee" of the Hurutse lineage of the Sotho-Tswana. Campbell provided both illustrations as well as a verbal description of the chief's house: "The wall was painted yellow, and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants and camel-leopards, etc. It was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painting of a red colour...its walls (of Sinosee's bedroom) were decorated with delightful representations of elephants and giraffes… In some houses there were figures, pillars, etc moulded in hard clay and painted with different colours that would not have disgraced European workmen" (Van Wyk 1996:43; 1998:88).

Campbell's accounts were compiled and published by historian George Stow, in his book ''The Native Races of South Africa'' (1905). Stow also published the earliest known drawings of litema – reproductions of eight designs made by the "[[Koena tribe|Bakuena]]" (the founding clan of the [[Basotho]] nation), which he likely drew himself, based on an unpublished letter by Stow in the South African Library in which he recounts visiting a ruined Bakoena kraal (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's drawings showed textured panels similar to litema engravings still made today as well as painted patterns of dots, stripes, triangles, and zigzags executed in limited colors. 

In his 1861 book, the French missionary Eugene Casallis recalled the litema patterns he had experienced since settling among Basotho in the 1830s, calling the designs "ingenious", which suggests designs more intricate than the Bakoena examples Stow reproduced (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's documentation did not include any designs incorporating plant motifs like those seen in modern-day litema. Van Wyk (1994) suggests that the more modern and "intricate curvilinear designs have a distinctly Victorian or Edwardian flavor that was probably influenced by such turn-of-the-century European products as linoleum patterns, cast-iron moldings and lace". 

===Contemporary Revival===

Almost a century separates Stow's drawings from those done in 1976 by students of the Lesotho National Teachers Training College (Van Wyk 1989:89). Benedict Lira Mothibe, an art lecturer at the college at the time, instructed students to copy litema designs for the purposes of using these in classroom geometry lessons and as copies for potato prints. More importantly, it was an attempt by Mothibe to revive interest in what he considered a worthwhile Sesotho tradition. Gary van Wyk employed these drawings during his extensive field research in South Africa and Lesotho from 1991-1994, recording women's responses to the historical patterns, including the names and meanings they ascribed to them, and later republished several of the drawings. He found that although many of the specific vegetal patterns (e.g. "melons") that had been named in the 1970s had been forgotten by the 1990s and subsumed under a general descriptive category of "blomme", the Afrikaans word for "flowers," nonetheless this designation maintained the close symbolic association between women and vegetative fertility, linked to women's traditional roles as cultivators and foragers. Furthermore, a few patterns recorded by Mothibe were still identifiable and being produced in the early 1990s, such as one that refers to the board for marabaraba, a popular indigenous game like checkers (1998:90-91).   

More recently (2003), Mothibe, in a further contribution towards the cause of preservation, compiled and donated a second edition on litema designs entitled ''Basotho Litema Patterns (With Modifications)'' to the School of Design Technology and Visual Art of the [[Central University of Technology]], [[Free State (province)|Free State]], providing an updated record of designs and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/historical.html |title=Historical Record |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Research conducted by Van Wyk and Mathews in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, culminating in two photographically illustrated books titled ''African Painted Houses: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa'' (Van Wyk, 1998) and ''The African Mural'' (Chanquion &amp; Matthews, 1989)), suggests that the art of litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms. 

In several works on this topic, Gary Van Wyk (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998) states that Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to the ancestors for the rain that delivers the fertility that nourishes the fields and thereby sustains the herds and the human community. Murals, he says, can be seen as prayers in paint. If the ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away the murals, and the cycle of life begins anew. It is fitting that murals are produced by women, who are symbolically linked to the house, which is a metaphor of the womb and of creation, and to the vegetal realm to which women are linked through their traditional roles as cultivators and foragers, and through several other vegetal symbols. The Basotho creation myth, for example, states that the nation emerged from a dark place deep in the earth through a bed of reeds; accordingly it was once customary upon the birth of child inside the earthen house, originally built in an igloo shape, and therefore womb-like, to place a reed in the doorway of the home until the child "crossed the reed" to emerge into the light of day (Van Wyk 1998: 103-107). Similarly, female initiates wear a reed mask, and during their initiation confinement they weave reed mats. 

This symbolic link between the igloo-shaped house and the body later was transferred to modern rectangular homes with flat roofs, where the surrounds of doorways and windows were particularly ornamented, and the name for the litema patterns along the roofline was the "headband". 

"The fecundity of fields and of women is celebrated in the creation of radiant blooms, unfurling fronds, spiralling tendrils and sprouts...Because agricultural labor was traditionally women's work, women who decorate houses can be viewed as picturing this work in the fields upon their walls. The murals are thus African landscapes, composed of the very landscape they represent"(Van Wyk 1994). This is most apparent in litema patterns that consist solely of uncolored combing into mud: these closely mimic the appearance of a plowed field. 

Van Wyk found that red ocher, called ''letsoku'', or "the blood of the earth", symbolized fertility and the blood of both menstruation and sacrifice, underscoring the key link between the ancestors and fertility and accounting for the fact that red ocher is invariably incorporated into every painting scheme. White symbolized the calm, purity and enlightenment that the ancestors promote and desire, while black represented the dark rain clouds that the ancestors deliver if all is calm and well, and these two colors are frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns applied to transitional zones of the architecture, such as the roofline and around doors and windows. Similarly, such patterns elements as triangles and zigzags likely also carried symbolic meanings that have become obscured in recent times. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Van Wyk also photographed murals that expressed political statements, using the colors of the banned African National Congress during the apartheid era, or incorporating specific political graphics or statements. 
	
Tom Mathews in his writings (supported by photographs taken by his son Paul Chanquion) stated that flowers and dots were symbols of fertility. Furthermore, he states that chevron patterns represent water or uneven ground whilst triangles are symbols denoting male and female (Changuion &amp; Matthews, 1989:9,19,55).

In the study conducted by the [[Central University of Technology|CUT]], no persons knowledgeable in the art of litema (Bekker, Thabane and Mothibe) or practising litema artists had any knowledge of a deeper significance other than that of beautifying the home for aesthetic purposes. Some of the artists questioned did however share their opinions concerning the possibility of symbolic meaning. According to artists in the Free State, their mothers (many of whom originate from Lesotho), might have been aware of such meanings, but did not share this information with them during their teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/symbolism.html |title=Litema Symbolism |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing System===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ditema tsa Dinoko.jpeg|thumbnail|right|"Ditema tsa Dinoko" written in the writing system of that name]] --&gt;
One popular commentator has claimed that litema represent an ancient Basotho [[logographic]] writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zulumathabo.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/ditema-tsa-basotho-writing-system |title=Ditema Tsa Basotho Writing System |publisher=zulumathabo.wordpress.com |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, it is probable that there has always been a symbolic logic associated with litema (perhaps comparable to the tradition of [[Adinkra symbols]] in West Africa), but there is little evidence to assert the historical existence of a formal logography of the kind represented in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] or [[Chinese characters]].

Nevertheless, there is indeed a contemporary [[writing system]] (specifically, a [[featural]] syllabary) associated with litema, that can be used to write Sesotho (and all other [[Southern Bantu]] languages). It is called ''[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]'' ("Ditema syllabary") and is also known by its [[Zulu language|Zulu]] name, ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu'', and various other related names in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=IsiBheqe |publisher=isibheqe.org |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.org.za/LSSASAALASAALT-ConferenceProgramme2015.pdf |title=Isibheqe Sohlamvu: An Indigenous Writing System for Southern Bantu Languages |publisher=linguistics.org.za |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magic Circle''' is an informal term for the five [[London]]-headquartered [[law firm]]s with the largest revenues, the most international work and which consistently outperform most of the rest of the London market on profitability. The law firms described by most commentators as comprising the Magic Circle are [[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Clifford Chance]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter and May]].&lt;ref name="thelawyer.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/one-essex-court-remains-the-go-to-set-for-litigation-heavyweights/|title=One Essex Court is the 'go-to' set for litigation heavyweights|date=14 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term Magic Circle was coined by ''[[The Lawyer]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/its-a-kind-of-magic/42082.article|title=It's a kind of magic|accessdate=9 May 2011|publisher=The Law Gazette|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "club of nine" was an informal group of law firms that comprised [[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Clifford Chance]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Herbert Smith]], [[Linklaters]], [[Lovells]], [[Norton Rose]], [[Slaughter and May]] and [[Stephenson Harwood]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The members of the "club of nine" had an informal "no-poaching" agreement and the firm's senior partners would meet.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

In 1996, Stephenson Harwood was asked to leave the ‘club of nine’ due to its stagnant performance. The "club of nine" was disbanded in 2000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The magic circle, contrary to the "club of nine", isn't an informal grouping of law firms. Initially, the magic circle's membership was described by commentators as comprising the UK firms with strong corporate practices or international work. At the time, these firms were Allen &amp; Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters, and Slaughter and May.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Generally, the Magic Circle firms have among the highest earnings per-partner and earnings per-lawyer of UK-headquartered law firms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/2-sept-2013/2018-the-magic-circle-will-be-no-more/|title=2018: The magic circle will be no more - The Lawyer - Legal News and Jobs - Advancing the business of law|date=2 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that the term was coined, Herbert Smith's corporate practice was focused on privatisation work, which had dried up. Arguably, for this reason, it was not included in the initial magic circle.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2004, Slaughter and May's then senior partner, Tim Clark, said: "It's a funny concept. I don't know where the term came from or who founded it. It's mainly something that comes up when we talk to journalists or they talk to us. We don't describe ourselves as a magic circle firm in any of our marketing material."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Linklaters' then head of corporate, David Cheyne, said: "City law firms years ago used to provide information to each other so they could keep in touch with what was going on, but that ended yonks ago... It seems to be a term to describe the leading City firms and there is some truth in it."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Then corporate partner at Herbert Smith Freehills and former investment banker Henry Raine said: "The phrase was coined by a legal magazine and referred to firms which were very strong in corporate or international work. At the time, Herbert Smith was languishing in the corporate stakes, and so was consigned to the outer darkness."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Since then, [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] has also, on occasion (although not widespread), been referred to as forming part of the magic circle. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/343bd57e-6ccb-11da-90c2-0000779e2340|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, ''[[The Lawyer]]'' argued that [[Clifford Chance]] and [[Slaughter &amp; May]] should no longer form part of the Magic Circle. It argued that Clifford Chance’s profitability does not match the other Magic Circle firms, and [[Slaughter &amp; May]] operates a different (UK-focused) model and its revenue is less than half of the other Magic Circle firms.&lt;ref name="thelawyer.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/online-october-2014/is-this-the-end-of-the-magic-circle-brand/|title=Is this the end of the ‘Magic Circle’ brand? – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=2 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/uk-200-record-11-firms-join-1m-pep-club/|title=UK 200: Record 11 firms join the £1m PEP club – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=27 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[The Lawyer]]'' magazine coined the term, it included [[Slaughter and May]] as part of the Magic Circle. ''[[The Lawyer]]'' magazine, however,  no longer considers it to form part of the Magic Circle due to its lower revenues and UK domestic focus.&lt;ref name="thelawyer.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/one-essex-court-remains-the-go-to-set-for-litigation-heavyweights/|title=One Essex Court is the 'go-to' set for litigation heavyweights|date=14 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[The Lawyer]]'' magazine stated that "Slaughters fits the silver circle bill in every respect. London-centric, sky-high PEP, top-tier work, an aura of prestige: Slaughter and May is far more like [[Macfarlanes]] than the magic circle quartet it is commonly lumped in with. To put it in the same category as Allen &amp; Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Linklaters would be inaccurate, and to say it is in a class of its own is frankly showing the firm too much deference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/silver-circle-law-firms-2017/|title=The silver circle|date=19 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawyers4law.com/?p=222|title=The long read: How the silver circle shattered - Lawyers4law|website=lawyers4law.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other commentators still consider [[Slaughter and May]] to be a member of the Magic Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/law-firms/types-of-law-firm/magic-circle-law-firms|title=Magic circle law firms|website=Chambers Student}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyerportal.com/free-guides/law-firms/magic-circle-law-firms|title=Magic Circle Law Firms: The Ultimate Guide|website=The Lawyer Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegatewayonline.com/law/where-to-work/the-magic-circle-meet-the-citys-top-commercial-law-firms|title=The magic circle: meet the City's top commercial law firms|website=The Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/blogs/guest-post-the-magic-circle-is-doomed-heres-why/|title=Guest post - The Magic Circle is doomed.

==Relationship with the Silver Circle==
The [[Silver Circle (law firms)|Silver Circle]] is an informal term for perceived elite corporate law firms headquartered in the United Kingdom that are the main competitors for the magic circle in the United Kingdom. The term was coined by ''[[The Lawyer]]'' magazine in 2005 in response to the pre-existing term, Magic Circle.&lt;ref name="chambersstudent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.com/law-firms/types-of-law-firm/the-silver-circle|title=The silver circle - Chambers Student Guide|website=Chambers Student}}&lt;/ref&gt; These firms have a lower turnover than the members of the Magic Circle, but consistently have an average profits per equity partner (PEP) and average revenue per lawyer (RPL) far above the UK average &lt;ref name=lawyer1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/ashurst-herbies-ride-out-tough-year-blp-macfarlanes-sj8200berwin-succumb/133767.article|title=Ashurst, Herbies ride out tough year; BLP, Macfarlanes, SJ Berwin succumb|accessdate=25 October 2010|publisher=The Lawyer|date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lawyer2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/silver-circle/128316.article|title=Silver Circle|accessdate=25 October 2010|publisher=The Lawyer|date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/support_services/article559686.ece|title='Silver circle' firms upset the legal order|accessdate=25 October 2010|publisher=The Times|date=28 August 2005|location=London|first=Martin|last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and, in some instances, higher than members of the magic circle). Contrary to what the term Silver Circle may suggest, there is no Golden Circle.&lt;ref name="chambersstudent.com"/&gt;

==Impact of globalisation and relevance of the term==
{{see also|List of 100 largest law firms|List of largest European law firms|List of largest United Kingdom-based law firms|List of Hong Kong law firms by size}}

UK law firms, including Magic Circle law firms, have experienced increased competition from US law firms both domestically (from US law firms with a UK presence) and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://l2b.thelawyer.com/issues/l2b-online/us-firms-the-magic-circle/|title=Can the magic circle ward off the challenge of the US firms? – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=8 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/7-june-1999/gaining-ground-on-the-magic-circle/|title=Gaining ground on the magic circle – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=9 June 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/sites/ali/2016/10/02/losing-the-magic/ Retrieved 2 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[The Lawyer]]'' argued that the term Magic Circle would lose its relevance, becoming "outmoded": "It will remain an easy shorthand to denote the UK-heritage firms with the biggest revenues, the most international work and which consistently outperform the rest of the [UK] market on profitability." It was argued that by 2023 global law firms will rather be split between the Global Elite law firms, International Business law firms and Super Boutique law firms.  

The Global Elite law firms comprise [[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton]], [[Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Latham &amp; Watkins]], [[Linklaters]], [[Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett]], [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]], [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]], [[Kirkland &amp; Ellis]] and [[Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges]].

The International Business law firms comprise [[Clifford Chance]], [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst]], [[Norton Rose Fulbright]], [[Hogan Lovells]], [[DLA Piper]], [[Jones Day]], [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]], [[White &amp; Case]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]], [[King &amp; Wood Mallesons]] and [[Sidley Austin]].

The Super Boutique law firms comprise [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]], [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]], [[Slaughter and May]], [[Debevoise &amp; Plimpton]] and [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2014, it was reported that [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]] wished to discard its Magic Circle designation in the US in favour of being part of the Global Elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/online-september-2014/freshfields-in-the-us-dont-call-us-magic-circle/|title=Freshfields in the US: Don’t call us magic circle – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=29 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2014, Linklaters’ then managing partner, Simon Davies, said "The magic circle isn’t what it used to be in the context of the US market or any market. I don’t think it’s going to gain power or momentum and I don’t think it’s a strengthening brand in itself." and "At the end of the day we see ourselves as one of the leading global law firms, not one of the leading magic circle firms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/online-november-2014/linklaters-simon-davies-the-magic-circle-isnt-what-it-used-to-be/|title=Linklaters' Simon Davies: “The magic circle isn’t what it used to be” – The Lawyer - Legal insight, benchmarking data and jobs|date=28 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barristers' chambers==

The following [[barrister]]s' [[Chambers (law)|chambers]] in the United Kingdom are occasionally, by analogy, described by commentators as the Bar's Magic Circle:&lt;ref&gt;Bar Magic Circle, AllAboutLaw; [http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/law/study/buildingbrilliantcareers/glossary/ Glossary of Law Terminology], University of Exeter; [https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/30-october-2000/set-point/ "Set Point"], The Lawyer, 30 October 2000; [https://thebriefdotorg.wordpress.com/about/the-modern-bar-diverse-and-open-to-all/ The Modern Bar: diverse and open to all], fn 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelawyer.com1"/&gt;

*[[Brick Court Chambers]]
*[[Essex Court Chambers]]

In August 2018, research from The Lawyer, however, showed that [[South Square Chambers]] received more instructions from the Magic Circle law firms than any other chamber. Barristers from it worked on 64 matters for the Magic Circle law firms since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelawyer.com/revealed-the-magic-circles-chambers-of-choice/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milang''' is a [[Siangic languages|Siangic]] or [[Tani languages|Tani]] language of [[Upper Siang district]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India. It is spoken in the 3 villages of Milang, Dalbing, and Pekimodi, located in Mariyang Subdivision, [[Upper Siang District]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (Tayeng 1976).

==Classification==
Milang has traditionally been classified as the most divergent of the [[Tani languages]], hence ultimately [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]]. Post &amp; Blench (2011) reclassified it as [[Siangic languages|Siangic]], on the basis of clear correspondences with the [[Koro language (India)|Koro]] language in vocabulary that may not ultimately be of Sino-Tibetan origin. The implication is that Milang may, like other Siangic languages, harbour a non-Sino-Tibetan [[substratum (linguistics)|substrate]], or may be a non-Sino-Tibetan language with Sino-Tibetan features acquired through prolonged contact, perhaps with the neighbouring and much larger [[Padam (tribe)|Padam]] tribe, who speak an [[Padam language|Eastern Tani language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">In semantics and text extraction, '''name resolution''' refers to the ability of [[text mining]] software to determine which actual person, actor, or object a particular use of a name refers to. It can also be referred to as [[Record linkage|entity resolution]].

==Name resolution in simple text==
For example, in the [[text mining]] field, software frequently needs to interpret the following text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;John gave Edward the book.  He then stood up and called to John to come back into the room.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In these sentences, the software must determine whether the pronoun "he" refers to "John", or "Edward" from the first sentence.  The software must also determine whether the "John" referred to in the second sentence is the same as the "John" in the first sentence, or a third person whose name also happens to be "John".  Such examples apply to almost all languages, and not only English.

==Name resolution across documents==
Frequently, this type of name resolution is also used across documents, for example to determine whether the "'''George Bush'''" referenced in an old newspaper article as President of the United States ([[George H. W. Bush]]) is the same person as the "George Bush" mentioned in a separate news article years later about a man who is running for President ([[George W. Bush]].) Because many people may have the same name, analysts and software must take into account substantially more information than only a name to determine whether two identical references ("George Bush") actually refer to the same specific entity or person.

Name/entity resolution in text extraction and semantics is a notoriously difficult problem, in part because in many cases there is not sufficient information to make an accurate determination.  Numerous partial solutions exist that rely on specific contextual clues found in the data, but there is no currently known general solution.

The problem is sometimes referred to as name disambiguation and, for digital libraries, author disambiguation.

'''K.S. Narayanacharya''' (born 30 October 1933) is an Indian teacher and writer, popularly known as '''Ramayanacharya'''.

==Early life and education==
''K.S. Narayanacharya''' was born at Kanakanahally (now [[Kanakapura]], of [[Bangalore]] District, [[Karnataka]]) on 30 October 1933, to K.N Srinivasa Deshikacharya and Ranganayakamma, in a family of Vedic scholars{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. He was educated at [[Mysore]], ([[Maharaja's College, Mysore|Maharaja's College]] and Yuvaraja's College), earning a BSc (Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics), B.A. (Honours) English, and M.A. (Modern English Literature). His doctoral thesis (UGC Fellowship 1959–1961) was on "The Influence of Indian thought on the poetry of [[W.B. Yeats]] and [[T.S. Eliot]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Dr KSN is an erudite scholar whose main thrust is towards Nationalism, presented through the eyes of the epics.

==Career==
He has studied the [[Krishna Yajurveda]] under the guidance of masters like Dandavati Siva Dixit Somayaji of Dharwad, where he worked as Professor and Principal of the [[Karnataka Arts College]], [[Karnatak University]], Dharwad&lt;ref&gt;http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=95&amp;page=21&lt;/ref&gt; for over 32 years and as a teacher of English literature. He is the author of over 70 works in Kannada and English on varied subjects, including the [[Vedas]], [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharatha]], [[Bhagavata]], the Hymns of [[Alwars]], [[Vedanta]], [[Haridasa]] literature, [[D.R.

'''National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities''', also called as [[Ranganath Misra]] Commission was constituted by [[Government of India]] on 29 October 2004 to look into various issues related to Linguistic and Religious minorities in India. It was chaired by former [[Chief Justice of India]] Justice Ranganath Misra.&lt;ref name="minorityminstry"&gt;[http://www.minorityaffairs.gov.in/ncrlm Report of the National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities (Ranganath Misra Commission Report)]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission submitted the report to the Government on 21 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/03/stories/2007090354300500.htm Plea to table Ranganath Mishra Commission report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of reference==
Initially, the commission was entrusted with the following terms of reference.&lt;ref name="minorityminstry"/&gt;

(a) To suggest criteria for identification of socially and economically backward sections among religious and linguistic minorities;
(b) To recommend measures for welfare of socially and economically backward sections among religious and linguistic minorities, including reservation in education and government employment;
and
(c) To suggest the necessary constitutional, legal and administrative modalities required for the implementation of its recommendations.

After nearly five months of its work the Commission’s Terms of Reference were modified so as to add the following.&lt;ref name="minorityminstry"/&gt;

(d) To give its recommendations on the issues raised in WPs 180/04 and 94/05 filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] and in certain High Courts relating to para 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 in the context of ceiling of 50 percent on reservations as also the modalities of inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes.

==Main findings==
* 10% quotas for Muslims and 5% for other minorities in government jobs and seats in educational institutions [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110827/jsp/nation/story_14431414.jsp]
* reserves 8.4% out of existing OBC quota of 27% for minorities
* SC reservation to [[Dalit]] converts &lt;ref name="dalits"&gt;[http://www.dalitnetwork.org/eeimages/uploads/Scheduled_Castes_report.pdf Para 3 of the Constitutional (Scheduled Caste)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Since the submission India's national party, BJP has been opposing the Ranganath Misra's recommendation fiercely. In 2010, BJP's senior official and CM of Madhya Pradesh [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] stated "prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had opposed reservation for converted SCs and STs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-slams-against-ranganath-mishra-commission-report-1405238 BJP slams against Ranganath Mishra commission report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, The BJP decided to file a PIL against a report recommending Scheduled Caste quotas for all minorities that could lead to Dalit Christians and Muslims coming within its ambit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110827/jsp/nation/story_14431414.jsp BJP to question quota]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2014, [[Narendra Modi]] during his prime-ministerial campaign in Kerala he critisied Mishra's report for creating "insecurities of the Dalit communities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-slams-mishra-report/article5670511.ece Modi pitches BJP as ‘third alternative’ in Kerala]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aulus Persius Flaccus.jpeg|thumb|Persius]]
'''Persius''', in full '''Aulus Persius Flaccus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɜr|ʃ|i|ə|s|,_|ˈ|p|ɜr|ʃ|ə|s}}; 4 December 34, in [[Volterra]]{{snd}}24 November 62), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[satirist]] of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] origin. In his works, poems and [[satire]]s, he shows a [[Stoicism|stoic]] wisdom and a strong criticism for what he considered to be the stylistic abuses of his poetic contemporaries. His works, which became very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], were published after his death by his friend and mentor, the stoic philosopher [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus]].

==Life==
According to the ''Life'' contained in the manuscripts, Persius was born into an equestrian family at [[Volterra]] (Volaterrae, in Latin), a small Etruscan city in the province of [[Pisa]], of good stock on both parents' side. When six years old he lost his father; his stepfather died a few years later. At the age of twelve Persius came to Rome, where he was taught by [[Quintus Remmius Palaemon|Remmius Palaemon]] and the [[rhetor]] [[Verginius Flavus]]. During the next four years he developed friendships with the [[stoicism|Stoic]] [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus]], the lyric poet [[Caesius Bassus]], and the poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Persius|volume=21|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucan would become a generous admirer of all Persius wrote. He also became close friends with [[Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus|Thrasea Paetus]], the husband of [[Caecinia Arria|Arria]], a relative of Persius's; over the next ten years Persius and Thrasea Paetus shared many travels together. Later, he met [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], but was not impressed by his genius.

In his boyhood, Persius wrote a [[tragedy]] dealing with an episode in [[Roman history]], and another work, probably on travel (although this would have been before the travels with Thrasea Paetus). Reading the satires of [[Lucilius]] made Persius want to write like him, and he set to work on a book of his own satires. But he wrote seldom and slowly; a premature death (''uitio stomachi'') prevented him from completing the book. He has been described as having "a gentle disposition, girlish modesty and personal beauty", and is said to have lived a life of exemplary devotion towards his mother Fulvia Sisenna, his sister and his aunt. To his mother and sister he left his considerable fortune. Cornutus suppressed all his work except the satires, to which he made some slight alterations before handing it over to Bassus for editing. It proved an immediate success.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Doubts over his biography===
The ''scholia'' add a few details—on what authority is, as generally with such sources, very doubtful. The ''Life'' itself, though not free from the suspicion of interpolation and undoubtedly corrupt and disordered in places, is probably trustworthy. The manuscripts say it came from the commentary of [[Marcus Valerius Probus|Valerius Probus]], no doubt a learned edition of Persius like those of [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]] by this same famous "grammarian" of [[Beirut|Berytus]], the poet's contemporary. The only case in which it seems to conflict with the ''Satires'' ({{lang|la|Saturae}}) themselves is in its statement as to the death of Persius's father. The declaiming of a ''suasoria'' in his presence (Sat. 3.4 sqq.) implies a more mature age than that of six in the performer. But ''pater'' might here mean "stepfather," or Persius may have forgotten his own autobiography, may be simply reproducing one of his models. The mere fact that the ''Life'' and the ''Satires'' agree so closely does not of course prove the authenticity of the former. One of the points of harmony is, however, too subtle for us to believe that a forger evolved it from the works of Persius: the ''Life'' gives the impression of a "bookish" youth, who never strayed far from home and family. This is also the picture drawn by the ''Satires''; many of the characters that Persius creates have the same names as characters found in Horace.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A keen observer of what occurs within his narrow horizon, Persius did not shy away from describing the seamy side of life (cf. e.g. such hints as ''Sat.'' iii.110), especially the relationship between excesses of consumption and moral failure; he shows little of Horace's easy-going acceptance of human weaknesses. Perhaps the sensitive, homebred nature of Persius can also be glimpsed in his frequent references to ridicule, whether of great men by street gamins or of the cultured by [[philistinism|philistines]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; [[Montaigne]] mentions Persius several times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Work==
The chief interest of Persius's work lies in its relation to Roman satire, in its interpretation of Roman [[Stoicism]], and in its use of the Latin tongue. The influence of Horace on Persius can, in spite of the silence of the ''Life,'' hardly have been less than that of Lucilius. Not only characters, as noted above, but whole phrases, thoughts and situations come direct from him. The resemblance only emphasizes the difference between the caricaturist of Stoicism and its preacher. Persius strikes the highest note that Roman satire reached; in earnestness and moral purpose he rises far superior to the political rancour or good-natured persiflage of his predecessors and the rhetorical indignation of [[Juvenal]]. From him we learn how that philosophy could work on minds that still preserved the depth and purity of the old Roman ''gravitas.'' Some of the parallel passages in the works of Persius and Seneca are very close, and cannot be explained by assuming the use of a common source. Like Seneca, Persius censures the style of the day, and imitates it. Indeed, in some of its worst failings, straining of expression, excess of detail, exaggeration, he outbids Seneca, whilst the obscurity, which makes his little book of not seven hundred lines so difficult to read and is in no way due to great depth of thought, compares poorly with the terse clearness of the ''Epistolae morales''. A curious contrast to this tendency is presented by his free use of "popular" words. As of [[Plato]], so of Persius, we hear that he emulated [[Sophron]]; the authority is a late one (the Byzantine [[John of Lydia|Lydus]], ''De mag.'' I.41), but we can at least recognize in the scene that opens ''Sat.'' 3 kinship with such work as [[Theocritus]]' ''Adoniazusae'' and the ''Mimes'' of [[Herodas]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Persius's satires are composed in [[hexameter]]s, except for the scazons of the short prologue above referred to. The first satire censures the literary tastes of the day as a reflection of the decadence of the national morals. The theme of Seneca's 114th letter is similar. The description of the recitator and the literary twaddlers after dinner is vividly natural, but an interesting passage which cites specimens of smooth versification and the languishing style is greatly spoiled by the difficulty of appreciating the points involved and indeed of distributing the dialogue (a not uncommon crux in Persius). The remaining satires handle in order (2) the question as to what we may justly ask of the gods (cf. ''[[Second Alcibiades]]''), (3) the importance of having a definite aim in life, (4) the necessity of self-knowledge for public men (cf. Plato's ''[[First Alcibiades]]''), (5) the Stoic doctrine of liberty (introduced by generous allusions to [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]]' teaching), and (6) the proper use of money.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The ''Life'' tells us that the ''Satires'' were not left complete; some lines were taken (presumably by Cornutus or Bassus) from the end of the work so that it might be ''quasi finitus.'' This perhaps means that a sentence in which Persius had left a line imperfect, or a paragraph which he had not completed, had to be omitted. The same authority says that Cornutus definitely blacked out an offensive allusion to the emperor's literary taste, and that we owe to him the reading of the manuscripts in Sat. i.121,—"''auriculas asini ''quis non'' (for ''Mida rex'' ) habet!''" Traces of lack of revision are, however, still visible; cf. e.g. v.176 (sudden transition from ambition to superstition) and vi.37 (where criticism of Greek ''doctores'' has nothing to do with the context). The parallels to passages of Horace and Seneca are recorded in the commentaries: in view of what the ''Life'' says about [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], the verbal resemblance of ''Sat.'' iii.3 to ''[[Pharsalia|Phars.]]'' x.163 is interesting. Examples of bold language or metaphor: i.25, ''rupto iecore exierit caprificus,'' 60, ''linguae quantum sitiat canis''; iii.42, ''intus palleat,'' 81, ''silentia rodunt''; v.92, ''ueteres auiae de pulmone reuello.'' Passages like iii.87, 100 sqq. show elaboration carried beyond the rules of good taste. "Popular" words: ''baro'', ''cerdo'', ''ebullire'', ''glutto'', ''lallare'', ''mamma'', ''muttire'', ''obba'', ''palpo'', ''scloppus''. Fine lines, etc., in i.116 sqq., ii.6 sqq., 61 sqq., 73 sqq., iii.39 sqq.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Authorities===
The manuscripts of Persius fall into two groups, one represented by two of the best of them, the other by that of [[Petrus Pithoeus]], so important for the text of [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]]. Since the publication of [[J. Bieger]]'s ''de Persii cod. pith. recte aestimando'' (Berlin, 1890) the tendency has been to prefer the tradition of the latter.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The first important editions were: (1) with explanatory notes: [[Isaac Casaubon]] (Paris, 1605, enlarged edition by [[Johann Friedrich Dübner]], Leipzig, 1833); [[Otto Jahn]] (with the ''[[scholia]]'' and valuable ''prolegomena,'' Leipzig, 1843); [[John Conington]] (with translation; 3rd ed., Oxford, 1893), etc.; but there are several modern editions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Phytoremediation is a cost-effective plant-based approach of remediation that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It refers to the natural ability of certain plants called [[hyperaccumulator]]s to bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for phytoremediation. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoremediation began to emerge in recent years together with biological and engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve phytoremediation. In addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for [[environmental cleanup]].&lt;ref name=Salt1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salt DE, Smith RD, Raskin I |title=PHYTOREMEDIATION |journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology |volume=49 |issue= |pages=643–668 |year=1998 |pmid=15012249 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.643 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Phytoremediation may be applied wherever the [[soil]] or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic [[pollution]]. Examples where phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives,&lt;ref name="scriptieprijs.be"&gt;[http://www.scriptieprijs.be/NL/index.php?page=44&amp;cat=4&amp;id=1363 Phytoremediation of soils using Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomas tolaasi, Burkholderia fungorum reported by Sofie Thijs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326121916/http://www.scriptieprijs.be/NL/index.php?page=44&amp;cat=4&amp;id=1363 |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide. Many plants such as [[mustard plant]]s, [[Thlaspi caerulescens|alpine pennycress]], [[hemp]], and [[pigweed]] have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at [[toxic waste]] sites.

Not all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due to differences the physiology of the plant.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even cultivars within the same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic.  While it has the advantage that environmental concerns may be treated in situ, one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term commitment, as the process is dependent on a plant's ability to grow and thrive in an environment that is not ideal for normal plant growth.

==Advantages and limitations==
*'''Advantages''':
** the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional processes both ''in situ'' and ''ex situ''
** the plants can be easily monitored
** the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by companies specializing in "phyto mining")
** it is potentially the least harmful method because it uses naturally occurring organisms and preserves the environment in a more natural state.
** it preserves the topsoil, maintaining the fertility of the soil&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Hazrat|last2=Khan|first2=Ezzat|last3=Sajad|first3=Muhammad Anwar|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metals—Concepts and applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075|journal=Chemosphere|volume=91|issue=7|pages=869–881|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** the use of plants also reduces erosion and metal leaching in the soil&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Limitations''':
** phytoremediation is limited to the surface area and depth occupied by the roots.
** slow growth and low [[biomass]] require a long-term commitment
** with plant-based systems of remediation, it is not possible to completely prevent the leaching of contaminants into the [[groundwater]] (without the complete removal of the contaminated ground, which in itself does not resolve the problem of contamination)
** the survival of the plants is affected by the toxicity of the contaminated land and the general condition of the soil.
** bio-accumulation of contaminants, especially metals, into the plants which then pass into the [[food chain]], from primary level consumers upwards or requires the safe disposal of the affected plant material.
** when taking up heavy metals, sometimes the metal is bound to the soil organic matter, which makes it unavailable for the plant to extract&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarma|first=Hemen|title=Metal Hyperaccumulation in Plants: A Review Focusing on Phytoremediation Technology|url=http://www.scialert.net/abstract/?doi=jest.2011.118.138|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Technology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=118–138|doi=10.3923/jest.2011.118.138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

=== Heavy metal remediation with ''Ficus microcarpa Field Scale Experiment'' ===
Phytoremediation of efficiency of metal by ''Ficus microcarpa'' was evaluated through a real scale experiment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Jie|last2=Cai|first2=Limei|last3=Qi|first3=Shihua|last4=Wu|first4=Jian|last5=Gu|first5=Xiaowen Sophie|date=February 2018|title=Heavy metal remediation with  Ficus microcarpa  through transplantation and its environmental risks through field scale experiment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|journal=Chemosphere|volume=193|pages=244–250|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|issn=0045-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root biomass production of the species varied significantly from 3.68 to 5.43 g because of the spatial heterogeneity of different metals. According to the study it could take 4-93 years to purify excess Cd on the experimental site. Mercury was unable to be premeditated by ''F. microcarpa''. The species of plant was moved to unpolluted soil. When transplanted Cd and CU were transferred to the rhizosphere soil. Pb and Hg were not released.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Kaltag School oil seep (Alaska) ===
The [[Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. EPA|Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation]] (ADEC) has been monitoring fuel oil spills at the Kaltag School in [[Kaltag, Alaska|Kaltag]], [[Alaska]], since 1991. The community has been working with ADEC to use a phytoremediation plan drafted by scientists at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. The ADEC continues to keep the public informed of the progress on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dec.alaska.gov/Applications/SPAR/PublicMVC/CSP/SiteReport/289|title=Division of Spill Prevention and Response|last=Alaska|first=Division of Spill Prevention and Response, Department of Environmental Conservation, State of|website=dec.alaska.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
[[File:Phytoremediation Process - svg.svg|350px|thumb|Phytoremediation process]]
A range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating environmental problems:
=== Phytoextraction ===
{{See also|Phytoextraction process}}
Phytoextraction (or ''phytoaccumulation'' or ''phytosequestration'') uses plants or algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass. The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate it above ground in the plant biomass&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Organisms that can uptake extremely high amounts of contaminants from the soil are called '''[[hyperaccumulators]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rascio|first=Nicoletta|last2=Navari-Izzo|first2=Flavia|title=Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: How and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168945210002402|journal=Plant Science|volume=180|issue=2|pages=169–181|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants (e.g.[[Populus]] and [[Salix]]) that take up lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil.&lt;ref&gt; Guidi Nissim W., Palm E., Mancuso S., Azzarello E. (2018) "Trace element phytoextraction from contaminated soil: a case study under Mediterranean climate". Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1197-x &lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or other inorganics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilon-Smits|first=Elizabeth|date=2005-04-29|title=Phytoremediation|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|volume=56|issue=1|pages=15–39|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation. Mining of these extracted metals through '''phytomining''', is also being experimented with as a way of recovering the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hyperaccumulators are plants that can naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted. In many cases these are [[metallophyte]] plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic metals. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning fluid containing a [[chelator]] or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doumett|first=S.|last2=Lamperi|first2=L.|last3=Checchini|first3=L.|last4=Azzarello|first4=E.|last5=Mugnai|first5=S.|last6=Mancuso|first6=S.|last7=Petruzzelli|first7=G.|last8=Bubba|first8=M.

Examples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:
*[[Arsenic]], using the sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.03.018 | title = Removal of trace metals by Sorghum bicolor and Helianthus annuus in a site polluted by industrial wastes: A field experience | year = 2007 | last1 = Marchiol | first1 = L. | last2 = Fellet | first2 = G. | last3 = Perosa | first3 = D. | last4 = Zerbi | first4 = G. | journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 379–87 | pmid = 17507235}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Chinese Brake fern (''[[Pteris vittata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1104/pp.008185 | title = Mechanisms of Arsenic Hyperaccumulation in Pteris vittata.

*[[Cadmium]], using willow (''[[Salix viminalis]]''): In 1999, one research experiment performed by Maria Greger and Tommy Landberg suggested willow has a significant potential as a phytoextractor of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), as willow has some specific characteristics like high transport capacity of heavy metals from root to shoot and huge amount of biomass production; can be used also for production of bio energy in the biomass energy power plant.&lt;ref name="Greger"&gt;{{Citation |last=Greger |first=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Landberg |first2=T. |title=Using of Willow in Phytoextraction |journal=International Journal of Phytoremediation |year=1999 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=115–123 |doi=10.1080/15226519908500010  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cadmium]] and [[zinc]], using alpine pennycress (''[[Thlaspi caerulescens]]''), a hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be [[poison|toxic]] to many plants. On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its growth (see table for reference).
*[[Lead]], using Indian mustard (''[[Brassica juncea]]''), ragweed (''[[Ambrosia artemisiifolia]]''), hemp dogbane (''[[Apocynum cannabinum]]''), or [[poplar trees]], which sequester lead in their biomass.
*Salt-tolerant (moderately [[halophyte|halophytic]]) [[barley]] and/or [[sugar beets]] are commonly used for the extraction of [[sodium chloride]] (common salt) to reclaim fields that were previously flooded by [[sea water]].
*[[Caesium|Caesium-137]] and [[Strontium|strontium-90]] were removed from a pond using [[sunflower]]s after the [[Chernobyl accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n3_v150/ai_18518620/?tag=content;col1 |title=Botanical cleanup crews: using plants to tackle polluted water and soil |author=Adler, Tina |publisher=''Science News''|date=July 20, 1996|accessdate= 2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], [[selenium]] and organic pollutants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) have been removed from soils by [[transgenic plant]]s containing [[gene]]s for bacterial enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Meagher, RB | title=Phytoremediation of toxic elemental and organic pollutants | journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology  | volume=3 | issue=2 | year=2000 | pages=153–162 | pmid=10712958 | doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00054-0 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|List of hyperaccumulators|l1='Table of hyperaccumulators'}}
=== Phytostabilization ===
Phytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of substances from the [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less available for plant or human uptake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An example application of phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain [[mine tailings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278–83 |title=Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments—An Emerging Remediation Technology |vauthors=Mendez MO, Maier RM |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid=18335091 |pmc=2265025 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024115430/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodegradation ===
Phytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released through transpiration.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.or.jp/Ietc/Publications/Freshwater/FMS2/2.asp|title=Phytoremediation Processes|website=www.unep.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process works best with organic contaminants like herbicides, [[trichloroethylene]], and [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Phytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant [[metabolism]], often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization). In the case of [[organic compounds|organic]] pollutants, such as [[pesticides]], [[explosives]], [[solvents]], industrial chemicals, and other [[xenobiotic]] substances, certain plants, such as [[Canna (plant)|Cannas]], render these substances non-toxic by their [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze&gt;{{Citation |author=Kvesitadze, G. |title=Biochemical Mechanisms of Detoxification in Higher Plants |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-28996-8 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, [[microorganism]]s living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term ''phytotransformation'' represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.
The term "Green Liver" is used to describe phytotransformation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=H. |last=Sanderman |title=Higher plant metabolism of xenobiotics: the "green liver" concept |journal=Pharmacogenetics |volume=4 |pages=225–241 |year=1994 |doi=10.1097/00008571-199410000-00001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as plants behave analogously to the human [[liver]] when dealing with these [[xenobiotic]] compounds (foreign compound/pollutant).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Burken, J.G. |chapter=2. Uptake and Metabolism of Organic Compounds: Green-Liver Model |editor1=McCutcheon, S.C. |editor2=Schnoor, J.L. |title=Phytoremediation: Transformation and Control of Contaminants |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/047127304X.ch2 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/summary/106569012/SUMMARY?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |series=A Wiley-Interscience Series of Texts and Monographs |isbn=0-471-39435-1 |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramel, F., Sulmon, C., Serra, A.A., Gouesbet, G., [http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1117-0043 Couée I.] (2012), “Xenobiotic sensing and signalling in higher plants”, Journal of Experimental Botany, 63(11):3999-4014, doi: 10.1093/jxb/ers102, {{PMID|22493519}}&lt;/ref&gt; After uptake of the xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).

This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds ([[drug metabolism]]). Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450]]s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases, esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze /&gt;

In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where [[glucuronidation]] (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes, e.g. [[UGT1A1]]) and [[glutathione]] addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.

Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.

In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics polymerize in a [[lignin]]-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.

Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation. [[Trinitrotoluene]] phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.&lt;ref name="Subra"&gt;{{Citation |first=Murali |last=Subramanian |first2=David J. |last2=Oliver |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=Jacqueline V. |last3=Shanks |title=TNT Phytotransformation Pathway Characteristics in Arabidopsis: Role of Aromatic Hydroxylamines |journal=Biotechnol.

=== Phytostimulation ===
Phytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of [[soil life|soil microbial]] activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process occurs within the [[rhizosphere]], which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plants release carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in the biodegradation of the organic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dzantor|first=E. Kudjo|date=2007-03-01|title=Phytoremediation: the state of rhizosphere ‘engineering’ for accelerated rhizodegradation of xenobiotic contaminants|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/jctb.1662|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology|language=en|volume=82|issue=3|pages=228–232|doi=10.1002/jctb.1662|issn=1097-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the microorganisms are able to digest and break down the toxic substances into harmless form.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Phytostimulation has been shown to be effective in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and PAHs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Phytostimulation can also involve aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the stimulation of [[atrazine]] degradation by [[hornwort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rupassara|first=S. I.|title=Degradation of Atrazine by Hornwort in Aquatic Systems|year=2002|last2=Larson|last3=Sims|last4=Marley|first2=R. A.|first3=G. K.|first4=K. A.|journal=Bioremediation Journal|volume=6|issue=3|pages=217–224|doi=10.1080/10889860290777576|lastauthoramp=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytovolatilization ===
Phytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Limmer|first=Matt|last2=Burken|first2=Joel|date=2016-07-05|title=Phytovolatilization of Organic Contaminants|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=50|issue=13|pages=6632–6643|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through phytovolatilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rhizofiltration ===
[[Rhizofiltration]] is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess [[nutrients]]. The pollutants remain absorbed in or adsorbed to the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process is often used to clean up contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an off-site location.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In either case though, typically plants are first grown in a greenhouse under precise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2|title=Phytoremediation of Soils|last=Surriya|first=Orooj|last2=Saleem|first2=Sayeda Sarah|last3=Waqar|first3=Kinza|last4=Kazi|first4=Alvina Gul|pages=1–36|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological hydraulic containment ===
Biological [[hydraulic containment]] occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary|title=Phytotechnology and Photosynthesis|last=Evans|first=Gareth M.|last2=Furlong|first2=Judith C.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470975152|pages=145–174|doi=10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodesalination ===
Phytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract salt from the soil to improve its fertility&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Role of genetics ==
Breeding programs and [[genetic engineering]] are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants.  Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a [[micro-organism]] or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.&lt;ref name="Hannink"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hannink |first=N. |last2=Rosser |first2=S. J. |last3=French |first3=C. E. |last4=Basran |first4=A. |last5=Murray |first5=J. A. |last6=Nicklin |first6=S. |last7=Bruce |first7=N. C. |title=Phytodetoxification of TNT by transgenic plants expressing a bacterial nitroreductase |journal=Nature Biotechnology |year=2001 |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1168–72 |doi=10.1038/nbt1201-1168 |pmid=11731787 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous [[polyamine]]s, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.

== Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactions ==
A plant is said to be a [[hyperaccumulator]] if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example: more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of dry weight for [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[chromium]] or [[lead]]; or more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[zinc]] or [[manganese]]).&lt;ref name="BB89"&gt;{{Citation |first=A. J. M. |last=Baker |first2=R. R. |last2=Brooks |title=Terrestrial higher plants which hyperaccumulate metallic elements – A review of their distribution, ecology and phytochemistry |journal=Biorecovery |year=1989 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=81–126 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This capacity for accumulation is due to '''hypertolerance''', or ''phytotolerance'': the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including [[mycorrhiza]]e, [[pollen]] and seed dispersal), commensalism, and [[biofilm]].

== Phytoscreening ==
As plants are able to translocate and accumulate particular types of contaminants, plants can be used as [[biosensor]]s of subsurface contamination, thereby allowing investigators to quickly delineate contaminant plumes.&lt;ref name="Burken"&gt;{{Citation |last=Burken |first=J. |last2=Vroblesky |first2=D. |last3=Balouet |first3=J.C. |title=Phytoforensics, Dendrochemistry, and Phytoscreening: New Green Tools for Delineating Contaminants from Past and Present |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2011 |volume=45 |issue=15 |pages=6218–6226 |doi=10.1021/es2005286 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorek"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sorek |first=A. |last2=Atzmon |first2=N. |last3=Dahan |first3=O. |last4=Gerstl |first4=Z. |last5=Kushisin |first5=L. |last6=Laor |first6=Y. |last7=Mingelgrin |first7=U. |last8=Nasser |first8=A. |last9=Ronen |first9=D. |last10=Tsechansky |first10=L. |last11=Weisbrod |first11=N. |last12=Graber |first12=E.R. |title="Phytoscreening": The Use of Trees for Discovering Subsurface Contamination by VOCs |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2008 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=536–542 |doi=10.1021/es072014b }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorinated solvents, such as [[trichloroethylene]], have been observed in tree trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations.&lt;ref name="Vroblesky"&gt;{{Citation |last=Vroblesky |first=D. |last2=Nietch |first2=C. |last3=Morris |first3=J. |title=Chlorinated Ethenes from Groundwater in Tree Trunks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=1998 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=510–515 |doi=10.1021/es980848b }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To ease field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by using an [[increment borer]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Vroblesky, D. |title=User's Guide to the Collection and Analysis of Tree Cores to Assess the Distribution of Subsurface Volatile Organic Compounds |year=2008 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5088/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.

Diwakar was a member of the [[Indian National Congress]] and served as the President of the [[Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee]] (KPCC) from 1930 to 1942. He became a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] and the Provisional Parliament.

The '''Royal Proclamation of 1763''' was issued October 7, 1763, by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] following [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain's]] acquisition of [[New France|French territory]] in North America after the end of the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]]. It forbade all settlement west of a line drawn along the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which was delineated as an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]]. 

This proclamation rendered worthless all land grants given by the government to [[British subject]]s who fought for the Crown against France. People throughout the various [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] were filled with indignation at having been unjustly shut out of the vast western wilderness and away from its resources. This anger was a foreshadowing of the discontent that would later arise during the [[American Revolution]]. The Royal Proclamation continues to be of legal importance to [[First Nations]] in Canada. The 1763 proclamation line is similar to the [[Eastern Continental Divide|Eastern Continental Divide's]] path running northwards from Georgia to the Pennsylvania–New York border and north-eastwards past the [[drainage divide]] on the St. Lawrence Divide from there northwards through New England.

==Background==
{{Main|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}
The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was the official conclusion to the [[Seven Years' War]], of which the [[French and Indian War]] was the North American [[theater (warfare)|theater]]. Under this treaty, France ceded ownership of all of continental North America east of the [[Mississippi River]], including Quebec, and the rest of Canada to Britain. Spain received all French territory west of the Mississippi. Both Spain and Britain received some French islands in the Caribbean. France kept [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon|a few small islands]] used by fishermen,&lt;ref&gt;Fred Anderson, ''Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754–1766'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; modern-day [[Haiti]] and the rich sugar island of [[Guadeloupe]].

==Provisions==
===New colonies===
[[File:NorthAmerica-WaterDivides.png|thumb|right|The Eastern (orange line) in the southern areas, and St. Lawrence (magenta line) watershed boundaries in the northern areas of this map more-or-less defined almost all of the Royal Proclamation's western boundaries]]
Besides regulating colonial expansion, the Proclamation of 1763 dealt with the management of inherited [[New France|French colonies]] from the [[French and Indian War]]. It established government for four areas: [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Quebec]], [[West Florida]], [[East Florida]], and [[Grenada]].

===Native lands===
Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples—primarily in the Great Lakes region—had a long and close relationship with France, and were dismayed to find that they were now under British sovereignty. They missed the amicable relationship with the French, along with the gifts they bestowed upon them, neither of which they had with the British. [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763–66), a war launched by a group of natives around the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, was an unsuccessful effort by the western tribes to push the British back. However tribes were able to take over a large number of the forts which commanded the waterways involved in trade within the region and export to Great Britain. The Proclamation of 1763 had been in the works before Pontiac's Rebellion, but the outbreak of the conflict hastened the process.&lt;ref name="wood-22"&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The American Revolution, A History.'' New York, Modern Library, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8129-7041-1}}, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; British officials hoped the proclamation would reconcile American Indians to British rule and help to prevent future hostilities.

====Proclamation line====
[[Image:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|300px|New borders drawn by the Royal Proclamation of 1763.]]
At the outset, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 defined the jurisdictional limits of the occupied territories of North America. Explaining parts of the Frontier expansion in North America, in Colonial America and especially [[Canada (New France)|Canada colony]] of [[New France]], a diminutive new colony, the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]] was carved. The territory northeast of the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|St. John River]] on the [[Labrador]] coast was placed under the [[Newfoundland Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Eccles, France in America, Fitzhrenry &amp; Whiteside Limited 1972, p220&lt;/ref&gt; The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny mountains became Indian territory, temporarily barred to settlement, to the great disappointment of the land speculators of Virginia and Pennsylvania, who had started the [[Seven Years' War]] to gain these territories.&lt;ref&gt;Jack M. Sosin, Whitehall and the Wilderness (University of Nebraska Pres. 1961) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation created a boundary line (often called the ''proclamation line'') between the British colonies on the Atlantic coast and American Indian lands (called the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]]) west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The proclamation line was not intended to be a permanent boundary between the colonists and Aboriginal lands, but rather a temporary boundary which could be extended further west in an orderly, lawful manner.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Markowitz, ''American Indians'' (1995)  p. 633&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis De Vorsey, ''The Indian boundary in the southern colonies, 1763–1775'' (1966) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also not designed as an uncrossable boundary; people could cross the line, just not settle past it. Its contour was defined by the headwaters that formed the watershed along the Appalachians. All land with rivers that flowed into the Atlantic was designated for the colonial entities, while all the land with rivers that flowed into the Mississippi was reserved for the native Indian population. The proclamation outlawed the private purchase of Native American land, which had often created problems in the past. Instead, all future land purchases were to be made by Crown officials "at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians". Furthermore, British colonials were forbidden to settle on native lands, and colonial officials were forbidden to grant ground or lands without royal approval. The proclamation gave the Crown a monopoly on all future land purchases from American Indians.

British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them.  Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line,&lt;ref name="wood-22" /&gt; some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac's War, and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled. For example, George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary. Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west.

Their demands were met, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans. In 1768 the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the [[Treaty of Hard Labour]], followed in 1770 by the [[Treaty of Lochaber]], opened much of what is now [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] to British settlement.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:1768 Boundary Line Map Treaty of Ft Stanwix.jpg|Thumb|300px|left|Boundary Line Map of 1768 move the boundary West]]

A new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, that moved the line (from the green line to the red line on the map) much further to the west, and gave the lands claimed by the colonists to the British side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J Campbell|title=Speculators in Empire: Iroquoia and the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_ACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118|date=29 April 2015|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=118–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples ===
{{details|topic=Canadian Aboriginal legacy|The Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples}}
The Royal Proclamation continued to govern the cession of Indigenous land in [[British North America]], especially [[Upper Canada]] and [[Rupert's Land]]. Upper Canada created a platform for treaty making based on the Royal Proclamation. After loyalists moved into land after Britain's defeat in the American Revolution, the first impetus was created out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=J. R.|title=Compact, Contract, Covenant|date=May 2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation forms the basis of land claims of Indigenous peoples in Canada – [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis]]. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is thus mentioned in [[Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

According to historian Colin Calloway, "[settler] scholars disagree on whether the proclamation recognized or undermined tribal sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, ''Scratch of a Pen'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation established the important precedent that the indigenous population had certain rights to the lands they occupied.

Some see the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as a "fundamental document" for [[First Nations]] land claims and [[self-government]].&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, ''Wampum'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is "the first legal recognition by the [[British Crown]] of [[Aboriginal rights]]"&lt;ref&gt;Douglas R. Francis, Richard Jones and Donald B. Smith, ''Origins: Canadian History to Confederation'' 6th ed. (Toronto:  Nelson Education Ltd., 2009), 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and imposes a [[fiduciary]] duty of care on the Crown.  The intent and promises made to the native in the Proclamation have been argued to be of a temporary nature, only meant to appease the Native peoples who were becoming increasingly resentful of "settler encroachments on their lands"&lt;ref&gt;Francis et al., ''Origins,'' 156.&lt;/ref&gt; and were capable of becoming a serious threat to British colonial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Stagg, ''Anglo-Indian Relations In North America to 1763 and An Analysis of the Royal Proclamation of 7 October 1763'', Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Research Branch, 1981, 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, ''Wampum'', 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; Advice given by a [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|merchant]] to the Board of Trade on August 30, 1764, expressed that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Indians all know we cannot be a Match for them in the midst of an extensive woody Country...from whence I infer that if we are determined to possess Our Posts, Trade &amp; ca securely, it cannot be done for a Century by any other means than that of purchasing the favour of the numerous Indian inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Native Liberty, Crown Sovereignty:  The Existing Aboriginal Right of Self-Government in Canada'', Bruce Clark. (Montreal:  McGill-Queen's University Press, 1990), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some historians{{who|date=November 2018}} believe that "the British were trying to convince Native people that there was nothing to fear from the [[colonists]], while at the same time trying to increase political and economic power relative to First Nations and other European powers".{{attribution needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, "''Wampum''", 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{who|date=November 2018}} argue that the Royal Proclamation along with the subsequent [[Treaty of Fort Niagara|Treaty of Niagara]], provide for an argument that "discredits the claims of the Crown to exercise [[sovereignty]] over First Nations"{{attribution needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, ''Wampum'', 164.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms Aboriginal "powers of [[self-determination]] in, among other things, allocating lands".{{attribution needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, ''Wampum'', 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The influence of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on the coming of the [[American Revolution]] has been variously interpreted. Many historians argue that the proclamation ceased to be a major source of tension after 1768, since the aforementioned treaties opened up extensive lands for settlement. Others have argued that colonial resentment of the proclamation contributed to the growing divide between the colonies and the mother country.  Some historians argue that even though the boundary was pushed west in subsequent treaties, the British government refused to permit new colonial settlements for fear of instigating a war with Native Americans, which angered colonial land speculators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woody Holton |title=The Ohio Indians and the Coming of the American Revolution in Virginia |journal=The Journal of Southern History |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=August 1994 |pages=453–78 |doi=10.2307/2210989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others argue that the Royal Proclamation imposed a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1379594359150/1379594420080|title=Royal Proclamation of 1763: Relationships, Rights and Treaties – Poster|last=|first=|date=2013-11-27|website=Government of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed |date=December 2016}}

[[George Washington]] was given {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of wild land in the Ohio region for his services in the French and Indian War.  In 1770, Washington took the lead in securing the rights of him and his old soldiers in the French War, advancing money to pay expenses in behalf of the common cause and using his influence in the proper quarters. In August 1770, it was decided that Washington should personally make a trip to the western region, where he located tracts for himself and military comrades and eventually was granted letters patent for tracts of land there. The lands involved were open to Virginians under terms of the [[Treaty of Lochaber]] of 1770, except for the lands located 2 miles south of Fort Pitt, now known as Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WasFi03.xml&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=43&amp;division=div1 |work=The writings of George Washington from the original manuscript sources |title=Letter from George Washington to George Mercer dated November 7, 1771, at Williamsburg |volume=3 |page=68 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213347/http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WasFi03.xml&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=43&amp;division=div1 |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ended with the American Revolutionary War because Great Britain ceded the land in question to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. Afterward, the U.S. government also faced difficulties in preventing frontier violence and eventually adopted policies similar to those of the Royal Proclamation. The first in a series of [[Indian Intercourse Act]]s was passed in 1790, prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands. In 1823, the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|21|543|1823|Wheat.|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that only the U.S. government, and not private individuals, could purchase land from Native Americans.

The '''semicolon''' or '''semi colon'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv55.shtml|title=Learning English – BBC World Service|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''';''') is a [[punctuation]] mark that separates major [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] elements. A ''semicolon'' can be used between two closely related independent [[clause]]s, provided they are not already joined by a [[coordinating conjunction]]. Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate items in a list, particularly when the elements of that list contain commas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grammarcamp.com/learning-english-grammar-2/ | title=Learning English Grammar: How to Correctly Use a Semicolon | author=Scribendi.com | accessdate=July 30, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053114/http://www.grammarcamp.com/learning-english-grammar-2/ | archivedate=August 8, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first printed semicolon was the work of the [[Italy|Italian]] printer [[Aldus Manutius]] the Elder in 1494.&lt;ref name="Truss 2004 111"&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manutius established the practice of using the semicolon to separate [[word]]s of opposed meaning and to allow a rapid change in direction in connecting [[interdependent]] statements.&lt;ref name="truss"&gt;{{cite book | last = Truss | first = Lynne | authorlink = Lynne Truss | title = [[Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves]] | year = 2003 | page = 77 | isbn = 1-59240-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ben Jonson]] was the first notable English writer to use the semicolon systematically. The modern uses of the semicolon relate either to the listing of items or to the linking of related [[clause]]s.

== English ==
Although terminal marks (i.e. [[full stop]]s, [[exclamation mark]]s, and [[question mark]]s) mark the end of a sentence, the [[comma]], semicolon and [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] are normally sentence-internal, making them secondary boundary marks. The semicolon falls between terminal marks and the comma; its strength is equal to that of the colon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'', Chapter 19, §&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constraints ===
# When a semicolon marks the left boundary of a constituent (e.g. the beginning of a clause or a phrase), the right boundary is marked by punctuation of equal or greater strength.
# When two or more semicolons are used within a single construction, all constituents are at the same level, unlike commas, which can separate, for example, subordinate clauses from main clauses.

=== Usage ===
Semicolons are followed by a [[lower case]] letter, unless that letter would ordinarily be capitalized mid-sentence (e.g., the word "I", acronyms/initialisms, or [[proper noun]]s). Modern [[style guides]] recommend no space before them and one space after. They also typically recommend placing semicolons outside ending [[quotation mark]]s, although this was not always the case. For example, the first edition of the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (1906) recommended placing the semicolon inside ending quotation marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://typedesk.com/2011/02/15/chicago-manual-of-style-16th-edition-2 |title= Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition |first= David|last= Spencer|date= 15 February 2011|work= Type Desk|publisher= Matador |accessdate= 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications of the semicolon in English include:
* Between items in a series or listing containing internal [[punctuation]], especially parenthetic commas, where the semicolons function as [[serial comma]]s:
** ''The people present were Jamie, a man from New Zealand; John, the milkman's son; and George, a gaunt kind of man with no friends.''
** ''Several fast food restaurants can be found within the following cities: London, England; Paris, France; Dublin, Ireland; Madrid, Spain.''
** ''Here are three examples of familiar sequences: one, two, and three; a, b, and c; first, second, and third.''
** ''(Fig. 8; see also plates in Harley 1941, 1950; Schwab 1947).''
* Between closely related [[independent clause]]s not conjoined with a [[Grammatical conjunction|coordinating conjunction]], when the two clauses are balanced, opposed or contradictory:&lt;ref name="purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/04/|title=Purdue OWL: Commas|work=purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''My wife would like tea; I would prefer coffee.''
** ''I went to the basketball court; I was told it was closed for cleaning.''
** ''I told Kate she's running for the hills; I wonder if she knew I was joking.''
::Either clause may include commas; this is especially common when parallel wording is omitted from the second:
:*''Ted has two dogs; Sam, one.''
* When a comma replaces a period (full stop) in a quotation, or when a quotation otherwise links two independent sentences:
** ''"I have no use for this," he said; "you are welcome to it."''
** ''"Is this your book?" she asked; "I found it on the floor."''&lt;ref&gt;A period (full stop) may also be used here:
* ''"I have no use for this," he said. "You are welcome to it."''
* ''"Is this your book?" she asked. "I found it on the floor."''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other languages ==

=== Arabic ===
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the semicolon is called ''Filament Manque'' ({{lang-ar|فاصلة منقوطة}}) which means literally "a dotted comma", and is written inverted (&amp;nbsp;؛&amp;nbsp;). In Arabic, the semicolon has several uses:
* It can be used between two phrases, in which the first phrase causes the second.
** Example: "He played much; so, his clothes became dirty". ({{lang-ar|لقد لعب كثيرًا؛ فاتسخت ملابسه.}}), ({{lang-eng|He played a lot;}})
* It can be used between two phrases, where the second is ''a reason'' for the first.
** Example: "Your sister did not get high marks; because she didn't study". ({{lang-ar|لم تحقق أختك درجات عالية؛ لأنها لم تدرس .}}), ({{lang-eng|Your sister did not achieve high grades; she did not study}})

=== Greek, Church Slavonic ===

In [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], a semicolon indicates a question, similar to a Latin [[question mark]].&lt;ref name="Truss 2004 111" /&gt; To indicate a long pause or separate sections, each with commas (the semicolon's purpose in English), Greek uses, but extremely rarely, the "άνω τελεία", an [[interpunct]] (&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;).

Church Slavonic example: гдѣ єсть рождeйсѧ царь їудeйскій; (Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? - Matthew 2:1)

=== French ===
In [[French language|French]], a semicolon (''point-virgule'', literally 'dot-comma') is a separation between two full sentences, used where either a colon or a comma would not be appropriate. The phrase following a semicolon has to be an independent clause, which is related to the previous one (but not explaining it, contrary to a sentence introduced by a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]]).

The [[dash]] character is used in French writing too, but not as widely as the semicolon. Usage of these devices (semicolon and dash) varies from author to author.

Some authors have spurned the semicolon throughout their works. [[Lynne Truss]] stated that "[[Samuel Beckett]] spliced his way merrily through such novels as ''Molloy'' and ''Malone Dies'', thumbing his nose at the semicolon all the way," "[[James Joyce]] preferred the colon, as he thought it was more authentically classical; [[P. G. Wodehouse]] did an effortlessly marvelous job without it; [[George Orwell]] tried to avoid the semicolon completely in ''[[Coming Up for Air]],'' (1939);" "[[Martin Amis]] included just one semicolon in ''[[Money (novel)|Money]]'' (1984);" and "[[Umberto Eco]] was congratulated by an academic reader for using no semicolons in ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1983)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|pages=88, 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Truss, [[Ben MacIntyre]], columnist in ''[[The Times]]'' (London), wrote: "Americans have long regarded the semi-colon with suspicion, as a genteel, self-conscious, neither-one-thing-nor-the other sort of punctuation mark, with neither the butchness of a full colon nor the flighty promiscuity of the comma. [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] and [[Raymond Chandler|Chandler]] and [[Stephen King]] wouldn’t be seen dead in a ditch with a semi-colon (though [[Truman Capote]] might). Real men, goes the unwritten rule of American punctuation, don’t use semi-colons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacIntyre|first=Ben|title=Is it worth busting your (Lynne) truss over a comma with a hat on?|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article591397.ece|newspaper=The Times|location= London|date=November 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'', [[Kurt Vonnegut]] writes that semicolons are "transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.

== Computing usage ==

=== Programming ===
In [[computer programming]], the semicolon is often used to separate multiple [[Statement (programming)|statements]] (for example, in [[Perl]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[PL/I]], and [[SQL]]; see [[Pascal (programming language)#Semicolons as statement separators|Pascal: Semicolons as statement separators]]). In other languages, semicolons are called ''terminator''s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-13-629155-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential and frequently-cited study in this debate was {{harvtxt|Gannon|Horning|1975}}, which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator:
{{quote
|The most important [result] was that having a semicolon as a statement terminator was better than having a semicolon as a statement separator.&lt;ref&gt;''Software Metrics: An Analysis and Evaluation,'' 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNw2_RYNLYC&amp;q=semicolon#v=snippet 324]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The study has been criticized as flawed by proponents of semicolon as a separator,&lt;ref name="plde"&gt;{{cite techreport
| title = Principles of language design and evolution
| url = http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/hoare/evolution.pdf
| first = Bertrand
| last = Meyer
| authorlink = Bertrand Meyer
}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to participants being familiar with a semicolon-as-terminator language and unrealistically strict grammar. Nevertheless, the debate ended in favor of semicolon as terminator. Therefore, semicolon provides structure to the programming language.

Semicolons are optional in a number of languages, including [[BCPL]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]], meaning that they are part of the formal grammar for the language, but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g. by end of line that ends a statement (in Go)). As languages can be designed without them, semicolons are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some.&lt;ref name="plde" /&gt;

The use of semicolons in control flow structures and blocks of code is varied &amp;nbsp;– semicolons are generally omitted after a closing brace, but included for a single statement branch of a control structure (the "then" clause), except in Pascal, where a semicolon terminates the entire if...then...else clause (to avoid [[dangling else]]) and thus is not allowed between a "then" and the corresponding "else", as this causes unnesting.

This use originates with [[ALGOL 60]], and falls between the comma (,)&amp;nbsp;– used as a list separator&amp;nbsp;– and the period/full stop (.)&amp;nbsp;– used to mark the end of the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses, and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the [[comma operator]] that separates expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period as the end of the program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] (1986), where commas separate expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://damienkatz.net/2008/03/what_sucks_abou.html What Sucks About Erlang], Damien Katz, March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases the distinction between a separator and a terminator is strong, such as early versions of Pascal, where a final semicolon yields a [[syntax error]]. In other cases a final semicolon is treated either as optional syntax, or as being followed by a null statement, which is either ignored or treated as a [[NOP (code)|NOP]] (no operation or null command); compare [[trailing comma]]s in lists. In some cases a blank statement is allowed, allowing a sequence of semicolons or the use of a semicolon by itself as the body of a control flow structure. For example, a blank statement (a semicolon by itself) stands for a NOP in C/C++, which is useful in [[busy waiting]] [[synchronization]] loops.

Other languages (for instance, some [[assembly language]]s and [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] dialects, [[; (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CONFIG.SYS]] and [[INI file]]s) use semicolons to mark the beginning of [[comment (computer programming)|comments]].

Example [[C (programming language)|C]] code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
int main() {
  int x, y;
  x = 1; y = 2;
  printf("X + Y = %d", x + y);
  return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Conventionally, in many languages, each statement is written on a separate line, but this is not typically a requirement of the language. In the above example, two statements are placed on the same line; this is legal, because the semicolon separates the two statements. Thus programming languages like Java, the C family, Javascript etc. use semicolons to obtain a proper structure in the respective languages.

=== Data ===
&lt;!--- Use common sense – example lists should not be comprehensive and adding your pet language undermines the quality of the article ---&gt;
The semicolon is often used to separate elements of a string of text. For example, multiple e-mail addresses in the "To" field in some e-mail clients have to be [[Delimiter|delimited]] by a semicolon.

In [[Microsoft Excel]], the semicolon is used as a list separator, especially in cases where the decimal separator is a comma, such as &lt;code&gt; 0,32; 3,14; 4,50&lt;/code&gt;, instead of &lt;code&gt;0.32, 3.14, 4.50&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], the semicolon can be used as a row separator when defining a vector or matrix (whereas a comma separates the columns within a row of a vector or matrix) or to execute a command silently, without displaying the resulting output value in the console.

In [[HTML]], a semicolon is used to terminate a [[character entity reference]], either named or numeric.

In some [[delimiter-separated values]] file formats, the semicolon is used as the separator character, as an alternative to [[comma-separated values]].

== Mathematics ==
In the argument list of a mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \dots; a_1, a_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt;, a semicolon may be used to separate [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] from fixed [[parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In [[differential geometry]], a semicolon preceding an [[Indexed family|index]] is used to indicate the [[covariant derivative]] of a function with respect to the [[coordinate]] associated with that index.

== Other uses ==
The semicolon is commonly used as parts of [[emoticon]]s, in order to indicate [[wink]]ing and/or crying.

[[Project Semicolon]] is the name of a [[Faith-based organization|faith-based]] anti-[[suicide]] initiative (since the semicolon continues a sentence rather than ending it) which has led to the punctuation mark becoming a highly symbolic and popular [[tattoo]].&lt;ref name="The Semicolon Project"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/07/project-semicolon-tattoos_n_7745358.html | title=RELIGION Global Semicolon Tattoo Trend Is A Sign Of Strength Among Faithful Individuals Dealing With Mental Health Problems | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=2016-07-07 | accessdate=2016-10-02 | author=Steyer, Carly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humphrey point]] is sometimes used instead of a [[decimal point]] in [[duodecimal]] numbers.

There is much [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] culture around the semicolon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.scratch-wiki.info/w/index.php?title=Semicolon_Glitch&amp;oldid=209229|title=Semicolon Glitch|accessdate=2018-09-28|publisher=The Scratch Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumo''' (also known as '''Sumu''') is the collective name for a group of [[Misumalpan]] languages spoken in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Honduras]]. Hale &amp; Salamanca (2001) classify the Sumu languages into a northern Mayangna, composed of the Tawahka and Panamahka dialects, and southern Ulwa. Sumu specialist [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] considered the differences between Ulwa and Mayangna in both vocabulary and morphology to be so considerable that he prefers to speak of Ulwa as a language distinct from the northern Sumu varieties.

[[File:TensionGridLJP.jpg|thumb|220px|Tension grid assembly with removable modules at [[La Jolla Playhouse|La Jolla Playhouse's]] Potiker Theater]]

A '''tension grid''' is a type of non-standard largely-transparent [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]]. Tension grids are composed of tightly woven wire rope [[steel]] cables that create a taut floor strong enough for technicians to walk on.

==Benefits==
Lighting instruments can be hung on a pipe grid just above the tension grid; there is no need for holes, as the [[Stage lighting instrument|light]] can shine through the grid, virtually unobstructed, to the stage. Cables and electrical wires can pass through, and special fixtures may be used to allow beams and other solid material to pass through. 

[[File:Hearing acuity test in anechoic chamber 1949.jpg|thumb|A tension grid forming the floor of an AT&amp;T anechoic chamber]]
Originally developed for use as a floor in [[Anechoic chamber|anechoic chambers]], this style of catwalk is popular in new and remodeled theatres due to the flexibility it provides. Use of a tension grid does not require working off of edges as a traditional catwalk does, as lights are over the walking surface, not next to it. As a result, many consider tension grids safer in terms of risk of falling.

Wall to wall wire grids are impossible to fall through making them a better solution than catwalks in venues where students or volunteers might work.

==Costs==

New construction cost in most US cities ranges from $65 per square foot to $100.

Tension grids require yearly inspections. Lights shining through the tension grid light up a section of the grid itself, which some audience members find distracting. The cables of the grid absorb and redirect some of the light from a fixture, leading to a negligible loss in total light output.  Working on a tension grid can take time to get used to because of the compliant nature of the surface.  This motion coupled with the illusion of no floor can be disconcerting to some. 

Most tension grids do not meet the structural standards of a traditional catwalk, however there are tension grids available rated for a live load of 40 pounds per square foot.  The number of technicians permitted to work on a tension grid simultaneously can be limited, relative to a standard catwalk, due to relatively low load ratings.

==Construction==
[[File:AnechoicChamber2.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an anechoic chamber tension grid from above]]
Tension grids for theatrical catwalks are typically constructed of 1/8" diameter black galvanized aircraft cable woven into a taut grid with 2" spacing, which corresponds to an open area (transparency) of approximately 94%. Swaged fittings terminate the ends of the cables, which are secured at a perimeter frame. Tension grid frames are typically made of steel channel or rectangular tubing. Tension grid assemblies are often made up of tension grid modules arranged in a grid and resting on support structure suspended from ceiling structure above.

'''Thomas Thiemeyer''' (born 1963) is a German [[illustrator]] and [[writer]].

He studied [[art]] and [[geology]] in [[Cologne]]. His first children's book was published in 1989 by the [[Ravensburger]] publishing house, where Thiemeyer already worked as graphic advisor. 2 years later he became freelance artist. As freelance artist, he illustrates games, children's books, book covers and much more. Among others he has worked for [[Heyne Verlag]], [[Arena (publisher)|Arena]], [[Fantasy Productions]], [[Beltz &amp; Gelberg]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Random House]] and [[Wizards of the Coast]]. In recent time he co-operated with the American director [[Darren Aronofsky]]. His work was awarded several times by the ''[[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]]'' and the ''Deutscher Phantastik-Preis'' (maybe translated as German [[Fantasy]] award, or German [[Fantastique]] award).

In 2004 his [[debut novel]] "Medusa" published by [[Droemer Knaur]] became an international success. Many others followed, some of them became best-sellers. His works were translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as well as [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]].

His stories stand in the tradition of classic adventure novels and do often deal with the discovery of ancient cultures and threats by mysterious powers.

Thomas Thiemeyer lives in [[Stuttgart]] with his wife and two sons.

* ''Magma'', Knaur publishing house 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-426-66213-7}}.
Seismologist Dr. Ella Jordan gets the news that strange signals are being received in the middle of the Pacific, which much too regular to be caused by anything in nature. They’re coming from the 10,000 meters deep [[Mariana Trench]]. Ella drops everything to join a team of researchers heading over there in the most advanced submarine in the world. Along with a Japanese crew, an attractive U.S. Marine officer, and a somewhat shady Swiss professor, Konrad Martin, Ella dives to the deepest spot on Earth and barely escapes disaster: They find a gigantic, perfectly round stone that reacts to their probing with a deadly heat ray.
What hardly anyone knows is that hidden away in the mountains of Switzerland is an underground lab where scientists are working on a similar, though smaller ball of stone, found decades earlier next to the corpse of a geologist. Suddenly new signals are detected: first from the North Pole, then Russia, Australia, and the Antarctic. Ella and Konrad Martin find these same inexplicable stone shapes everywhere. When the stones’ signals start to be sent in unison, the resulting seismic waves are so strong that they cause earthquakes and volcanoes, and that’s just the beginning. A countdown to disaster begins, Ella recognizes the terrible truth. The threat does not come from this world.

The '''urban-to-rural''' '''[[transect]]''' is an [[urban planning]] [[model (abstract)|model]] created by New Urbanist [[Andrés Duany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transect.org/transect.html|title=Center for Applied Transect Studies|website=transect.org|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''transect''' defines a series of zones that transition from sparse [[rural]] [[farmhouse]]s to the dense [[urban core]]. Each zone is [[fractal]] in that it contains a similar transition from the edge to the center of the neighborhood. The transect is an important part of the [[New Urbanism]] and [[smart growth]] movements. Duany's firm DPZ has embodied the transect philosophy into their SmartCode generic planning code for municipal ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2017/04/13/great-idea-rural-urban-transect|title=Great idea: The rural-to-urban Transect|last=Steuteville|first=Robert|date=2017-04-13|work=CNU|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duany|first=Andres|last2=Talen|first2=Emily|date=26 Nov 2007|orig-year=2002|title=Transect Planning|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944360208976271|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|pages=245-266|doi=10.1080/01944360208976271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duany|first=Andrés|last2=Talen|first2=Emily|date=2002|title=Transect planning|url=https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/transect-planning|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|issue=3|pages=245–266|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of transect planning is particularly seen as a contrast to modern [[Euclidean zoning]] and [[suburban]] development. In these patterns, large areas are dedicated to a single purpose, such as housing, offices, shopping, and they can only be accessed via major roads. The transect, by contrast, decreases the necessity for long-distance travel by any means.

== History ==
[[File:Valley Section, 1909.png|thumb|240px|Patrick Geddes, Valley Section, 1909]]
The concept of the [[transect]] was borrowed from ecology. Ecological transects are used to describe changes in habitat over some gradient such as a change in topography or distance from a water body. [[Patrick Geddes]], in his Valley Section&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Catherine|date=2004-12-01|title=Geddes, Zoos and the Valley Section|url=https://journals.lincoln.ac.nz/index.php/lr/article/view/219|journal=Landscape Review|language=en-US|volume=10|issue=1 2|pages=115–119|issn=2253-1440}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the early 20th century was among the first to proclaim that human settlement should be analyzed in the context of its natural region. Transects were later used by [[Ian McHarg]] in ''Design with Nature.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design+with+Nature,+25th+Anniversary+Edition-p-9780471114604|title=Design with Nature, 25th Anniversary Edition|date=1995-02-20|website=Wiley.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Benjamin|title=Grand Reductions: 10 Diagrams That Changed City Planning|journal=The Urbanist|date=November 9, 2012|issue=518|url=http://www.spur.org/publications/urbanist-article/2012-11-09/grand-reductions-10-diagrams-changed-city-planning|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breakdown of the Transect ==
A major feature of transect planning is that it incorporates a variety of residential and commercial spaces into a single [[neighborhood]]. A typical neighborhood would consist of a light commercial area with a bank, general store, pub, coffee shop, and apartments. Moving outwards from the center, residential [[population density|density]] would gradually decrease starting with [[apartments]] to [[townhouses]] to fully [[detached]] houses. The central area would be a focus of transit and ideally be within walking distance from any point in the neighborhood.

The Transect has six zones, moving from rural to urban. It begins with two that are entirely rural in character: Rural preserve (protected areas in perpetuity); and Rural reserve (areas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved, but perhaps should be).The transition zone between countryside and town is called the Edge, which encompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood, and the countryside just beyond. The Edge is primarily single family homes. Although Edge is the most purely residential zone, it can have some mixed-use, such as civic buildings (schools are particularly appropriate for the Edge). Next is General, the largest zone in most neighborhoods. General is primarily residential, but more urban in character (somewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses allowed). At the urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily [[mixed use]]: Center (this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center, the latter serving more than one neighborhood); and Core (serving the region — typically a central business district). Core is the most urban zone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newurbannews.com/transect.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The character—from rural to highly urban—of each of the zones in the transect continuum is made up not only of the land uses and activities that take place in that zone, but the degree of development and the [[typology (urban planning and architecture)|typology]] of that development.  In contrast to conventional 20th-century zoning, which was for the most part concerned with land uses and activities and largely ignored issues of typology and community form (also known as urban form), transect-based zoning codes take up the issue of development typology as a principal concern.

== Potentials in Implementation ==

The potential of the transect as an urban planning tool lies in:

1) Education: it is easy to understand

2) Coding: it can be directly translated into the familiar legal framework of Euclidean [[Zoning]] districts

3) Immersive environments: this is one where all of the elements of the human environment work together to create something that is greater than the sum of the parts.

The transect contains other features: it creates a framework to control and promote growth in certain areas; it intends to increase pedestrian life, local safety, and community identity; and, it provides tools to protect and restore natural environments. A transect is a breakdown of city centre houses out to country houses

== Challenges to Implementation ==

Many of the features of transect planning cannot be reproduced without a change to municipal ordinances. For example, the transect encourages storefronts to push forward to the sidewalk, to allow window shopping, and push parking lots to the rear. In many municipalities, this design would not be permitted today under town planning bylaws. Hence, any effort to implement the principles of the transect must be accompanied by code changes (See the development of [[SmartCode]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21171">This article is a companion to [[Turkish grammar]] and contains some information that might be considered grammatical. The purpose of this article is mainly to show the use of some of the ''yapım ekleri'' "structural suffixes" of the [[Turkish language]], as well as to give some of the structurally important words, like pronouns, determiners, postpositions, and conjunctions.

==Origins==

''See also [[Turkish language#Vocabulary]].''

In the ninth century, Turks began to convert to [[Islam]] and to use the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] alphabet. When the [[Seljuk Turks]] overran [[Iran]] ([[Name of Iran|Persia]]), they adopted for official and literary use the [[Persian language]]&amp;mdash;which meanwhile had borrowed many [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words. Thus educated Turks had available for their use the vocabularies of three languages: [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Arabic, and Persian.

When the [[Ottoman Empire]] arose out of the remains of the Selcuk Empire in Anatolia, its official language, ''Osmanlıca'' or Ottoman Turkish, became the only language to approach English in the size of its vocabulary (according to [[#Lewis]]). However, common people continued to use ''kaba Türkçe'' or "rough Turkish" which contained much fewer loanwords and which is the basis of the modern Turkish language. 
[[File:TurkishVocabulary.png|thumb|right|200px|Origin of the words in Turkish vocabulary, which contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin]]
With the advent of the [[Turkish Republic]] in 1923 came the attempt to unify the languages of the people and the administration, and to westernize the country. The modern [[Turkish alphabet]], based on the [[Latin script]], was introduced. Also, Arabic and Persian words were replaced, as possible, by:
Turkish words surviving in speech, obsolete Turkish words, new words formed regularly from the agglutinative resources of Turkish, thoroughly new words or formations. However, still a large portion of current Turkish words have Arabic or Persian origins.
Turkish has words borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] due to the Ottoman Empire having conquered the [[Byzantine Empire]]. There are also borrowings from other European languages, or from the common  technical vocabulary of Europe.
In the latter case, the borrowings are usually taken in their [[French language|French]] pronunciation.

===Origin of the words in Turkish vocabulary===
The 2005 edition of ''Güncel Türkçe Sözlük'', the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by [[Turkish Language Association]], contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFB40CE59E171C629F|title=Güncel Türkçe Sözlük|accessdate=2007-03-21|year=2005|publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]]|language=tr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321023726/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFB40CE59E171C629F|archivedate=2007-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name="Loanwords"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF1A46C5FBFA979D0C|title=Türkçe Sözlük (2005)’teki Sözlerin Kökenlerine Ait Sayısal Döküm (Numerical list on the origin of words in ''Türkçe Sözlük (2005)'')|accessdate=2007-03-21|year=2005|publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]]|language=tr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301064559/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF1A46C5FBFA979D0C|archivedate=2007-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nouns==
===Nouns from nouns and adjectives===
The suffix ''-ci'' attached to a noun denotes a person involved with what is named by the noun:
:{| class=wikitable
! Noun !! Noun + ''-ci''
|-
| ''iş'' "work" || ''işçi'' "worker"
|-
| ''balık'' "fish" || ''balıkçı'' "fisherman"
|-
| ''gazete'' "newspaper" || ''gazeteci'' "newsagent", "journalist"
|-
|}

The suffix ''-lik'' attached to a noun or adjective denotes an abstraction, or an object involved with what is named by the noun:
:{| class=wikitable
! Noun !! Noun + ''-lik''
|-
| ''iyi'' "good" || ''iyilik'' "goodness"
|-
| ''tuz'' "salt" || ''tuzluk'' "salt shaker"
|-
| ''gün'' "day" || ''günlük'' "diary", "daily" (adverb)
|-
| ''gece'' "night" || ''gecelik'' "nightgown"
|-
|}

===Nouns from verbs===

The noun in ''-im'' denoting an instance of action was mentioned in the introduction to [[Turkish grammar]].
:''yat-'' "lie down",
:''yatır-'' "lay down",
:''yatırım'' "investment".

For more examples on word derivations, see the ''related article: [[List of replaced loanwords in Turkish]]''.

==Adjectives==
===Classification of adjectives===
Adjectives can be distinguished as being
*'''descriptive''' (''niteleme'' "qualifying"), or
*'''determinative''' (''belirtme''): in particular:
**'''demonstrative''' (''gösterme'' "to show" or ''işaret'' "sign"),
**'''numerical''' (''sayı'' "number"),
**'''indefinite''' (''belirsizlik'' or ''belgisiz''),
**'''interrogative''' (''soru'' "question").

For an intensive form, the first consonant and vowel of a (descriptive) adjective can be reduplicated; a new consonant is added too, ''m, p, r,'' or ''s'', but there is no simple rule for which one:
:{| class=wikitable
! Adjective !! Intensive Form
|-
| ''başka'' "other" || ''bambaşka'' "completely different"
|-
| ''katı''  "hard" || ''kaskatı''  "hard as a rock"
|-
| ''kuru''  "dry" || ''kupkuru''  "dry as a bone"
|-
| ''temiz'' "clean" || ''tertemiz'' "clean as a whistle"
|}

The determinative adjectives, or [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s, are an essential part of the language, although Turkish takes some of its determiners from Arabic and Persian.

====Demonstrative adjectives====
*''o'' "that",
*''bu'' "this",
*''şu'' "this" or "that" (thing pointed to).
These are also demonstrative pronouns.  Used with plural nouns, these adjectives represent the English "those" and "these"; there is no such inflexion of adjectives in Turkish.

====Numerical adjectives====
The [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s are built up in a regular way from the following:

:{| class="wikitable"
|- align="center"
! rowspan=2 | 0-9
! 0
! 1
! 2
! 3
! 4
! 5
! 6
! 7
! 8
! 9
|- align="center"
| ''sıfır''
| ''bir''
| ''iki''
| ''üç''
| ''dört''
| ''beş''
| ''altı''
| ''yedi''
| ''sekiz''
| ''dokuz''
|- align="center"
! rowspan=2 | Multiples of Ten
| rowspan=2 | — 
! 10 !! 20 !! 30 !! 40 !! 50 !! 60 !! 70 !! 80 !! 90
|- align="center"
| ''on''
| ''yirmi''
| ''otuz''
| ''kırk''
| ''elli''
| ''altmış''
| ''yetmiş''
| ''seksen''
| ''doksan''
|}

:{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan=2 | Powers of Ten
! 10 !! 100 !! 1,000 !! 1,000,000 !! 1,000,000,000
|-
| ''on'' || ''yüz'' || ''bin'' || ''milyon'' || ''milyard''
|}

Units follow multiples of ten; powers of ten come in descending order. For example: 
:''yüz kırk dokuz milyar beş yüz doksan yedi milyon sekiz yüz yetmiş bin altı yüz doksan bir metre'' ("149,597,870,691 metres").
:{|
|-
| '''''yüz''''' || '''''kırk''''' || '''''dokuz''''' || '''''milyar'''''
|-
| [one] hundred || forty || nine || billion
|}

:{|
|-
| '''''beş''''' ||'''''yüz''''' || '''''doksan''''' || '''''yedi''''' || '''''milyon'''''
|-
| five || hundred || ninety || seven || million
|}

:{|
|-
|'''''sekiz''''' || '''''yüz''''' || '''''yetmiş''''' || '''''bin'''''
|-
| eight || hundred || seventy || thousand
|}

:{|
|-
|'''''altı''''' || '''''yüz''''' || '''''doksan''''' || '''''bir''''' || '''''metre'''''
|-
| six || hundred || ninety || one || metres
|}

The cardinals are generally not used alone, but a general word for a unit is used, such as:
*''tane'', literally "grain";
*''kişi'' "person".

Remembering that the plural suffix is not used when numbers are named, we have:
:''dört tane bira'' "four beers";
:''Altı kişiyiz'' "We are six."

From the ''cardinal'' numbers, others can be derived with suffixes:
*'''ordinal''' ''-(i)nci''
*: ''yedi'' "seven" → ''yedinci'' "seventh"
*:: ''Sırada yedincisiniz.''
*::"You are seventh in line."
*'''distributive''' ''-(ş)er''
*: ''bir'' "one" → ''birer'' "one each"
*: ''iki'' "two" → ''ikişer'' "two each"
*'''collective''' ''-(i)z''
*: ''iki'' "two" → ''ikizler'' "twins"

====Indefinite adjectives====
The cardinal ''bir'' "one" can be used as an '''indefinite [[Article (grammar)|article]]'''.  
Other so-called indefinite adjectives might be listed as follows:
*'''universal:''' ''her'' "each, every", ''tüm'' "the whole", ''bütün'' "whole, all";
*'''existential:''' ''bazı'' "some", ''biraz'' "a little", ''birkaç'' "a few, several";
*'''negative:''' ''hiç'' "none";
*'''quantitative:''' ''az'' "little, few", ''çok'' "much, many";
*'''distinguishing:''' ''başka, diğer, öteki, öbür'' "other";
*'''identifying:''' ''aynı'' "same".

====Interrogative adjectives====
*''hangi'' "which?"
*''kaç'' "how much?" or "how many?"
*: ''Saat kaç?'' "What time is it?"
*: ''Kaç saat?'' "How many hours?"
*''nasıl'' "what sort?" (this is also the interrogative adverb "how?")

===Adjectives from nouns===

Added to a noun, ''-li'' or ''-siz'' indicates presence or absence, respectively, of what is named by the noun.
:{| class=wikitable
! Noun !! Presence (''-li'') !! Absence (''-siz'')
|-
| ''tuz'' "salt" || ''tuzlu'' "salted" || ''tuzsuz'' "salt-free"
|-
| ''ümit'' "hope" || ''ümitli'' "hopeful" || ''ümitsiz'' "hopeless"
|}

The suffix ''-li'' also indicates origin:
:''Ankaralıyım.'' "I am from Ankara."

Finally, added to the verbal noun in ''-me'', the suffix ''-li'' creates the '''necessitative''' verb.
:Pattern: (verb-stem) + ''me'' + ''li'' + (personal ending).
::''Gitmeliyim.'' "I must go".

The native speaker may perceive ''-meli'' as an indivisible suffix denoting compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, [VIII,30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Added to a noun for a person, ''-ce'' makes an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis [IV,4]&lt;/ref&gt;
:{| class=wikitable
! Noun !! Adjective (Noun + ''-ce'')
|-
| ''çocuk'' "child" || ''çocukça'' "childish"
|-
| ''kahraman'' "hero" || ''kahramanca'' "heroic"
|-
|}

==Adverbs==

Adjectives can generally serve as adverbs:
:''iyi'' "good" or "well"

The adjective might then be repeated, as noted earlier.  A repeated noun also serves as an adverb:
:''kapı'' "door" → ''kapı kapı'' "door-to-door"

The suffix ''-ce'' makes nouns and adjectives into adverbs.  One source (Özkırımlı, p.&amp;nbsp;155) calls it the ''benzerlik'' ("similarity") or ''görelik'' (from ''göre'' "according to") ''eki'', considering it as another case-ending.
* Attached to adjectives, ''-ce'' is like the English ''-ly'':
*:''güzelce'' "beautifully"
* Attached to nouns, ''-ce'' can be like the English ''like'':
*:''Türkçe konuş-'' "speak like Turks" (i.e., "speak Turkish")

Adverbs of place include:
*''aşağı/yukarı'' "down/up"
*''geri/ileri'' "backwards/forwards"
*''dışarı/içeri'' "outside/inside"
*''beri/öte'' "hither/yon"
*''karşı'' "opposite"

These can also be treated as adjectives and nouns (in particular, they can be given case-endings).
Also, the suffix ''-re'' can be added to the demonstrative pronouns ''o'', ''bu'', and ''şu'', as well as to the interrogative pronoun ''ne'', treated as a noun. The result has cases serving as adverbs of place:
*''nereye/buraya/oraya'' "whither?/hither/thither"
*''nerede/burada/orada'' kutmek"where?/here/there"
*''nereden/buradan/oradan'' "whence?/hence/thence"

==Postpositions==
===With genitive and absolute===

The following are used after the genitive pronouns ''benim'', ''bizim'', ''senin'', ''sizin'', ''onun'', and ''kimin'', and after the absolute case of other pronouns and nouns:
*''gibi'' "like, as";
*''için'' "for";
*''ile'' "with";
*''kadar'' (Arabic) "as much as".

For example, a certain company may describe its soft drink as:
:{|
| '''''buz''''' || '''''gibi''''' 
|-
| ice || like
|-
| colspan=2 | "like ice", "ice cold"
|}

However, another company may say of itself:
:{|
| '''''Gibisi''''' || '''''yok.''''' 
|-
| its-like || non-existent
|-
| colspan=2 | "There's nothing like it."
|}

Thus the label of postposition does not adequately describe ''gibi''; Schaaik proposes calling it a predicate, because of its use in establishing similarity:
:{|
| '''''Eşek''''' || '''''gibisin.''''' 
|-
| donkey || you-are-like
|-
| colspan=2 | "You are like a donkey."
|}

:{|
| '''''beni''''' || '''''küçümseyecekmiş''''' || '''''gibi''''' || '''''bir''''' || '''''duygu'''''
|-
| me-[[Accusative case|{{small|ACC}}]] || s/he-will-look-down-on || like || a || feeling
|-
| colspan=5 | "a feeling as if s/he will look down on me"
|}

The particle ''ile'' can be both ''[[comitative]]'' and ''[[Instrumental case|instrumental]]''; it can also join the preceding word as a suffix. Examples:
*''Deniz ile konuştuk'' or ''Deniz'le konuştuk''
*:"Deniz and I [or we], we spoke."
*:(here the literal translation "We spoke with Deniz" may be incorrect)
*''çekiç ile vur-'' or ''çekiçle vur-''
*:"hit with a hammer"

===With dative===

Used after nouns and pronouns in the dative case are:
*''doğru'' "towards";
*''göre'' "according to";
*''kadar'' "as far as";
*''karşı'' "against".

===With ablative===

*''önce/sonra'' "before/after";
*''beri'' "since";
*''itibaren'' (Arabic) "from…on";
*''dolayı'' "because of".

===With absolute===

The following postpositions are case-forms of nouns with the third-person possessional suffix; they can be understood as forming nominal compounds, ''always indefinite'', with the preceding words (see also [[Turkish grammar#Nouns]]):
*''bakımdan'' "from the point of view of" (''bak-'' "look");
*''hakkında'' "concerning, about" (''hak'' "right, justice");
*''tarafından'' "by the agency of" (''taraf'' "side");
*''yüzünden'' "because of" (''yüz'' "face").

==Interjections==
Some samples include:
*secular:
** ''Öf'' [disgust];
**''Haydi'' "Come on": ''Haydi kızlar okula'' "Girls to school!" (slogan for an education campaign);
*invoking the Deity:
**implicitly:
***''Aman'' "Mercy";
***''Çok şükür'' "Much thanks";
**explicitly:
***''Allah Allah'' (pronounced as ''Allahallah'') "Goodness gracious";
***''Hay Allah'';
***''Vallah'' "By God [I swear it]".

==Conjunctions==
Some Turkish conjunctions are borrowed from Persian and Arabic.

===Logical conjunction===

The ''cumulative'' sense of the English "A and B" can be expressed several ways:
*''A ve B'' (an Arabic borrowing);
*''B ile A'' (''ile'' is also a ''postposition'');
*''A, B de''.

For the ''adversative'' sense of "but" or "only", there are ''ama'' and ''fakat'' (both Arabic), also ''yalnız'' (which is also an adjective corresponding to "alone").

For emphasis: ''hem A hem B'' "both A and B".

===Logical disjunction===
For the sense of English "(either)…or":
*''A veya B'';
*''ya A veya B'';
*''ya A ya da B''.
The pattern of the last two can be extended:
*''ya A ya B veya C'';
*''ya A ya B ya da C''.

===Logical non-disjunction===

*''Ne A ne B'' "Neither A nor B":
 ''NE ABD NE AB TAM BAĞIMSIZ DEMOKRATİK TÜRKİYE'' 
 "Neither USA nor EU: Fully Independent Democratic Turkey" 
(slogan on placard at demonstration);
*''Ne A ne B ne C'' "Not A or B or C."

===Implication===

*''B, çünkü A'' "B, because A".
*''((Eğer)) A'ysa, (o zaman) B'dir.'' "If A, then B." ("Eğer" is not generally used.)
Both ''çünkü'' and ''eğer'' are Persian; the latter is not generally needed, because the ''conditional'' form of the verb is available.

===&lt;div id="ki"&gt;The conjunction ''ki''&lt;/div&gt;===

The Persian conjunction ''ki'' brings to Turkish the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] style of relating ideas ([[#Lewis]] [XIII,15]):
 ''Beklemesini istiyorum'' "Her-waiting I-desire"; but
 ''İstiyorum ki beklesin'' "I-desire that he-wait."
Thus ''ki'' corresponds roughly to English "that", but with a broader sense:
 ''Güneş batmıştı ki köye vardık'' "The-sun had-set [when] that at-the-village we-arrived."
 ''Kirazı yedim ki şeker gibi'' "The-cherry I-ate [and found] that [it was] sugar like."
The following is from a newspaper:
 ''             "[[Mehmed VI|Vahdettin]] ne yazık '''ki''' haindi"''
 ''...Bu iki açıklamadan anlıyoruz '''ki''' 
 [[Ecevit]], Osmanlı Tarihi adlı bir kitap hazırlıyormuş...
 Vahdettin, [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Tevfik Paşa]] ve Londra Konferansı hakkındaki açıklamaları gösteriyor '''ki''' 
 Sayın Ecevit, yakın tarihimizi ciddi olarak incelememiş, 
 bu konudaki güvenilir araştırmaları ve sağlam belgeleri görmemiş...
 Diyor '''ki:''' 
 "Benim şahsen çocukluğumdan beri dinlediğim şeyler var..."'' 
 

 "...From these two accounts, we understand '''that''' 
 Ecevit is preparing a book called Ottoman History...
 His accounts concerning Vahdettin, Tevfik Pasha and the London Conference show '''that''' 
 Mr Ecevit has not seriously studied our recent history, 
 has not seen trustworthy research and sound documentation on this subject...
 He says '''that:''' 
 "'There are many things I heard personally from my childhood till today...'"
(''Source:'' ''Cumhuriyet'' 19 July 2005.)

==Verbs==

The verb-stem ''temizle-'' "make clean" is the adjective ''temiz'' "clean" with the suffix ''-le-''.  Many verbs are formed from nouns or adjectives with ''-le'':
:*''başla-'' "make a head", that is, "begin" (intransitive; ''baş'' "head");
:*''kilitle-'' "make locked", that is, "lock" (''kilit'' "lock");
:*''kirle-'' "make dirty" (''kir'' "dirt")
:*''köpekle-'' (from ''köpek'' "dog", discussed at [[Turkish grammar#Parts of speech]]).

The suffix ''-iş-'' indicates reciprocal action, which is expressed in English by "each other" or "one another".

:*''görüşmek'' "to see one another" (from ''görmek'' "to see", for example ''Görüşürüz'', "Goodbye"
(literally "We see one another"))

(But there are exceptions: ''sevişmek'' does not mean "to love one another" (from ''sevmek'' "to love") but rather "to make love with each other."

Many causative verbs are formed with ''-dir-''.

:*''öldürmek'' "to kill" (from ''ölmek'' "to die")
:*''yaptırmak'' "to have something done" (from ''yapmak'' "to do")

'''Unmanned aircraft system simulation''' focuses on training pilots (or operators) to control an [[unmanned aircraft]] or its payload from a control station.  Flight simulation involves a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc.

Manned simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities.&lt;ref name=faa2013far/&gt; Unlike manned simulation, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) simulation does not involve a pilot aboard the training device.

== Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Simulation Training ==

Manned [[flight simulators]] employ various types of hardware and software, depending on the modeling detail and realism that is required for the role in which they are to be employed. Designs range from PC laptop-based models of aircraft systems (called Part Task Trainers or PTTs), to replica cockpits for initial familiarization, to highly realistic simulations of the cockpit, flight controls and aircraft systems for more complete pilot training.&lt;ref name=wikipedia2014flight/&gt;

The use of unmanned systems by defense forces globally has grown substantially over the past decade, and is only expected to continue to grow significantly. In addition, unmanned systems will be used increasingly for commercial applications such as remote inspection of pipelines and hydroelectric installations, surveillance of forest fires, observation of critical natural resources, assessing natural disasters and a range of other applications. This increase in the use of UAS capabilities results in the need to have more highly skilled UAS pilots, sensor operators, and mission commanders.&lt;ref name=unmanned/&gt;

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone and referred to as a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.&lt;ref name=lyle2010air/&gt; Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.&lt;ref name=shah2009pakistan/&gt;
A UAS is composed of the UAV, itself, as well as associated launch, recovery, and control hardware and software.

UAVs are usually deployed for military and special operation applications, but are also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work such as surveillance of pipelines. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too "dull, dirty or dangerous" for manned aircraft.&lt;ref name=tice1991unmanned/&gt;

UAS Simulation Training allows UAV operators to train in real-time to operate UAVs in a virtual environment that is realistic and accurate, but without the risks and constraints of a real flight. UAS simulation includes:
 
* Simulated UAVS: The system allows training on both helicopter and fixed wing UAVs.
* Training with the actual ground station: The system uses real data generated by the actual UAV autopilot to provide an extremely realistic simulation.
* The virtual world in which the UAV flies is modeled in 3D with photo textures, and contains all the necessary features to simulate a mission in operational conditions.
* Payload simulation: The system generates real-time video to simulate the payload output in both visible and IR modes. This video is piped to the actual video station as in the real system.
* Simulation features: Multilingual interface, VCR type controls (replay forward / backward), Simulated weather functions, display options (flight panel, UAV trajectory), display of telemetry data.&lt;ref name=h-sim/&gt;

UAS Simulation Training combines an open architecture with commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and simulation software that helps the use of proprietary designs to provide a comprehensive, platform-agnostic training system. Customers benefit from greater flexibility for evolution, networking, distributed mission training and combination within an integrated training environment. UAS is a solution that optimizes operational readiness while minimizing the use of live assets to train and prepare the integrated mission team for operations. The comprehensive solution also prepares the integrated mission team (pilot, payload specialist, and commanding officer) in platform operating procedures, data interpretation and analysis, and team interaction.&lt;ref name=unmanned/&gt;

== UAS Training in the United States Armed Forces ==

Potential Air Force UAS pilots and sensor operators attend three and a half months of specialized training courses, most of which is simulated.&lt;ref name=cloucci/&gt; In simulated training for the Predator, operators use a manual control stick, rudder system and monitor system that is the same as the live simulator. The Air Force’s primary UAS training bases are at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], NM, [[Cannon AFB]], NM, [[Ellsworth AFB]], SD, and [[Whiteman AFB]], MO, but will take initial flight training in Pueblo, CO.&lt;ref name=zakaria/&gt;

Army soldiers receive training on smaller, easier to maneuver UAS, such as the Raven and Puma, from master trainers. Master trainers are selected from bases around the world and are given instruction at Ft. Benning, GA.&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt; These master trainers then train units at their home base. Army operators for larger UAS, such as the Shadow and Gray Eagle, conduct training in Ft. Huachuca, AZ because of its remote location.&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt; These operators are UAS fight specialist for a single specific model. This is due to the different capabilities and functions of each air craft.&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt; Training is a combination of live and simulated training to teach new operators. Training is easily simulated because it is almost the same experience as live training in the aircraft that is operated by a [[Ground Control Station]] (GCS).&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt;

The standard for the Navy was to use pilots who have completed at least one piloting tour before allowing training in operating a UAS. With the advancement and economy of simulators, the Navy is beginning to train enlisted personnel with flight experience to become operators.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Capt. Patrick Smith, a Fire Scout program manager was quoted to state, “Ideally, we take [potential operators] from the SH-60 [SeaHawk] community and add them to the five-week program, mainly simulator-based."&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;  The Navy conducts UAS training in Ft. Huachuca, AZ for live simulation or military installations near Patuxent River, MD for the Fire Scouts.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

In 2014, Marines that complete the Basic School Officer course in Quantico, V.A., will have taken training in small UAS (Raven and Puma).&lt;ref name=story/&gt; UAS are not widely used in the Marines,&lt;ref name=story/&gt; but as the UAS become smaller and more mobile, they will become more integrated in mission resources. Marines recently started to receive training from the Group I (under 20 pounds) UAS Training and Logistics Support Activity in [[Camp Lejeune]], N.C.&lt;ref name=nas/&gt;

UAS in inventory for each branch of service:

* Air Force: [[MQ-1 Predator]], [[MQ-9 Reaper]], and [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]].&lt;ref name=dod/&gt;
* Army: [[RQ-11 Raven]], [[RQ-7 Shadow]], [[RQ-5 Hunter]], [[MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]&lt;ref name=dod/&gt; and [[Puma UAV|RQ-20 Puma]].&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt;
* Navy: [[Broad Area Maritime Surveillance|BAMS]], [[Firescout]]/VTUAV, [[RQ-21 Blackjack|STUAS]], [[Scan Eagle]], and UCASS UAS. The UCASS was scheduled to be replaced by the UCLASS in fiscal year 2015.&lt;ref name=dod/&gt;
* Marine Corps: [[RQ-7 Shadow]] and STUAS.&lt;ref name=dod/&gt;

== UAS Training in Domestic/Civil Sectors ==

Firefighters, police, miners, and weather researchers are now using UAVs (commonly referred to as drones), which were first used in military sectors. The drones used by police and firefighters are the same type of drones; however, they are used for different purposes. UAVs have gone beyond the human capacity of lifting heavy loads, performing daring photography amidst a heavy storm, and digitizing images that can be converted into 3D maps.

Weather researchers use different drones to help predict weather, photograph storms and measure temperature. Drones are very essential for weather crews in predicting wind speed and temperature, wind direction, air temperature and pressure (Aerosonde Mark 4).&lt;ref name=ingrobotic2014mining/&gt; Other drones are used for taking images of storm systems, even inside the storm itself.&lt;ref name=darack2012uavs/&gt; Like the Mark 4, NASA's Global Hawk is used to measure air temperature, wind speed, and pressure, but unlike the Mark 4, it can take images of the storm system.&lt;ref name=darack2012uavs/&gt;&lt;ref name=healy2013applications/&gt;

In mining, drones help miners with tasks such as inspection and maintenance, carrying heavy equipment, and even carrying out tasks 24 hours a day/7 days a week.  The mining industry uses drones such as Responder and Serenity to assist mining crews with maintenance, inspection, and imagery.&lt;ref name=ingrobotic2014mining/&gt;  Some drones within the mining industry assist workers with photography of the sediments to be mined so it can be calculated in terms of volume for removal and the stockpile of sediment graded by workers.&lt;ref name=lane2013how/&gt;

In police forces, drones are used for bomb detonation, response to incidents, pursuing criminals in the air, and determining a suspect’s location using high tech camera systems (Viking 400-S).&lt;ref name=policeone2014uav/&gt; Other uses for drones in police sectors are to record incidents, create maps of the incidents in 3D models, and then later send them to officers’ smart phones (Sensefly eBee).&lt;ref name=policeone2014uav/&gt; Other drones, such as the Kaman drop supplies and equipment for officers, as well as transport officers to and back from the crime scene. The E300 is used to stop criminals and record an incident.&lt;ref name=policeone2014uav/&gt;

Firefighters use the same drones, but for different purposes. For example, ELIMCO’s E300 is used to put out fires, the Viking 400-S uses a camera to photograph incidents, then later transmits the images back to firefighting personnel for mapping the incidents electronically.&lt;ref name=roberts2014drone/&gt; The Information Processing Systems’ MCV, like the E300 is used for putting out wildfires and man-made fires.&lt;ref name=roberts2014drone/&gt; The eBee, like its police variant takes photographs with a 16 MP camera, which is used to create 3D models of maps through integrating technology from Google Maps. It is later sent to firefighting personnel smart phones. The Kaman, like its police variant, is used to supply firefighters and victims of fires, and to provide medical assistance.&lt;ref name=roberts2014drone/&gt; The Defikopter sends defibrillators to victims of heart attack. To locate a victim, it uses a GPS system.&lt;ref name=healy2013applications/&gt;

== UAS Training in Higher Education ==

There are two primary roles or purposes for UAS in higher education:

* Training and certification of UAS operators
* UAS-related research

=== Specific UAS Applications by School ===

At the University of North Dakota (UND) Bachelor of Science in Aeronautics program, simulators are used for both operator certification and research purposes.&lt;ref name=und/&gt; For operator certification, UND uses Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) simulators specific to a particular vehicle (e.g., ScanEagle, MQ-8, etc.). Actual qualification training is on hold until the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) puts standards in place for the use of UAS in United States airspace. However, students can learn basic operation principles and how UAS will function in national airspace. UND also conducts research funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory on task loading of UAS operators. This research compares single operators versus multi-operator crews and full auto-piloted systems versus remotely piloted systems.

Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL uses simulators in an undergraduate UAS operator program awarding a Bachelor of Science degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Science.&lt;ref name=erau/&gt; Primarily, this program trains UAS operators, but it also serves a research role to test the application of UAS in national airspace.

Several other schools offer non-engineering based UAS undergraduate programs, of which simulators are an integral part. Some examples include:

* Indiana State University: Minor in Unmanned Systems&lt;ref name=isu/&gt;
* Kansas State University – Salina: Bachelor of Science in Unmanned Aircraft Systems&lt;ref name=ksu/&gt;
* Oklahoma State University: UAS option for MS or PhD degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;

== Agent based Modeling and Simulation of UAS ==

UAV Simulators generally focus on low-level flight control and coordination by using complex physics-based models that are geared towards accuracy. These simulators requires domain expertise and complex knowledge to build, learn and operate the simulator itself.&lt;ref name=garcia2010multi /&gt;&lt;ref name=jang2005actor /&gt; Alternate simulators are being developed such as Agent Based Modeling and Simulation for UAS, especially by military.&lt;ref name=cioppa2004military /&gt;

Agent based modeling and simulation of UAV focuses on specialized issues such as coordination and planning. For example, the CoUAV.&lt;ref name=happe2010couav /&gt; simulator focuses on cooperative search and MAS-Planes&lt;ref name=pujol2014mas /&gt; focuses on request servicing by decentralized coordination. Agent based simulation has also been used for UAV flight dynamic simulation modeling.&lt;ref name=yun2014research /&gt;

Agent based modeling and simulation has been used for managing missions for UAS.&lt;ref name=karim2005experiences /&gt;&lt;ref name=karim2004agent /&gt; The authors used Codarra Avatar for their experiments. Codarra Avatar is a lightweight UAV which has been specifically built for small-scale reconnaissance and surveillance missions. This UAV can be assembled and disassembled very quickly and transported in a backpack. However, in becoming an autonomous UAV, the Codarra Avatar faces challenges of flight time, flight range, durability, limited computational power, limited sensory data, and flight regulations and restrictions. The authors developed Agent-Flight Control System Architecture (FCS) to combat the issues faced with the UAV.

FCS has an agent that sits at the top of a control tree, receives data at regular intervals, and issues high level waypoint commands. The agent is designed in JACK, an agent-oriented programming language. The behavior of agents defined using JACK are structured around the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intentions) theory of agency. The mission Management System is designed using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Approach that was developed by Colonel John Boyd. Authors conducted successful tests in Melbourne, Australia, using an FCS Architecture on the Codarra Avatar UAV.&lt;ref name=karim2004agent /&gt;

'''Vangjel Meksi''' (1770–1821) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] physician, writer, and translator. One-time personal physician to [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], the 19th-century Albanian ruler of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]], Meksi produced the first translation of the [[New Testament]] into [[Albanian language|Albanian]] with the help and sponsorship of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS). Meksi did not live to see his work's publication however, which was supervised by [[Gregory IV of Athens]]. As a member of ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]'', a secret society whose purpose was to establish an independent Greek state, Meksi joined the Greeks in the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]] during their [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and died shortly afterwards.

As well as its value to Albanian [[Christian]]s, who could for the first time read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work advanced the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, [[August Schleicher]], and [[Johann Georg von Hahn]]. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.

==Early life==
Meksi was born in 1770 in [[Labovë]], a village near [[Gjirokastër]], and pursued secondary studies in [[Ioannina]], then an important [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] provincial center (now in [[Greece]]).&lt;ref name=l112&gt;Lloshi, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; His first employment was as a [[Folk medicine|folk physician]] to the court of [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], the [[Albanians|Albanian]] ruler of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]], a position he held until 1803. Armed with a [[letter of recommendation]] from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the [[University of Naples]] in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of [[San Giovanni a Carbonara]].&lt;ref name=Monti&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monti |first=Gennaro |year=1941 |journal=Rivista d'Albania |volume=II|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians.&lt;ref name=Monti/&gt; His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the [[University of Paris]]), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the [[University of Vienna]]), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of [[Thanasis Vagias]], with a degree in medicine from [[Leipzig University]]).&lt;ref name=Monti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philological activity==
After falling out of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe.&lt;ref name=l112/&gt; During a brief stay in [[Venice]] he began to develop an interest in the Albanian alphabet and grammar.&lt;ref name=l112/&gt; He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abbé [[Claude Fleury]] (1640–1723).&lt;ref name=k516&gt;Kastrati, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

Meksi also wrote a grammar of the [[Albanian language]] in Albanian.&lt;ref name=l117&gt;Lloshi, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It too has been lost, but it is mentioned in many letters reporting Meksi's work as an Albanian [[philology|philologist]] written by Robert Pinkerton to his superiors at the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS), which subsequently sponsored the translation of the New Testament into Albanian.&lt;ref name=l117/&gt; The work must have been written before 1819 and may be either the first Albanian grammar or the second, after that of [[Jani Evstrat Vithkuqari]]; it is not known which was published first.&lt;ref name=k516/&gt;

In this period Meksi also created a new Albanian alphabet, rationalizing and consolidating the many different [[Albanian alphabet#List of alphabets used for written Albanian|pre-existing alphabets]],&lt;ref name=m46&gt;Meksi (2000), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; employing a mix of Greek and Latin characters.&lt;ref name=m46/&gt; Using his new alphabet, he wrote a book called ''Orthography of the Albanian language'', ({{lang-sq|Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe}}).&lt;ref name=m46/&gt;

==Translation of the New Testament==

Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's representative in Moscow, had met that year with a community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the [[Austrian Empire]]. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible.&lt;ref name=c181&gt;Clayers, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied a large part of the ancient [[Illyria]], that they spoke a language completely different from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Latin language|Latin]], and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the [[Ionian islands]] under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.&lt;ref name=c181/&gt;

In 1819, apparently with the blessing of his superiors at the BFBS, Pinkerton met with Meksi (referring  him as ''Evangelos Mexicos'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA179&amp;dq=massacre+Constantinople+1821&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AbVfUoKFLcWq4ATPnYDgCw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Mexicos&amp;f=false Rev. Dr. Pinkerton's Letters, in the "Annual Report of the American Bible Society", pp. 181, 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; in Istanbul.&lt;ref name=c182&gt;Clayers, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  Meksi, who was then a teacher in [[Serres]], had been recommended to Pinkerton because of his Albanian grammar book.&lt;ref name=c181/&gt; Pinkerton also relates in one of his letters to the BFBS that Meksi was well regarded by the Albanian community, the Greek Orthodox Church, and by [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=l117/&gt; Gregory, according to Pinkerton, also offered to find two suitable clergymen to assist Meksi in his endeavor.&lt;ref name=l117/&gt; Lastly, Pinkerton recommended that the Greek alphabet be used as the most suitable for the Albanian language.&lt;ref name=l117/&gt; On October 19, 1819, Pinkerton and Meksi concluded a contract to translate the New Testament into Albanian on behalf of the society. It was agreed that the Bible would have to be translated into the Albanian dialect of Yanina.&lt;ref name=c182/&gt; Meksi completed the work in two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elsie |first=Robert |year=1991 |title=Albanian Literature in Greek Script: The Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Century Orthodox Tradition In Albanian Writing |journal=Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies |volume=15 |pages=20–34 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/86997/Albanian-literature-in-Greek-script-?secret_password=&amp;autodown=pdf |accessdate=2010-06-20 |quote= |doi=10.1179/byz.1991.15.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ten&amp;nbsp;months earlier than the contract's deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited [[Thessaloniki]] to supervise the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, and that the only outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task.&lt;ref name=l118&gt;Lloshi p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to [[Malta]] to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in [[Corfu]] the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian.&lt;ref name=l118/&gt; Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the [[Archimandrite]] of [[Euboea]], [[Grigor Gjirokastriti]], an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop [[Gregory IV of Athens]].&lt;ref name=l118/&gt; Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than [[Koine]].&lt;ref name=l119&gt;Lloshi p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's secretary in Corfu, sent a letter to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 [[Two Sicilies piastra|piastras]] and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]].&lt;ref name=l119/&gt; On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of [[Missolonghi]] was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian.&lt;ref name=ll28&gt;Lloshi, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1827 the form in which the first 500&amp;nbsp;copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London.&lt;ref name=ll32&gt;Lloshi, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The entire edition amounted to 2,000&amp;nbsp;copies.&lt;ref name=l142&gt;Lloshi, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Gjirokastriti's edition of the New Testament was written in Albanian, it used the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name=l23&gt;Lloshi, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known which alphabet Meksi used in his own manuscript.&lt;ref name=l23/&gt;

The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] was not against the work of Meksi or the Bible Society at that time. On the contrary, for the translation  the British missionaries successfully appealed to Gregory V and enlisted the help of an Orthodox bishop, Gjirokastriti, for the final edition of the New Testament in Albanian.&lt;ref name=c182/&gt;

==Greek War of Independence==
Meksi was a member of the ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]'',&lt;ref name=c182&gt;Clayers, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; a secret society whose purpose was to overthrow [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over the [[Balkans]] and to establish an independent Greek state. When the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]].&lt;ref name=c182/&gt; Despite suffering from a serious bout of [[pneumonia]], he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed,&lt;ref name=m56&gt;Meksi (2000), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; an arrangement that helped the Greeks to capture the town from the Turks.&lt;ref name=m56/&gt;

==Legacy==
Meksi did not live to see the 1827 publication of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51.&lt;ref name=c182/&gt; The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language,&lt;ref name=c183/&gt; it ran to 2,000&amp;nbsp;copies, a huge number for the time.&lt;ref name=l142/&gt; It preceded the modern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] version by two years and the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] translation by twenty.&lt;ref name=k519&gt;Kastrati p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens,&lt;ref name=c183&gt;Clayers 183&lt;/ref&gt; but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.&lt;ref name=l142/&gt;

Meksi's work was important for the development of written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable [[Albanian alphabet]] had to be created.&lt;ref name=l142/&gt; His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a [[Tatar language|Tatar]] origin.&lt;ref name=l142/&gt; Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root.&lt;ref name=l142/&gt;

Two other international scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi's translation of the New Testament: [[August Schleicher]], who stated that his knowledge of the conjugation of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi's work,&lt;ref name=l143-144&gt;Lloshi, pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] an Austrian diplomat, [[Philology|philologist]], and specialist in [[Albania]]n history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into [[Gheg Albanian]] with the help of [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]].&lt;ref name=l144&gt;Lloshi, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video game localization''' is the preparation of video game software and hardware for sale in a new region or country. Although translating the text is a large part of localization, the process includes any changes made to a game, including altering art assets, creating new packaging and manuals, recording new audio, transforming [[Computer hardware|hardware]], cutting out whole portions of the game due to differing [[Culture#Defining "culture"|cultural]] sensitivities and/or local legal requirements, and even adding sections to replace cut content.
 
The decision to localize a game relies heavily on economic factors, such as the potential profits that could be made in a new country.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the process is usually undertaken either by the game developers themselves or by a third-party translating company, though unauthorized fan localizations can occur if a translation is poor quality or if a game is not going to be released in a specific language. As an industrial field, localization is still in development and lacks consistency in terms of implementation and importance. Gathering information about industrial localization practices can often be difficult because of the lack of consistency between companies, as well as non-disclosure agreements many translators have to sign.

The goal of localization is to create an enjoyable, non-confusing play experience for the end user by paying heed to their specific cultural context while being faithful to the source material. The suspension of disbelief is of utmost importance to the process; if a player feels as though the product was not meant for them, or if the localization creates confusion or difficulty in comprehension, this may break immersion and disrupt the player's ability to continue the game.&lt;ref&gt;Bernal-Merino 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The founding concepts of game localization can be seen early in videogame history, as in the case of the localization of [[Pac-Man]]. The original transliteration of the Japanese title would be “Puck-Man,” but the decision was made to change the name when the game was imported to the United States out of fear that the word ‘Puck’ would be vandalized into an obscenity. In addition, the names of the ghosts were originally based on colors - roughly translating to “Reddie,” “Pinky,” “Bluey,” and “Slowly.” Rather than translate these names exactly, they were renamed to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. This choice maintained the odd-man-out style of the original names without adhering to their exact meaning. The change in cultural context between the two countries provoked a change in the game text that was not a precise translation.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

An important concern for early localization was the limited amount of processing space available to house text strings that were longer than the originals, as was often the case with the NES and SNES. [[Ted Woolsey]], translator of [[Final Fantasy VI]], recounts having to continually cut down the English text due to limited capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler 2005, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Often the budgets and production times for localizations were short, resulting in translations that were either confusing or entirely re-written. Early translations were sometimes “literally done by a 'programmer with a phrase book'.”&lt;ref&gt;Corliss 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the original translation for the Sega Genesis game [[Beyond Oasis]] (original Japanese title, Story of Thor) was discarded by the English editor because it was nonsensical. Instead, it was completely re-written without any input from the translator.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the poor quality of the translation helped make the game more notable, as in the case of the notoriously poor translation of [[Zero Wing]], whose text “[[All Your Base Are Belong to Us]]” became an early [[Internet meme]].

Technology in the early 2000s expanded to allow text to be stored in [[ASCII]] strings instead of in picture format, allowing for more efficient processing and more storage space for housing text. Better audio capabilities and reliance on voice acting created new challenges and avenues for translation, allowing the use of dubbing while also adding the burden of translating and recording new audio.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; As graphics improved and games relied more on cinematics, more attention had to be paid to lip-syncing as well as visual gestures that might be culturally-specific.

In present times, there has been significant uptake in the amount of text and dialogue in a game, especially for [[AAA (game industry)|triple-A]] RPGs. For instance, the team in charge of localizing [[Fable II]] into five languages consisted of 270 actors and 130 personnel- a far cry from the lone programmer with a phrase book.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Deming 2012, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the dialogue scripts for [[Star Wars: The Old Republic]] contained over 40 novels worth of text. Director of audio and localization Shauna Perry reports that the game had as much audio as ten [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]] recorded back-to-back.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The length and intensity of these projects presents never-before-seen complexity in the localization process.

==Levels of localization==
Depending on the financial viability of importing a game to a new locale, a number of different levels of localization may be undertaken. The first level is no localization. A game may still be imported into a region in the original language if there is a potential market for it, but no efforts to localize the game will occur, to cut back on costs. The second level is box and documentation localization, in which the box and documentation or manuals for the game will be translated, but not the game itself. This tactic may be used if the game has little text or story, such as early [[arcade game]]s, or if the target locale is expected to have a decent command of the original language, as in the importation of some English-language games such as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' or ''[[Terranigma]]'' into Scandinavian countries. The third level of localization is partial localization, in which game text is translated but voiceover files aren’t. This helps cut down on the cost of hiring actors and re-recording all of the dialogue, while still making the game comprehensible in another language. Voiceover dialogue that doesn’t appear on screen may be subtitled. The final level of localization is full localization, where in all of a game's assets will be translated, including voiceover, game text, graphics, and manuals. This is the most expensive option, and is usually only undertaken by [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA game companies]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2005, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production models==
Officially produced localizations generally fit into one of two shipping models: post-gold or sim-ship. The post-gold localization model is undertaken when the original game has already been completed, and usually has already been released. As a result, there is a lag between the release of the original and the release of the localized versions.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The post-gold model allows localizers to access a completed game rather than working with incomplete bits and pieces, and generally allow for more time to complete translations, so fewer translation errors occur with this method. This model is used commonly by Japanese AAA producers, though these companies are starting to move towards a sim-ship method for marketing reasons.&lt;ref name="O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 234"&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The sim-ship model, short for simultaneous-shipment, allows a game to be released in multiple regions at the same time. Because games have a short shelf-life and are prone to be pirated, there is a profit incentive to release games simultaneously across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2005, p. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; However, with this method, a completed version of the game is unlikely to be made available for localization workers, resulting in a greater risk for translation errors, as crucial context and game information may be missing. Most Western games follow the sim-ship method of production.&lt;ref name="O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 234"/&gt;

In addition to these shipping models, different production methods may be used to create the localization, usually either outsourced or in-house production. Most game companies in North America and Europe rely on an outsourcing model of production, and this model is popular amongst emerging game development markets such as Chile, Russia, and China. In the outsourcing model, a company that specializes in game translation is hired to undertake the entire process.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes outsourced companies do not have the full game available to work with, and are dealing with only portions of the game's text or art, resulting in a “blind localization.” &lt;ref&gt;Dietz 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietz 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In a blind localization, only a limited amount of information about the final game is available, resulting in a lack of context which can hinder productive localization. Sometimes, even if a game is incomplete, the developer may send a mostly-finished version of the game so that translators can play through the game and get a better sense of the text they’re working with.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In the outsourcing model, developers and publishers will usually provide the translation company with a localization kit. A localization kit may contain elements such as general information about the project (including deadlines, contact information, software details), resources about the game itself (a [[strategy guide|walkthrough]], plot or character descriptions, cheat codes), reference materials (glossaries of terms used in the game world or used for the specific hardware), software (such as computer-aided translation tools), code, and the assets to be translated (text files, graphics, audio, and so forth). An insufficient localization kit can severely hamper translation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 119-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate to the outsourcing model, translators may control the localization in-house. This model is more common for Japanese developers, most notably [[Square Enix]]. In the in-house model, the localization process is completely controlled by the developer, though it is common for freelance translators to be hired on a project-basis. Translators working in this model still usually receive a localization kit, but also have greater access to the original game and to the original artists and authors. Because Japanese developers rely on the post-gold model, the in-house translators favored by these companies usually have full access to the completed game. This allows the translation to have fewer context mistakes and results in an overall smoother localization. The downside is the long delay between the game's release in the original country and the subsequent release of the localized version, which is of concern in a global market. Companies like Square Enix are beginning to move towards a simultaneous shipping model, with a shorter release time between different versions.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a game can be localized through the unauthorized efforts of fans. Fans may be willing to put forth a huge amount of unpaid labor in order to localize a game if it would be otherwise unavailable. If a game is not going to be released in a specific territory, for instance due to doubts about making sufficient profits, fans may take up the slack and release a translation on their own. For instance, the Game Boy Advance game [[Mother 3]] (2006) was not going to be released in North America, possible due to poor sales of the previous installment of the series, Mother 2 (renamed [[EarthBound]] in North America). Fans petitioned Nintendo to localize the game, and when that failed, they undertook the process themselves, resulting in a fan-helmed English-language release of the game in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://mother3.fobby.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

Inferior localization may also prompt fan action, as in the case of the fan community Clan DLAN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clandlan.net/&lt;/ref&gt; The group has undertaken the work of localizing many games, mods, cheats, guides, and more into Castilian Spanish when the official versions were of poor quality, such as with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Montón 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tasks and challenges ==
The major types of localization are as follows.
* [[natural language#Defining natural language|Linguistic]] and [[cultural#Defining "culture"|cultural]]: the translation of language and cultural references maintaining the feel of the game but making it more appealing for the receiving locale.
* Hardware and software: for example the change between [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]], re-mapping of [[Keyboard shortcut|hotkeys]], [[gameplay]] modifications.
* Legal: age ratings may differ depending on the country of release. They are controlled by national or international bodies like [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] (for Europe), [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] (for US and Canada), [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] (for Australia), or [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] (for Japan).
* Graphics and music: Some games may exhibit different [[Character (arts)|character]]s, or the same ones with a slightly different appearance in order to facilitate players identification with their [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. Music may also vary according to national trends or the preferences of major fan communities.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pokémon Gold Japanese-English comparison.png|left|thumb|322px|The Japanese and English versions of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'']]. Localization required more than simply reprogramming the text; to conform to the longer English Pokémon names, the layout had to be changed to a more horizontal orientation. {{ffdc|1=Pokémon Gold Japanese-English comparison.png|log=2014 June 27}}]] --&gt;

When games are more [[narrative|story]]- than [[action game|action]]-driven, [[culturalising]] them can be challenging because of all the [[premise]]s the [[game designer|designer]]s are taking for granted in the development of the [[plot (narrative)|plot]]. [[Asian people|Asian]] gamers seem to prefer more childlike characters, while [[Western world|Western]] countries might emphasize adult features. An example of the changes that are likely to happen during localization is [[Fatal Frame (video game)|Fatal Frame]] (known in Japan as ''Zero'' and known in Europe as ''Project Zero'') ([[Tecmo]] 2001). In the original [[Japan]]ese version the female [[protagonist]], [[Fatal Frame|Miku]], was a frightened seventeen-year-old girl looking for her brother Mafuyu who disappeared after entering a [[Fatal Frame|haunted mansion]]. In the [[United States|US]] and [[Europe]]an versions Miku is nineteen, has Western features, and is not wearing the original [[Japanese school uniform]]. Unfortunately, developers did not think necessary to change her brother's appearance, so when players do find Mafuyu at the end of the game they do not seem to be blood-related.

A similar thing happens with the depiction of blood, and real historical events; many things have to be readjusted to fit the country's [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[taste (sociology)|taste]] in order not to hurt sensibilities. This is probably one of the reasons why so many games take place in imaginary worlds. This customisation effort draws on the knowledge of [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[strategist]]s, like [[Kate Edwards]] from Englobe. During the 2006 [[Game Developers Conference]] in [[California]] she explained the importance of being culturally aware when internationalising games in a presentation called "Fun vs. Offensive: Balancing the 'Cultural Edge' of Content for Global Games" (Edwards 2006). Both developers and [[Publishing|publisher]]s want to please their clients. [[Gamer]]s are not particularly interested in where the game comes from, or who created it any more than someone buying a new car or DVD player. A product for mass consumption only keeps the [[brand]]ing features of the [[trademark]]; all the other characteristics might be subject to customisation due to the need to appeal to the local market. Therefore, the translation will be in some cases an actual recreation, or, to put it in the words of Mangiron &amp; O’Hagan (2006), a "[[transcreation]]", where translators will be expected to produce a text with the right "feel" for the target market. It is important for translators to be aware of the logic behind this. Video games are a [[Computer software|software]] product, and as such, they will have [[Instruction manual (gaming)|manuals and instructions]], as well as interactive menus and [[Online help|help file]]s. This will call for technical [[translation]]. On the other hand, we will also find narration and dialogue closer to literary texts or film scripts where a more creative translation would be expected. However, unlike most forms of translation, video games can adapt or even change the original script, as long as it is in the search of enhanced fun and playability of the target culture. We can only find a parallel of this type of practice in the translation of children's [[literature]] where professionals often adapt or alter the original text to improve children's understanding and enjoyment of the book.

[[Sony Computer Entertainment|SCEE]] David Reeves, has stated that the main reason that Europe is often affected by significant content delays is because of language localization. He stated "the problem is that there isn't enough incentive for developers to work on multiple language translations during development. Hence, Europeans suffer delays and may never see a particular title". He also commented on why the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which are English speaking countries, also experience the same delays as those in continental Europe with many different languages despite little or no modification. He stated "With PlayStation Store we could probably go in the UK almost day and date. But then what are the Germans and the French going to say to me? That I'm Anglo-centric" indicating that the reason that these countries also must wait is to avoid criticism from other large European gaming countries such as [[Germany]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psxextreme.com/ps3-news/3037.html PS3 News: Reeves: Euro Gamers Wait Because&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural changes==
Oftentimes localization changes include adjusting a game to consider specific cultural sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fun-for-all-translation-and-accessibility-practices-in-video-games/oclc/867851587&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Fun for all: translation and accessibility practices in video games|last=Mangiron|first=Carmen|last2=Orero|first2=Pilar|last3=O'Hagan|first3=Minako|date=2014-01-01|isbn=9783034314503|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes may be self-enforced by the developers themselves, or enacted by national or regional rating boards ([[Video game content rating system]]). However, games are still sometimes released with controversial or insensitive material, which can lead to controversy or recall of the product.

Games localized for import into Germany often have significant changes made due to the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]]’s (USK) strict policies against blood and gore, profanity, and symbols associated with racial hatred, such as Nazi symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hagan and Mangiron, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the German version of Team Fortress 2 (2007) has no blood or detached body parts as a result of this regulation, which can cause difficulty for players as it is hard to tell if an enemy has been hit or taken damage (218). As a result, mods known as “bloodpatches” have been created for this and many German games that allow the blood and gore of the original game to be unlocked.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz 2006, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a significant overhaul of the graphics, the German localization of the World War II game Wolfenstein (2009) contained a single visible swastika on an art asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=5982811 Schnittberichte - Wolfenstein]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Raven Software recalled the game.&lt;ref&gt;Good 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

China also has strict censorship rules, and forbids content that endangers the “unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state” or the “social moralities or fine national cultural traditions,” amongst other qualifications.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2012"&gt;Zhang 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Swedish PC game [[Hearts of Iron]] (2002), set during World War II, was banned because the historically accurate maps depicted Manchuria, West Xinjiang, and Tibet as independent states. Additionally, Taiwan was shown to be a territory of Japan, as was accurate for the time period. However, these inclusions were considered harmful to China's territorial integrity, so the game was forbidden from being legally imported. The localization of Football Manager (2005) was similarly banned because Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China were all treated as separate teams, putting them on equal footing.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2012"/&gt;

== Linguistic assets ==
[[Video game]]s come accompanied by a variety of texts, for example manuals, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing script]]s, and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] that need translating, but they also have other type of texts in a format only common to utility software, like a [[word processor]], or an [[Web browser|internet browser]]. All these programs have one thing in common: information and commands are readily available at the click of a button. It is what we call ‘[[interactivity]]’. The interactive element of computer programs has serious consequences for translators because it means that access to texts and information is [[Randomness|random]], i.e., each user will activate a particular message or command at a different point, or not at all. An arbitrary sequence of events does not allow for linear texts and contextual information, therefore, translators lose two of the most important sources needed in the decision making process: co-text and context. When the program is still unfinished or no localization kit has been prepared, some information is still available, although difficult to obtain, from similar manuals, the localization manager, or the actual technical team responsible for the software. Esselink (2000) is probably one of the best references for the localization of utility software and [[web page]]s.

Unfortunately, the localization software industry has not been able to create a GUI ([[graphical user interface]]) localization tool for translators to use with video games, like the ones used in the translation of utility software and web pages. These programs (like [[Alchemy Catalyst|Catalyst]] and [[SDL Passolo|Passolo]]) allow users to work directly but safely with the game [[Source code|code]], generating a [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visual representation]] of the final product, which means that translators can see exactly what the end result will look like and adjust the text or the interface to suit the space available as well as the general look. The LRC ([[Localization Research Center]]) and LISA (The [[Localization Industry Standards Association]]) have ample information on these programs.

Linguistic assets will be utilised in a variety of ways at different times throughout the creation, development, and launch of the game, mainly: the game itself, which has a variety of texts in multiple formats, the official [[Website|web site]] of the game, promotional articles, [[Patch (computing)|game patches]] and updates.

== Textual types and file formats ==
Within these products there are different textual types, each of which has its own characteristics and purpose. Because we are dealing with a [[multimedia]] product, the challenges translators have to face are also multimedia. Within the same project they have to deal with a wide variety of issues like reproducing the oral quality of [[dialogue]] in writing, [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] for [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], space and time constraints for [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]], number of characters for subtitle, UI, etc. The following paragraphs are an attempt to classify the several textual types that accompany the standard PC video game:

=== [[Instruction manual (gaming)|Manual]] ===
(Written form. May be a [[Adobe PageMaker|Pagemaker]] or a [[Microsoft Word|Word]] format) Although it always has some attractive and engaging creative writing, partly [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] partly [[Literature|literary]], most of the manual would normally be filled with [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts when telling players the instructions to be followed to fully enjoy the game. Manuals would also include technical texts with the appropriate hardware and software specifications to be able to run the game application. In addition players will always find corporative and legal texts, informing users of their rights and responsibilities attached to the acquisition of an entertainment software product.

=== [[Video game packaging|Packaging]] ===
(Written form. Pagemaker or Word format) Like manuals, game boxes and packaging present a mixture of textual types, the difference being the space provided, limited not only by the size of it but also by images of the game, [[logo]]s of the companies involved and legal labelling requirements. It mixes an alluring promotional text, together with concise technical information and legal notices.

=== [[README|Readme]] file ===
(Written form. [[WordPad]]/[[Rich text]] format) This small [[Text file|.txt]] file is probably the last thing in the development process. It is used to inform users of all the last-minute adjustments and how to make sure that the product runs smoothly, as well as to correct mistakes and typos in the printed material, such as manual and packaging. It is mainly a technical text.

=== Official website ===
(Written form. [[HTML]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] format) It mixes a promotional text with a [[Journalism|journalistic]] one, but it will also have technical details like minimum requirements, etc. A lot of the information offered through the official web will be similar to the one that was shipped with the game. But websites tend to include previews and reviews of the product, [[Bulletin board|notice board]]s, [[Technical support|customer support]] and downloadable files to fix specific problems, or [[Patch (computing)|patches]] with new language versions, as well as [[screenshot]]s, [[concept art]], thematic [[Screensaver|screen saver]]s, [[merchandising]], and fan [[blog]]s.

=== [[Dialogue]] for [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] ===
(Spoken form. There will be a separate sound file per utterance. Written scripts will normally be in [[spreadsheet]]s or Word tables.) Speech delivered by game characters where [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s, and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] have to be conveyed into other languages. Sometimes an extra column is included to add inflection comments for the dubbing director. A part of the dubbing script may include atmospheric utterances also in a spoken form. Many games might feature characters talking or reacting to players’ actions. These characters may have little or no relevance to the plot, but their inclusion and to the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] of the player in the virtual world. No synchronisation is normally required, but [[orality]] has to be maintained.

=== Dialogue for [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] ===
(Written form. Spreadsheets and [[table (information)|table]]s are preferred for this although subtitles might be [[Hard coding|hard-coded]] in order to [[Synchronization|synchronize]] them with video and [[animation]]s). Oral text in written form. The dubbing script may be applied directly in the subtitling of the game, which results in cluttered and fast subtitles with no character limit per line, nor lines per subtitle. In addition, translators may be faced with the fact that not all languages allow for the same freedom when writing subtitles. Often translators will have to apply techniques used in the translation of children's literature and comic-books to convey certain characteristics that would otherwise be lost. Time and space constraints are very relevant here.

=== [[User interface|User interface (UI)]] ===
(Written form. Table format, sometimes hard-coded text file due to the interactivity of each item). Space in menus, pop-up windows and hint captions is at a premium and redesigning is rarely an option, so translators will have to maintain a similar number of characters to that of the original label. Similarly to what happens in software localization, video games may have very detailed and crowded menu options to control different features of the game such as difficulty level, as well as graphic display selection, [[mouse (computing)#Mouse speed|mouse sensitivity]], or feedback preferences.

=== [[Graphic arts|Graphic art]] with words ===
(Written form. A multi-layered graphic format will be needed). Players will normally find this type of graphic-text in game names but they can often be seen throughout the game as part of the [[brand]]ing of the product, as well as in [[Advertising|advertisement]]s.

==Controversy==
In the 2010s there has been debate about how Japanese games are localized, particularly for [[Nintendo]] platforms.&lt;ref name="kotakuFromJapan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/from-japan-with-changes-the-endless-debate-over-video-1747960323|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|work=Kotaku|title=From Japan, With Changes: The Endless Debate Over Video Game 'Censorship’|date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nymagScalp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/this-looks-like-a-disgraceful-gamergate-win.html|last=Singal|first=Jesse|work=New York Magazine|title=Gamergate May Have Just Won Its Most Disgraceful Scalp Yet|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans consider resulting changes to plot and characterization as marring the original artistic vision, and some object to sexual content being removed or [[bowlderized]].&lt;ref name="kotakuFromJapan"/&gt; Localization of Nintendo games is commonly handled by a Nintendo division called the Treehouse.&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-ugly-new-front-in-the-neverending-video-game-cultur-1762942381|last=Clepek|first=Patrick|work=Kotaku|title=The Ugly New Front In The Neverending Video Game Culture War|date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of Nintendo's unwillingness to communicate about localization, speculation and conspiracy theories circulated among enthusiasts,&lt;ref name="kotakuFromJapan"/&gt; and several employees of the Treehouse were alleged to be responsible for unpopular changes.&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"/&gt;

Allison Rapp, a Treehouse employee not directly involved in localization, garnered controversy due to her comments on Twitter.&lt;ref name="nymagScalp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"/&gt; Attention on Rapp was heightened as part of the [[Gamergate controversy]] by the circulation of an undergraduate essay by Rapp which favored [[cultural relativism]] regarding sexualization of minors in Japanese media. The essay argued against the sort of censorship that the Treehouse's critics decried.&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"/&gt; Some however interpreted the essay as defending the exploitation of children, and readers of [[The Daily Stormer]] organized a letter-writing campaign to have her fired.&lt;ref name="nymagScalp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianRapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/31/nintendo-denies-alison-rapp-firing-is-linked-to-harassment-campaign|last=Stuart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=Nintendo denies Alison Rapp firing is linked to harassment campaign|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That initiative was controversial within the Gamergate movement, with some supporters considering it justifiable treatment of an ideological opponent, while others considered the campaign against Rapp to be unethical or not aligned with the movement's goals.&lt;ref name="nymagScalp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotakuUglyNew"/&gt; Rapp was subsequently fired, though Nintendo issued a statement that the reason was that Rapp had held a second job against company policy.&lt;ref name="guardianRapp"/&gt; She maintains that her controversial online presence was the true cause.&lt;ref name="guardianRapp"/&gt;
