      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">The '''Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe''' (ACARE) is a [[Europe|European]] advisory body that aims to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the [[European Union]] in the field of [[aeronautics]]. It is a [[public-private partnership]] between the [[Directorate-General for Transport and Energy]] of the [[European Commission]] and industry leaders. ACARE was launched at the [[Paris Airshow]] in June 2001 and has about 40 members.

==Overview==
In the year 2000 the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science]], [[Philippe Busquin]], invited a number of [[aviation]] industry leaders to produce a strategy detailing how the European Commission could help Europe’s aviation industry become more competitive. This ‘Group of Personalities’ published [https://web.archive.org/web/20140823065946/http://ec.europa.eu/research/growth/aeronautics2020/pdf/aeronautics2020_en.pdf ‘’European Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020’’] in January 2001. The document recommended the creation of ACARE, which would define the content of a long-term strategy to create a coherent European aviation research network. This network would bring together industry leaders, government actors from the [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] of the European Union, and the European Commission.

Following the publication of ACARE’s [http://www.acare4europe.org/sites/acare4europe.org/files/document/volume1.pdf ‘’Strategic Research Agenda’’], the Commission launched a number of aeronautical research bodies and initiatives as part of the 6th and 7th [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]] and the [[Horizon 2020]] Research and Innovation Programme. Prominent examples of these include the [[Clean Sky| Clean Sky Joint Undertaking]], a public-private partnership coordinating and funding research projects that aim to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation by developing more fuel-efficient technologies, and the [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]], which aims to improve the efficiency of the European [[air traffic management]] system.

'''Algerian–Malian relations''' refer to the relationship between [[Algeria]] and [[Mali]]. Algeria maintains an embassy in [[Bamako]] and a consulate in [[Gao]], while Mali has en embassy in [[Algiers]].

The relationship between two countries, once former colonies of [[France]], both share the [[Sahel]] desert as border, and also having a very long border, has made the relationship become a major obstacle for both two neighboring states. As two majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] countries, recent instability in Mali, notably the [[Azawad]] of the [[Tuareg people]] has poured a large presence of [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] and it has pushes Algeria into a difficult situation. To retaliate, Algeria fortified their border and deployed more troops to secure the border with Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/02/201324152820629866.html|title=Algeria beefs up army presence on Mali border|date=5 February 2013|work=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of growing militants from Mali brings Algeria and the [[United States]] to discuss on how to curb their extremist actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/algeria-mali-al-qaeda_n_2497280.html|work=Huffington Post|title=In Algeria And Mali, Al Qaeda-Tied Terrorists Pose Challenge For U.S. Forces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/world/africa/us-tries-to-coordinate-anti-militant-push-in-mali.html|work=The New York Times|title=U.S. and Algeria discuss ousting Mali militants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malian immigrants has formed at least 1% of Algerian population, and most live in coastal cities such as [[Oran]], [[Constantine]] and [[Algiers]], although Malians sometimes live in the South, notably in [[Tamanrasset Province|Tamanrasset]] and [[Adrar Province]]s.

Algeria and Mali have been going further to diversify economic cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201509011604.html|title=Algeria, Mali Willing to Diversify Bilateral Relations|date=1 September 2015|work=All Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has been a major investor to Mali, economically due to Algeria's economic progress and lesser poverty comparing to Mali.

==2012 seizure of Algerian consulate==
During the [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|Tuareg rebellion of 2012]], the Algerian consulate was seized by at least two people wearing explosives belts. Seven hostages were taken, including the consul. In regards to [[Azawad]]'s UDI, Algeria's Prime Minister has declared it would never "accept questioning Mali's territorial integrity" Algeria has planned to co-ordinate with MNLA to work towards freeing the hostages.

'''All India Radio''' ('''AIR'''), officially known since 1956 as '''''Ākāsha Vāṇī''''' ("Voice from the Sky") is the national [[public broadcasting|public]] radio broadcaster of [[India]] and is a division of [[Prasar Bharati]]. It was established in 1930.&lt;ref name=Milestones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Profile/Milestones |title=Milestones of AIR (official website) |publisher=All India Radio |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sister service of Prasar Bharati's [[Doordarshan]], an Indian television broadcaster. Headquartered in the Akashvani Bhavan building in [[New Delhi]], it houses the Drama Section, the FM Section, the National Service, and is also home to the Indian television station [[Doordarshan]] Kendra, ([[Delhi]]).

All India Radio is the largest radio network in the world, and one of the largest broadcasting organizations in the world in terms of the number of languages broadcast and the spectrum of socio-economic and cultural diversity it serves. AIR’s home service comprises 420 stations located across the country, reaching nearly 92% of the country’s area and 99.19% of the total population. AIR originates programming in 23 languages and 179 dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Default.aspx|title=Default|last=|first=|date=|website=allindiaradio.gov.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Etymology}}Etymology==
{{Main|Akashvani (term)}}

[[wiktionary:akashvani|Ākāśavāni]] (आकाशवाणी) is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning 'celestial announcement' or 'voice from the sky/heaven'. In [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], Akashvanis are often featured in stories as a medium of communication from heaven to mankind.

'Akashvani' was first used in the context of radio by M. V. Gopalaswami in 1936 after setting up India's first private radio station in his residence, "Vittal Vihar" (about two hundred yards from AIR’s current [[Mysore]] radio station).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/mysore-akashavani-is-now-75-years-old/408172/ |title=Mysore Akashavani is now 75 years old |publisher=[[Business Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Akashvani'' was later adopted as All India Radio's on-air name in 1957.

==History==
Broadcasting began in June 1923 during the [[British Raj]] with programs by the [[Bombay Presidency Radio Club]] and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorized to operate two radio stations: the [[Bombay]] station which began on 23 July 1927, and the [[Calcutta]] station which followed on 26 August 1927. The company went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over the broadcasting facilities and began the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on 1 April 1930 on an experimental basis for two years, and permanently in May 1932 it then went on to become All India Radio on 8 June 1936.&lt;ref name=Milestones/&gt;

On 1 October 1939, the External Service began with a broadcast in [[Pashto language|Pushtu]]. It was intended to counter radio [[propaganda]] from Germany directed at Afghanistan, Iran and Arab nations. 1939 also saw the opening of the [[Dhaka]] station of Eastern India, in what is now [[Bangladesh]]. This station catered and nurtured the pioneers of Bengali intellectuals. The foremost among them, [[Natyaguru]] [[Nurul Momen]], became the trail-blazer of the talk-show in 1939. He wrote and directed the first modern radio-play for this station in 1942. When India became independent in 1947, the AIR network had only six stations ([[Delhi]], [[Bombay]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Lucknow]], and [[Tiruchirappalli]]). The three radio stations at [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]] and [[Dhaka]] remained in what became Pakistan after the division. The total number of radio sets in India at that time was about 275,000. On 3 October 1957, the ''[[Vividh Bharati]]'' Service was launched, to compete with [[Radio Ceylon]]. Television broadcasting began in Delhi in 1959 as part of AIR, but was split off from the radio network as ''[[Doordarshan]]'' on 1 April 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |title=AIR Manual, Chapter 1: History of All India Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917064450/http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in [[Chennai]], and expanded during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |title=Milestones of AIR |publisher=All India Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612212622/http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deccan Radio (Nizam Radio 1932)]], the first radio station in [[Hyderabad State]] (now [[Hyderabad, India]]), went live on air on 3 February 1935. It was launched by [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]] the 7th [[Nizam]] of Hyderabad with a transmitting power of 200 [[Watt]]s. On 1 April 1950, Deccan Radio was taken over by the Indian Government, and in 1956 it was merged with All India Radio (AIR). Since then, it has been known as AIR-Hyderabad (100&amp;nbsp;kW).&lt;ref name="Wavescan2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long and Interesting Story of All India Radio, Hyderabad–Part 2|url=http://yimber-gaviria.blogspot.com/2010/08/wavescan-nws78-dx-program.html|work=Wavescan-NWS78|date=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External services==
The external services of All India Radio are broadcast in 27 languages to countries outside India via high-power [[shortwave band]] broadcasts. [[Medium wave]] is also used to reach neighbouring countries. In addition to broadcasts targeted at specific countries by language, there is a General Overseas Service broadcasting in English with 8¼ hours of programming each day aimed at a general international audience. The external broadcasts were begun on 1 October 1939 by the British government to counter the propaganda of the Nazis directed at the Afghan people. The first broadcasts were in Pushto, beamed to Afghanistan and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]]. Broadcasts soon began in other languages including: Dari, Persian, Arabic, English, Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, Malay and French. The external services broadcast in 16 foreign and 11 Indian languages, with a total program output of 70¼ hours per day on medium and shortwave frequencies.

Two high powered FM stations of All India Radio are being installed in Amritsar and Fazilka in the Punjab to supplement the programs broadcast from transmitters operating from Jalandhar, New Delhi, Chandigarh and Mumbai and to improve the broadcast services during unfavourable weather conditions in the border regions of Punjab.

Today, the External Services Division of All India Radio broadcasts daily with 57 transmissions with almost 72 hours or programming covering over 108 countries in 27 languages, of which 15 are foreign and 12 Indian. The foreign languages are: Arabic, Baluchi, Burmese, Chinese, Dari, French, Indonesian, Persian, Pushtu, Russian, Sinhala, Swahili, Thai, Tibetan and English (General Overseas Service). The Indian languages are Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, Kashmiri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Nepali, Punjabi, Saraiki, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.

The longest daily broadcast is the Urdu Service to Pakistan, around the clock on DTH ([[direct-broadcast satellite]]) and on short- and medium wave for 12¼ hrs. The English-language General Overseas Service is broadcast 8¼ hours daily. During [[Hajj]], there are special broadcasts beamed to Saudi Arabia in Urdu. AIR is planning to produce programmes in the [[Baluchi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/all-india-radio-to-revamp-baluchi-language-programme-116083101302_1.html|title=All India Radio to revamp Baluchi language programme|first=|last=IANS|date=31 August 2016|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external services of AIR are also broadcast to Europe in DRM ([[Digital Radio Mondiale]]) on 9950&amp;nbsp;kHz between 1745–2230 UTC. These external transmissions are broadcast by high-power transmitters located at Aligarh, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Gorakhpur, Guwahati, Mumbai and Panaji on shortwave and from Jalandhar, Kolkata, Nagpur, Rajkot and Tuticorin on medium wave. Soon All India Radio Amritsar will also start a booster service on the FM band. Some of these transmitters are 1000&amp;nbsp;kW (1&amp;nbsp;MW) or 500&amp;nbsp;kW. Programs are beamed to different parts of the world except for the Americas and the reception quality is very good in the target areas. In each language service, the program consists of news, commentary, a press review, talks on matters of general or cultural interest, feature programmes, documentaries and music from India and the target region. Most programs originate at New Broadcasting House on Parliament Street in New Delhi, with a few originating at SPT Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jalandhar, Kolkata, HPT Malad Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram and Tuticorin.

The External Services Division of AIR is a link between India and rest of the world, especially in countries with Indian emigrants and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|people of Indian origin]]. It broadcasts the Indian point of view on matters of national and international importance, and demonstrates the Indian way of life through its programs. [[QSL cards]] (which are sought-after by international radio hobbyists) are issued to radio hobbyists by AIR in New Delhi for [[reception report]]s of their broadcasts.

==Direct-To-Home==
Direct-to-home (DTH) service is a satellite television service in which a large number of television channels are digitally compressed, encrypted, up-linked, and beamed down over a territory from a high-power satellite. The DTH signals can be received directly at homes using a small-sized dish receiver unit containing a dish antenna installed on a building’s rooftop or on a wall facing clear south and one indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddindia.gov.in/Technical/Pages/DD-Free-Dish-(DTH).aspx|title=DD Free Dish (DTH)|website=ddindia.gov.in|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; DTH service is offered on twenty one channels via [[Indian National Satellite System|Insat]].

The most prominent broadcaster of English Features was [[Melville de Mellow]], and of Hindi Features, Shiv Sagar Mishra. This format has been revived by AIR producers across India because of its flexibility, its relative low cost to produce, its messaging potential and its creative potential.

===Central Drama Unit===
AIR's Central Drama Unit (CDU) is responsible for the national broadcast of plays. Plays produced by the CDU are translated and produced by regional stations. Since its inception in the 1960s, the unit has produced more than 1,500 plays, and the CDU houses a repository of old scripts and productions. The National Programme of Plays is broadcast by the CDU on the fourth Thursday of each month at 9.30&amp;nbsp;pm. Each play included in the National Programme of Plays is produced in 22 Indian languages and broadcast at the same time by all regional and national network stations. The CDU also produces Chain Plays, half-hour dramas broadcast in succession by a chain of stations.

===Social Media Cell===
The News Service Division's Social Media Cell was established on 20 May 2013 and is responsible for providing AIR news on new media platforms such as websites, Twitter, Facebook, and SMS.

The law has three primary purposes: to incorporate the rights of  the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) and the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] into the national law, to provide the responsibilities of government agencies associated with the law and to integrate children-focused legislation  into one comprehensive law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Achilihu|first1=Stephen Nmeregini|title=Do African Children Have Rights?: A Comparative and Legal Analysis of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|date=2010|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781599428536|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=V9ICUHILa68C&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a legislation against [[Human trafficking]] since it forbids children from being "separated from ... parents against their will, except where it is in the best interests of the child,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cullen-DuPont|first1=Kathryn|title=Human Trafficking|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119007|page=90|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=B2GeSNXy5CoC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Col·lectius d'Obrers en Lluita''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] for 'Collectives of Workers in Struggle') was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] left-nationalist [[trade union]]. COLL functioned as the trade union wing of the [[Socialist Party of National Liberation - Provisional]] (PSAN-p). COLL, which was formed by members of [[CC.OO.]] emerged in January 1977, with cells in [[Barcelona]], [[Lleida]] and [[Majorca]]. In September the same year COLL broke away from CC.OO.

COLL published ''Obrers en Lluita''.

In 1987 COLL merged into the [[Trade Union Workers Coordination]] (''Coordinadora Obrera Sindical'').

The '''Cretan State''' ({{lang-el|Κρητική Πολιτεία}}, ''Kritiki Politia''; {{lang-ota|كريد دولتى}}, ''Girit Devleti''), was established in 1898, following the intervention by the [[Great Power]]s (Britain, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Russia) on the island of [[Crete]]. In 1897, an insurrection in Crete headed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] to [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|declare war]] on [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], which led [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to intervene on the grounds that the Ottoman Empire could no longer maintain control.  It was the prelude to the island's final annexation to the [[Kingdom of Greece]], which occurred ''[[de facto]]'' in 1908 and ''[[de jure]]'' in 1913.

==History==
===Background===
{{Main article|History of Crete|Ottoman Crete|}}
The island of Crete, an Ottoman possession since the end of the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Cretan War]], was inhabited by a mostly Greek-speaking population, whose majority was Christian. During and after the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Christians of the island rebelled several times against external Ottoman rule, pursuing union with Greece. These were brutally subdued, but secured some concessions from the Ottoman government under the pressure of European public opinion. In 1878, the [[Pact of Halepa]] established the island as an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty, until the Ottomans reneged on that agreement in 1889.

The collapse of the Pact heightened tensions in the island, leading to another rebellion in 1895, which greatly expanded in 1896–1897 to cover most of the island. Six [[Great Powers]] ([[Austria-Hungary]], [[France]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]]) sent warships to Crete in February 1897, and their naval forces combined to form an "[[International Squadron (Cretan intervention, 1897–1898)|International Squadron]]" charged with intervening to bring fighting on Crete to a halt.&lt;ref name=mctienan13-14&gt;McTiernan, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, nationalist secret societies and a fervently [[Irredentism|irredentist]] public opinion forced the Greek government to send military forces to the island. Although the International Squadron quickly halted their activities,&lt;ref name=mctienan13-14/&gt; the presence of Greek forces on Crete provoked a [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|war with the Ottoman Empire]]. Although most of Crete came under the control of Cretan insurgent and Greek forces, the unprepared [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]] was crushed by [[Ottoman Army|the Ottomans]], who occupied [[Thessaly]]. The war was ended by the intervention of the [[Great Power]]s (the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Russia), who forced the Greek contingent to withdraw from Crete and the Ottoman Army to stop its advance. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|Treaty of Constantinople]] the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Government]] promised to implement the provisions of the Halepa Pact.

===Establishment of the Cretan State===
[[File:Timbre Crete PrinceGeorgesdeGrece 1900.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Stamp of Crete, representing the High Commissioner [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George]]]]
[[File:British Marines in Chania, 1897.jpg|thumb|180px|British [[Royal Marines]] parade in the streets of [[Chania]] in Crete following the occupation of the island by the Great Powers in spring 1897.]]
In February 1897, the Great Powers decided to restore order by governing the island temporarily through an "Admirals Council" consisting of admirals from the six powers making up the International Squadron. Through naval bombardments of Cretan insurgent forces, by placing sailors and [[marines]] ashore to occupy key cities, and by establishing a [[blockade]] of Crete and key ports in Greece, the International Squadron brought organized fighting on Crete to an end by the end of March 1897, although the insurrection continued.&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, pp. 13-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers from the armies of five of the powers (Germany declined to send any) arrived to occupy key Cretan cities in late March and April 1897.&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the Admirals Council focused on a negotiated settlement that would bring the insurrection to an end without bringing Ottoman governance of Crete to an end, but this proved impossible. They then decided that Crete would become an autonomous state under the [[suzerainty]] of the Ottoman Empire. Germany strongly opposed this idea and withdrew from Crete and the International Squadron in November 1897 and Austria-Hungary followed in March 1898, but the remaining four powers carried on with their plans.&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1898 (25 August 1898 according to the [[Julian calendar]] then in use on Crete, which was 12 days behind the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] during the 19th century), a Turkish mob [[Candia massacre|massacred hundreds of Cretan Greeks]] and murdered the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], his family, and 17 British soldiers. As a result, the International Squadron and the occupying forces ashore expelled all Ottoman forces from Crete in November 1898.&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, pp. 32-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous Cretan State, under Ottoman suzerainty, garrisoned by an international military force, and with its [[High Commissioner]] provided by Greece, was founded when [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark]] arrived to take office as the first High Commissioner ({{lang-el|Ὕπατος Ἁρμοστής}}, ''Hýpatos Harmostēs''), effectively detaching Crete from the Ottoman Empire, on 21 December 1898 (9 December according to the Julian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;Kitromilides M. Paschalis (ed) ''Eleftherios Venizelos: The Trials of Statesmanship'', Edinburgh University Press, 2008 p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, pp. 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admirals Council was dissolved on 26 December 1898.&lt;ref&gt;McTiernan, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Bank of Greece]] established a bank, the [[Bank of Crete (1899–1919)|Bank of Crete]], which had a 40-year monopoly on note issuance. The Cretan State also established a paramilitary force, the [[Cretan Gendarmerie]], modeled on the Italian [[Carabinieri]], to maintain public order. The Cretan Gendarmerie incorporated the four small gendarmerie units the four remaining occupying powers had created before the arrival of Prince George.

===Internal turmoil – the Therisos Revolt===
{{Details|Theriso revolt}}

[[File:Nomisma Kritis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Five drachmae coin of the Cretan State (1901)]]
On 13 December 1898, [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George of Greece]] arrived as High Commissioner for a three-year tenure. On 27 April 1899, an Executive Committee was created, in which a young, Athens-trained lawyer from [[Chania]], [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], participated as Minister of Justice. By 1900, Venizelos and the Prince had developed differences over domestic policies, as well as the issue of ''Enosis'', the union with Greece.

Venizelos resigned in early 1901, and for the next three years, he and his supporters waged a bitter political struggle with the Prince's faction, leading to a political and administrative deadlock on the island. Eventually, in March 1905, Venizelos and his supporters gathered in the village of [[Theriso]]s, in the hills near Chania, constituted a "Revolutionary Assembly", demanded political reforms and declared the "political union of Crete with Greece as a single free constitutional state" in a manifesto delivered to the consuls of the [[Great Powers]]. The [[Cretan Gendarmerie]] remained loyal to the Prince, but numerous deputies joined the revolt, and despite the Powers' declaration of military law on 18 July, their military forces did not move against the rebels.

On 15 August, the Cretan Assembly voted for the proposals of Venizelos, and the Great Powers brokered an agreement, whereby Prince George would resign and a new constitution created. In the 1906 elections the pro-Prince parties took 38,127 votes while pro-Venizelos parties took 33,279 votes, but in September 1906 Prince George was replaced by former Greek [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] [[Alexandros Zaimis]] and left the island. In addition, Greek officers came to replace the Italians in the organization of the Gendarmerie, and the withdrawal of the foreign troops began, leaving Crete ''de facto'' under Greek control.

===Union with Greece===
A [[Constitution of the Cretan State|Constitution]] was promulgated in February 1907, but in 1908, taking advantage of [[Young Turk Revolution|domestic turmoil in Turkey]] as well as the timing of Zaimis' vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies declared unilateral [[enosis|union]] with Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Ion, Theodore P., "The Cretan Question," ''The American Journal of International Law'', April, 1910, pp. 276–284&lt;/ref&gt; The flag of the Cretan State was replaced by the Greek flag, all public servants took an oath to King George I of Greece, and the Greek constitution and laws were enacted on the island. This act was not recognized internationally, including by Greece, where Eleftherios Venizelos was elected Prime Minister in 1910. In May 1912, the Cretan deputies travelled to Athens and tried to enter the [[Greek Parliament]], but were forcibly prevented from doing so by the police.

Upon the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], Greece finally recognized the union and sent [[Stephanos Dragoumis]] as the island's [[governor-general]]. The Great Powers tacitly recognized the ''fait accompli'' by the act of lowering their flags from the Souda fortress on 14 February 1913, and by the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] in May 1913, Sultan [[Mehmed V]] relinquished his formal rights to the island.

On 1 December, the formal ceremony of union took place: the [[Greek flag]] was raised at the Firka Fortress in [[Chania]], with Eleftherios Venizelos and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] in attendance. The [[Cretan Turks|Muslim minority of Crete]] initially remained on the island but was later relocated to Turkey under the general [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] agreed to in the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]] between Turkey and Greece.

==Population==
The total population in 1911 was 336,151: 307,812 Christians, 27,852 Muslims and 487 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913–1936, M. Th Houtsma, page 879&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Life Design''' (DLD) is a global conference network, organized by the [[Munich]] based DLD Media, a company of Burda Digital. DLD acts as a platform for an exchange of future visions and experiences, driven by the mission to create a network of innovation, digital prospects, science and culture.

In 2005, Stephanie Czerny and Marcel Reichart founded DLD as an annual conference scheme. Its main purpose is to connect business, creative and social leaders, opinion formers and investors for crossover conversation and inspiration. Since its first gathering, DLD hosted events in [[New York City]], [[Beijing]], [[San Francisco]], [[London]], [[Moscow]], [[New Delhi]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tel Aviv]] and Munich.(e.g. DLD Global Conference)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dld-conference.com/articles/article/dld-digital-life-design_aid_11.html "DLD Conference"]. DLD-conference.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, DLD initiated a female themed conference DLDwomen (see "Events" below). The DLD Conference is referred to by the Economist as one of Europe`s leading conferences on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;David Rowan (2 February 2011). [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-02/02/dld-conference-eric-schmidt?page=all "Why DLD is Europe’s hottest conference invitation"]. Wired.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16317551?story_id=16317551 "Europe's tech entrepreneurs - Blooming"]. Economist.com. 10 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaired by [[Hubert Burda]] and [[Yossi Vardi]] the DLD conference held in Munich hosts over 800 creative international leaders, disruptors and thinkers from digital and consumer markets, media, technology, design, science, politics, social, arts and culture from around the globe. The three-day event always takes place in late January before the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]]. At this time, DLD also offers live streaming and blogging.
Speakers present their ideas in thematically assembled panels or in key speeches. Alongside DLD guests, speakers shed light on the developments in our markets, society and lifestyles through central innovation paradigms.

==Background==
Since 2005 the conference is held in Munich, Germany, where the DLD headquarters are located. Each year the slogan of the conference accordingly changes to the dominant theme.

Most countries issue '''diplomatic license plates''' to accredited [[diplomat]]s. Per the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]], these are special [[vehicle registration plates]] which typically have distinctive features to allow [[diplomatic vehicle]]s to be distinguished from other vehicles by police and other bodies, allowing them to give diplomatic vehicles special treatment and warning them that the operators and passengers of those vehicles may have [[diplomatic immunity]]. Critics of these plates say that operators of these vehicles abuse these privileges, often parking in illegal spaces and breaking vehicular law without fear of repercussion. 

Conventions on the format of diplomatic license plates vary from country to country. They often feature the letters "CD" (for "''[[Corps Diplomatique]]''"), "D" (for "Diplomat") or prefix of international organisations with diplomatic privileges, such as "EU" (for "EUROPEAN UNION") and "OSCE" (for "Organization For Security And Co-operation In Europe").

'''''El Icha ''''' (Life) is a 2010 film from Tunisia.

== Synopsis ==
Havet is a [[Tunisia]]n woman of some forty years. She is a widow and has a twenty-year-old son who has emigrated to [[Canada]]. She lives with her mother in a working-class neighborhood in [[Tunis]] and works as a [[telemarketing]] operator for a French company installed in Tunis. Each morning, she leaves for work, sinking deeper and deeper into suffocating routine. At home, her life is monotonous and of no interest.&lt;!-- Sounds fascinating! --&gt;

[[Image:Explorer_vodka.jpg#file|thumb|right|150px|Explorer Vodka]]
'''Explorer Vodka''' is a Swedish [[vodka]] brand manufactured by the [[V&amp;S Group]], formerly owned by the Swedish government. It was developed in the 1950s, targeted for customers in the [[United States]], but its 1958 launch failed in the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocktailguiden.com/artiklar/explorer-vodka Cocktailguiden: Explorer Vodka], accessed 2012-12-16 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it is one of Sweden's most popular brands of vodka, and has during some periods been the most sold distilled beverages in Sweden. It was the first Swedish alcoholic beverage to be termed vodka rather than ''[[brännvin]]''.

The bottle was designed by Swedish ex-prince [[Sigvard Bernadotte]].

'''Hizb-an-Nusra''' ({{lang-en|'''Party of Support'''}}) is an [[Islamist]] organization which the Uzbek government considers to be [[terrorist]] in nature that has operated in [[Uzbekistan]] since 1999. It was founded by [[Mirzazhanov Atoyevich]]. Members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], an international organization dedicated to establishing a unified Islamic state across the Muslim world, created Hizb-an-Nusra in [[Tashkent]] out of dissatisfaction with Hizb ut-Tahrir's inability to overthrow the [[Government of Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="SPLIT"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav202103.shtml Hizb ut-Tahrir faces internal split in Central Asia] EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Akromiya]], another Islamic Uzbek terrorist organization, broke away from HT in 1996. Akromiya leader [[Akrom Yo‘ldoshev]]'s pamphlet ''Yimonga Yul'' (Way to Faith) criticizes HT's goal of creating an international [[caliphate]] for impracticality. Yudashev argues in favor of creating an [[Islamic state]] on a local level instead.&lt;ref name="SPLIT"/&gt;

[[File:Escudo de la Casa de Álvarez-Cuevas sin corona.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the House of Álvarez-Cuevas]]
The '''House of Álvarez-Cuevas''' or '''House of Álvarez de Cuevas''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Nobility|aristocratic]] family. In the 19th century, they possessed the [[noble titles]] of Marquises of Santa Cruz de Marcenado and Viscounts of Puerto.

After the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1713) and the victory of [[Philip V of Spain]], supported by the House of Álvarez-Cuevas, successive members of the family participated in the [[West Indies Fleet]] and occupied high military commands in [[Cádiz]], [[Veracruz]], [[La Habana]] and [[Cartagena de Indias]], in the [[Spanish Navy]]. They also occupied different municipal offices in [[El Puerto de Santa María]], where Francisco de Álvarez-Cuevas y Banquero became an illustrious native of the city.

In the 18th century, the senior line of the family was established in the [[Principality of Catalonia]], when Juan de Álvarez-Cuevas y de Craywinckel married María Luisa de Viard y de Salvador, niece of the Count of Fogonella.

The '''Inkanyamba''' is a legendary serpent said to be living in a waterfall lake area in the northern forests near [[Pietermaritzburg]] most commonly in the base of [[Howick Falls]], [[South Africa]]. The [[Zulu people|Zulu]] tribes of the area believe it to be a large serpent with a horse like head. Most active in the summer months, it is believed that the Inkanyamba's anger causes the seasonal storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getawaytoafrica.com/content/magazine/features/feature.asp?id=909 |title=Legends of the deep |last1=Exelby |first1=Narina |last2= |first2= |date=March 2004 |website=Gateway to Africa |publisher= |access-date=18 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113075226/http://www.getawaytoafrica.com/content/magazine/features/feature.asp?id=909|archivedate=20 September 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Cryptozoologists have suggested that it might be a form of [[eel]], augmented by local myth.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Inkanyamba was featured on television series [[Animal X (TV series)|Animal X]].&lt;ref&gt;Inkanyamba - African Legend.

'''Intelsat IVA F-3''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-353]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IVA F-3 was part of the Intelsat IVA series which consisted of 6 satellites, of which five were successfully placed into orbit. All five satellites in the series were retired and operated an average of almost 4 years beyond their life expectancies. The satellite antenna allowed coverage from the land masses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] basin with four point beams and had sufficient insulation between the east beams and the western beams that used the same frequencies in the east and west. The separation of the beam by directional [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] allowed this dual use of the frequency, significantly increasing the capacity of satellite communication within an assigned frequency range. Although the initial requirement Intelsat VAT series was only for the Atlantic service, but also was given special attention during the project to provide service on the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]].

The satellite had 20 transponders (individual radio transmitters) compared to 12 on board each Intelsat IV satellite. It had a total height of 22 feet, 11 inches (7.01 meters) and a diameter of 7 feet, 9 inches (2.38 meters). The solar panels, covered with about 17,000 solar cells, provided primary energy of 600 Watts. The weight of the satellite, which had an orbiting life project of 7 years, was about £3335 (1,515&amp;nbsp;kg).

The satellite was successfully launched into space on January 07, 1978, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,515&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 22 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kiga''' (also called ''Rukiga'', ''Ruchiga'', or ''Chiga'') is the native language of the [[Kiga people]] (''Bakiga''). Kiga is a very similar language to the [[Nkore language]]. It was first written in the second half of the 19th century.

Kiga is so similar to Nkore (84%–94% lexical similarity&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nyn|title=Ethnologue Report for Language Code: nyn|last=Lewis|first=Paul M. (ed.)|year=2009|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Dallas, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that some argue they are [[dialects]] of the same language, called [[Nkore-Kiga]] by [[Charles V. Taylor (linguist)|Charles Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Poletto 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poletto|first=Robert E.|title=Topics in Runyankore Phonology|location=Linguistics Graduate Program, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio|year=1998|url=ftp://ftp.ling.ohio-state.edu/pub/odden/Polettodissertation.pdf|accessdate=Dec 8, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, Kiga has a noun class system in which prefixes on nouns mark membership of one of the noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives, and verbs reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Some examples of noun classes:
* mu – person (singular), e.g. ''omukiga'' = inhabitant of [[Kigezi]] land
* ru – language, e.g. ''Rukiga'' = language of the Kiga
* ba – people, e.g. ''Bakiga'' = The Kiga people
* ki – customs or traditions, e.g. ''kikiga'', (sometimes spelled ''Kichiga''), describes religious tradition common to the Kiga people.  Sometimes the people are called 'Chiga' by people misunderstanding the linguistic rules in relation to the prefixes.

The sound {{IPAblink|l}} is not distinctive in Rukiga.  The letter "r" is used instead.

'''Luchtverkeersleiding Nederland (LVNL)''' is the agency in charge of [[air traffic control]] in the airspace of the [[Netherlands]]. Since 1998 it is an independent [[government agency]]. The LVNL is integrated into the Central European Functional Airspace Block ([[Functional airspace block|FABEC]]).

==History==
The origin of the LVNL can be traced back to 1930 when the Royal Aviation Service (Rijksluchtvaartdienst) was created and the Directorate for Aviation Security was created.

==Organisation==
The agency is based at Schiphol airport and has offices at 3 other airports:
*[[Rotterdam Airport]]
*[[Groningen Airport Eelde]]
*[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]]
In addition to handling civil aviation traffic in the Netherlands, the LVNL is also responsible for the maintenance of all technical installations required to accomplish this, the provision of aviation information, controller training and provision of aviation maps.

'''Naka Vihara''' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]ː නඛා වෙහෙර) is a [[Stupa|dagoba]] belonging to the late Anuradhapura period between 7-10 centuries C.E.&lt;ref name="amazinglanka.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amazinglanka.com/wp/nakha-vehera-anuradhapura/ | title=Nakha Vehera of Ancient Anuradhapura | publisher=Amazinglanka | accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The dagoba has been built with bricks and square in shape. The site was constructed according to an unusual model and would have been similar to the seven story building (Satmahal Prasadaya) in [[Polonnaruwa]], [[Sri Lanka]]. Excavations done at this location revealed several clay caskets.

'''Ohaw''' or '''rur''' is a savory soup of the [[Ainu people]] of northern [[Japan]], flavored with [[fish]] or animal bones. [[Kelp]] is also used to add flavor to the [[stock (food)|stock]]. Unlike the majority of the traditional Japanese soups, the Ainu do not use [[miso]] or [[soy sauce]] in their soups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 2, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html |archivedate=August 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The solid ingredients such as [[meat]], [[fish]], [[vegetable]]s and/or wild edible plants are added to the stock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">{{European patent law}}
'''European Union patent law''' is a subset of [[European patent law]]. It also serves as the [[superset]] of the patent laws of the individual [[member states of the European Union]] (EU). The most recent (proposed) addition to the range of measures currently in place is the [[Directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights]]. The most recent directive relating specifically to patents is [[Directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions]]. Patents are probably the least harmonised area of [[intellectual property]] laws of the European Union insofar as harmonisation through EU Directives and Regulations is concerned. However, patentability criteria have been substantially harmonized by the [[European Patent Convention]].

"The most noticeable characteristic of the present state of the patent law in the EU is its dualism, i.e. the coexistence of two different ways for obtaining patents with the same effects, namely limited to the territory of the Member State for which they are granted. (...) a [[Community patent]], i.e. a patent which would cover the entire territory of the EU, have the same effects throughout the EU, which could be revoked centrally, etc., is not available because a great number of EU Member States have not ratified the [[1989 Agreement Relating to Community Patents]]."&lt;ref&gt;Straus, J. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The continuing decentralized administration of European patents in as many as 17 States, in spite of the [[European Community|Single Market]] and the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] Treaties, is an anachronism for which applicants have to pay dearly. Enforcement is another area where European patent holders must still live with disadvantages unknown to their [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]]ese competitors in their own countries.” &lt;ref&gt;Braendli (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scibe Airlift''' was an [[airline]] from [[Zaire]] (today known as [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), with its base at [[N'Djili Airport]], [[Kinshasa]].&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | pages= 58–59 | date= 2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The airline started activities in November 1976 as '''SBZ Cargo''' with a single [[Vickers Viscount]]. Due to problems concerning the national airline, [[Air Zaire]], Scibe Airlift became the first passenger airline in the country. After covering the whole country, it bought a [[Boeing 707]], which allowed for serving Europe.  In the early 1990s Scibe Airlift was at its height, serving a multitude of destinations and leasing its aircraft out to European airlines. In 1992, it operated a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10-30]] on its Kinshasa-[[Brussels]] route.

The political instability of the country and the poor financial management of the company brought it to an end. Scibe Airlift ceased its operations on 29 September 1998 when its last aircraft was stored at [[London Southend Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Boeing 707-329C (20200/828) [http://www.skystef.be/B707/OO-SJO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents and incidents ==

'''Slatina Air Base''' ({{lang-sq|Aeroporti Sllatina}}; {{lang-sr|Аеродром Слатина|translit=Aerodrom Slatina}}), located at [[Pristina International Airport]], contained the second largest military [[underground hangar]] complex in former [[Yugoslavia]]. The largest one was at [[Željava Airport]] near [[Bihać]]. After [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia]], the airfield was used by NATO [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]].

Before the Yugoslav military withdrawal, Slatina was home of the [[83rd Fighter Aviation Regiment]] and its 123rd and the 124th squadron. These squadrons were equipped with [[MiG-21|MiG-21 Bis]] and [[MiG-21|MiG-21 UM]] aircraft. &lt;ref&gt;Dimitrijević, Bojan. ''Jugoslovensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo 1942-1992''. Beograd, 2006, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;


== Historical value of the Slatina air base ==
During the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO's operation against Yugoslavia]] 83rd fighter squadron of Yugoslavian Air Forces was based in Slatina. It did not perform any sorties and suffered no losses from NATO aircraft during the 1999 bombings. Every single aircraft remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;The Air Forces of Serbia. Aircraft and astronautics, № 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slatina air base was a strategically important base which NATO had planned to use for airlifting of much of their military units in support of the UNSF Resolution 1244. Control over the airport was to be established on 12 June 1999 though on that first night the air base was seized by a battalion of Russian paratroopers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://otvaga2004.narod.ru/publ_w2/brosok.htm Throw to Kosovo (Lang.

'''Stepanakert Memorial''' is a memorial located in [[Stepanakert]], the capital of the [[Republic of Artsakh]].

== History ==
[[File:Artsakh Movement 1988.jpg|thumb|A protest at the memorial on February 20, 1988.]]
The memorial complex, built in honor of the 22,000 inhabitants of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] who died during [[World War II]], is centered around a 21 meter high [[obelisk]] in the center. Those who died were entombed in the common grave formed on the opposite hill. Another part of the complex is a cascade pool with a fountain and seven ‘weeping’ springs constructed in the style of traditional [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh#Armenian historical monuments|Armenian monuments]] and classic ornamental art. On the granite pedestals are portraits of [[Armenians|Armenian]]- [[Soviet]] soldiers of the [[Red Army]] who were honored as [[Heroes of the Soviet Union]]. The newest part of the complex is a cemetery where the veterans [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] [[Artsakh War|War]] are buried. From 1945 to 1990, the memorial was managed by the government of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]]. From 1991 to the present, it has been owned by the government of the [[Republic of Artsakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Memorial.18/current_category.203/memorials_detail.html|title=Memorial Complex in Stepanakert, Artsakh|website=www.armenian-genocide.org|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/stepanakert-memorial-complex.html|title=Stepanakert Memorial Complex {{!}} Stepanakert {{!}}  Travel Story and Pictures from Armenia|last=Kester|first=Boris|website=www.traveladventures.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I want a channel that speaks well of the country, that can show Brazil as it really is".&lt;ref name="Brazil launches international TV station for Africa"/&gt; He also said: "We want a network that talks about politics in quality terms, leaving aside prejudices because this will be a public network showing how Brazilians are beyond our borders".&lt;ref name="Brazil launches international TV network"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100525-brazil-launches-international-tv-network|title=Brazil launches international TV network|date=25 May 2010|publisher=[[France 24]]|accessdate=25 May 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Federation of United Nations Associations''' ('''WFUNA''') (French: ''Fédération Mondiale des Associations pour les Nations Unies - '''FMANU''''') was founded in 1946 as a Federation of national associations. Its obectives are to promote the values of the [[UN Charter]], defend [[multilateralism]], work towards a better United Nations Organisation and raise awarness on the main pillars of work of the [[United Nations]] - peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights.

WFUNA is a [[non-governmental organization]] with Consultative Status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) and consultative or liaison links with many other UN organizations and agencies. As a Federation, its membership is made of 95 [[United Nations Associations]] (UNAs) in as many member states of the UN.  

WFUNA is the largest non-profit organization with the  mission of supporting the principles and purposes of the UN.  

__TOC__

== History ==
WFUNA was founded in [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] on 2 August 1946 by 22 national [[United Nations Association|United Nations Associations]] (UNAs). The Constitution they adopted proclaims that:

{{quote|"We the representatives of the United Nations Associations in our respective countries, 

Believing that since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed, and 

Believing that the peace must be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of all peoples, 

Have resolved to combine our efforts to form an association of the peoples to be known as the World Federation of United Nations Associations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfuna.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/images/wfuna40pa_2012constitution.pdf|title=Constitution of WFUNA (pdf format)|publisher=World Federation of United Nations Associations|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over the years, UNAs have been established in more UN member-States especially as new countries were formed and joined the UN. 

The [[UN General Assembly]] has adopted resolutions expressing appreciation for the Federations efforts to promote wider public support for the UN. In 1986 resolution 41/68 concerning questions relating to information dedicated an entire section to commending the efforts of WFUNA and UNAs around the world for their "mobilization of popular support for the programs and work of the United Nations".

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was an active participant in WFUNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfuna.org/history|title=History {{!}} World Federation of United Nations Associations {{!}} WFUNA|website=www.wfuna.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In practical terms, WFUNA played a crucial role by helping people in those countries where human rights were violated, such as Franco’s Spain, some of the former communist countries in [[Eastern Europe]] and in the [[Middle East]]. WFUNA brought together people of divided countries – such as East and West Germany and [[Cyprus]], and the opponents in conflicts, for example between Israel and [[Egypt]] in the late 1960s.

WFUNA helped promote "[[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Security and Co-operation in Europe]]" (CSCE) by holding in 1967 the first conference on this topic. Other NGOs followed WFUNA’s campaign which continued until 1975 when the Final Act was signed at [[Helsinki]] by 35 governments, including United States and Canada, establishing the CSCE process. Further campaigning led in 1994 to the CSCE process that consisted of a Biennial Review Conference being raised to a Permanent Organization (OSCE).

WFUNA, including its African UNA members, made significant contributions to the NGO campaign for the abolition of [[Apartheid]]. The 32nd General Assembly of the UN, in 1977, received a resolution from the 117th WFUNA Executive Committee meeting, which requested:

"The [[Security Council]] of the UN to give urgent consideration to the taking of immediate steps to ensure that no State, multinational or other body or person be allowed to provide [[South Africa]] or [[Rhodesia]] with any equipment, technology or production of [[nuclear weapons]] of any kind".

WFUNA facilitated high-level informal consultations on disarmament issues between key experts of the USA and [[USSR]] during the [[Cold War]]. It organized a number of NGO Seminars on [[disarmament]] in cooperation with the UN, [[UNESCO]] and other NGOs.

During its history, WFUNA has served as a forum for global dialogues on development. Several suggestions, like the establishment of an [[Economic Commission for Africa]], were first adopted at the WFUNA Plenary Assemblies and then endorsed by governments.

WFUNA has actively supported reform of the UN and its capacity to meet new tasks and challenges. WFUNA has continually received recognition from the highest ranks of the UN. The sentiments in this statement by UN [[Secretary-General]], [[Dag Hammerskjöld]], to WFUNA's 12th Plenary Assembly were shared by his successors: "I wish... to express my appreciation of your most essential service. At the same time, I wish to urge you to fresh endeavors. Over the years you have accomplished much and have acted with an ever increasing sense of your great responsibilities."

For many years WFUNA conducted a fund raising program based on the sale of first day covers of UN stamps and lithographs produced by artists and celebrities, such as [[Picasso]], Lou Zheng Jang, [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[Salvador Dalí]], Ruben Leyva, [[Al Hirschfeld]] and [[Andy Warhol]] to promote the ideals of the UN. This highly successful program ran for several decades during the 20th century.

== Membership ==
{{see also|List of United Nations Associations}}
There are currently 95 UN Associations connecting hundreds of thousands of people to the United Nations. UNAs at the national level mainly play a role in:

[[File:CountrieswithUNAssociations.svg|thumb|UN member-States with a United Nations Association]]

* Disseminating information and educational materials about the UN
* Lobbying the government, political parties and interest groups in support of the UN
* Conducting Model UN conferences
* Stimulating the media to provide frequent and accurate coverage of the UN and its programs

== Areas of Work ==
WFUNA is involved with the UN system since its inception and has been working with most Member States through its activities and through its member Associations. 
*Transparency at the UN: as part of WFUNA's mandate to strengthen and improve the UN, the organization implements initiatives that increase the transparency of established UN processes.

*Civil Society Working Towards the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]: as part of a belief that people's involvement in local, national, and global decision-making is essential to achieving the UN's goals, WFUNA ensures that civil society is involved in UN programs and events.

*[[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship]] Around the World: as global citizenship is at the heart of WFUNA's mission, the organization facilitates regular programs that foster critical-thinking and problem-solving, and empowers people to act in their communities.

*Human Rights: since the adoption in 1948 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], WFUNA considered human rights advocacy as a central part of its programs. A number of international seminars in different regions of the world have been organized by WFUNA on the teaching of human rights. The proposal for creating the position of a [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] was on WFUNA’s agenda for many years.
