      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3370">'''Arbora &amp; Ausonia''' was a company that dealt in the manufacturing and sale of absorbent products for the child and family hygiene, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence markets. It fully merged into [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 2013.

==History==
Arbora Holding (founded in 1968) and Ausonia (created in 1977) merged in 1998 to form Arbora &amp; Ausonia, a leading company in the Iberian [[personal care]] and [[hygiene]] sector market. In 1989 Arbora &amp; Ausiona became a joint venture between Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer products multinational, and Agrolimen group, a Spanish holding company with international presence at the forefront of the food sector.&lt;ref&gt;EFE - [http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/07/19/actualidad/1342726412_346544.html P&amp;G compra el 50% de Arbora &amp; Ausonia a Agrolimen por 814 millones de euros]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Arbora &amp; Ausonia traded in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], with offices in [[Barcelona]] (headquarters of the central offices) and in [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] ([[Lisbon]]). There were nearly 1,300 employees distributed throughout its offices and plants. The Arbora &amp; Ausonia plant in [[Jijona]], the industrial site with the highest number of employees in all the [[province of Alicante]], employed 500 people. The plant had also grown considerably from 2,600 square metres in the 80's, to an area of 59,500 square metres. Arbora &amp; Ausonia, had a further two plants in [[Mequinenza]] ([[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]]) and Montornès del Vallès ([[Barcelona (province)|Barcelona]]).

On 2012 it was announced that Agrolimen would be seeling its 50% to Procter &amp; Gamble for $1 Billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters - [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-agrolimen-idUSBRE86J0PS20120720 Procter buying rest of Agrolimen joint venture for $1 billion]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2013 Procter &amp; Gamble announced the absortion of the Arbora &amp; Ausonia company into Procter &amp; Gamble, closing their Barcelona headquarters but maintaining most of the remaining infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;Expansión - [http://www.expansion.com/2013/01/16/catalunya/1358352764.html P&amp;G anuncia el cierre de la sede de Arbora &amp; Ausonia en Barcelona y su traslado a Madrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands and products==
* Dodot, Kandoo and Charmin [[nappies]] and wipes
* Evax and Ausonia sanitary towels and panty liners
* Tampax [[tampon]]s
* Ausonia Evolution, Lindor and Salvacamas products for [[urinary incontinence]]

==Corporate social responsibility==
Through its brands Arbora &amp; Ausonia offered society useful information on health at different stages of people's lives, and worked with specialists and professionals in different fields on projects such as "La adolescencia y tú" (Adolescence and you), run on a joint basis with the Child and Adolescent Gynaecology Group, an initiative of the Spanish Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (SEGO), a society with which the Women's Intimate Health Observatory has been developed.

'''Articles of incorporation''', also referred to as the '''certificate of incorporation''' or the '''corporate charter''', are a document or charter that establishes the existence of a corporation in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  They generally are filed with the Secretary of State or other [[list of company registers|company registrar]].

An equivalent term for [[limited liability companies]] (LLCs) in the United States is [[articles of organization]]. For terms with similar meaning in other countries, see [[articles of association]].

== United States ==
The articles of incorporation outline the governance of a corporation along with the [[bylaw|corporate bylaws]] and the corporate statutes in the state where articles of incorporation are filed.

The articles of incorporation typically include the name of the corporation, the type of corporate structure (e.g. profit corporation, nonprofit corporation, benefit corporation, professional corporation), the [[registered agent]], the number of authorized shares, the effective date, the duration (perpetual by default), and the names and signatures of the incorporators.

The state fee to file articles of incorporation to incorporate a profit corporation range from $50 - $300, and to incorporate a nonprofit corporation range from $0 -$125.&lt;ref&gt;Entity formation fees [https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/entity-formation-fees].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino''''' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10] is a case relevant for European contract law concerning the scope of [[consumer protection]] in the [[Unfair Terms Directive]] under [[EU law]].

==Facts==
Calderon Camino borrowed €30,000 from Banesto to buy a car at 7.95% interest, and APR 8.89%, and 29% on late payments. Banesto claimed €29,381.95 for unpaid monthly repayments, interest and costs.

First instance held the 29% rate to be automatically unfair, given it was 20% above the nominal, fixing the rate instead at 19%. Banesto complained that the consumer had not asked for this, and said national law prevented a court assessing a term for unfairness on its own motion. The Barcelona Provincial Court referred the question to the ECJ.

==Judgment==
The [[European Court of Justice]]'s First Chamber held that the court had the right and the duty to assess the fairness of a clause. However, it could not substitute an interest rate: it had to find the interest rate void, while leaving the rest of the contract intact.

{{Cquote|''The first question''

38. By its first question, the referring court is essentially asking whether Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not allow the court before which an application for an order for payment has been brought to assess of its own motion, in limine litis or at any other stage during the proceedings, whether a term relating to interest on late payments contained in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in the case where that consumer has not lodged an objection.

39. For the purpose of replying to that question, it is appropriate to note, first, that the system of protection introduced by Directive 93/13 is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of those terms (Joined Cases C-240/98 to C-244/98 ''Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores'' [2000] ECR I-4941, paragraph 25; Case C-168/05 ''Mostaza Claro'' [2006] ECR I-10421, paragraph 25; and Case C-40/08 ''Asturcom Telecomunicaciones'' [2009] ECR I-9579, paragraph 29).

40. As regards that weaker position, Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13 provides that unfair terms are not binding on the consumer. As is apparent from the case-law, that is a mandatory provision which aims to replace the formal balance which the contract establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them (see ''Mostaza Claro'', paragraph 36; ''Asturcom Telecomunicaciones'', paragraph 30; Case C-137/08 ''VB Pénzügyi Lízing'' [2010] ECR I-10847, paragraph 47; and C-453/10 ''Pereničová and Perenič'' [2012] ECR, paragraph 28).

41. In order to guarantee the protection intended by Directive 93/13, the Court has already stated on several occasions that the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier may be corrected only by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract (see ''Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores'', paragraph 27; Mostaza Claro, paragraph 26; ''Asturcom Telecomunicaciones'', paragraph 31; and ''VB Pénzügyi Lízing'', paragraph 48).

42. It is in the light of those principles that the Court has therefore held that the national court is required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term falling within the scope of Directive 93/13 is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier (see, to that effect, ''Mostaza Claro'', paragraph 38; Case C-243/08 ''Pannon GSM'' [2009] ECR I-4713, paragraph 31; ''Asturcom Telecomunicaciones'', paragraph 32; and ''VB Pénzügyi Lízing'', paragraph 49).

[...]

69. In that context, it is clear, as the Advocate General observed in points 86 to 88 of her Opinion, that, if it were open to the national court to revise the content of unfair terms included in such contracts, such a power would be liable to compromise attainment of the long-term objective of Article 7 of Directive 93/13. That power would contribute to eliminating the dissuasive effect on sellers or suppliers of the straightforward non-application with regard to the consumer of those unfair terms (see, to that effect, the order in Pohotovost’, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited), in so far as those sellers or suppliers would remain tempted to use those terms in the knowledge that, even if they were declared invalid, the contract could nevertheless be modified, to the extent necessary, by the national court in such a way as to safeguard the interest of those sellers or suppliers.}}

The ''' Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean''',&lt;ref name="EURef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barcelona Convention - Marine - Environment - European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/international-cooperation/regional-sea-conventions/barcelona-convention/index_en.htm|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally the '''Convention for Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unepmap.org/index.php?module=content2&amp;catid=001001004 "Barcelona Convention"] at the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], Mediterranean Action Plan for the Barcelona Convention website. [accessed 2015-07-25].&lt;/ref&gt; and often simply referred to as the '''Barcelona Convention''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l28084 "Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean"] at EUR-Lex: Access to European Law. [accessed 2015-07-25].&lt;/ref&gt; is a regional convention adopted in 1976 to prevent and abate pollution from ships, aircraft and land based sources in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This includes but is not limited to dumping, run-off and discharges. Signers agreed to cooperate and assist in dealing with pollution emergencies, monitoring and scientific research. The convention was adopted on 16 February 1976 and amended on 10 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l28084 "Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean"] at EUR-Lex: Access to European Law. [accessed 2015-07-25].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barcelona Convention and its protocols form the legal framework of the Mediterranean Action Plan (approved in 1975), developed under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] ([[UNEP]]) Regional Seas Programme.

== Goals ==
The key goal of the convention is to 'reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l28084 "Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean"] at EUR-Lex: Access to European Law. [accessed 2015-07-25].&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this a number of aims and commitments have been established.

=== Aims ===
*To prevent, reduce, combat and, as far as possible, eliminate pollution in the Zone of the Mediterranean Sea.
*To attain the objective of sustainable development, taking fully into account the recommendations of MCSD.
*To protect the environment and to contribute to sustainable development:
**By applying the precautionary principle and that the polluter should pay
**By performing Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)
**By promoting cooperation between coastal States in EIA procedures.
**To promote the integrated management of coastal zones, taking into account the protection of zones of ecological and landscape interest and the rational use of natural resources. To apply the Convention and its Protocols:
**By adopting programmes and measures with defined deadlines for completion.
**By using the best techniques available and the best environmental practices.
*To formulate and adopt Protocols that prescribe agreed measures, procedures and regulations to apply the Convention.
*To promote, within the relevant international bodies, measures relating to the application of sustainable development programmes and environmental protection, conservation and rehabilitation and the natural resources of the Mediterranean Sea.

=== Commitments ===
Members agreed to take specific measures:

*against pollution due to dumping from ships and air planes and against incineration at sea,
*against pollution due to discharges from ships,
*against pollution caused by prospection for, and exploitation of, the continental shelf, the seabed and its subsoil,
*against land-based pollution,
*to cooperate in pollution incidents giving rise to situations of emergency,
*to protect biological diversity,
*against pollution due to transboundary movements of dangerous wastes and to eliminate them,
*to monitor pollution,
*to cooperate in science and technology
*to apply environmental legislation, and
*to facilitate public access to information and public participation.

== Status ==
Originally, fourteen states and the [[European  Communities]] signed the Convention adopted in 1976. It came into effect on 12 February 1978. The amendments adopted in 1995 have yet to be ratified by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Parties are all countries with a Mediterranean shoreline as well as the European Union. NGOs with a stated interest and third-party governments are allowed observer status.

The convention is applicable to the 'Zone of the Mediterranean Sea'. This is defined as 'the maritime waters of the Mediterranean as such, with all its gulfs and tributary seas, bounded to the west by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and to the east by the [[Dardanelles|Dardanelle Strait]]'. Parties are allowed to extend the application of the convention to the coastal areas within their own territory.

In [[geology]], a '''boulder''' is a [[rock (geology)|rock]] fragment with size greater than {{Convert|25.6|cm|in|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Glossary2005"&gt;{{cite book | title=Glossary of Geology (5th edition) | publisher=American Geological Institute | last=Neuendorf | first=K.K.E. | last2=Mehl, Jr. | first2=J.P. | last3=Jackson | first3=J.A. (editors) | year=2005 | location=Alexandria, Virginia | page=79 | isbn=978-0922152896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller pieces are called [[cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and [[pebble]]s. While a boulder may be small enough to move or roll manually, others are extremely massive.&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boulder|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common usage, a boulder is too large for a person to move. Smaller boulders are usually just called [[rocks]] or stones. The word ''boulder'' is short for ''boulder stone'', from [[Middle English]] ''bulderston'' or [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bullersten''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boulder boulder. (n.d.)] Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved December 9, 2011, from Dictionary.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places covered by [[ice sheet]]s during [[Ice Age]]s, such as [[Scandinavia]], northern [[North America]], and [[Siberia]],  [[glacial erratic]]s are common.  Erratics are boulders picked up by ice sheets during their advance, and deposited when they melt.&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;   They are called "erratic" because they typically are of a different rock type than the [[bedrock]] on which they are deposited.  One of them is used as the [[pedestal]] of [[the Bronze Horseman]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.

Some noted [[rock formation]]s involve giant boulders exposed by [[erosion]], such as the [[Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve|Devil's Marbles]] in [[Australia]]'s [[Northern Territory]], the [[Horeke basalts]] in [[New Zealand]], where an entire [[valley]] contains only boulders, and [[The Baths]] on the island of [[Virgin Gorda]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]].

Boulder-sized [[Clastic rock|clast]]s are found in some [[sedimentary rock]]s, such as coarse [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and [[boulder clay]].

The climbing of large boulders is called [[bouldering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7662">[[Image:CMTS frontside.jpg|right|thumb|Cable modem termination system]]
A '''cable modem termination system''' or '''CMTS''' is a piece of equipment, typically located in a [[cable television|cable]] company's [[Cable television headend|headend]] or hubsite, which is used to provide high speed data services, such as [[Cable modem|cable Internet]] or [[Voice over IP|Voice over Internet Protocol]], to cable [[subscriber]]s.  A CMTS provides many of the same functions provided by the [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAM]] in a [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] system.

==Connections==
In order to provide high speed data services, a cable company will connect its headend to the Internet via very high capacity data links to a [[network service provider]]. On the subscriber side of the headend, the CMTS enables the communication with subscribers' [[cable modem]]s. Different CMTSs are capable of serving different cable modem population sizes—ranging from 4,000 cable modems to 150,000 or more, depending in part on traffic. A given headend may have between 1-12 CMTSs to service the cable modem population served by that headend or [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|HFC hub]].

One way to think of a CMTS is to imagine a [[Router (computing)|router]] with [[Ethernet]] [[Network interface controller|interfaces]] (connections) on one side and [[coaxial cable]] [[Radio frequency|RF]] interfaces on the other side. The RF/coax interfaces carry RF signals to and from the subscriber's cable modem.

In fact, most CMTSs have both Ethernet interfaces (or other more traditional high-speed data interfaces like [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET]]) as well as RF interfaces.  In this way, traffic that is coming from the [[Internet]] can be routed (or bridged) through the Ethernet interface, through the CMTS and then onto the RF interfaces that are connected to the cable company's '''hybrid fiber coax''' ([[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|HFC]]). The traffic winds its way through the HFC to end up at the cable modem in the subscriber's home. Traffic from a subscriber's home system goes through the cable modem and out to the Internet in the opposite direction.

CMTSs typically carry only [[Internet Protocol|IP]] traffic. Traffic destined for the cable modem from the Internet, known as downstream traffic, is carried in IP packets encapsulated according to [[DOCSIS]] standard. These packets are carried on data streams that are typically modulated onto a TV channel using either 64-QAM or 256-QAM versions of [[quadrature amplitude modulation]].

Upstream data (data from cable modems to the headend or Internet) is carried in Ethernet frames encapsulated inside DOCSIS frames modulated with [[QPSK]], 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM or 128-QAM using [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]], [[ATDMA]] or S-[[CDMA]] frequency sharing mechanisms. This is done at the "subband" or "return" portion of the [[North American cable television frequencies|cable TV spectrum]] (also known as the "T" channels), a much lower part of the frequency spectrum than the downstream signal, usually 5 - 42&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[DOCSIS|DOCSIS 2.0]] or 5 - 60&amp;nbsp;MHz in EuroDOCSIS.

A typical CMTS allows a subscriber's computer to obtain an [[IP address]] by forwarding [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] requests to the relevant servers. This DHCP server returns, for the most part, what looks like a typical response including an assigned IP address for the computer, gateway/router addresses to use, DNS servers, etc.

The CMTS may also implement some basic filtering to protect against unauthorized users and various attacks. [[Traffic shaping]] is sometimes performed to prioritize application traffic, perhaps based upon subscribed plan or download usage and also to provide guaranteed [[Quality of service]] (QoS) for the cable operator's own [[PacketCable]]-based [[VOIP]] service. However, the function of traffic shaping is more likely done by a Cable Modem or policy traffic switch. A CMTS may also act as a [[Network bridge|bridge]] or [[Router (computing)|router]].

A customer's [[cable modem]] cannot communicate directly with other modems on the line. In general, cable modem traffic is routed to other cable modems or to the Internet through a series of CMTSs and traditional routers. However, a route could conceivably pass through a single CMTS.

==Architectures==
A CMTS can be broken down into two different architectures, Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS) or Modular (M-CMTS).  There are both pros and cons to each type of architecture.

===Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS)===
The I-CMTS architecture consists of all components housed in a single chassis.  The RF interface and IP Networking components are all integrated in a single device.  This makes for much simpler RF combining in the [[Cable television headend|headend]].  The benefits of an all-in-one solution are less single points of failure, lower costs and ease of deployment.&lt;ref name="cmtsarchitecture"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMTS Architectures|url=http://volpefirm.com/docsis3_architecture/|website=volpefirm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular CMTS (M-CMTS)===
In an M-CMTS solution the architecture is broken up into two components.  The first part is the Physical Downstream component (PHY) which is known as the Edge QAM (EQAM).  The second part is the IP networking and [[DOCSIS]] MAC Component which is referred to as the M-CMTS Core.  There are also several new protocols and components introduced with this type of architecture.  One is the DOCSIS Timing Interface, which provides a reference frequency between the EQAM and M-CMTS Core via a DTI Server.  The second is the Downstream External PHY Interface (DEPI).  The DEPI protocol controls the delivery of DOCSIS
frames from the M-CMTS Core to the EQAM devices &lt;ref name="cablelabmcmts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications Modular Headend Architecture|url=http://www.cablelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/specdocs/CM-SP-M-OSSI-I08-081209.pdf|website=www.cablelabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the challenges that entail an M-CMTS platform are increased complexity in RF combining and an increase in the number of failure points.  One of the benefits of an M-CMTS architecture is that it is extremely scalable to larger numbers of downstream channels.&lt;ref name="cmtsarchitecture"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4570">'''Cancell''', also called '''Protocel''', '''Sheridan's Formula''', '''Jim's Juice''', '''Crocinic Acid''', '''JS–114''', '''JS–101''', '''126–F''', and '''Entelev''', is a formula that has been promoted as a treatment for a wide range of diseases, including [[cancer]]. Cancell is available in tablet and liquid form.  Originally called Entelev, the formula was developed by [[biochemist]] '''James V. Sheridan'''. Sheridan sought to target the primarily [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] cell metabolism of cancer cells (following the theories of [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]]), claiming to lower cell potential leading to the destruction of cancer cells. The Cancell formula was tested by the [[National Cancer Institute]] and found to be ineffective against cancer,&lt;ref name="nci"/&gt; though Cancell continues to be marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] in the US.

== Formulation and efficacy ==
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has listed the components as [[inositol]], [[nitric acid]], [[sodium sulfite]], [[potassium hydroxide]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[catechol]].  Precise formulation varies by manufacturer, and may include [[crocinic acid]] and various minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name="mskcc"&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69160.cfm | title = Cancell | accessdate = 2011-02-26 | publisher = [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) tested the constituents of Cancell in animal experiments in 1978 and 1980 and ''in vitro'' on human tumors in 1990 and 1991. They concluded that the compounds comprising Cancell could not be taken in doses high enough to kill cancer cells in the body, and that further study was not warranted. No peer-reviewed clinical or animal trials of Cancell have demonstrated any positive effect; claims for Cancell's efficacy are limited to [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal reports]] and [[testimonial]]s.&lt;ref name="nci"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = [[National Cancer Institute]] | title = Questions and Answers About Cancell | work = | publisher = National Cancer Institute | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cancell/patient/page2 | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] and [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] recommend against the use of CanCell, as there is no evidence that it is effective in treating any disease, and its proposed method of action is not consistent with modern science.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Questionable methods of cancer management: Cancell/Entelev |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=57–62 |year=1993 |pmid=8422607 |doi= 10.3322/canjclin.43.1.57|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.43.1.57/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mskcc" /&gt;

== Legal status ==
Injunction proceedings were instigated by the FDA in June 1987 for manufacturing compliance violations and failure to maintain complaints files.  A complaint for permanent injunction was filed February 21, 1989 in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] to enjoin Sheridan and Edward J. Sopcak from distributing CanCell.  At a hearing in November 1992, the Court found Sopcak to be in civil contempt and ordered him to comply with the injunction immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Segal | first = Marian | title = Court says to cancel the CanCell | journal = FDA Consumer | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | issn = 0362-1332 | publisher = Federal Drug Administration | location = May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancell is currently distributed as a dietary supplement under the names ''Protocel'' and ''Entelev'', and is not approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment or for any other purpose. Since it is marketed as a dietary supplement with no health claims attached, its regulation falls under the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]] (DSHEA).

{{Property law}}

A '''concurrent estate''' or co-tenancy is a concept in [[property law]] which describes the various ways in which property is owned by more than one person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are commonly referred to as co-owners. Legal terminology for co-owners of real estate is either co-tenants or joint tenants, with the latter phrase signifying a right of survivorship. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety, which is a joint tenancy between married persons. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, but they are the same, as every joint tenancy includes a right of survivorship. In contrast, a tenancy in common does not include a right of survivorship.

The type of co-ownership does not affect the right of co-owners to sell their fractional interest in the property to others during their lifetimes, but it does affect their power to [[will (law)|will]] the property upon death to their [[devisee]]s in the case of joint tenants. However, any joint tenant can change this by severing the joint tenancy. This occurs whenever a joint tenant transfers his or her fractional interest in the property.

Law can vary from place to place, and the following general discussion will not be applicable in its entirety to all jurisdictions.

==Rights and duties of co-owners (general)==
Under the common law, Co-owners share a number of rights by default:

# Each owner has an unrestricted right of ''access'' to the property. When one co-owner wrongfully excludes another from using the shared property, the excluded co-owner can bring a cause of action for ''ouster''. As a remedy, the court may grant the wronged co-owner the fair rental value of the property for the time that they were ousted.
# Each owner has a right to an [[Account of profits|''accounting'' of profits]] made from the property. If the property generates any income (e.g. rent, farming, etc. . . .) each owner is entitled to a [[pro-rata]] share of that income.
# Each owner has a right of ''contribution'' for the costs of owning the property. Co-owners can be forced to contribute to the payment of expenses such as property taxes, necessary maintenance and repairs or [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] for the entire property.

===Contribution and improvements===
Co-owners generally do not have any obligation to contribute to any costs of ''improving'' the property. If one co-owner adds a feature that enhances the value of the property, that co-owner has no right to demand that any others share the cost of adding that feature{{snd}} even if other co-owners reap greater profits from the property because of it. However, at partition, a co-owner is entitled to recover the value added by his or her improvements of the property if the "improvements" resulted in an increase in property value. Conversely, if the co-owner's "improvements" decrease the value of the property, the co-owner is responsible for the decrease. In an [[Australia]]n case,&lt;ref&gt;''Brickwood v Young'', (1905) 2 CLR 387; 11 ALR 154.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] said that the costs of repairing by one co-owner must be taken into account on the partition or final distribution (i.e. sale) of the property.

===Mortgages===
Furthermore, each co-owner can independently encumber the co-owner's own share in the property by taking out a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] on that share (although this may effectively convert a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, as described below); other co-owners have no obligation to help pay a mortgage that only runs to another owner's share of the property, and the mortgagee can only [[foreclosure|foreclose]] on that mortgagor's share.  Bank loans secured by mortgages on individual shares of co-owned property are one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the mortgage lending industry.

Finally, co-owners owe one another a duty of fair dealing. Because of this, any co-owner who acquires a mortgage claim against the property must give his co-owners a reasonable opportunity to purchase proportionate shares in that claim.

==Tenancy in common==
Tenancy in common is a form of concurrent estate in which each owner, referred to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as owning separate and distinct shares of the same property. By default, all co-owners own equal shares, but their interests may differ in size.

TIC owners own percentages in an undivided property rather than particular units or apartments, and their deeds show only their ownership percentages. The right of a particular TIC owner to use a particular dwelling comes from a written contract signed by all co-owners (often called a "Tenancy In Common Agreement"), not from a deed, map or other document recorded in county records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andysirkin.com/HTMLArticle.cfm?Article=1|title=Clear Answers and Explanations on Tenancy In Common (TIC)|author=|date=|website=andysirkin.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ownership is most common where the co-owners are not married or have contributed different amounts to the purchase of the property. The assets of a joint commercial partnership might be held as a tenancy in common.

Tenants in common have no right of survivorship, meaning that if one tenant in common dies, that tenant's interest in the property will be part of his or her estate and pass by [[inheritance]] to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by [[will (law)|will]], or by [[intestate succession]]. Also, as each tenant in common has an interest in the property, they may, in the absence of any restriction agreed to between all the tenants in common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.

===Destruction of tenancy in common===
Where any party to a tenancy in common wishes to terminate (usually termed "destroy") the joint interest, he or she may obtain a ''[[partition of the property]]''. This is a division of the land into distinctly owned lots, if such division is legally permitted under zoning and other local land use restrictions. Where such division is not permitted, a forced sale of the property is the only alternative, followed by a division of the proceeds. (This paragraph is not the case in the law of England and Wales)

If the parties are unable to agree to a partition, any or all of them may seek the ruling of a court to determine how the land should be divided{{snd}} physically division between the joint owners (partition in kind), leaving each with ownership of a portion of the property representing their share. Courts may also order a partition by sale in which the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed to the owners.  Where local law does not permit physical division, the court must order a partition by sale.

Each co-owner is entitled to partition as a matter of right, meaning that the court will order a partition at the request of any of the co-owners. The only exception to this general rule is where the co-owners have agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to waive the right of partition. The right may be waived either permanently, for a specific period of time, or under certain conditions.  The court, however, will likely not enforce this waiver because it is a restraint on the alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.lawyerment.com/topic/tenancy_in_common/# Destruction of tenancy in common] Lawyerment Legal Dictionary. Retrieved on 29 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint tenancy==
A joint tenancy or joint tenancy with right of survivorship (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) is a type of concurrent estate in which co-owners have a ''right of survivorship'', meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners [[by operation of law]], and avoiding [[probate]]. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs.  Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their [[estate (law)|estate]]. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abkj.com.au/abkj-newsletter-march-2014.html#01 Joint Tenants vs Tenants in Common] ABKJ Lawyers. Retrieved on 2014-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that [[creditors]]' claims against the deceased owner's [[estate (law)|estate]] may, under certain circumstances, be satisfied by the portion of ownership previously owned by the deceased, but now owned by the survivor or survivors.  In other words, the deceased's liabilities can sometimes remain attached to the property.

This form of ownership is common between spouses, parent and child, and in any other situation where parties want ownership to pass immediately and automatically to the survivor.  For bank and brokerage accounts held in this fashion, the acronym JTWROS is commonly appended to the account name as evidence of the owners' intent.

To create a joint tenancy, clear language indicating that intent must be used{{snd}} e.g. "to AB and CD as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common". This long form of wording may be especially appropriate in those jurisdictions which use the phrase "joint tenancy" as synonymous with a tenancy in common. Shorter forms such as "to AB and CD as joint tenants" or "to AB and CD jointly" can be used in most jurisdictions. Words to that effect may be used by the parties in the [[deed]] of conveyance or other instrument of transfer of title, or by a [[testator]] in a [[Will (law)|will]], or in an [[inter vivos]] [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]].

If a testator leaves property in a will to several beneficiaries "jointly" and one or more of those named beneficiaries dies before the will takes effect, then the survivors of those named beneficiaries will inherit the whole property on a joint tenancy basis. But if these named beneficiaries had been bequeathed the property on a tenancy in common basis, but died before the will took effect, then those beneficiaries' heirs would in turn inherit their share immediately (the named beneficiary being deceased).

===Four unities of a joint tenancy===
{{Main article|Four unities}}
To create a joint tenancy, the co-owners must share "''four unities''":

* Time – the co-owners must acquire the property at the same time. So, for example, if a piece of land was vested to ABCD as co-owners on 1 January 2018 and ‘A’ died before the date leaving ‘K’ to succeed him for, as between K on the one hand and BCD on the other hand, there is no unity of time. K becomes a tenant in common, while BCD are joint tenants.
* Title – the co-owners must have the same title to the property. If a condition applies to one owner and not another, there is no unity of title. Also, there must me unity in the sense that title must emenate from the same grantor. Thus, in the hypothetical example above, there is no unity of title between ‘K’ on the one hand and ‘BCD’ on the other hand because K derived his title from another dinor, that is; A.
* Interest – each co-owner owns an equal share of the property; for example, if three co-owners are on the deed, then each co-owner owns a one-third interest in the property regardless of the amount each co-owner contributed to the purchase price
* Possession – the co-owners must have an equal right to possess the whole property.

If any of these elements is missing, the joint tenancy is ineffective, and the joint tenancy will be treated as a tenancy in common in equal shares.

===Breaking a joint tenancy===
If any joint co-owner deals in any way with a property inconsistent with a joint tenancy, that co-owner will be treated as having terminated (sometimes called "breaking") the joint tenancy. The remaining co-owners maintain joint ownership of the remaining interest. The dealing may be a conveyance or sale of the co-owner's share in the property. The position in relation to a mortgage is more doubtful (see below). For example, if one of three joint co-owners conveys his or her share in the property to a third party, the third party owns a 1/3 share on a tenancy in common basis, while the other two original joint co-owners continue to hold the remaining 2/3s on a joint tenancy basis. This result arises because the "unity of time" is broken: that is, because on the transfer the timing of the new interest is different from the original one. If it is desired to continue to maintain a joint tenancy, then the three original joint co-owners would need to transfer, in the one instrument, the joint interest to the two remaining joint co-owners and the new joint co-owner.

A joint co-owner may break a joint tenancy and maintain an interest in the property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to break a joint tenancy by the execution of a document to that effect. In those jurisdictions which retain the old common law requirements, an actual exchange with a ''[[straw man (law)|straw man]]'' is required. This requires another person to "buy" the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the joint tenancy will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.

A significant issue can arise with the simple document execution method.  In the ''straw man'' approach, there are witnesses to the transfer.  With the document, there may not be witnesses.  With either method, as soon as the break occurs, it works both ways.  Because there may not be witnesses, the party with the document could take advantage of that fact and hide the document when the other party dies.

===Mortgages to break joint tenancy===
If one joint co-owner takes out a mortgage on jointly owned property, in some jurisdictions this may terminate the joint tenancy. Jurisdictions which use a ''[[title theory]]'' in this situation treat a mortgage as an actual conveyance of title until the mortgage is repaid, if not permanently. In such jurisdictions, the taking of a mortgage by one owner terminates the joint tenancy as to that co-owner.  There are exceptions, and the law in the State of Georgia is a notable exception.

In Georgia, joint tenancy is commonly conveyed in a deed as "Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship".  The legal effect of this type of tenancy is a "life estate" with a "contingent remainder".  Translated, this means that the interest of each joint tenant can be thought of in two parts:  the "present" interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the "future" when one of the tenants dies.  Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only "temporary" interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a "full" interest.  The "full" interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death.  In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy.  Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds.  In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or "temporary") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant.  Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage does not mean that the mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. "Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate." J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023, § 3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (“[U]nder the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt [on devised real property] from the personal property of the testatrix, if any she had....”). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a predecessor in title). Id. In Manders, the Court held “a surviving joint tenant does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid.” In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.

In sum, under Georgia law, execution of a mortgage (called a "Deed to Secure Debt" or "Security Deed") by one co-tenant does not sever the joint tenancy.

However, in jurisdictions which use the ''[[lien theory]]'', the mortgage merely places a lien on the property, leaving the joint tenancy undisturbed. As a lien is not enough to terminate a joint tenancy, if the debtor dies before the creditor sues, the creditor is left with no claim against the property, as the debtor's interest in the property evaporates and automatically vests in the other surviving co-owners.

===Petition to partition to sever a joint tenancy===
A co-owner of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deed may sever the joint tenancy by filing a petition to partition. A petition to partition is a legal right, so usually there is no way to stop such an action. When a court grants a partition action for a joint tenants with rights of survivorship deed, the property is either physically broken into parts and each owner is given a part of equal value OR the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed equally between the co-owners regardless of contribution to purchase price. No credits would be issued to any tenant who may have made a superior contribution toward purchase price.

Some states allow a co-owner the option of buying out the other co-owners to avoid a public sale of the property. Some states also allow multiple co-owners to join their shares together to claim a majority ownership to avoid public sale of the property and to have the property awarded to the majority owners. If the property is sold publicly, the usual method is a public auction.

During a partition process, credits may be granted to co-tenants who have paid property expenses in excess of their share, such as utilities and property maintenance. Credit may be given for improvements done to the property if the improvements have increased the value of the property. No credit would be given for excess contribution to purchase price, as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deeds are taken in equal shares as a matter of law.

Pennsylvania partition case example:
In D’Arcy v. Buckley, 71 Bucks Co. L. Rep. 167 (August 21, 1998), two persons purchased property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The Plaintiff contributed five times more than the Defendant toward the purchase price. In a partition action, the Plaintiff sought credit for the full amount of his superior contributions. The Court held that, in the absence of fraud, the working of the deed operated to convey a one-half interest to each of the two joint tenants. The decision relies the authorities of Masgai v. Masgai, 460 Pa. 453, 333 A.2d 861 (1975) and DeLoatch v. Murphy, 369 Pa. Super. 255, 535 A.2d 146 (1987). The Plaintiff argued, to no avail, that he did not intend to make a lifetime gift to defendant.

==Tenancy by the entirety==
A tenancy by the entirety (sometimes called a tenancy by the entireties) is a type of concurrent estate formerly available only to [[married]] couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a [[coverture|single legal person]]. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy by the entirety.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the tenancy by the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to "ripen" in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.

In some jurisdictions, to create a tenancy by the entirety the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple "as tenants by the entirety," while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed to create a tenancy by the entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Code of Puerto Rico of 1930, Article 1295, Sociedad de Gananciales|url=http://www.lexjuris.com/LEXLEX%5Clexcodigoc%5Clexsociedaddegananciales.htm|website=lexjuris.com|publisher=LexJuris|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also Sociedad de gananciales)&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Sociedad de gananciales]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship{{snd}} time, title, interest, and possession{{snd}} there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a tenancy by the entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with any part of the property requires the consent of both spouses.  A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize tenancies by the entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Clifford, ''Plan Your Estate'', Nolo, 9th ed. (April 2008), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;  Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for [[bankruptcy]] relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a tenancy by the entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.

In many states, tenancy by the entireties is recognized as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets.  One must be careful to ensure that the tenancy by the entireties designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost.  For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.

Tenancy By the Entirety in Massachusetts.

For a good discussion on this misunderstood estate see ''Coraccio v. Lowell Five Cents Savings Bank'', 415 Mass. 145, 612 N.E. 2d 650.

There is nothing in the laws of [[Massachusetts]], or [[New York (state)|New York]] as stated in ''Coraccio'', to prevent one tenant by the entirety from conveying her own or his own interest in the property, subject to the continuing rights of the other. While it is generally believed that one tenant by the entirety cannot convey their interest because the tenancy cannot be severed, rather it is the survivorship rights of the other that cannot be severed. Thus, if a husband conveyed his interest in the property held as tenants by the entirety to his brother, the husband no longer owns an interest in the property. The brother takes his (the husband's) place within the tenancy. Here is the tricky part: if the wife dies then the husband's brother acquires all interest in the real estate. If the husband dies before the wife then it all goes to her free and clear and the husband's brother has nothing. Some conveyancers have treated deeds by one tenant by the entirety as null. However, such a deed conveys the interest of the grantor in the property subject to the survivorship rights of the other co-tenant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11556">[[Image:Esquilache riots.jpg|thumb|375px|''The Esquilache Riots'', by [[Francisco de Goya]]]]

The '''Esquilache Riots''' (''Motín de Esquilache'') occurred in March 1766 during the rule of [[Charles III of Spain]].  Caused mostly by the growing discontent in [[Madrid]] about the rising costs of bread and other [[Staple food|staples]], they were sparked off by a series of measures regarding Spaniards' apparel that had been enacted by [[Leopoldo de Gregorio|Leopoldo de Gregorio, Marqués de Esquilache]], a [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] minister whom Charles favored.

==Background==

Esquilache's plan was to terminate the wearing of [[Spaniard cloak|long capes]] and broad-brimmed hats (''[[Slouch hat|chambergos]]'') by male ''madrileños'', replacing these traditional garments with French-style short capes and [[tricorn hat|three-cornered hats]]. This reform was intended to modernize the appearance of conservative Spanish society and improve public safety, since the long capes were supposedly thought to facilitate the concealment of weapons, while the large hats were thought to conceal a person's face, a safeguard for criminals.

The new policies did not immediately catch the attention of the populace, as more pressing issues fanned the flames of popular discontent, namely the rising prices in [[bread]], [[oil]], [[coal]], and cured meat, caused in part by Esquilache's liberalization of the grain trade. Moreover, these measures at first were only applied to the royal household and staff (January 21, 1766).

Under pain of arrest, these royal functionaries adopted the measures en masse.  Having applied these initial measures, Esquilache proceeded to impose them on the general population.  The writer and government official [[Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes]] and the body known as the ''[[Council of Castile]]'' warned him that the confiscation of hats and cloaks would cause resentment amongst the people.

Esquilache nevertheless went ahead with these measures, and on March 10, 1766 placards appeared in Madrid prohibiting the wearing of these garments.  Popular reaction was immediate: the placards were torn off the walls.  Soldiers were mobilized and local authorities were attacked by the populace. Rioters shouted "Long Live Spain! Death to Esquilache!"&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riots begin==
[[File:Monsó Esquilache.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Demonstrators being outfitted as&lt;br /&gt; "Hats-and-Capes"; painting by&lt;br /&gt; [[José Martí y Monsó]] (1864)]]
On [[Palm Sunday]], around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, two townsmen, dressed in the forbidden long capes and ''chambergos'', provocatively crossed the little square of [[Antón Martín]]. Several soldiers on guard duty stopped them to inquire about their garments. Insults were exchanged and the soldiers tried to detain them. One of the townsmen unsheathed a sword and whistled. A band of townspeople appeared and the soldiers fled. The rioters quickly took over Plaza de los Inválidos where muskets and sabers were stored. 2,000 rioters marched on the [[Calle Atocha]] to the [[Plaza Mayor (Madrid)|Plaza Mayor]], yelling insults against Esquilache. They ran into [[Luis Antonio Fernández de Córdoba y Spínola]], the 11th [[Duke of Medinaceli]], whom they surrounded, and they forced him to approach the king with a series of petitions.

The duke reported to the king, who remained calm, unaware of the seriousness of the situation. The rioters meanwhile had destroyed many of the 5,000 [[lamp post|lampposts]] that had been erected throughout the city by order of the king as another well-intended modernization policy. The rioters' petition had included the demand that the unpopular ''Guardia Valona'' ([[Walloon Guard]]) be disbanded. This regiment of the Royal Guard was recruited in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and formed part of the permanent garrison of Madrid. A servant attached to Esquilache's household was knifed when the rioters made their way to the minister's mansion, which they sacked. They also stoned the mansion of the [[Jerónimo Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and approached the mansion of the [[Francesco Sabatini|Sabatini]]. That night, a portrait of Esquilache was burned in the Plaza Mayor. The king still had done nothing.

On March 24, the situation worsened. The rioters, much strengthened in numbers and in confidence, marched towards where the king was residing, in the Arco de la Armería de Palacio, which was defended by Spanish troops alongside the Walloons.

The Walloon troops fired and killed a woman, increasing the number of rioters. A priest who made himself the rioters' representative managed to make his way to Charles and present him with the petitions. The priest's tone was ominous, and he promised to reduce [[Royal Palace of Madrid|the king's palace]] to rubble within two hours if the demands were not met. The rioters' demands included:

#That the minister Esquilache and all of his family leave Spain.
#That there only be Spanish ministers in the government. 
#That the Walloon Guard be disbanded.
#That the price of basic goods be lowered.
#That the Juntas de Abastos be suppressed.
#That the troops withdraw to their respective headquarters.
#That the use of the long cape and broad-brimmed hat be permitted.
#That His Majesty show himself and speak from his own mouth his desire to fulfill and satisfy these demands.

The king was inclined to accept the demands, despite being counselled not do so by several of his ministers. Those ministers who believed he should accept the rioters' demands emphasized that the riots were not a challenge against royal authority, but that they could develop into such should the demands be ignored. Charles appeared on the palace balcony. The rioters once again presented their demands. Charles calmly acceded to their demands. He and his Walloon Guard retired to the palace.

This act temporarily calmed the populace. However, fearing for his own safety, Charles then decided to retreat to [[Aranjuez]] with the rest of his family and his ministers, including Esquilache.

A military junta took measures to restore order. The city remained calm. However, upon hearing that Charles had left secretly for Aranjuez, anger spread that the king had simply accepted the demands in order to make his subsequent escape. There were also fears that a large force of royal troops would approach Madrid and crush the revolt.

In reaction to these fears, some 30,000 people, including men, women, and children, surrounded the house of Diego Rojas Contreras, [[bishop of Cartagena]] and president of the Council of Castile. The bishop was instructed to inform the king of the popular mood and to draw up a series of demands. An emissary was sent to Aranjuez and the bishop remained trapped. Meanwhile, the townspeople had begun to sack military buildings and stores, releasing prisoners. The king replied with a letter that stated that he sincerely promised to comply with the demands of his people, and asked for calm and order.

This calmed the populace once again. Esquilache was also dismissed, a move that both Charles and Esquilache lamented.  Esquilache felt that his modernizing reforms had deserved a [[statue]], and would comment that he had cleaned and paved the city streets and had created [[boulevard]]s and had nevertheless been dismissed. He was given the ambassadorship to [[Venice]], where he subsequently died.

==Aftermath==

Still fearing for his own safety, Charles remained at Aranjuez, leaving the government in the hands of his minister [[Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda]].  Doing so damaged his reputation.  The king remained at Aranjuez as Aranda and troops were sent there to protect him.  Aranda's arrival calmed Charles down but the king remained in the city until mid-April.

In Madrid, Aranda meanwhile had convinced the populace to adopt the French-style short capes and three-cornered hats, first meeting with the members of Madrid's five major [[guild]]s (''Gremios Mayores'') and 53 minor guilds (''Gremios Menores'').  Aranda managed to convince these members that the ''chambergo'' and the long cape was nothing but the apparel of ''el verdugo'' –the hated [[hanging|hangman]] or executioner- and that no respectable person would wear such a thing.  The populace thus gradually and peacefully adopted more modern apparel.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Charles III's advisers blamed the riots as a [[Jesuit conspiracy theories|plot organized by the Jesuits]].  The riots thus helped seal the fate of the Jesuits, already not in favor in Charles III's court. One scholar states that "Charles III would never had dared to expel the Jesuits had he not been assured of the support of an influential party within the Spanish Church."&lt;ref&gt;Brading, ''The First America'', p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish Crown [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelled the Jesuits in January 1767]] and dismantled the Jesuit missions of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=López |first=Adalberto |authorlink= |title=The Colonial History of Paraguay: The Revolt of the Comuneros, 1721-1735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD5SXlVFSg0C |year=2007 |origyear=first published 1976 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-7658-0745-8 |pages=162–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the near-insurrection of the populace, Charles would continue his program of reforms.  The painter [[Francisco de Goya]], an eyewitness to these events, would paint his ''Motín de Esquilache'' around 1766-7.

[[File:Barley and grapes.jpg|thumb|300px|Harvested grapes in basket and reaped barley]]
The '''first tithe''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''ma'aser rishon'' מעשר ראשון) is a positive [[Mitzvah|commandment]] in the [[Torah]] requiring the giving of one tenth of agricultural produce, after the giving of the standard ''[[terumah]],'' to the [[Kohen]] (Jewish priest) (or [[Levite]]).  This giving is required to be free of both monetary and servicial compensation.

Historically, during the [[First Temple]] period, the first tithe was given to the Levite.  Approximately at the beginning of the [[Second Temple]] construction, [[Ezra]] and his [[Beth din]] implemented its giving to the kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud [[Adin Steinsaltz]] 1992 "Yet if a priest has first tithe in his possession, he need not give it to a Levite. Ezra penalized the Levites of his generation because they did not return to Eretz Israel with him, and he decreed that first tithe should be given to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Restoration: Old Testament, Jewish, and Christian perspectives '' p329 James M. Scott - 2001 "One says that the Levites were punished because they did not come up to the Land of Israel during Ezra's days. The other says that the first tithe was given to the priests, so that they would have food when they were in a state of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hebrew Bible ==
The tithe gift is discussed in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb|num|18:21–26|JP}}) according to which a tenth of the produce was to be presented to a Levite who then gave a tenth of the first tithe to a kohen (Numbers {{bibleverse-nb|num|18:26|JP}}). Tithing was seen as performing a [[mitzvah]] done in joyful obedience to God. Giving tithe would open oneself up to receipt of divine blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] to [[Naso (parsha)|Parshat Naso]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations ==
The Torah instructs that the tithe should be of the "five grains",&lt;ref&gt;(see [[the Mitzvah of Challah]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[wine]], [[olive oil]], [[fruit]], and [[cattle]] ([[Leviticus]] {{bibleverse-nb|lev|27:30–33|JP}}). The time for taking such tithes was at the finished stage of processing the produce (Numbers {{bibleverse-nb|num|18:30|JP}}). Unlike ''[[terumah]]'' given to the Kohen, the ''ma'aser rishon'' was not regarded as sacred, and as a result did not have to be [[Tumah and taharah|ritually pure]], neither was it required to be eaten in any particular state (such as the Temple in Jerusalem). Once received by the Levite, it was regarded simply as ordinary property, and they could pass it on to non-Levites, or sell it, as they wished.

Traditionally tithes were calculated for the produce of each whole year, however [[Chazal]]ic Literature indicates that there was a debate between [[Beit Shammai]] and [[Beit Hillel]] as to when this tithing year should begin and end. Tithing years had different starts and ends depending on the particular crop in question; land crops began their tithe year on the first of [[Tishrei]] ([[Rosh Hashanah]]); according to [[Eleazar ben Shammua]] and [[Simeon bar Yohai]] the first of Tishri was also the start of the tithe year for cattle, but according to [[Rabbi Meir]] it was the first of [[Elul]] that held this honour. The followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] argued that the tithe year for fruit from trees began on the fifteenth of [[Shevat]], but the followers of [[Shammai]], his rival, argued that it began on the first of Shevat; the view of Hillel's followers eventually became the majority view and the ''new year for trees'' &amp;mdash; [[Tu Bishvat]] &amp;mdash; is now held at the date which they considered appropriate.&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=TITHE|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14408-tithe|first=Joseph|last=Jacobs|author-link=Joseph Jacobs|first2=Max|last2=Seligsohn|author2-link=Max Seligsohn|first3=Wilhelm|last3=Bacher|author3-link=Wilhelm Bacher|accessdate=Aug 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the priestly code ==

In classical rabbinical literature, according to which the entire Torah was principally written by [[Moses]], the first tithe is contrasted with the [[poor tithe]], and [[second tithe]], as entirely different tithes from each other, and for this reason gave the tithes the distinct names they possess; these latter tithes, which are mentioned by the [[Deuteronomic Code]], differ by not covering cattle or fruit, and rather than just going to the Levites, are in one case shared among the poor and other charitable destinations, and in the other go to the food producer themselves. According to some secular scholars, the poor tithe and the second tithe, when taken together, are a conflicting version of the same single tithe as the first tithe; the poor tithe and second tithe together being the [[Deuteronomist]]'s version and the first time being the version of the [[priestly source]].&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;

Although such scholars speculate that the deuteronomist is a later author than the priestly source, scholars believe that much of the Deuteronomic Code was a reaction against the regulations introduced by the Priestly Code,&lt;ref name="who"&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; and that here it reflects the earlier situation. In the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which some scholars believe predates the Priestly Code, meaning that according to their view the Priestly Code must post-date the Babylonian Exile, there is no mention whatever of a tithe appointed for the Levites, and in the Deuteronomic Code, though Levites have a share of the ''ma'aser sheni'', their share is seemingly voluntary, and it can alternatively be given to strangers, widows, and/or paternal orphans; in the Priestly Code, however, donation of the tithe to the Levites is compulsory.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; Of course, if the ''ma'aser sheni'' tithe, also mentioned in Leviticus, were originally different from ''ma'aser rishon'', there is a simpler explanation for the variation.

The clear differentiation between the [[kohen]]s (the ''priests'') and the other Levites, in the regulations given by the Priestly Code for the ''ma'aser rishon'', is a distinction scholars attribute to the pro-Aaronid political bias of the ''priestly source''; according to the Biblical revisionists' worldview, all Levites can be legitimate priests, which is likely to be why the Deuteronomist does not mention a ''tithe of the tithe'' (the portion of the tithe which is given to the priests rather than other Levites), since it would be somewhat meaningless.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; On the other hand, it raises a question about the distinction between ''ma'aser'' and ''terumah''. In the Priestly Code it is stated that the ''ma'aser rishon'' existed as the source of sustenance for the Levites, since they had no territory, and hence nowhere to keep [[livestock]] or perform [[agriculture]] (Numbers {{bibleverse-nb|num|18:21–24|JP}}). but this seemingly neglects the existence of a number of scattered Levite cities;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; scholars believe that the tithe (i.e. the tithe of which the ''ma'sar&lt;!-- מַעְשַׂר ("ma'sar"–NO double “a” – the ע has a Shva, not a ḥaṭaf pataḥ) as in וְכָל-מַעְשַׂר הָאָרֶץ (Lev. 27:30)--&gt; ani'' and ''ma'aser rishon'' are conflicting versions) actually arose as a generic heave offering, given to priests at the sanctuaries for their sustenance, and only became distinct when the Aaronids began to position themselves as the only Levites that could be legitimate priests.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; This view neglects the fact that cities are not agricultural centers and the tithing laws focus on agricultural produce. According to a holistic view of the Torah, the Levites had no portion in the fields. The [[Book of Amos]], cited by some scholars for support of their proposition, admonishes the Israelites about their rebellious offerings to idols by mentioning practices that would be acceptable to idolatry but not Torah Law.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Amos|Amos]] {{bibleverse-nb|amos|4:4|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] sarcastically remarks that they bring "for three days your tithes", as well as saying that they should offer their ''todah'' offerings of leaven (which was forbidden, see Lev. {{bibleverse-nb|lev|2:11|JP}}). Amos {{bibleverse-nb|amos|4:5|JP}}. The text itself does not bear out such scholars identification between ''ma'aser rishon'' and ''ma'sar ani''. First, the text clearly does not state "three years," it states "three days". Second, the text expressly proposes deviant practices as forms of rebellion. Finally, the owner of the produce was not required to bring ''ma'sar ani'' to the Temple; but, rather to the poor, no matter where there were. Likewise, this confused story does not clearly demonstrate how ''ma'aser sheni'' developed into a system where the owner separated the tithe for himself and had nothing to do with kings or priests.

== Contemporary practice ==

[[Orthodox Judaism]] regards the tithe as still being required for any produce grown within the historic boundaries of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdoms of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|of Judah]], covering the modern territories of the [[state of Israel]], [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Golan Heights]], and portions of western [[Jordan]]. However, because ''ma'aser rishon'' has no inherent sanctity, consistent with Numbers {{bibleverse-nb|num|18:31|JP}} (Levite tithes are wages), after ''terumat ma'aser'' has been removed, it is governed by the monetary civil laws which put the proof of a claim for monetary compensation on the person making the demand (the plaintiff). Since the lineage of the Levites is currently uncertain, there is no obligation to provide ''ma'aser rishon'' to a questionable Levi, whereas there is no rabbinic prohibition by doing so.

Contemporary practice, after designating and setting aside ''terumah'', is to make a formal declaration that the portion set aside is ''ma'aser rishon''. Afterwards, ''terumat ma'aser'' is designated and set aside. Finally, depending on the year, ''ma'aser sheni'' or ''ma'sar&lt;!-- מַעְשַׂר ("ma'sar"–NO double “a” – the ע has a Shva, not a ḥaṭaf pataḥ) as in וְכָל-מַעְשַׂר הָאָרֶץ (Lev. 27:30)--&gt; ani'' are designated and tithed in the appropriate manner.

While tithes from produce may not be given to a [[Kohen]] or [[Levite]], they may be fed to their animals.

The '''Gowers Review of Intellectual Property''' was an independent review of UK [[intellectual property]] (IP) focusing on [[copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]] that was published in December 2006. The then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] commissioned [[Andrew Gowers]] to lead the review in December 2005. The Review was published on 6 December 2006 as part of the Chancellor's annual pre-budget report. The review concludes that the UK's intellectual property system is fundamentally strong but made 54 recommendations for improvements.

== Recommendations ==

=== Instruments - Balance ===
* 1 - "Amend section 60(5) of the [[Patents Act 1977]] to clarify the research exception to facilitate experimentation, innovation and education"
* 2 - "Enable educational provisions to cover [[distance learning]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] by 2008 by amending sections 35 and 36 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]"
* 3 - "The [[European Commission]] should retain the length of protection on sound recordings and performers’ rights at 50 years"
* 4 - "Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and scope of protection for IP rights should not be altered retrospectively"&lt;ref name="official-documents6"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrew| first = Gowers| title = Gowers Review of Intellectual Property| publisher = HM Treasury| date = December 2006   | page =6 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruments - Coherence ===
* 5 - The Patent Office "should undertake joint working with African patent offices from mid-2007, with the aim of:
** helping them to take advantage of the flexibilities currently existing in the WTO/TRIPS architecture where appropriate; and
** encouraging them to make positive use of IP rights through dissemination of information in patents"
* 6 - "Encourage the international community under the auspices of the WTO to review the TRIPS status of the least developed countries prior to 2016 and consider whether further extension for reaching TRIPS compliance would be appropriate"
* 7 - "Government should encourage WTO members to ratify the amendments to TRIPS to make importation of drugs easier and cheaper"&lt;ref name="official-documents6"/&gt;

=== Instruments - Flexibility ===
* 8 - "Introduce a limited [[private copying]] exception by 2008 for [[format-shifting]] for works published after the date that the law comes into effect. There should be no accompanying [[Tax|levies]] for consumers"
* 9 - "Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media"
* 10a - "Amend s.42 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear"
* 10b - "Enable libraries to [[format-shift]] archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete"
* 11 - "Propose that [[Directive 2001/29/EC]] be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the [[Berne Three Step Test]]."

* 13 - "Propose a provision for orphan works to the European Commission, amending [[Directive 2001/29/EC]]"
* 14a - "The Patent Office should issue clear guidance on the parameters of a ‘reasonable search’ for [[orphan works]], in consultation with rights holders, collecting societies, rights owners and archives, when an orphan works exception comes into being"
* 14b - "The Patent Office should establish a voluntary register of copyright; either on its own, or through partnerships with database holders, by 2008.
* 15 - "Make it easier for users to file notice of complaints procedures relating to [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) tools by providing an accessible web interface on the Patent Office website by 2008"
* 16 - The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department for Trade and Industry]] "should investigate the possibility of providing consumer guidance on DRM systems through a labelling convention without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens"
* 17 - "Maintain policy of not extending patent rights beyond their present limits within the areas of software, business methods and genes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrew| first = Gowers| title = Gowers Review of Intellectual Property| publisher = HM Treasury| date = December 2006   | pages =6–7 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 22 - "Maintain a high quality of patents awarded by increasing the use of ‘section 21’ observations: streamlining procedures and raising awareness"
* 23 - "The Patent Office should conduct a pilot of Beth Noveck’s Community Patent Review in 2007 in the UK to determine whether this would have a positive impact on the quality of the patent stock"
* 24 - "The Patent Office should develop stronger links with universities and other research institutions, including through short placements, to ensure that IP examiners are aware of recent developments in technology.
* 25a - "Introduce accelerated grant process for patents to complement the accelerated examination and combined patent search and examination procedures"
* 25b - "Introduce fast track registration for trade marks"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrew| first = Gowers| title = Gowers Review of Intellectual Property| publisher = HM Treasury| date = December 2006   | page =7 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private copying ==
The review coincided with a 2006 survey carried out on behalf of the National Consumer Council, which indicated that over half of British adults infringe copyright law by duplicating and [[ripping]] music CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Consumer Council |date=2006-05-11 |title=Shake-up 'absurd' copyright laws, says NCC |url=http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003200223/http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the review, in January 2008 the government initiated a public consultation period on proposals to legalise personal copying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7176538.stm|title=Copying CDs could be made legal|date=2008-01-08|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright terms extension ==
On November 27, 2006, it was reported that Gowers would not recommend for the [[copyright term]] of recorded music to be extended from the current 50 years after the date of recording. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] and prominent musicians, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]], had lobbied for an extension to 95 years, matching the length of copyright provided in the United States; other musicians, such as [[Dave Rowntree]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] provided counteropinions. The Gowers Review found that the UK, compared with the USA, suffers no apparent impediment to creativity due to this disparity. To coincide with the publication of the review on the 6 December a full-page advertisement entitled [[Fair play for musicians]], was taken in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' of December 7, stating "We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright on sound recordings", and was signed by over 4,500 musicians, including a few dead ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessig.org/blog/against_term_extension/ Lessig Blog: Ok, so I'm wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
Richard Sargeant, a civil servant who wrote large amounts of the Review,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/23/europe_music_copyright_term/ The Register: EU votes for longer music copyright]&lt;/ref&gt; was later hired by [[Google]]. In January 2009, as Google's "public policy manager", he called for reforms to incorporate exemptions similar to the United States' [[fair use]] doctrine into UK and Europe copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/22/google-calls-for-uk-copyright-reforms The Guardian: Google calls for UK copyright reforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gun laws in [[Finland]]''' incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of [[firearm]]s usage in the country. Both hunting and shooting sports are common hobbies among [[Finns]]. There are approximately 300,000 people with hunting permits &lt;ref&gt;[http://riista.fi/en/hunting/ The Finnish Wildlife Agency] "Approximately 300,000 persons obtain a hunting card in Finland annually."&lt;/ref&gt; and 34,000 people belong to sport shooting clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ampumaurheiluliitto.fi/esittely/ Finnish Shooting Sport Federation] "34 165 total members" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1500 people are licensed weapons collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.poliisi.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/intermin/embeds/poliisiwwwstructure/38570_Asetilastot_2010-2015_versio2.pdf The Police of Finland] "1 545 licensed collectors in 2014" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many reservists practice their skills using semi-automatic rifles and pistols after the military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resul.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SRAJohtoSaanto19_10_2013.pdf Reservist Sports Association] "The aim of applied reservist shooting is to develop and compare the practical shooting skills of reservists using modern service weapons or their semi-automatic versions." {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal firearms in Finland must be registered and licensed on a per-gun basis. There are approximately 1.5 million registered small firearms in the country. Out of those, 226,000 are short firearms ([[pistol]]s, [[revolver]]s) with the rest being long firearms ([[rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/aseiden_maara_suomessa_vahenee__katso_missa_ovat_maan_15_miljoonaa_asetta/8588611 YLE] "Number of firearms declining" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 650,000 people with at least one permit which means 12% of Finns own a firearm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermin.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/1/1/suomen_aserekisterissa_on_noin_1_6_miljoonaa_asetta_28307 Ministry of the Interior] "Approximately 1.6 million guns in Finland" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, legal [[gun ownership rate]] is similar to countries such as [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Canada]] and [[Germany]]. Estimates place the number of illegal, unregistered firearms between some tens of thousands &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermin.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/1/1/suomen_aserekisterissa_on_noin_1_6_miljoonaa_asetta_28307 Ministry of the Interior] "The Ministry of the Interior estimates that there are at most some tens of thousands of unlicensed firearms in Finland." {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upwards of a million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2007/en/full/Small-Arms-Survey-2007-Chapter-02-EN.pdf Small Arms Survey] An estimate of between 2.15 to 3.60 million total firearms is given in table 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of these are thought to be weapons hidden during the [[Weapons Cache Case|aftermath]] of [[World War II]].

The current Firearms Act of 1998 is a near full rewrite of the earlier, 1933 law. The law was revised to comply with the '''[[European Firearms Directive]]''' after Finland joined the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edilex.fi/he/19970183 HE 183/1997] Government's proposal to the Parliament for new Firearms Act {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the school shooting incidents in 2007 and 2008 in which the perpetrators used .22 caliber semi-automatic pistols, legislation regarding short firearms was considerably tightened in 2011. Nevertheless, no types of firearms are outright banned, and in principle a person can apply for a licence for any type of gun.

== Regulation ==

The ownership and use of firearms is regulated by the Firearms Act of 1998. A license is always needed for possession of a firearm and all firearms are registered. Firearms may only be carried while they are being used for a specific purpose (e.g. hunting, shooting at the range). When transporting a firearm to or from such activity, the firearm must be unloaded and stored in a case or pouch. The owner of a firearm is responsible for making sure that firearms and ammunition do not end up in unauthorized hands. The exact requirements regarding storage of firearms depends on their type and quantity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 10 § 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air gun]]s up to 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm (0.25 inch) in caliber are not regulated regardless of their muzzle energy. Larger bore air weapons need a permit, unless the person already holds a firearms licence. Bows and crossbows are not regulated items in Finland, while pepper spray is. Suppressors are considered firearm components, but can be used with without requiring any separate licensing. Magazine capacity is not restricted nor is there regulation regarding other firearm accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 1 § 2&lt;/ref&gt;

An unlicensed person may use firearms only under direct supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 7 § 88&lt;/ref&gt; Simple unlawful possession of a firearm is punishable by fine or up to two years in prison, although more severe punishments may apply e.g. in the case of fully automatic weapons or when used to commit other crime. However, an unlicensed firearm may always be turned in without repercussions, provided this happens at the initiative of the person in possession of the firearm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Finlex] Criminal Code, 41 § 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain types of ammunition, such as expanding pistol rounds or incendiary rounds, require special authorization (in addition to a firearms licence) to purchase. The amount of ammunition a person may possess is not limited by the Firearms Act. However, legislation related to the safe storage of explosive materials does apply. Ordinarily, this means a maximum of 20,000 rounds of ammunition (including loose primers) and 2&amp;nbsp;kg of gunpowder per household, with larger quantities requiring separate storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2015/20150819#Pidm1963680 Finlex] Valtioneuvoston asetus
räjähteiden valmistuksen ja varastoinnin valvonnasta ("Explosive Materials Decree") 12 § 56 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed changes to regulation==

Currently, work is underway to streamline the license application process in straightforward cases. An applicant who already has existing permits and has a proven track-record with responsible ownership would be able to apply for further permits more easily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermin.fi/download/64157_Aseluvat_asettamispaatos_03122015.pdf Ministry of the Interior] AMPUMA-ASELUPAMENETTELYÄ KOSKEVAN LAINSÄÄDÄNNÖN UUDISTAMISTA KOSKEVA HANKE ("Project for renewing firearms legislation") {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the EU adopted changes to the Firearms Directive that became known as the "'''[[European_Firearms_Directive#Amending_Directive_(EU)_2017/853|EU Gun Ban]]'''". The changes will need to be implemented in local legislation.

== Licensing ==

When applying for a licence to purchase a firearm, the applicant must fill in a form with information such as the type and mode of operation of firearm, and the intended purpose of use (although one can use any firearm for any legal purpose regardless of the original application, e.g. a range gun for hunting or vice versa). According to the law, the firearm must be appropriate for the stated purpose, but evaluating this is largely left to the discretion of the police. For example, while an [[AR-15]] is suitable for practical shooting, the police may consider one inappropriate for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/JulkaisuMetatieto/Documents/EDK-2015-AK-27457.pdf Parliament] Statement from the Police regarding the EU Firearms Directive "-- permits for [military style semi-automatics] are generally not given for hunting use --"&lt;/ref&gt;

Valid reasons for obtaining a firearms license are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Reason !! Description
|-
| 1|| Hunting || A valid hunting permit is expected. Minimum muzzle energy for different game, magazine capacity restrictions etc. defined in separate legislation.
|-
| 2|| Sports and hobby || Type of firearm needs to be appropriate for the discipline. Proof that the hobby exists is expected. For pistols and revolvers further requirements apply.
|-
| 3|| Work|| The need for a firearm must be justified. Appropriate training is expected.
|-
| 4|| Film and theater||
|-
| 5 || Museum or collection|| Person or organization the Ministry of the Interior has approved as a weapons collector.
|-
| 6|| Memento|| Item is of significant importance to the person or family.
|-
| 7|| Signaling|| Flare guns for e.g. boating.
|-
| 8|| Proxy ownership|| 15-17 year olds may participate in sports shooting or hunting on their own but a licensed adult is responsible for the transportation and storage of the firearm.
|}

The application process includes a check of criminal records, the police interviewing the applicant and in some cases a [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|computer-based personality test]] or a medical health certificate. Any significant history with violence or other crime, substance abuse or mental health issues will cause the application to be rejected. Membership in a hunting or shooting club or other appropriate organization is considered a positive, though membership can not be legally required as the Constitution of Finland guarantees freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/Lausunto/Documents/pevl_18+2010.pdf Parliament] PERUSTUSLAKIVALIOKUNNAN
LAUSUNTO 18/2010 vp&lt;/ref&gt;

If the application is approved, an acquisition permit is mailed to the applicant. A dealer (or private person) may only sell a firearm if the buyer has the appropriate paperwork to show. There is no waiting period as such, but in practice processing an application takes a minimum of several days, usually a few weeks. Licences can be valid either until further notice or for a fixed term, which is sometimes the case for a people applying for their first license, and always with the first pistol license. A licence-holder may also borrow other firearms from the same or lesser category (e.g. a rifle licence is valid for borrowing shotguns and small-caliber rifles, but not pistols) and purchase ammunition for any firearm he owns or is permitted to borrow.

'''Classification of firearms'''

For legal purposes, firearms are divided into 12 different types:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 1 § 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sub-compact pistols'''

A pistol is considered sub-compact or a "pocket gun" if it fits in a rectangular box of 180 x 130&amp;nbsp;mm, as is a revolver that fits in a box of 190 x 140&amp;nbsp;mm. Special legislation applies to these easily concealed firearms and they are not licensed for sporting purposes. Some common pistols such as [[Glock#9.C3.9719mm Parabellum|Glock 19]] fall under this description, and are therefore generally unavailable to e.g. [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]] shooters in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 1 § 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specially dangerous weapons'''

Some types of weapons are considered "specially dangerous". Licences for such weapons can only be granted on a very limited basis and are essentially for recognized collectors and filming purposes only. A weapon is considered specially dangerous if:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980001.pdf Finlex] Firearms Act, 1 § 9&lt;/ref&gt;

* its mode of operation is automatic fire
* it is a cannon, rocket launcher or comparable weapon system
* it is disguised as another object

'''Short-barreled rifles and carbines'''

Short-barreled rifles and pistol carbines fall under the any other firearm category and, while not restricted by law, are more difficult to get a licence for. The primary concern is again that, being easy to conceal, they are particularly dangerous should they be stolen and fall into criminal hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/oikeus/kho/vuosikirjat/2002/200200269 Finlex] The Supreme Administrative Court: "-- rejecting application for 9 mm Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 A3 (pistol carbine) on the basis of public order and safety was legal, even though the firearm was otherwise appropriate for the intended purpose --" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal protection and self-defense ==

In the 1980s and 1990s roughly 7% of firearm licenses were granted for the purpose of personal protection. Since 1998 new licences have not been granted on that basis, although existing permits remain valid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edilex.fi/he/19970183 Edilex] HE 183/1997, 2.2 ("Proposal of the Government to the Parliament for a Firearms Act") {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still possible to obtain a licence for pepper spray for the purpose of self-defense if a concrete threat exists. Carrying a firearm licensed for hunting or sporting use outside of that specific activity is not allowed. One can nevertheless legally defend himself by any means available, including firearms. Any use of force must always be proportional to the threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Finlex] Criminal Code, 4 § 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in crimes ==

Between 2010 and 2015, firearms were used in 15% of all homicides. In 73% of these the firearm was illegally possessed by the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/175210/Katsauksia_19_Lehti_2017.pdf University of Helsinki] HENKIRIKOSKATSAUS 2017 ("Report on Homicide 2017") {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two school shootings in [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela in 2007]] and [[Kauhajoki school shooting|Kauhajoki in 2008]] are by far the worst mass murders in Finland, with 8 and 10 victims, respectively. In both cases the perpetrator was armed with a .22 rimfire pistol licensed only shortly before. In the case of Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the original application was for a 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol, but this was rejected. In the aftermath police were blamed for being too lax in issuing licences, as neither perpetrator had any significant history with sports shooting. Police defended their decision, stating that nothing suspicious had come up with the information available, so there was no reason to reject the application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/tarkempi-haastattelu-olisi-tuskin-paljastanut-auvista/2041460 MTV3] "A more in-depth interview probably would not have revealed intent" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation was revised in 2011 and now pistol licenses can only be issued following a two-year period of documented, active pistol shooting hobby, and only to persons 20 years old or older.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2011/20110124 Finlex] 124/2011 Laki
ampuma-aselain muuttamisesta ("Law regarding revision of the Firearms Act") {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in suicides ==

In 2013, firearms (both legally and illegally held) were used in 18% of suicides. Some consider this a problem and would like to see stricter firearms legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/something_terrible_has_happened_does_finland_need_to_wake_up_to_its_gun_problem/8535425 YLE] “Something terrible has happened”: Does Finland need to wake up to its gun problem?&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the number of suicides is already steadily going down, while the number of firearms has remained constant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikkoniskasaari.fi/node/220 Mikko Niskasaari] "Take psychiatric medication away from women!" {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/10 Findicator] "Number of suicides fell clearly"&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Military reserve ==

[[Military service#Finland|Military service]] guns are stored by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]], and are only given out during reservist training or [[mobilization]]. At present, a strong political consensus exists that military weapons should not be stored by individuals, even if they are reservists in first-line, quick response units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edilex.fi/mt/puvm20040001 Edilex] Puolustusvaliokunnan mietintö 1/2004 (PuVM 1/2004 vp) The memorial by the defense committee of the Finnish Parliament discusses the Finnish military doctrine, including the principle that military weapons are always stored by the Defence Forces. There are 6 opposing comments to the memorial, none of them questioning this principle. Retrieved 2016-04-18. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hybrid Access Networks''' refer to a special architecture for broadband access networks where two different network technologies are combined to improve bandwidth. A frequent motivation for such Hybrid Access Networks is to combine one [[xDSL]] network with a wireless network such as [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. The technology is generic and can be applied to combine different types of access networks such as [[DOCIS]], [[WiMAX]], [[5G]] or satellite networks. The [[Broadband Forum]] has specified an architecture&lt;ref name="BBF-TR348"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-348.pdf |title=TR-348 Hybrid Access Broadband Network Architecture|last=Broadband Forum|date=2016-07-01|accessdate=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the deployment of such networks.

== Use cases ==

One of the main motivations for such Hybrid Access Networks is to provide faster Internet services in rural areas where it is not always cost effective to deploy faster xDSL technologies such as [[G.Fast]] or [[VDSL2]] that cannot cover long distances between the street cabinet and the home. Several governments, notably in Europe, require network operators to provide fast Internet services to all inhabitants with a minimum of 30 Mbps by 2020.&lt;ref name="BBEurope"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/broadband-europe|title=Broadband Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second use case is to improve the reliability of the access link given that it is unlikely that both the xDSL network and the wireless network will fail at the same time.

A third motivation is the fast service turnup. The customer can immediately install the hybrid network access and use the wireless leg while the network operator is installing the wired part.

== Technology ==

Several techniques are defined by the [[Broadband Forum]] to create Hybrid Access Networks. To illustrate them, we assume that the enduser has an hybrid CPE router that is attached to both a wired access network such as [[xDSL]] and a wireless on such as [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. Other deployments are possible, e.g. the enduser might have two different access routers that are linked together by a cable instead of a single hybrid CPE router.

The first deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber but no specialised equipment in the operator's network. There are two possible configurations for [[IP address|IP]] addresses. A first deployment scenario is to allocate different IP addresses to the wired and wireless interfaces. In this case, the hybrid CPE router needs to load-balance intelligently the packets over the two networks. In particular, it must ensure that all packets belonging to a given [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection are sent over the same interface. A second deployment scenario is to allocate the same IP address to both the wired and the wireless networks and configure the routing in these networks to ensure that packets or correctly routed.

The second deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber and installs a Hybrid Aggregation Gateway inside its access networks. The Hybrid Aggregation Gateway plays an important role in balancing the packets sent by and destined to the hybrid CPE router over the two access networks. Two technologies have been defined and deployed to enable hybrid CPE routers to interact with Hybrid Aggregation Gateways. The main objective of these technologies is to efficiently use the two access links even if they have different delay and bandwidth. One technical difficulty that occurs when distributing packets over such heterogeneous links is to accurately detect congestion, notably on the wireless network whose bandwidth can vary quickly, and cope the reordering which is caused by the delay difference. One approach uses GRE tunnels &lt;ref name="RFC8157"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding Protocol |rfc= 8157 |last=Leiman |first=N. |year= 2017|month=May|autolink=yes |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hide the two links to the upper layer protocol. Both the hybrid CPE and the HAG need to reorder the received packets to ensure that TCP receives in-sequence packets. The second approach uses [[Multipath TCP]], a recent [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] extension that has been designed to precisely enable the transmission of the packets that belong to a single connection to different links. More precisely, [[Multipath TCP]] proxies are installed on both the hybrid CPE router and on the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway. When a client behind the hybrid CPE router initiates a TCP connection, this connection is automatically converted in a [[Multipath TCP]] connection which is proxied by the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway before being forwarded to the final server. This approach leverages the ability of [[Multipath TCP]] to efficiently handle congestion and cope with reordering on the heterogeneous access links. Two approaches have been defined for the interactions between the hybrid CPE router and the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway. The transparent mode &lt;ref name="draft-transparent"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Link bonding with transparent Multipath TCP|autolink=yes|draft=draft-peirens-mptcp-transparent-00 |last1=Peirens |first=Bart|last2=Detal|first2=Gregory|last3=Barre|first3=Sebastien|last4=Bonaventure|first4=Olivier |year= 2016|month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used when the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway is placed on the path of all packets sent by the hybrid CPE router. Otherwise, the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway includes a TCP converter as defined in &lt;ref name="draft-converter"&gt;{{cite IETF |title= 0-RTT TCP Convert Protocol |draft= draft-ietf-tcpm-converters-02 |last1=Bonaventure |first1=Olivier|last2=Boucadair|first2=Mohammed |year= 2018|month=July|autolink=yes |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006''' (c 13) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

It is the fifth major{{says who|date=October 2011}} piece of legislation relating to immigration and asylum since 1993.

==Commencement Orders==
Although the Act received [[Royal Assent]] on 30 March, its provisions did not take effect immediately, until a series of commencement orders brought the provisions into force incrementally:
*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1497/contents/made The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2006] (S.I. 2006/1497 (C. 50)), made on 2 June 2006, brought into force on 16 June 2006 the sections on grants, proof of right of abode, accommodation, removal: cancellation of leave, deprivation of citizenship, deprivation of right of abode, and money. It also repealed section 40A(3) of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]].
*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2226/contents/made The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2006] (S.I. 2006/2226 (C. 75)), made on 13 August 2006, enacted the bulk of the Act's provisions including the sections on variation of [[leave to enter]] or remain, removal, grounds of appeal, failure to provide documents, refusal of leave to enter, deportation, continuation of leave, consequential amendments, code of practice, discrimination: code of practice, documents produced or found, fingerprinting, attendance for fingerprinting, searches: contracting out, information: embarking passengers, inspection of detention facilities, capacity to make nationality application, arrest pending deportation, refugee convention: construction, refugee convention:certification, detained persons: national minimum wage. It also repealed sections of the [[Prison Act 1952]] (c.52),the [[Immigration Act 1971]] (c.77), the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] and the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] (c.41).
*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2838/contents/made The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2006] (S.I. 2006/2838 (C. 98)), made on 4 December 2006, enacted the remainder of the Act's provisions including the sections on abandonment of appeal and acquisition of British nationality.

==Summary of changes==
===Appeals===
The Act introduced a number of changes to the immigration appeals process, most notably restricting the right of appeal for refusal of entry clearance in cases where the subject intends to enter the country as a dependent, a visitor or a student.

This leaves the only grounds for appeal open to human rights and race discrimination reasons. Appeals launched within the UK can be for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] cases only.

===Employment===
The Act introduces civil (not criminal) penalties in the form of [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s for employers who take on people over the age of 16 who are subject to immigration control (that is, have no entry clearance or leave to remain, or no valid permit to work in the UK).

===Information===
The Act allows immigration officers to request and obtain [[biometric]] data (such as [[fingerprint]]s) from immigration arrivals for the purposes of proving they are the rightful holder of their passport or travel documents.

It allows the police to request and obtain advance information on passengers and crew of flights and ships arriving in or leaving the United Kingdom, or those expected to do so.

The Act requires the [[Asylum and Immigration Tribunal]] and the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] to first consider if an application for refugee status meets article 1F of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], if the decision by the Home Secretary is to refuse on that basis.

===Citizenship and Right of Abode===
The Act contains several provisions empowering the Home Secretary to deprive a person of British citizenship (or [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|Right of Abode]]) if it is considered that such deprivation is "conducive to the public good".

==Notable applications of the Act==
*Australian [[Guantánamo Bay]] inmate [[David Matthew Hicks]] applied for British citizenship in 2005 after the previous 2002 legislation allowed citizenship by virtue of maternal heritage. It was considered that the British government may petition for his release as had been done for other British nationals. After a lengthy court battle with the [[Home Office]], Hicks was granted British citizenship on 5 July 2006, but then stripped of it several hours later under section 56 of the Act allowing the [[Home Secretary]] to "deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Blake QC: [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27969-2146936,00.html Why is there no song and dance about this Act?], ''[[The Times]]'', 25 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anna Chapman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home Office stripping more dual-nationality Britons of citizenship|first=Ian|last=Cobain|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/15/home-office-law-dual-citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inherent jurisdiction''' is a doctrine of the [[England|English]] [[common law]] that a [[superior court]] has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear any matter that comes before it, unless a [[statute]] or rule limits that authority or grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to some other court or [[tribunal]]. The term is also used when a governmental institution derives its jurisdiction from a fundamental governing instrument such as a [[constitution]]. In the English case of ''Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation Ltd'', [[Lord Diplock]] described the court's inherent jurisdiction as a general power to control its own procedure so as to prevent its being used to achieve injustice. 

Inherent jurisdiction appears to apply to an almost limitless set of circumstances. There are four general categories for use of the court's inherent jurisdiction:

#to ensure convenience and fairness in legal proceedings;
#to prevent steps being taken that would render judicial proceedings inefficacious;
#to prevent abuses of process;
#to act in aid of superior courts and in aid or control of inferior courts and tribunals.

As such, the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is a broad doctrine allowing a court to control its own processes and to control the procedures before it. The power stems not from any particular statute or legislation, but rather from inherent powers invested in a court to control the proceedings brought before it.

==Inherent jurisdiction in Canada==
According to the [[case law]] in [[Canada]], the key restriction on the application of inherent jurisdiction is that the [[doctrine]] cannot be used to [[override power|override]] an existing [[statute]] or [[Procedural law|rule]]. The clearest articulation of such restriction is set out in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision in ''[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1975/1975canlii164/1975canlii164.html College Housing Co-operative Ltd. v Baxter Student Housing Ltd. (1976)]'' which was a case dealing with whether a judge had exceeded jurisdiction in determining the [[mortgagee]] should have priority over other charges and encumbrances. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that a court cannot negate the unambiguous expression of legislative will and further held that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inherent jurisdiction cannot, of course, be exercised so as to conflict with statute or rule. Moreover, because it is a special and extraordinary power, it should be exercised only sparingly and in a clear case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another restriction on the application of the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction appears to be that inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to create new rules of [[substantive law]].

The [[rules of civil procedure]] in various provinces in Canada have varying relationships with the inherent jurisdiction of their courts. In [[Ontario]] the Rules of Civil Procedure are considered to be regulations of the [[Courts of Justice Act]], and thus an expression of legislative will. They are created and amended by a "Civil Rules Committee" which consists of fourteen judges and thirteen other persons involved in the legal community including the [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] or his representative. The rules are subject to the approval of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The judges of the Court obviously have a part in the making of the rules, but the rules are regulations under the Act. Inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to conflict with the unambiguous expression of the Rules.

In [[Nova Scotia]], on the other hand, the Rules of Civil Procedure are made by the judges of the [[Supreme Court of Nova Scotia|Superior Court]] and the [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] pursuant to s.46 of the [[Judicature Act]]. The [[Attorney General of Nova Scotia|Attorney General]] does not have a hand in their creation, and they are not subject to approval by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia has taken the position that a single judge of the court may use the inherent jurisdiction of the court to manage its own procedures.

'''''Jacobson v. Massachusetts''''', 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce [[compulsory vaccination]] laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that the freedom of the individual must sometimes be subordinated to the common welfare and is subject to the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the state.

== Background ==
Pastor Henning Jacobson already lived through an era of mandatory vaccinations back in his original home in [[Sweden]]. The national law made vaccination mandatory and when he was a child, he was vaccinated for smallpox.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pox: An American History|last = Wilrich|first = Michael|publisher = Penguin|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the efforts to eradicate smallpox were successful in Sweden, he did not agree with the methods. He said vaccination caused him "great and extreme suffering" that he would have to endure for the rest of his life. One of his sons "suffered adverse effects" after being vaccinated as a child. Jacobson and his wife were thus resistant when it came to mandatory vaccinations in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A leader in his community, Jacobson was one of the few who resisted mandatory vaccinations for smallpox in the early 20th century in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. While many were pleased to hear about a vaccine for smallpox, others were alarmed by the idea of being stabbed by a needle and having [[cowpox]] injected inside of them. Jacobson was distraught by this and took his case against mandatory vaccinations to the Supreme Court in 1905. He refused the vaccine stating it was an "invasion of his liberty",&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ussc|name=Jacobson v. Massachusetts|volume=197|page=11|pin=|year=1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was prosecuted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The penalty for vaccination refusal was a $5 monetary fine ({{Inflation|US|5|1905|r=-1|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jacobson v Massachusetts: It's Not Your Great-Great-Grandfather’s Public Health Law|journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = 2005-04-01|issn = 0090-0036|pmc = 1449224|pmid = 15798113|pages = 581–590|volume = 95|issue = 4|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2004.055160|first = Wendy K.|last = Mariner|first2 = George J.|last2 = Annas|first3 = Leonard H.|last3 = Glantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor Jacobson refused vaccination saying that "he and his son had had bad reactions to earlier vaccinations". Because of his refusal to get vaccinated, Jacobson was fined $5 and appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Fourteenth Amendment was brought up during the case on individual liberty. The case showed that the State was "restricting one aspect of liberty" by forcing people to get vaccinated. In its ruling in support of the Massachusetts law, the Supreme Court identified two primary rationales. One was that "the state may be justified in restricting individual liberty... under the pressure of great dangers" to the safety of the "general public".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By identifying the ongoing smallpox epidemic as a danger to the general public, the court ruled that individual rights and liberty were subordinate to the state's obligation to eradicate the disease. Jacobson had also argued that the law requiring vaccination was "arbitrary or oppressive".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Court rejected the argument stating that mandatory immunization in the face of epidemic was not arbitrary or oppressive, but a measure for "getting to their goal of eradicating smallpox". Massachusetts was one of only 11 states that had compulsory vaccination laws.&lt;ref name="Toward a 21st-century"&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title=Toward a Twenty-First-Century ''Jacobson v. Massachusetts'' |url=http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/a_twenty-first-century_jacobson_v_massachusetts.pdf |journal=Harvard Law Review |publisher=The Harvard Law Review Association |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=1822 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision ==
Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] delivered the decision for a 7-2 majority. He rejected Jacobson's claim that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] gave him the right to refuse vaccination.
Harlan deemed that the Massachusetts state punishment of a fine or imprisonment on those who refused vaccines was acceptable, but those individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curry |first=Lynn |date=2002 |title=''The Human Body on Trial: A Sourcebook With Cases, Laws, And Documents'' |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=105 |isbn=1-57607-349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his decision, he acknowledged that for certain individuals, the requirement of vaccination would be cruel and inhumane and therefore an overreach of government power. That created a medical exemption for adults under the Massachusetts health law, but Harlan denied that Henning Jacobson deserved exemption.&lt;ref name="Pox"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willrich |first=Michael |date=2011 |title=Pox: An American History |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=319–329 |isbn=978-0-14-312078-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedent ==
Harlan ruled that personal liberties could be suspended when "the safety of the general public may demand" for example during a smallpox outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title=Toward a Twenty-First-Century ''Jacobson v. Massachusetts'' |url=http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/a_twenty-first-century_jacobson_v_massachusetts.pdf |journal=Harvard Law Review |publisher=The Harvard Law Review Association |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=1822–1823 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the smallpox outbreak to the [[American Civil War]] (in which three out of nine Justices at the term served) by saying that a community has the right to protect itself from both disease and military invasion.&lt;ref name="Pox" /&gt;

More broadly, Harlan ruled that Massachusetts was justified in mandating vaccination: "there are manifold restraints to which each person is necessarily subject for the common good".&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; While Harlan supported such restraints, he also warned that if the state targeted specific individuals or populations to unnecessary restrictions, the court might have to step in to protect them.

That was a few years after ''Wong Wai v. Williamson'' in which a federal circuit court injunction in [[San Francisco]] was overturned. It required all Chinese residents of San Francisco to get a dangerous [[bubonic plague]] inoculation if they wished to leave the city, which Judge [[William Morrow (judge)|William Morrow]] ruled was "boldly directed against the Asiatic or Mongolian race as a class".&lt;ref name="Pox" /&gt;

Harlan's decision supported both [[police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] and limits on the power, and his decision would be invoked to support both in later cases. He stated his nuanced opinion on the limits of government power by saying that "general terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression or absurd consequence". &lt;ref name="Pox" /&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
The anti-vaccine movement mobilized following the decision and the Anti-Vaccination League of America was founded three years later in [[Philadelphia]] to promote the principle that "health is nature's greatest safeguard against disease and that therefore no State has the right to demand of anyone the impairment of his or her health." The League warned about what it believed to be the dangers of vaccination and the dangers of allowing the intrusion of government and science into private life, part of the broader process identified with the [[Progressive Movement]]. The League asked, "We have repudiated ''religious'' tyranny; we have rejected ''political'' tyranny; shall we now submit to ''medical'' tyranny?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title=Toward a Twenty-First-Century ''Jacobson v. Massachusetts'' |url=http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/a_twenty-first-century_jacobson_v_massachusetts.pdf |journal=Harvard Law Review |publisher=The Harvard Law Review Association |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=1823–1824 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in ''Jacobson'' in ''[[Zucht v. King]]'' (1922), which held that a school system could refuse admission to a student who failed to receive a required vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title=Toward a Twenty-First-Century ''Jacobson v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5783">'''[[Judicial review]]''' is the procedure by which courts in '''[[Denmark]]''' assess whether laws are compatible with the constitution, and administrative acts are compatible with the law. The [[Constitution of Denmark]] does not expressly authorise the courts to review statutes, but the courts have inferred the right from its provisions.

==History==

As the [[constitution]] does not mention whether the courts can overturn legislative acts, it has been debated in Danish legal theory whether the courts are able to do this. However the courts have assumed this right which has been accepted by the government as well as  [[Parliament of Denmark|parliament]].

There have been little debate whether the courts were able to examine whether the formal constitutional procedures connected to the creation of a law has been followed. The courts have done this in a few cases but have never ruled a law unconstitutional due to non-compliance with formal procedure.

Previously it has been debated whether the courts were able to examine whether a law was in compliance with the material provisions of the constitution. However there is a consensus in recent legal theory that the courts have this power, citing a longstanding precedence. In 1912 the supreme court assumed that it had the power to try the constitutionality of tithe abolition laws. In 1921 the supreme court came close to declare a land reform law unconstitutional; and it was only because a judge changed his vote that the law was considered constitutional.

The first time a law was declared unconstitutional was in 1971 when a law demanded that a foundation under the [[University of Copenhagen]] was to transfer its collection of Icelandic manuscripts and its capital to the [[University of Iceland]] without compensation. The foundation contested that this was violating the constitutional ban on expropriation without compensation. The supreme court ruled that the foundation was to transfer the manuscripts without compensation but not its capital.

The second time a law was declared unconstitutional was in a 1980 case concerning whether a law banning private shipping companies from transporting goods to and from [[Greenland]]. In reality there was only one company affected by the law and the eastern high court ruled that the law expropriated the business of that shipping company and awarded the company a compensation.

{{Sister|project=Wikisource|text=Wikisource English translation of the Supreme Court's Judgement in [[s:The Tvind Case (1999)|The Tvind Case (1999)]]|position=right}}
The third and most recent case where a law was ruled unconstitutional is from 1999, where several named individual schools from the [[Tvind]] network was cut off from government funding. The law was passed because the schools were suspected of receiving funding based on forged numbers of students. To avoid a lot of lawsuits a law was passed cutting the Tvind schools from government funding and barring them from suing the government over the lost funding. The supreme court declared this to be a violation of the separation of powers and declared the law unconstitutional.

==Procedure==

As the Danish courts are formally only able to decide in concrete cases an unconstitutional law is technically still in force. However a court ruling that a law is unconstitutional means that authorities will not again try to apply the law as they would expect to be met with a lawsuit they are guaranteed to lose. There has been several cases on the constitutionality of Danish membership of the [[European Union]]. It is unclear what the political response would be if a law on accession to an EU treaty was found unconstitutional.

Since the courts are only competent to rule in concrete disputes not everyone can sue the state for passing an unconstitutional law. To do this the plaintiff has to have a legal interest in the case. However in 1996 the supreme court ruled that a group of citizens had legal interest in suing the prime minister over the law on accession to the [[European Union]]. The supreme court found that accession to the European Union was affecting the entire population in many substantial areas and that every Danish citizen thus had legal interest in the constitutionality of Danish accession to the EU.

Denmark has no specialised [[constitutional court]] and thus the question on the constitutionality of a law is to be contested before the ordinary courts. All courts are able to rule on the constitutionality of a law but in practice such highly political cases would be appealed to the Supreme Court.

As for judicial review of acts of the administration rather than pieces of legislation, Article 63 of the Danish constitution provides that the judiciary is entitled to try any question relating to the limits to the executive's powers. This is traditionally construed to mean that beyond the sphere of criminal procedure, unless otherwise provided for by legislation, the judiciary may try any question of fact and of law, whereas courts traditionally do not review discretion exercised by the administration. In certain areas, however, such as tax law, courts exercise a wider review, as well as in cases concerning just reparation for expropriation of property, as provided for by Article 73(3) of the Danish constitution. Other areas where the standard of scrutiny may traditionally be less extensive include, inter alia, cases of royal prerogative, such as foreign policy actions of the executive.

'''''Lee v. Weisman''''', 505 U.S. 577 (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lee v. Weisman|505|577|1992}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision regarding school prayer. It was the first major [[school prayer]] case decided by the [[Rehnquist]] Court. It ruled that schools may not sponsor clerics to conduct even non-denominational prayer. The Court followed a broad interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]] that had been standard for decades at the nation's highest court, a reaffirmation of the principles of such landmark cases as ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Engel v. Vitale|370|421|1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp|Abington v. Schempp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Abington School District v. Schempp|374|203|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Robert E. Lee was the principal of Nathan Bishop Middle School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. He invited a rabbi to deliver a prayer at the 1989 graduation ceremony, but the parents of student Deborah Weisman requested a temporary injunction to bar the rabbi from speaking. The question being reviewed was whether or not this was constitutional. The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island|Rhode Island district court]] denied the Weismans' motion. The family did attend the graduation ceremony, and the rabbi did deliver the benediction. 

The Weismans continued their litigation after the graduation and won a victory at the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The school district appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the prayer was nonsectarian and was doubly voluntary: Deborah was free not to stand for the prayer and because participation in the ceremony itself was not required. Arguments were heard on November 6, 1991. [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Anthony Kennedy]] had been critical of the Court's decisions on school prayer, and many court watchers thought that he would provide the crucial fifth vote to reverse the lower court's ruling and deal a major blow to the twin separationist pillars of ''Engel'' and ''Abington''.'''

==Decision==
The 5–4 decision was announced on June 24, 1992. It was somewhat surprising as a victory for the Weismans and a defeat for the school district. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which maintained previous Supreme Court precedents sharply limiting the place of religion within the nation's public schools—far from joining those who favored curtailing restrictions on school prayers. The [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] papers reveal that Kennedy switched his vote during the deliberations, as he also did in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|link=|volume=505|page=833|pin=|year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that his draft majority opinion upholding the prayer exercise "looked quite wrong." Instead, Kennedy wrote an opinion that repudiated the school district's main arguments. He found fault with Principal Lee's decision to give the rabbi who was planning to offer the graduation invocation a pamphlet on composing prayers for civic occasions:

:Through these means, the principal directed and controlled the content of the prayers. Even if the only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that the rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious representative who valued his or her continued reputation and effectiveness in the community would incur the State's displeasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government, and that is what the school officials attempted to do.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 588 citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy also noted that the nonsectarian nature of the prayer was no defense, as the Establishment Clause forbade coerced prayers in public schools, not just those representing a specific religious tradition. He addressed the State's contention that attendance was voluntary at the graduation exercises:

:To say a teenage student has a real choice not to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commencement without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allow the case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that, in our society and in our culture, high school graduation is one of life's most significant occasions. A school rule which excuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may not be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term "voluntary," for absence would require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which have motivated the student through youth and all her high school years.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Kennedy formulated what is now known as the coercion test in answering the argument that participation in the prayer was voluntary:

:The school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirect public and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group or maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. A reasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing or remaining silent signified her own participation in, or approval of, the group exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a ''[[de minimis]]'' character, since that is an affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The principle that government may accommodate the [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]] does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by '''the [[Establishment Clause]]'''. It is beyond dispute that, '''at a minimum''', the Constitution '''guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which "establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so."'''&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 587 (citations omitted and emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

:As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools. Our decisions in [Engel] and [Abington] recognize, among other things, that prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there. What to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 592 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinions===

Justice Blackmun's concurrence stressed that "our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the Court has recognized that 'the fullest possible scope of religious liberty,' entails more than freedom from coercion."&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 606 (Blackmun, J., concurring; internal citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun emphasized that the government was without power to place its imprimatur on any religious activity, even if no one was compelled to participate in a state-sponsored religious exercise, directly or indirectly.

Justice Souter devoted his concurring opinion to a historical analysis, rebutting the contention that the government could endorse nonsectarian prayers. He cited the writings of [[James Madison]] and pointed to the changing versions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that the First Congress considered, as opposed to the version which was eventually adopted. Souter, too, took issue with the school district's defense of non-coercive religious exercises, dismissing the position as without precedential authority.

===Dissenting opinion===
Justice Scalia's dissent argued against the coercion test:

:In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court - with nary a mention that it is doing so - lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineering, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable, test of psychological coercion.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 632 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia pointed to several historical examples of calling on divine guidance by American Presidents, including Washington's proclamation of the Thanksgiving holiday in 1789 and the inaugural addresses of both Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. He disputed the Court's contention that attendance at high school graduation ceremonies was effectively required as part of social norms, and also the conclusion that students were subtly coerced to stand for the rabbi's invocation. In Scalia's view, only official penalties for refusing to support or adhere to a particular religion created an Establishment Clause violation.

==Subsequent developments==

The coercion test is now used to determine the constitutionality of certain government actions under the Establishment Clause, along with the [[Lemon test]] and Justice O'Connor's [[Endorsement test|"endorsement or disapproval" test]]. The test "seeks to determine whether the state has applied coercive pressure on an individual to support or participate in religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Doe v. Elmbrook School Dist. |vol=687 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=840 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120723121 |accessdate=2018-07-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad reading of the Establishment Clause won out, but it seems to have its greatest current application in a public school context. The Court has ruled against the separationist position in several key funding cases since ''Lee'', including the [[school voucher]] case ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Zelman v. Simmons-Harris|link=|volume=536|page=639|pin=|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a majority of the Court continues to maintain a strict ban on most forms of state-sponsored religious exercises in schools themselves, as evidenced by the 6–3 ruling in ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe]]'', which struck down student-led prayers before public school football games.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe|link=|volume=530|page=290|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa''' is a 1998 multilateral environmental [[memorandum of understanding]] that entered into effect on 1 July 1999 under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the Bonn Convention. The MoU focuses on the protection of six marine turtle species that are estimated to have rapidly declined in numbers along the Atlantic Coast of Africa. The MoU covers 26 range States (Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Portugal (Azores, Madeira), São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain (Canary Islands), Togo and United Kingdom). As of May 2013, 23 range States have signed the MoU.&lt;ref name=ss&gt;[http://www.cms.int/pdf/en/summary_sheets/mar_turtle_afr.pdf Summary Sheet]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:Map of Signatories to the Marine Turtles Atlantic Coast of Africa Memorandum of Understanding.jpg|thumb|290px|Map of Signatories to the Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa MoU, as of 15 August 2012]]
[[Marine turtles]] are thought to be numerous along much of the Atlantic Coast of Africa. The area includes nesting sites, feeding areas and migration corridors of importance to six species of marine turtles. To protect these species an Article IV agreement was concluded and came into effect on 1 July 1999.

Signatories to the Marine Turtles of Atlantic Coast of Africa MoU:&lt;ref name = ss/&gt;

* South Africa (6 November 2007)

In addition, the CMS Secretariat also signed the MoU (29 May 1999).

The “Nairobi Declaration”, adopted at the May 2002 meeting, drew attention to the problem of by-catch in industrial fishing operations and emphasized the importance of involving local communities in the development and implementation of conservation activities.&lt;ref&gt;Nairobi Declaration: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/older_files/nairobi_declaration_090502.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to maximise the advantages of cooperation between related conventions and NGOs, and the integration of marine turtle conservation measures within the emerging African Process for the Development and Protection of the Marine and Coastal Environment in Sub-Saharan Africa.

== Aim of MoU ==
The aim of the MoU is to safeguard six marine turtle species that are estimated to have rapidly declined in numbers during recent years due to excessive exploitation (both direct and incidental) and the degradation of essential habitats.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/08/0808_wireturtles.html ; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8604723.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Species covered by MoU ==
[[File:3959 aquaimages.jpg|thumb|200px|Hawksbill turtle]] [[File:Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta) 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Loggerhead turtle]]
The MoU protects six species of marine turtles:
* [[Loggerhead turtle]] ''(Caretta caretta)''
* [[Ridley turtle|Atlantic ridley turtle]] ''(Lepidochelys kempii)''
* [[Olive ridley turtle]] ''(Lepidochelys olivacea)''
* [[Green turtle]] ''(Chelonia mydas)''
* [[Hawksbill turtle]] ''(Eretmochelys imbricate)''
* [[Leatherback turtle]] ''(Dermochelys coriacea)''

== Fundamental components ==
Conscious that concerted, coordinated action must be taken immediately to address the threats posed to the existing populations, the Signatories agree to work closely together to improve the conservation status of the marine turtles and the habitats on which they depend. To that end, they shall:&lt;ref&gt;Text of Marine Turtles Atlantic Coast of Africa Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/MoU/African_Marine_Turtles_MoU_E_with_amending_decision.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Endeavour to put in place measures for the conservation and, where necessary and appropriate, strict protection of marine turtles at all stages of their life cycle (including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub-adults and adults)
# Review and, as necessary, revise national legislation, and ratify or accede to those international conventions most relevant for the conservation of marine turtles, so as to enhance the legal protection given to these species
# Implement in their respective countries, subject to the availability of necessary resources, the provisions of the Conservation Plan annexed to the MoU
# Facilitate the expeditious exchange of scientific, technical and legal information needed to coordinate conservation measures; and cooperate with recognized scientists of international organizations and other range States in order to facilitate their work conducted in relation to the Conservation Plan
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and Conservation Plan at regular meetings
# Provide the secretariat an annual report on the implementation of the MoU and Conservation Plan 

The MoU took effect on 1 July 1999 and shall remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all of the other Signatories.

== Meetings ==
Meetings of Signatories are organized regularly to review the conservation status of the marine turtles and the implementation of the MoU and Conservation Plan. National reports by individual Signatories and a report prepared by the Secretariat are also submitted.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories''' took place in the UNEP Headquarters, [[Nairobi, Kenya]], May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Report First Meeting of Signatories: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/Meeting_Reports/RS1_Report_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservation Plan, which had been drafted at the previous meeting, was revised and adopted. 

'''The Second Meeting of Signatories''' was held in [[Dakar, Senegal]], 5-7 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Report Second Meeting of Signatories: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/Meeting_Reports/RS2_Report_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting the Signatories reviewed the implementation of the MoU, updated the Conservation Plan and established a Consultative Committee on Science and Technology. Furthermore, the second meeting amended the MoU in order to:
* Establish an Advisory Committee
* Encourage the CMS Secretariat to take necessary measures for effective regional coordination of the MoU
* Recall the decisions and accord reached during the first Meeting of Signatories and make explicitly clear in the text of the MoU that this instrument is open to all States with impacts on marine turtles and relevant interests in the region

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat — located in Bonn, Germany — provides the Secretariat functions. From October 2005 until the end of July 2012 the coordination services for the MoU were provided by the Coordination Unit known by its French acronym URTOMA. Since August 2012, the administration of the MoU has been shifted to the CMS Secretariat in Bonn until other arrangements can be found.

== Conservation Plan ==
In May 2002, the range States gathered in Nairobi to conclude a comprehensive Conservation Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Plan: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/pdf/africa_turtles_mou_cp_en.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The text of the MoU states that the Plan shall aim to improve basic knowledge of species and migration routes, reduce mortality of marine turtles, enhance cooperation among range States and secure funding for the initiation and/or continuation of conservation programmes; the Plan shall also provide for the identification of key habitats for nesting and foraging, for population monitoring a research and the eventual preparation of national marine turtle action plans that take into account the needs of local human populations.

The Conservation Plan, adopted in 2002 and revised, focuses on the establishment of a database on turtle ecology (distribution, migration patterns, etc.) and on threats (mature and extent of direct exploitation, by-catch rate, impact of coastal management, pollution, etc.). 

== Activities and Successes ==
The CMS Secretariat has published two reports, entitled “Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa: CMS Technical Series Publication No.5” and “Biogeography and Conservation of Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa: CMS Technical Series Publication No.6.”&lt;ref&gt;Reports: http://www.cms.int/species/africa_turtle/AFRICAturtle_report.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, the MoU has supported a number of small-scale project activities in various countries, with a view to stimulating broader initiative and supported the development of basic training and awareness materials such as the funding of the production of French language marine turtle identification posters developed by WIDECAST, an NGO working on turtle conservation in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widecast.org/ |title=Welcome to WIDECAST - Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Network |publisher=Widecast.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a more practical level, through the MoU a project, which started in 2001 and was successfully concluded in 2003, was funded. The project aimed at uncovering the migratory patterns of the Green Turtle population nesting at Poilão, Guinea-Bissau.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7830">'''Military necessity''', along with [[distinction (law)|distinction]], and [[proportionality (international humanitarian law)|proportionality]], are three important principles of [[international humanitarian law]] governing the [[laws of war|legal use of force]] in an [[armed conflict]].

==Attacks==
Military necessity is governed by several constraints: an attack or action must be intended to help in the military defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a military objective,&lt;ref name="military objective"&gt;Article 52 of ''Additional [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]]'' provides a widely accepted definition of military objective: "In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage" (Source: {{harvnb|Moreno-Ocampo|2006|loc=page 5, footnote 11}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and the harm caused to [[civilians]] or civilian [[property]] must be proportional and not "excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated".&lt;ref&gt;Article 51 paragraph 5(b) of ''Additional [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court|Chief Prosecutor]] at the [[International Criminal Court]], investigated allegations of [[war crime]]s during the [[the International Criminal Court and the 2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]] and he published an open letter containing his findings. In a section titled "Allegations concerning War Crimes " he did not call it military necessity but summed up the term:

{{quotation|Under international humanitarian law and the [[Rome Statute]], the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives,&lt;ref name="military objective"/&gt; even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv).
&lt;p&gt;
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) criminalizes:&lt;br&gt;
Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;&lt;br&gt;
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) draws on the principles in Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional [[Protocol I]] to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], but restricts the criminal prohibition to cases that are "''clearly''" excessive. The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, ''[[inter alia]]'', an assessment of:&lt;br&gt; 
(a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury;&lt;br&gt;
(b) the anticipated military advantage;&lt;br&gt;
(c) and whether (a) was "clearly excessive" in relation to (b).|[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]].{{sfn|Moreno-Ocampo|2006|loc=See section "Allegations concerning War Crimes" Pages 4,5}} }}

The judgement of a field commander in battle over ''military necessity'' and ''proportionality'' is rarely subject to [[municipal law|domestic]] or international legal challenge unless the methods of warfare used by the commander were illegal, as for example was the case with [[Radislav Krstic]] who was found guilty as an aider and abbetor to genocide by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for the [[Srebrenica massacre]].

==Weapons==
Military necessity also applies to weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Article 35 of the ''Additional [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]]'' states at the start of PART III that "Basic rules: (1) In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. (2) It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. (3) It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment."&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when a new weapon is developed and deployed.&lt;ref&gt;Article 36 of the ''Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions'' states that "New weapons: In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage was considered in [[Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State| ''Ryuichi Shimoda'' et al. ''v. The State'']] (1963):
{{quotation|
For the international law of war is not formulated simply on the basis of humanitarian feelings. It has as its basis both considerations of military necessity and effectiveness and humanitarian considerations, and is formulated on a balance of these two factors. To illustrate this, an example often cited in the textbooks may be given, of the provisions of the [[St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868]] prohibiting the use of projectiles under 400 grammes which are either explosive or charged with combustible or inflammable substances. The reason for the prohibition is explained as follows: such projectiles are small and just powerful enough to kill or wound only one man, and as an ordinary bullet will do for this purpose, there is no overriding need for using these inhuman weapons. On the other hand, the use of a certain weapon, great as its inhuman result may be, need not be prohibited by international law if it has a great military effect.|[[Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State| ''Ryuichi Shimoda'' et al. ''v. The State'']] (1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shimoda 1963|''Shimoda'' 1963]] Section: Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: point (11): second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation''' was released on 7 October 2013 by the leaders of a number of organizations involved in coordinating the [[Internet]]'s global technical infrastructure. The statement was signed by the heads of the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], the [[Internet Architecture Board]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], the [[Internet Society]], and the five [[Regional Internet Registries|regional Internet address registries]] ([[African Network Information Center]], [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]], [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]], [[Latin America and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]], and [[Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre]]). In large part, the statement is seen as a response to the ongoing [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA surveillance scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/11/internet_heavyweights_turn_backs_on_snoopy_us_demand_global_oversight/ "Brazil's anti-NSA prez urged to SNATCH keys to the internet from America"], Rik Myslewski, ''The Register'', 11 October 2013.

* They reinforced the importance of globally coherent Internet operations, and warned against Internet fragmentation at a national level. They expressed strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance.
* They identified the need for ongoing effort to address Internet Governance challenges, and agreed to catalyze community-wide efforts towards the evolution of global multistakeholder Internet cooperation.
* They called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing.
* They also called for the transition to IPv6 to remain a top priority globally. In particular Internet content providers must serve content with both IPv4 and IPv6 services, in order to be fully reachable on the global Internet.

{{for|the granting of citizenship based on birth|Birthright citizenship in the United States}}

Status as a '''natural-born citizen''' of the [[United States]] is one of the eligibility requirements established in the [[United States Constitution]] for holding the office of [[President of the United States|President]] or [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].  This requirement was intended to protect the nation from foreign influence.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite web| last=Tucker|first=St. George|title=St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries 1:App. 316–s25, 328–29|year=1803|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s18.html|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Constitution uses but does not define the phrase "natural born Citizen", and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning. The consensus of early 21st-century constitutional scholars, together with relevant case law, is that natural-born citizens include, subject to exceptions, those born in the United States. Many scholars have also concluded that those who meet the legal requirements for [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship "at the moment of birth"]], regardless of place of birth, are also natural-born citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Pete|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/natural-born-issue-ted-cruz-not-settled-not-going-away-n499226|title='Natural Born' Issue for Ted Cruz Is Not Settled and Not Going Away|work=[[NBC News]]|date=January 19, 2016|quote= "The emerging consensus of the legal experts, however, is that being 'natural born' means becoming a citizen at the moment of birth, as opposed to achieving it later through the process of naturalization...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011 CRS"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42097.pdf | title=Qualifications for President and the 'Natural Born' Citizenship Eligibility Requirement | publisher =[[Congressional Research Service]] |author =Maskell, Jack | date=November 14, 2011 | accessdate=February 25, 2012 | quote = In addition to historical and textual analysis, numerous holdings and references in federal (and state) cases for more than a century have clearly indicated that those born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction (i.e., not born to foreign diplomats or occupying military forces), even to alien parents, are citizens 'at birth' or 'by birth,' and are 'natural born,' as opposed to 'naturalized,' U.S. citizens. There is no provision in the Constitution and no controlling American case law to support a contention that the citizenship of one's parents governs the eligibility of a native born U.S. citizen to be President. | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every president to date was either a citizen at the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 or was born in the United States; of these there have been seven that had at least one parent who was not born on U.S. soil.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Law.justia.com_January_16_2016c" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pilon /&gt;

The natural-born-citizen clause has been mentioned in passing in several decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], and by some lower courts that have addressed eligibility challenges, but the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question of a specific presidential or vice-presidential candidate's eligibility as a natural-born citizen.  Many eligibility lawsuits from the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]] election cycles were dismissed in lower courts due to the challengers' difficulty in showing that they had [[standing (law)|standing]] to raise legal objections.  Additionally, some experts have suggested that the precise meaning of the natural-born-citizen clause may never be decided by the courts because, in the end, presidential eligibility may be determined to be a [[non-justiciable]] [[political question]] that can be decided only by [[United States Congress|Congress]] rather than by the judicial branch of government.&lt;ref name="Tokaji"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=mlr_fi|title=The Justiciability of Eligibility: May Courts Decide Who Can Be President?| journal=Michigan Law Review, First Impressions|volume=107|page=31|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Charles |title=Who can be President of the United States: The Unresolved Enigma |journal=Maryland Law Review |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–32 |publisher=Maryland Law Review, Inc.

==Constitutional provisions==
[[File:NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg|thumb|Part of the constitutional provision as it appeared in 1787]]
Section 1 of  [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] sets forth the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, under clause 5 (emphasis added):

{{bquote|No Person '''except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President'''; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.{{refn|A [[Duke Law Journal]] article has noted, "Because of the placement of the commas, this clause, if read literally, suggests that only individuals alive at the time the Constitution was adopted are eligible to be president. For purposive and consequentialist reasons, however, the clause never
has been read that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3804&amp;context=dlj|title=CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT|last1=Bradley|first1=Curtis A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Neil|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=64|issue=7|date=April 2015|page=1243 (footnote 130)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] states, "No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of [[Vice-President of the United States]]." The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] does not use the phrase ''natural-born citizen''. It does provide, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], representatives and senators are required to be [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]], but there is no requirement that they be natural born.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution: [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Qualifications of Members|Article 1, Section 2, Clause 2: Qualifications of Members]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution: [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators|Article 1, Section 3, Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term "natural born" was not without precedent.

In 1775, however, Blackstone reversed his opinion and explained that the children "are now deemed to be natural-born subjects" rather than "are now natural-born subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, William.

"[https://archive.org/details/investigationofn00plowuoft An Investigation of the Native Rights of British Subjects]", pp. 74, 161-62 (London, Baldwin, Whieldon &amp; Debrett 1784).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after further consideration he also reversed his opinion and concluded in 1785 that the statutes did not make the children natural born subjects—rather, there remained a "relict of alienage in them."&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, Francis. "[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/osu.32437121568725 A Supplement to the Investigation of the Native Rights of British Subjects]", p. 134 (London, Baldwin, Whieldon &amp; Debrett 1785).&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Blackstone, [[Edward Coke]] offered a narrower opinion in ''[[Calvin's Case]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.org/coke/Calvins_Case-7_Coke_Report_1a_77_ER_377.html 7 Coke ''Report'' 1a], 77 ER 377 (1608), Opinion of Edward Coke.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Coke: "[I]f any of the King's ambassadors in foreign nations, have children there of their wives, being English women, by the common laws of England they are natural-born subjects, and yet they are born out-of the King's dominions."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, F. B.  "Natural-Born British Subjects at Common Law", ''Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation'', Vol. 14, p. 318 (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "natural born" has often been used synonymously with "native born".&lt;ref&gt;Maskell, Jack.  "[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42097.pdf Qualifications for President and the 'Natural Born' Citizenship Eligibility Requirement]", CRS Report for Congress, pp. 31-32  (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote in 1756 that the word "natural" means "native," and that the word "native" may mean either an "inhabitant" or an "offspring".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel.

===Between 1776 and 1789===
From the [[Declaration of Independence]] (1776) to the ratification of the Constitution (1789), the thirteen states were independent of Britain, and during much of this time the [[Articles of Confederation]] tied together the country.  The phrase "natural born citizen" was sometimes used during this period. An example occurred in 1784 when the [[Maryland General Assembly]] conferred citizenship on the (French-born) [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]:&lt;ref&gt;Speare, Morris.  [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/09/07/98291852.pdf "Lafayette, Citizen of America"], ''[[New York Times]]'' (September 7, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Elihu.

===Constitutional Convention===
The Constitution does not explain the meaning of "natural born".&lt;ref&gt;Han, William.

[[Max Farrand]] wrote that it "was not submitted to the Convention and has no further value than attaches to the personal opinions of Hamilton."&lt;ref&gt;3 M. Farrand, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=003/llfr003.db&amp;recNum=622&amp;itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A@field%28DOCID%2B@lit%28fr0032%29%29%230030003&amp;linkText=1 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 619].&lt;/ref&gt; Article IX, section 1 of Hamilton's draft constitution provided:  "No person shall be eligible to the office of President of the United States unless he be now a Citizen of one of the States, or hereafter be born a Citizen of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;3 [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=003/llfr003.db&amp;recNum=632&amp;itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A@field%28DOCID%2B@lit%28fr0032%29%29%230030003&amp;linkText=1 Farrand, at 629].&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 1787, [[John Jay]] wrote to [[George Washington]], presiding officer of the Convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Permit me to hint, whether it would not be wise and seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government, and to declare expressly that the Command in chief of the American army shall not be given to, nor devolve on, any but a natural {{underline|born}} Citizen.{{#Tag:Ref|Heard, Alexander; Nelson, Michael (1987).

While the [[Committee of Detail]] originally proposed that the President must be merely a citizen, as well as a resident for 21 years, the [[Committee of Eleven]] changed "citizen" to "natural born citizen", and the residency requirement to 14 years, without recorded explanation after receiving Jay's letter. The Convention accepted the change without further recorded debate.&lt;ref&gt;Han, William.

===Constitutionality of the natural-born-citizen clause===
In 2012, [[Abdul Hassan (lawyer)|Abdul Karim Hassan]] filed several unsuccessful lawsuits that claimed the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had superseded the natural-born-citizen clause; he had argued natural-born citizenship was a form of discrimination based on national origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Other Democratic Candidate|first=Joe|last=Palazzolo|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/09/04/the-other-democratic-candidate/|date=September 4, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed constitutional amendments ===
More than two dozen proposed constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress to relax the restriction.&lt;ref name="usa120204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-12-02-schwarzenegger-amendment_x.htm | title=Should the Constitution be amended for Arnold? | author=Kasindorf, Martin |work=[[USA Today]] | date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the more well known were introduced by Representative [[Jonathan Bingham]] in 1974, with the intent to allow German-born Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] (otherwise fourth in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]]) to become eligible,&lt;ref name="time030474"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944757,00.html | title=President Kissinger? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=March 4, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]] by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] in 2003, intending to allow eligibility for Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref name="usa120204" /&gt; The Bingham amendment would have also made clear the eligibility of those born abroad to U.S. parents,&lt;ref name="time030474" /&gt; while the Hatch one would have allowed those who have been naturalized citizens for twenty years to be eligible.&lt;ref name="usa120204" /&gt;

But all these proposed articles of amendment have failed in the Congresses, and thus none have ever been submitted to the states for ratification; thus the restriction that the clause imposes remains unrelaxed.

==Rationale==
[[St. George Tucker]], an early federal judge, wrote in his 1803 edition of William Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', perhaps the leading authority for the delegates to the Constitutional Convention for the terms used in the Constitution, that the natural-born-citizen clause is "a happy means of security against foreign influence" and that "[t]he admission of foreigners into our councils, consequently, cannot be too much guarded against."&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; In a footnote, Tucker wrote that naturalized citizens have the same rights as the natural-born except "they are forever incapable of being chosen to the office of president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.org/tb/tb2.htm Blackstone, ''Commentaries'', Vol. II, Ch. 10], 1803.{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech before the Senate, delegate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] gave the rationale, "to insure experience and attachment to the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Farrand |first=Max |title=Charles Pinckney in the United States Senate |work=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Vol 3 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1787&amp;chapter=96841&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |accessdate=October 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Akhil Amar]] of [[Yale Law School]] claimed that there had been a concern on the part of those drafting the U.S. Constitution that a member of the European aristocracy might immigrate and attempt to buy his way into power and that it made sense in this light to include a provision in the Constitution that would exclude immigrants from the presidency.&lt;ref name = "Amir"&gt;{{cite web

==Interpretations of the clause==

===Naturalization Acts of 1790 and 1795===
Because of the large number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] who went on to serve in Congress, laws passed by the early sessions of Congress have often been looked to as evidence of the Framers' intent.  The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] stated that "the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens: Provided, That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States."&lt;ref name="rs6.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|website=rs6.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was repealed by the [[Naturalization Act of 1795]], which removed the characterization of such children as "natural born", stating that "the children of citizens of the United States, born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, shall be considered as citizens of the United States" while retaining the same residency restrictions as the 1790 act.&lt;ref name="rs6.loc.gov"/&gt;

===Interpretations by the courts===

==== 1800s ====
Although eligibility for the Presidency was not an issue in any 19th-century litigation, there have been a few cases that shed light on the definitions of ''natural born'' and ''native born'' citizen. The leading case, ''Lynch v. Clarke''{{refn|NY Chanc.Ct., November 5, 1844; 1 Sandf.Ch. 583, 3 NY Leg.Obs. 236, 7 NY Ch. Ann. 443, 1844 WL 4804, 1844 N.Y.Misc. LEXIS 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009477674;view=1up;seq=597|title=Reports of cases argued and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of New-York : before the Hon. Lewis H. Sandford, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the First Circuit.|volume=1|publisher=Gould, Banks, and Co.|year=1846|page=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009477674;view=1up;seq=597 588]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} of 1844, indicated that citizens born "within the dominions and allegiance of the United States" are citizens regardless of parental citizenship. This case dealt with a New York law (similar to laws of other states at that time) that only a U.S. citizen could inherit real estate. The plaintiff, Julia Lynch, had been born in New York while her parents, both British, were briefly visiting the U.S., and shortly thereafter all three left for Britain and never returned to the U.S. The New York Chancery Court determined that, under common law and prevailing statutes, she was a [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen by birth]] and nothing had deprived her of that citizenship, notwithstanding that both her parents were not U.S. citizens or that British law might also claim her through her parents' [[nationality]]. In the course of the decision, the court cited the Constitutional provision and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose a person should be elected president who was native born, but of alien parents; could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the Constitution? I think not. The position would be decisive in his favor, that by the rule of the common law, in force when the Constitution was adopted, he is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Sandf. at 656, Leg.Obs. at 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon principle, therefore, I can entertain no doubt, but that by the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. It is surprising that there has been no judicial decision upon this question.&lt;ref&gt;Sandf. at 663, Leg.Obs. at 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The decision in ''Lynch'' was cited as persuasive or authoritative precedent in numerous subsequent cases, and reinforced the interpretation that "natural born citizen" meant born "within the dominions and allegiance of the United States" regardless of parental citizenship. For example, in an 1884 case, ''In re Look Tin Singg'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3556433;view=1up;seq=933|title=The Federal reporter : with key-number annotations ... Permanent ed. ..  v.21.|website=HathiTrust}}&lt;/ref&gt; the federal court held, that despite laws preventing naturalization of Chinese visitors, Chinese persons born in the United States were citizens by birth, and remained such despite any long stay in China. Citing ''Lynch'', Justice [[Stephen J. Field]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After an exhaustive examination of the law, the Vice-Chancellor said that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural-born citizen, and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession, and the universal impression of the public mind.&lt;ref&gt;Fed at 909, Sawyer at 359–360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Lynch'' case was also cited as a leading precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898),{{refn|''U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark'' (1898) 169 U.S. 649, 42 L.Ed. 890, 18 S.Ct. 456.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3381955771263111765|title=United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 US 649 - Supreme Court 1898|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which similarly held a child born in the United States of two Chinese parents became "at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States". Similarly, in a 1999 Circuit Court decision, the U.S.-born children of two non-citizen parents were spoken of as "natural born citizens".{{refn|''Mustata v. US Dept. of Justice'' (6th Cir. 1999) 179 F.3d 1017 at 1019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16060395960467504921|title=Mustata v. US Dept. of Justice, 179 F. 3d 1017 - Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit 1999|publisher=[[Google scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in 1875, Chief Justice Waite, in Minor v. Happersett, stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens,as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5117525999793250938&amp;q=Minor+v.+Happersett,+88+U.S.+162+(1875)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=800006]|title=Minor v.

==== 1900s ====
Consistent with the earlier decisions, in 1939, the U.S. Supreme Court stated in its decision in ''[[Perkins v. Elg]]'' that a person born in America and raised in another country was a natural born citizen, and specifically stated that they could "become President of the United States".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17485095411337455454|title=''Perkins v.

However, when she was about four her parents returned to Sweden taking her with them, and they stayed in Sweden. At age 20, she contacted the American embassy in Sweden and, shortly after her 21st birthday, returned to the United States on a U.S. passport and was admitted as a U.S. citizen. Years later, while she was still in America, her father in Sweden relinquished his American citizenship, and, because of that, the Department of Labor (then the location of the [[Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service]]) declared her a non-citizen and tried to deport her. The young woman filed suit for a declaratory judgment that she was an American citizen by birth. She won at the trial level, and at the circuit court—where she was repeatedly described as "a natural born citizen" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3381137503537572247|title=''Perkins v.

Cir. 1938) 69 U.S.App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; — and finally in the U.S. Supreme Court, where the court decision quoted at length from the U.S. Attorney General's opinion in ''Steinkauler's Case'' (mentioned in the next section [[#Government_officials'_interpretations]]) including the comment that a person born in America and raised in another country could yet "become President of the United States".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some federal cases argued for a narrow reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to which U.S. citizens were necessarily either born or naturalized in the United States, and any citizen who was not born in the United States must have been naturalized by operation of law, even if such naturalization was "automatic" at birth. In this view, such a person should not be considered a natural born citizen, but rather a "naturalized" citizen who is not eligible for the Presidency.&lt;ref name="CRS2016" /&gt;

In 1951, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted in ''Zimmer v. Acheson'' that "[t]here are only two classes of citizens of the United States, native-born citizens and naturalized citizens", quoting a [[dictum]] by Justice Gray from [[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]] and [[Elk v. Wilkins]].&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; The court ruled that Zimmer, who was born abroad in 1905 to a U.S. citizen father and a noncitizen mother, was himself a citizen under the nationality law in force at the time of his birth, but "his status as a citizen was that of a naturalized citizen and not a native-born citizen".&lt;ref name="ZimmervAcheson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/191/f2d/209/zimmer-v-acheson|title=''Zimmer v Acheson, 191 F.2d 209 (10th Cir. 1951)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1956 case of ''Wong Kam Wo v. Dulles'', the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit quoted ''Zimmer v. Acheson'' and ''United States v. Wong Kim Ark'' in support of a ruling that the statute that was in effect prior to 1940 granting citizenship to foreign-born children of U.S. citizens was a naturalization law rather than a provision for nationality at birth. In 1940, the [[Nationality Act of 1940]] ({{usstat|54|1137}}), explicitly defined "naturalization" as conferring nationality ''after'' birth.

In 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Montana v. Kennedy'' that an individual who was born in 1906 in Italy to a U.S. citizen mother and a noncitizen father was not a U.S. citizen by birth under the nationality laws in force at the time of his birth. It observed that automatic citizenship was granted to children of U.S. citizen fathers and noncitizen mothers by an 1855 act of Congress, but the reverse situation was only addressed, non-retroactively, in 1934.&lt;ref name="MontanavKennedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/366/366.US.308.198.html|title=''Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308 (1961)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the Court encountered a similar situation in ''[[Rogers v. Bellei]]'', where the individual in question was born after 1934 and so was granted automatic U.S. citizenship, though subject to residence requirements and was subject to expatriation. The Court "appeared to assume or imply that such persons became citizens at birth by way of naturalization".&lt;ref name="CRS2016" /&gt;

More recent cases, particularly ''[[Nguyen v. INS]]'' and ''Robinson v. Bowen'', relaxed this view, suggesting that the Fourteenth Amendment merely establishes a "floor" for birthright citizenship, and this category may be expanded by Congress.&lt;ref name="CRS2016" /&gt;

==== 2000s ====
In 2009 in ''Ankeny v. Governor'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/22488868/ANKENY-v-GOVERNOR-OF-THE-STATE-OF-INDIANA-APPEALS-COURT-OPINION-11120903 ''Ankeny v. Governor of the State of Indiana''] (2009), Appeals Court Decision, 11120903&lt;/ref&gt; the Indiana Court of Appeals reaffirmed that persons born within the borders of the United States are "natural born Citizens", regardless of the citizenship of their parents. The court referred to the case of Wong Kim Ark, and provides a compilation of the arguments pertaining to this topic.

A clarification to this interpretation was made in 2010, where a [[Judicial panel|three-judge panel]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] held that natural born citizens can lose their citizenship if their territory of birth later ceases to be U.S. territory. The case involved a Philippine-born litigant who could not claim U.S. citizenship on the basis of his parents, who lived all their lives in the Philippines, because they were born while the Philippines was U.S. territory prior to being given its independence. The Courts for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have also held that birth in the Philippines at a time when the country was a territory of the United States does not constitute birth "in the United States" under the Citizenship Clause, and thus did not give rise to United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13732685093008127861|title=''Nolos v.

To this the Court responded, "Article II, section 1, clause 5 does not state this. No legal authority has ever stated that the Natural Born Citizen clause means what plaintiff Strunk claims it says. ... Moreover, President Obama is the sixth U.S. President to have had one or both of his parents not born on U.S. soil". The opinion then listed Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Chester A. Arthur, Woodrow Wilson, and Herbert Hoover.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Law.justia.com_January_16_2016c" /&gt;

=== Government officials' interpretations ===
====1800s====
[[John Bingham]], an American lawyer and politician, held to the belief that natural born should be interpreted as born in the United States. In 1862, in the House of Representatives he stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Constitution leaves no room for doubt upon this subject. The words "natural born citizen of the United States" appear in it, and the other provision appears in it that, "Congress shall have power to pass a uniform system of naturalization." To naturalize a person is to admit him to citizenship. Who are ''natural born citizens'' but those born within the Republic? Those born within the Republic, whether black or white, are citizens by birth—natural born citizens.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Globe'' 37.2 (1862), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=059/llcg059.db&amp;recNum=680 p. 1639].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He reiterated his statement in 1866:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural-born citizen; but, sir, I may be allowed to say further that I deny that the Congress of the United States ever had the power, or color of power to say that any man born within the jurisdiction of the United States, not owing a foreign allegiance, is not and shall not be a citizen of the United States. Citizenship is his birthright and neither the Congress nor the States can justly or lawfully take it from him.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Globe'' 39.1 (1866) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=071/llcg071.db&amp;recNum=332 p. 1291]. Stated again during a House debate in 1872; cf. ''Congressional Globe'' 42.2 (1872), [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=104/llcg104.db&amp;recNum=106 p. 2791].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edward Bates also held to the belief that "natural born" should be interpreted as "born in the United States". He also indicated that those born in the United States to alien parents, even if they reside elsewhere, are still considered natural born. In 1862, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] sent a query to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edward Bates]] asking whether or not "colored men" can be citizens of the United States. The question arose because the Coast Guard had detained a schooner commanded by a free "colored man" who claimed he was a citizen of the United States. If he were a U.S. citizen the boat could be released, but otherwise—the Civil War then being fought—it would be confiscated. No information about the man's birth or parentage was provided. Bates responded on November 29, 1862, with a 27-page opinion — considered of such importance that the government published it not only in the official volumes of Attorney-General opinions but also as a separate booklet&lt;ref&gt;10 Opinions of the U.S. Atty.Gen. [pages] 382–413, and separately as ''Opinion of Attorney General Bates on Citizenship'' (1863, Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office) 27 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; — concluding,

&lt;blockquote&gt; I conclude that the ''free man of color'', mentioned in your letter, if born in the ''United States'', is a citizen of the United States. [italics in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of that opinion, Bates commented at some length on the nature of [[citizenship]], and wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... our constitution, in speaking of ''natural born citizens'', uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle, common to all nations, and as old as political society, that the people born in a country do constitute the nation, and, as individuals, are ''natural'' members of the body politic. [italics in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another opinion, dated September 1, 1862,&lt;ref&gt;"Citizenship of children born in the United States of alien parents", 10 Op. US Atty-Gen. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Bates dealt with a question from the Secretary of State, of whether a person born in the U.S. to two non-citizens, who is taken with them back to their country, could, years later, re-enter the United States as of right, as a U.S. citizen. Bates wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United States of alien parents, who have never been naturalized, are native-born citizens of the United States, and, of course, do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship. I might sustain this opinion by a reference to the well-settled principle of the common law of England on this subject; to the writings of many of the earlier and later commentators on our Constitution and laws; ... and lastly to the dicta and decisions of many of our national and state tribunals. But all this has been well done by Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, in the case of ''Lynch vs. Clarke'', and I forbear. I refer to his opinion for a full and clear statement of the principle, and of the reasons and authorities for its support. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike Edward Bates, U.S. Secretary of State [[William Learned Marcy]] was equivocal about whether those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens. In 1854 Marcy wrote [[John Y. Mason]], the U.S. Minister to France:&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Marcy to Mason, June 6, 1854, quoted from the manuscript, reprinted (with the emphasis shown) in John Bassett Moore, ''A Digest of International Law'' [''of the United States''], vol. 3, sec. 373, pp. 276–277 (US House of Representatives, 56th Congress, 2d Session, Document no. 551; Washington, DC, Govt. Printing Office, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In reply to the inquiry ... whether "the children of foreign parents ''born in the United States'', but brought to the country of which the father is a subject, and continuing to reside within the jurisdiction of their father's country, are entitled to protection as citizens of the United States", I have to observe that it is presumed that, according to the common law, any person born in the United States, unless he be born in one of the foreign legations therein, may be considered a citizen thereof until he formally renounces his citizenship. There is not, however any United States statute containing a provision upon this subject, nor, so far as I am aware, has there been any judicial decision in regard to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]], however, shared Edward Bates' opinion that those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens, and he added that they should be entitled to be president of the United States, if elected. In 1875 Pierrepont was presented with a query from the Secretary of State, [[Hamilton Fish]]. A young man, named Arthur Steinkauler,&lt;ref&gt;His first name is not given in the Opinion itself but is found in the correspondence seeking the opinion, in ''Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States''  (US House of Representatives, 44th Congress, 1st Session, December 6, 1875) Exec. Doct. 1, part 1, page 563.&lt;/ref&gt; had been born in Missouri in 1855, a year after his father was naturalized a U.S. citizen. When he was four years old, his father returned to Germany with him and both had stayed there ever since. The father had [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquished his U.S. citizenship]] and the young man was now 20 years old and about to be drafted into the Imperial German army. The question was asked "What was this young man's situation as a native-born American citizen?" After studying the relevant legal authorities, Pierrepont wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Steinkauler's Case'', 15 Opinions of the US Attorneys-General 15 at 17–18 (June 26, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the treaty [of 1868 with Germany], and in harmony with American doctrine, it is clear that Steinkauler the father abandoned his naturalization in America and became a German subject (his son being yet a minor), and that by virtue of German laws the son acquired German nationality. It is equally clear that the son, by birth, has American nationality, and hence he has two nationalities, one natural, the other acquired ... Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. There is no law of the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright. He can return to America at the age of 21, and in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States. ... I am of opinion that when he reaches the age of 21 years he can then elect whether he will return and take the nationality of his birth, with its duties and privileges, or retain the nationality acquired by the act of his father.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 1900s ====
Frederick van Dyne, the Assistant Solicitor of the U.S. Department of State (1900–1907) indicated that children of citizens born outside the United States are also considered citizens. In 1904, he published a textbook, ''Citizenship of the United States'', in which he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;van Dyne, Frederick, ''Citizenship of the United States'' (1904, Rochester, NY, Lawyers Co-operative Publ'g Co.) pp. 3–12. With regard to the last sentence in the quotation, van Dyne discusses some peripheral court decisions, none dealing with conventional U.S. citizenship, but with the nationality of the child of a foreigner and a member of an independent American Indian tribe whose members were not ordinarily regarded as U.S. citizens.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no uniform rule of international law covering the subject of citizenship. Every nation determines for itself who shall, and who shall not, be its citizens. ... By the law of the United States, citizenship depends, generally, on the place of birth; nevertheless the children of citizens, born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, are also citizens. ... The Constitution of the United States, while it recognized citizenship of the United States in prescribing the qualifications of the President, Senators, and Representatives, contained no definition of citizenship until the adoption of the 14th Amendment, in 1868; nor did Congress attempt to define it until the passage of the civil rights act, in 1866. ... Prior to this time the subject of citizenship by birth was generally held to be regulated by the common law, by which all persons born within the limits and allegiance of the United States were deemed natural-born citizens.

It appears to have been assumed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of ''Murray v. The Charming Betsy'' (1804) 2 Cranch (6 U.S.) 64, 119, 2 L.Ed. 208, 226, that all persons born in the United States were citizens thereof. ... In ''M'Creery v. Somerville'' (1824) 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 354, 6 L.Ed. 109, which concerned the title to land in the state of Maryland, it was assumed that children born in that state to an alien were native-born citizens of the United States. ... The Federal courts have almost uniformly held that birth in the United States, of itself, confers citizenship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Academic interpretations===
==== 1800s ====
[[William Rawle]], formerly the U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania (1791–1799)  defined ''natural born citizen'' as every person born within the United States, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. In an 1825 treatise, ''A View of the Constitution of the United States of America'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The citizens of each state constituted the citizens of the United States when the Constitution was adopted. ... [He] who was subsequently born the citizen of a State, became at the moment of his birth a citizen of the United States. Therefore every person born within the United States, its territories or districts, whether the parents are citizens or aliens, is a natural born citizen in the sense of the Constitution, and entitled to all the rights and privileges appertaining to that capacity. ... Under our Constitution the question is settled by its express language, and when we are informed ... no person is eligible to the office of President unless he is a natural born citizen, the principle that the place of birth creates the relative quality is established as to us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = A View of the Constitution of the United States of America | last=Rawle| first=William| publisher = Philadelphia, Carey &amp; Lea|year =1825 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=akEbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=every+person+born+within+the+United+States,+its+territories+and+districts,+whether+the+parents+are+citizens+or+aliens,+is+a+natural+born+citizen+in+the+sense+of+the+Constitution,+and+entitled+to+all+the+rights+and+privileges+appertaining+to+that+capacity+A+View+of+the+Constitution+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcxFT7XUH_HUiAKy_Jn5CA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 80–81]| isbn=978-1144771858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James F. Wilson]] agreed with Rawle's opinion, but added the exclusion of visiting foreign diplomats. During an 1866 House debate, he quoted Rawle's opinion, and also referred to the "general law relating to subjects and citizens recognized by all nations", saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and that must lead us to the conclusion that every person born in the United States is a natural-born citizen of such States, except it may be that children born on our soil to temporary sojourners or representatives of foreign Governments, are native-born citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Wilson in: ''Congressional Globe'', House of Representatives, 39th Congress, 1st Session, Washington 1866, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=071/llcg071.db&amp;recNum=158 p. 1117].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supreme Court Justice [[Peter Vivian Daniel]] disagreed with this position and considered ''natural born citizen'' as every person born of citizen parents within the United States. In 1857, in a concurring opinion in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Dred Scott v. Sandford|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/60/393/case.html#476|date=1857|vol=60|reporter=U.S.|opinion=393|pinpoint=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; he quoted an English-language translation of [[Emerich de Vattel]]'s 1758 treatise ''[[The Law of Nations]]'' (''Le Droit des gens''), stating that "The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2246#lfVattel_label_1644 Book 1, § 212]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was quoted again in 1898 by Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] in his dissenting opinion in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=United States v. Wong Kim Ark|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/169/649/case.html#708|date=1898|vol=169|reporter=U.S.|opinion=649|pinpoint=708|court=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two paragraphs later, Justice Vattel disagrees and states, "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2246#lfVattel_label_1646 § 214.] ... there are states, as, for instance, England, where the single circumstance of being born in the country naturalizes the children of a foreigner."

[[Joseph Story]], an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, believed that the term ''native citizen'' is synonymous with natural born citizen, though he does not define either term. In his 1840 guidebook to the Constitution, ''A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States'', about the natural-born-citizen clause he wrote "It is not too much to say that no one, but a native citizen, ought ordinarily to be [e]ntrusted with an office so vital to the safety and liberties of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Story|title=A familiar exposition of the Constitution of the United States: containing a brief commentary on every clause, explaining the true nature, reasons, and objects thereof: designed for the use of school libraries and general readers: with an appendix, containing important public documents, illustrative of the Constitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aew9AAAAIAAJ|year=1840|publisher=Marsh, Capen, Lyon and Webb|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aew9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 167] §269–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same wording also appeared in his 1834 work ''The constitutional class book: being a brief exposition of the Constitution of the United States: Designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Story|title=The constitutional class book: being a brief exposition of the Constitution of the United States: Designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCkTAAAAYAAJ|year=1834|publisher=Hilliard, Gray &amp; Company|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DCkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115 115] §190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Porter Morse, the lawyer who represented Louisiana in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=163&amp;invol=537 ''Plessy v. Ferguson''], 163 U.S. 537 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; considered this connection between ''native born'' and ''natural born'' to signify that only a child of citizens should be allowed to run for President. In the ''Albany Law Journal'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was intended that anybody who was a citizen by birth should be eligible, it would only have been necessary to say, "no person, except a native-born citizen"; but the framers thought it wise, in view of the probable influx of European immigration, to provide that the president should at least be the child of citizens owing allegiance to the United States at the time of his birth. It may be observed in passing that the current phrase "native-born citizen" is well understood; but it is [[pleonasm]] and should be discarded; and the correct designation, "native citizen" should be substituted in all constitutional and statutory enactments, in judicial decisions and in legal discussions where accuracy and precise language are essential to intelligent discussion.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Morse, "Natural-Born Citizen of the United States: Eligibility for the Office of President", ''Albany Law Journal'', vol. 66 (1904–1905)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 2000s ====
''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (9th Edition) defines "Natural Born Citizen" as "A person born within the jurisdiction of a national government".

===== Foreign soil and territories =====

In 2000, the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS), in [[Congressional Research Service reports|one of its reports]], wrote that most constitutional scholars interpret the natural-born-citizen clause to include citizens born outside the United States to parents who are U.S. citizens. This same CRS report also asserts that citizens born in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], are legally defined as "natural born" citizens and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf|title = Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer|accessdate =January 8, 2010|date = April 17, 2000|publisher = [[Congressional Research Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opinion was reaffirmed in a 2009 CRS report, which stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Considering the history of the constitutional qualifications provision, the common use and meaning of the phrase "natural-born subject" in England and in the Colonies in the 1700s, the clause's apparent intent, the subsequent action of the first Congress in enacting the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] (expressly defining the term "natural born citizen" to include a person born abroad to parents who are United States citizens), as well as subsequent Supreme Court dicta, it appears that the most logical inferences would indicate that the phrase "natural born Citizen" would mean a person who is entitled to [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship "at birth" or "by birth"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/41197555/41131059-MoC-Memo-What-to-Tell-Your-Constituents-in-Answer-to-Obama-Eligibility|title=41131059 MoC Memo What to Tell Your Constituents in Answer to Obama Eligibility - United States Nationality Law - United States Constitution|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interpretation of natural born being the equivalent of a citizen at birth was repeated in a 2011 CRS report and a 2016 CRS report. The 2011 report stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term "natural born" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship "by birth" or "at birth," either by being born "in" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship "at birth". Such term, however, would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth, and who was thus born an "alien" required to go through the legal process of "naturalization" to become a U.S. citizen.&lt;ref name="2011 CRS" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2016 report similarly stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the eligibility of U.S. born citizens has been settled law for more than a century, there have been legitimate legal issues raised concerning those born ''outside'' of the country to U.S. citizens. From historical material and case law, it appears that the common understanding of the term "natural born" in England and in the American colonies in the 1700s included both the strict common law meaning as born in the territory (''jus soli''), as well as the ''statutory'' laws adopted in England since at least 1350, which included children born abroad to British fathers (''jus sanguinis'', the law of descent). Legal scholars in the field of citizenship have asserted that this common understanding and legal meaning in England and in the American colonies was incorporated into the usage and intent of the term in the U.S. Constitution to include those who are citizens at birth.&lt;ref name="CRS2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/295658863/Qualifications-for-President-and-the-Natural-Born-Citizenship-Eligibility-Requirement-Congressional-Research-Service-R42097-2016| title=Qualifications for President and the "Natural Born" Citizenship Eligibility Requirement| publisher =[[Congressional Research Service]] |author =Maskell, Jack | date=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|chin opinion}}[[Gabriel J.

In 2009, G.

{{anchor|mcmanamon opinion}}Unlike Chin and White, Mary McManamon, Professor of Law at [[Widener University School of Law]], has argued in the ''Catholic University Law Review'' that, aside from children born to foreign ambassadors or to hostile soldiers on U.S. territory, both of whom owe allegiance to a different sovereign, a natural born citizen must be born in the United States. She claims that [[common law]] provides an exception for the children of U.S. ambassadors born abroad and the children of American soldiers while engaged in hostilities. Thus, with these two limited exceptions, she equates "natural born" with "native born".&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;McManamon, Mary (2015), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2600163_code940398.pdf?abstractid=2444766&amp;mirid=5 "The Natural Born Citizens Clause as Originally Understood"], 64 Catholic University Law Review 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/law-professor-ted-cruz-is-not-eligible-to-be-president-2016-1|title=Law professor: Ted Cruz is not eligible to be president|date=January 12, 2016|first=Mary Brigid|last=McManamon|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Einer Elhauge of [[Harvard Law School]] agrees with Professor McManamon that "natural born" means "native born" and therefore the wording of the Constitution "does not permit his [[Ted Cruz|{{bracket|Ted Cruz's}}]] candidacy," referring to a candidate who was born in [[Canada]] to one U.S. citizen parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/7/71/1265855/opinion-cruz-really-natural-born-american|title=Opinion: Cruz not really 'natural born citizen'|date=January 20, 2016|first=Einer|last=Elhauge|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Robert Clinton at the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] at [[Arizona State University]] is also of the opinion that "natural born citizen" means "born in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-01-27/ted-cruz-is-not-a-natural-born-citizen-according-to-the-constitution|title=Ted Cruz Is Not A 'Natural Born' Citizen|date=January 27, 2016|first=Robert|last=Clinton|work=''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''|access-date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Chicago]] Professor [[Eric Posner]] also concludes that "natural born citizen" means a "person born in the (United States)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2016/02/trump_is_right_ted_cruz_is_not_eligible_to_be_president.html|title = Ted Cruz Is Not Eligible to Be President|first = Eric|last = Posner|date = February 8, 2016|work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Chief Justice of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], [[Sol Wachtler]], concludes the same.&lt;ref name="Wachtler"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/ted-cruz-ineligible-to-be-president-according-to-history-1.11466068|title=Constitutional history shows Cruz ineligible for White House|first=Sol|last=Wachtler|date=February 13, 2016|work=[[Newsday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their conclusion is consistent with the position that the eighteenth century legal usage of the term "shall be considered as natural born" in the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] merely naturalized persons or granted them limited rights of the natural born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Vlahoplus|first=John|date=April 5, 2017|url=http://wakeforestlawreview.com/2017/04/on-the-meaning-of-considered-as-natural-born/ |title=On the Meaning of "Considered as Natural Born"|publisher=Wake Forest L.

=====American soil=====
There is consensus among academics that those born on American soil, except children born to foreign ambassadors or to hostile soldiers on U.S. territory, both of whom owe allegiance to a different sovereign, are natural born citizens, or ''[[jus soli]]'', regardless of parental citizenship status.

In a 2008 article published by the ''Michigan Law Review'', Lawrence Solum, Professor of Law at the University of Illinois, stated that "there is general agreement on the core of [the] meaning [of the Presidential Eligibility Clause]. Anyone born on American soil whose parents are citizens of the United States is a 'natural born citizen{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Solum, Lawrence B. (2008), [http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/fi/107/solum.pdf "Originalism and the natural born citizen clause"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204020457/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/fi/107/solum.pdf |date=February 4, 2011 }}, 107 Mich. L. Rev. First Impressions 22&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Solum republished the same article as an online draft, in which he clarified his original statement so that it would not be misunderstood as excluding the children of one citizen parent. In a footnote he explained, "based on my reading of the historical sources, there is no credible case that a person born on American soil with one American parent was clearly not a 'natural born citizen'." He further extended natural born citizenship to all cases of ''[[jus soli]]'' as the "conventional view".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence B. Solum, "Originalism and the natural born citizen clause", [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1263885&amp;amp revised draft version, April 18, 2010 (SSRN)], p. 1, n. 3. However, other passages of his revised draft still imply U.S. citizenship of both parents; cf. i.a. pp. 3, 9, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Solum stated elsewhere that the two-citizen-parents arguments were not "crazy", he believes "the much stronger argument suggests that if you were born on American soil that you would be considered a natural born citizen."&lt;ref name="TampaTimes20111020"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/birthers-ask-is-marco-rubio-eligible-to-be-president/1197628|title=Birthers say Marco Rubio is not eligible to be president|first=Alex|last=Leary|date=October 20, 2011|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|access-date=October 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021060422/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/birthers-ask-is-marco-rubio-eligible-to-be-president/1197628|archive-date=October 21, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Rotunda]], Professor of Law at Chapman University, has remarked "There's [''sic''] some people who say that both parents need to be citizens. That's never been the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2010/09/orly_taitz_embarrasses_chapman.php|title=Chapman Constitutional Scholar Rebuffs Orly Taitz's Overtures|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=September 22, 2010|work=OC Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polly Price, Professor of Law at Emory University, has commented "It's a little confusing, but most scholars think it's a pretty unusual position for anyone to think the natural born citizen clause would exclude someone born in the U.S."&lt;ref name="TampaTimes20111020" /&gt;

Chin concurred with that assessment, stating, "there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's really eligible to be president?|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-20/opinion/chin.natural.born_1_natural-law-united-states-and-subject-citizenship-clause?_s=PM:OPINION|first=Gabriel|last=Chin|publisher=CNN|date=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Eugene Volokh]], Professor of Law at UCLA, found "quite persuasive" the reasoning employed by the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]], which had concluded "that persons born within the borders of the United States are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of the citizenship of their parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indiana Court of Appeals Rejects Claim That 'Because His Father Was a Citizen of the United Kingdom, President Obama Is Not a Natural Born Citizen and Therefore Constitutionally Ineligible to Assume the Office of the President'|url=http://volokh.com/2009/11/18/plaintiffs-posit-that-because-his-father-was-a-citizen-of-the-united-kingdom-president-obama-cant-be-a-natural-born-citizen/|date=November 18, 2009|first=Eugene|last=Volokh|authorlink=Eugene Volokh|work=The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholar.google.com"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Ankeny v.

Daniel Tokaji, Professor of Law at Ohio State University, agrees the citizenship status of a U.S.-born candidate's parents is irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-press.com/article/20110920/NEWS0107/110918016/Exclusive-Now-birthers-eye-Marco-Rubio|title=Exclusive: Now, 'birthers' have eye on Marco Rubio|work=News-Press|date=September 20, 2010|first=Bob|last=Rathgeber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Implied repeal of the natural-born citizen clause=====
In a 2006 John Marshall Law Review article, Paul A. Clark argues that the Fifth Amendment should be read as implicitly repealing the requirement that the U.S. President needs to be a natural-born U.S. citizen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=lawreview&lt;/ref&gt; Clark points out that, starting from the 1954 case [[Bolling v. Sharpe]], courts have held that the Fifth Amendment contains an implicit equal protection clause whose scope is identical to the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and that federal discrimination against naturalized U.S. citizens (or, more specifically, federal discrimination based on national origin) would be struck down by the courts as being in violation of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Since the requirement that the U.S. President needs to be a natural-born U.S. citizen is a form of discrimination based on national origin, Clark argues that the courts should strike down this requirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

So far, Clark's argument in regards to this has not attracted wide support among the U.S. legal academy (though Professor [[Josh Blackman]] asked a question about a similar topic in 2015--specifically about the Fourteenth Amendment nullifying the natural-born citizen clause).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n74z2wx|title=Empowering Our Children to Dream without Limitations: A Call to Revisit the "Natural Born Citizen" Requirement in the Obama Era|journal=Chicana/o Latina/o Law Review|volume=29|issue=1|year=2010|last=Pease-Wingenter|first=Claudine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshblackman.com/blog/2015/03/24/did-the-14th-amendment-1868-nullify-the-natural-born-citizen-clause-1789/ |title=Did the 14th Amendment (1868) Nullify the “Natural Born Citizen” Clause (1789)? |publisher=Joshblackman.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility challenges==
Several courts have ruled that private citizens do not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the eligibility of candidates to appear on a presidential election [[ballot]].&lt;ref name="standing"&gt;E.g. see ''Robinson v. Bowen'', 567 [[Federal Supplement|F. Supp. 2d]] 1144 ([[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|N.D. Cal.]] 2008); ''Hollander v. [[John McCain|McCain]]'', 2008[[WestLaw|WL]]2853250 ([[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire|D.N.H.]] 2008); ''[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv04083/281573/20/ Berg v. Obama]'', 08-04083 ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|E.D. Pa.]] 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, there is a statutory method by which the eligibility of the [[president-elect of the United States]] to take office may be challenged in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{usc-title-chap|3|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal scholars assert that, even if eligibility challenges are nonjusticiable in federal courts, and are not undertaken in Congress, there are other avenues for adjudication, such as an action in state court in regard to ballot access.&lt;ref name="Tokaji" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

Every president to date was either a citizen at the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 or born in the United States; of the former group, all except one had two parents with citizenship in what would become the U.S. ([[Andrew Jackson]]). Of those in the latter group, every president except two ([[Chester A. Arthur]] and [[Barack Obama]]) had two U.S.-citizen parents. Further, four additional U.S. Presidents had one or both of his U.S.-citizen parents not born on U.S. soil (James Buchanan, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover and Donald Trump).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Law.justia.com_January_16_2016c"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pilon&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump's Immigrant Mother|first=Mary|last=Pilon|date=June 24, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trumps-immigrant-mother}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some presidential candidates were not born in a [[States of the United States|U.S. state]] or lacked two U.S.-citizen parents.&lt;ref name=nyt2008-02-28&gt;{{cite news |title=McCain’s Canal Zone Birth Prompts Queries About Whether That Rules Him Out |author=Carl Hulse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/us/politics/28mccain.htm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one U.S. vice president ([[Al Gore]]) was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and another ([[Charles Curtis]]) was born in the [[Kansas Territory]].

===1800s===

====Chester A. Arthur====
[[Chester A. Arthur]], who was sworn in as president when [[James A. Garfield]] died after [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|being shot,]] was rumored to have been born in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-07-29-voa79.cfm "Who Can Be President?"], Voice of America News (July 29, 2008). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220103402/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-07-29-voa79.cfm |date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chester A. Arthur was born in [[Vermont]] on October 5, 1829 to a Vermont-born mother and a father from [[Ireland]] (who later became a U.S. citizen, 14 years after Chester A. Arthur was born). His mother, Malvina Stone Arthur, was a native of [[Berkshire, Vermont|Berkshire]], Vermont, who moved with her family to [[Quebec]], where she met and married the future president's father, William Arthur, on April 12, 1821. After the family had settled in [[Fairfield, Vermont|Fairfield]], Vermont, somewhere between 1822 and 1824, William Arthur traveled with his eldest daughter to East Stanbridge, Canada, in October 1830 and commuted to Fairfield on Sundays to preach. "It appears that he traveled regularly between the two villages, both of which were close to the Canada–US border, for about eighteen months, holding two jobs",&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Thomas C. "The Mystery of Chester Alan Arthur's Birthplace", ''Vermont History'' 38, Montpelier: Vermont Historical Society, p.&amp;nbsp;295&lt;/ref&gt; which may well explain the confusion about Chester A. Arthur's place of birth, as perhaps did the fact that he was born in [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]], and thus within a day's walk of the Vermont–Quebec border.&lt;ref&gt;DeGregorio, William A. ''The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents'', [[Random House]]: 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;307–08, {{ISBN|0-517-08244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chester A. Arthur himself added a bit of confusion into the record by sometimes reporting his birth year as 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Reeves, ''Gentleman Boss. The Life and Times of Chester Alan Arthur'' (Newtown &lt;!--publisher?--&gt;1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

No evidence of his having been born in Canada was ever demonstrated by his Democratic opponents, although Arthur Hinman, an attorney who had investigated Chester A. Arthur's family history, raised the allegation as an objection during his vice-presidential campaign and, after the end of his presidency, published a book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hinman |first=Arthur P. |title=How a British Subject became President of the United States |year=1884 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/18450082/Arthur-Hinman-How-a-British-Subject-Became-President-of-the-United-States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christopher Schürmann====
Christopher Schürmann (born in [[New York City]]) entered the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Labor]] primaries during the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]]. His eligibility was questioned in a ''[[New York Tribune]]'' article, because he was born to parents of German nationality. It was stated that "various Attorney-Generals [''sic''] of the United States have expressed the opinion that a child born in this country of alien parents, who have not been naturalized, is, by the fact of birth, a native-born citizen entitled to all rights and privileges as such." But due to a lack of any statute on the subject, Schürmann's eligibility was "at best an open question, and one which should have made [his] nomination under any circumstances an impossibility", because questions concerning his eligibility could have been raised after the election.&lt;ref&gt;"Is Mr. Schürmann eligible?", ''New York Tribune'', October 2, 1896, in: Anonymous (ed.), ''The Presidential Campaign of 1896. A Scrap-Book Chronicle'', New York 1925: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, [https://archive.org/stream/presidentialcam00catlgoog#page/n140/mode/2up p. 130 sq.] (''Note'': The year of publication is given as 1888, though the election was eight years later. However, the author's introduction is dated 1925.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900s===

====Charles Evans Hughes====
The eligibility of [[Charles Evans Hughes]] was questioned in an article written by [[Breckinridge Long]], one of Woodrow Wilson's campaign workers, and published on December 7, 1916 in the ''Chicago Legal News'' — a full month ''after'' the [[U.S. presidential election, 1916|U.S. presidential election of 1916]], in which Hughes was narrowly defeated by [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Long claimed that Hughes was ineligible because his father was not yet naturalized at the time of his birth and was still a British citizen (in fact, both his parents were British citizens and never became U.S. citizens). Observing that Hughes, although born in the United States, was also (according to British law) a British subject and therefore "enjoy[ed] a dual nationality and owe[d] a double allegiance", Long argued that a ''native born'' citizen was not ''natural born'' without a unity of U.S. citizenship and allegiance and stated: "Now if, by any possible construction, a person at the instant of birth, and for any period of time thereafter, owes, or may owe, allegiance to any sovereign but the United States, he is not a 'natural-born' citizen of the United States." &lt;ref&gt;Breckinridge Long (1916), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/29744612/Breckinridge-Long-A-Natural-Born-Citizen-Within "Is Mr. Charles Evans Hughes a 'Natural Born Citizen' within the Meaning of the Constitution?"], ''Chicago Legal News'' vol. 49, pp.&amp;nbsp;146–148 (December 7, 1916). It does not appear that this issue was raised ''before'' the election day, which may indicate that the majority of voters or of legal authorities felt it was not an impediment to Hughes's eligibility.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barry Goldwater====
[[Barry Goldwater]] was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], in what was then the incorporated [[Arizona Territory]] of the United States. During his presidential campaign in 1964, there was a minor controversy over Goldwater's having been born in Arizona three years before it became a state.&lt;ref name="VOA" /&gt;

====George Romney====
[[George W. Romney]], who ran for the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican party]] presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], was born in [[Mexico]] to U.S. parents.&lt;ref name="Lipsky"&gt;Lipsky, Seth (2009).

However Romney's parents (monogamous under [[1890 Manifesto|new church doctrine]]) retained their U.S. citizenship and returned to the United States with him and his siblings in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/archive/junkie070998.htm|publisher=Washington Post|author=Ken Rudin |title=Citizen McCain's Panama Problem?|date=July 9, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romney's eligibility for President became [[mootness|moot]] when [[Richard Nixon]] was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate.

====Lowell Weicker====
[[Lowell P.

These views have been criticized by Chin, who argues that McCain was at birth a citizen of Panama and was only retroactively declared a born citizen under {{USC|8|1403}}, because at the time of his birth and with regard to the Canal Zone the Supreme Court's [[Insular Cases]] overruled the [[Naturalization Act of 1795]], which would otherwise have declared McCain a U.S. citizen immediately at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Gabriel J.

====Barack Obama====

[[Barack Obama]] was born in 1961 in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] (which had become a U.S. state in 1959). His mother was a U.S. citizen and his father was a [[British subject]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama's Kenyan Citizenship?|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/08/obamas-kenyan-citizenship/|date=September 3, 2009|publisher=FactCheck.org|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=British Nationality Act 1948|title=British nationality by virtue of citizenship|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/56/part/I/enacted|publisher=Her Majesty's Government|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/ukandcolonies?view=Binary|title=UK and Colonies|publisher=[[Home Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[British Kenya]].

Before and after the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], arguments were made that Obama was not a natural-born citizen. On June 12, 2008, the Obama presidential campaign launched a website to counter what it described as a [[smear campaign]] by his opponents, including [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories challenging his eligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate |title=The Truth About Barack's Birth Certificate (archived web cache) |publisher=Fight the Smears (Obama for America) |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922222958/http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |df= }} (Retrieved March 9, 2011), quoting in excerpts from: {{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html |title=Does Barack Obama have Kenyan citizenship? |publisher=FactCheck.org (Annenberg Foundation) |date=August 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210091436/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |df= }}; see also: {{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5juMJpMhCS5TDzEF2Ds-frHSuHQLQ |title=Obama hits back at Internet slanders |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=June 12, 2008 }}; in a written oath to the State of Arizona, Obama further stated that he is a natural-born citizen (cf. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/11107727/Barack-Obama-Presidential-Candidate-Nomination-Paper-State-of-Arizona-2009 Candidate Nomination Paper], ''State of Arizona'', November 30, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent issue raised against Obama was the claim made in [[Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation|several lawsuits]] that he was not actually born in [[Hawaii]]. The Supreme Court declined without comment to hear two lawsuits in which the plaintiffs argued it was irrelevant whether Obama was born in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;''Leo C. Donofrio v. Nina Mitchell Wells'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08a407.htm SCOTUS 08A407]) and ''Cort Wrotnowski v. Susan Bysiewicz'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08a469.htm SCOTUS 08A469])&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the cases were dismissed because of the plaintiff's lack of standing; however, several courts have given guidance on the question.

In ''Ankeny v. Governor'', a three-member Indiana Court of Appeals stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Based upon the language of Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 and the guidance provided by ''Wong Kim Ark'', we conclude that persons born within the borders of the United States are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of the citizenship of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/22488868/ANKENY-v-GOVERNOR-OF-THE-STATE-OF-INDIANA-APPEALS-COURT-OPINION-11120903 ''Ankeny v.

[[Administrative law|Administrative Law]] Judge Michael Malihi in Georgia decided a group of eligibility challenge cases by saying, "The Indiana Court rejected the argument that Mr. Obama was ineligible, stating that the children born within the United States are natural born citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. ...

On October 31, 2008, Hawaii Health Director Chiyome Fukino issued a statement saying,

===Potential presidential candidates who are not eligible===

====Arnold Schwarzenegger====

[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was reported as considering challenging the prevailing interpretation of the clause. In 2003, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] unsuccessfully put forth the [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]], intending to allow eligibility for Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref name="usa120204" /&gt; In October 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schwarzenegger—who is originally from Austria and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983, also retaining Austrian citizenship—was exploring a future run for the American presidency. He reportedly lobbied legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. [[Cornell University]] law professor [[Michael C. Dorf]] observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, "The law is very clear, but it’s not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arnold lobbies for White House run|author=Smith, Emily|url=http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/|newspaper=New York Post|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger subsequently denied that he was running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-denies-hes-aiming-for-president|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=Schwarzenegger denies he’s aiming for president|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9668">The '''Neutral Zone of Junik''' (1921&amp;ndash;1923) was a neutral demilitarized border area between the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Principality of Albania]].

==History==
===Establishment===
The neutral area was established in November 1921 by the authority of the [[League of Nations]] following border disputes between the two countries and the frequent military intrusion from the Yugoslav side since 1918 into the Albanian side as well as continuous skirmish between the Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslavian army.&lt;ref name="Prifti"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBq5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=neutral+zone+of+Junik&amp;dq=neutral+zone+of+Junik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=booDU8DXINLJsQS63YHwDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw| page=163| author=Kristaq Prifti (Instituti i Historisë - Akademia e Shkencave e RSH)| title=The truth on Kosova|publisher=Encyclopaedia Publishing House| year=1993|oclc= 30135036| quote=The intervention of the League of Nations brought about the formation of a "neutral zone" of Junik in November 1921. Within the creating of the "neutral zone" of Junik, the military reduced the intensity of its actions...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area included a couple of villages around [[Junik]] and the Highlands of [[Djakovica]] along the [[Kosovo]] border with Albania (back then part of the Prefecture of Kosovo). The zone consisted of the villages Junik, Mulliq/Molić, Batushë/Batusa, Brovinë/Brovina, Ponoshec/Ponosevac, [[Babaj Boks|Babaj i Bokës/Babaj Boks]], Popoc/Popovc, Shishman/Šišman, and [[Koshare, Kosovo|Koshare/Košare]].&lt;ref name="Tahiri1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/files/Histori/histori/bedri_tahiri_hasan_prishtina_truri_i_levizjes_2.8.08.htm| publisher=Pashtriku.de| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-18| title=Hasan Prishtina, truri i levizjes kombetare shqiptare (1908- 1933)| author= Bedri Tahiri| location=Prishtina|date=2008-08-02 |quote=Ky territor i lirë përfshinte këto fshatra: Junik, Mulliq, Batushë, Brovinë, Ponoshec, Bobaj- Boks, Popoc, Shishman e Koshare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside Junik, the rest correspond today to border villages of the [[District of Gjakova]]. 

===Ongoing===
The area was practically autonomous, ruled by local [[bayraktar]]s and the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]] only.&lt;ref name="Tahiri2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/files/Histori/histori/bedri_tahiri_hasan_prishtina_truri_i_levizjes_2.8.08.htm| publisher=Pashtriku.de| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-18| title=Hasan Prishtina, truri i levizjes kombetare shqiptare (1908- 1933)| author= Bedri Tahiri| location=Prishtina|date=2008-08-02 |quote=Në të u vendos pushteti nga ana e popullit vendës, nga shqiptarët dhe gëzonte autonomi të plotë.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Despite the intention, the area served as a buffer zone for the [[kachak]] guerrillas and was a starting point for consecutive Albanian rebellions organized from 1921 to 1924 in Kosovo. Many ''chetas'' settled around Junik and launched offensives against the Serbian armies starting from there.&lt;ref name="Banac"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=neutral+area+of+Junik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VYVfkiifpI&amp;sig=oTFDUK4thbIdbS2BMvKGaMRlesU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GEBU4ChNObr0gHI04GYBw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=neutral%20area%20of%20Junik&amp;f=false| author=Ivo Banac| page=305|publisher=Cornell University Press| title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics|year=1988| isbn=978-0801494932| quote=...within the neutral frontier zone toward Yugoslavia, where, notably at Junik, the KK and Bejta had their basis.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azem Galica]] and his man settled there, and a little later even [[Hasan Prishtina]] joined.&lt;ref name="Tahiri3"&gt;{{citation|url=http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/files/Histori/histori/bedri_tahiri_hasan_prishtina_truri_i_levizjes_2.8.08.htm| publisher=Pashtriku.de| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-18| title=Hasan Prishtina, truri i levizjes kombetare shqiptare (1908- 1933)| author= Bedri Tahiri| location=Prishtina|date=2008-08-02 |quote=Si shumica e çetave kaçake, edhe Çeta e Azemit kaloi atje.

The Committee of Kosovo leaders as Hasan Prishtina, [[Bajram Curri|Bajram]] and [[Hysni Curri]], and Azem Galica initiated more than once attacks against the Albanian armies and authorities stationed nearby. Two main ones were the [[Albanian Rebellion of 1922]],&lt;ref name="Banac3"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=neutral+area+of+Junik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VYVfkiifpI&amp;sig=oTFDUK4thbIdbS2BMvKGaMRlesU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GEBU4ChNObr0gHI04GYBw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=neutral%20area%20of%20Junik&amp;f=false| author=Ivo Banac| page=305| title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics| isbn=  978-0801494932| publisher=Cornell University Press  | year=1988| quote=In March 1922, Bajram Curri, Hasan Bej Prishtina, and Elez Jusufi, and important kacak leader, tried to overthrow the government in Tirana, but failed. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other tentative in January 1923. During the last attempt, [[Beqir Vokshi]], a former member of the Committee who was recently enlisted as an officer of the [[Albanian army]] got killed by Galica's men. Vokshi was trying to persuade the Junik population not to support the recent guerrillas attacks upon the [[Krumë]] and [[Tropojë]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8DG5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=beqir+vokshi&amp;dq=beqir+vokshi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pFUBU8fhBoy40QGg0oDoAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ| pages=194–197|title=Shota dhe Azem Galica|author=Ajet Haxhiu| publisher=Shtëpia Botuese "8 Nëntori"| year=1982| oclc= 255488782| quote=...më 14 shkurt 1921, kryetari i Komitetit, Hoxha Kadri Prishtina, njoftonte se lutja e Beqir Vokshit për dorëheqje si anëtar i qendrës së Komitetit pranohej...[on 14 February 1921, Hoxha Kadri Prishtina, announced that the resignation of Beqir Vokshi as a member of Committee Center was accepted...]&lt;br&gt;Shkaku i vrasjes eshte se Beqir Vokshi ne rastin e levizjes qe u be kunder Krumes kishte pase mberrite me e ndalu popullin e "Zones Neutrale" nga te marrunit pjese...[The motive of the assassination is that Beqir Vokshi in the case of the movement against Kruma had managed to stop the population of the "Neutral Zone" from participating...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaLiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=beqir+vokshi&amp;dq=beqir+vokshi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pFUBU8fhBoy40QGg0oDoAQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA| pages=232–233| title=Gjurmime Albanologjike |series=Seria e shkencave historike| issue=11| year=1982|publisher=Instituti Albanologjik i Prishtinës| location = Prishtina|oclc=1461456| issn=0436-0273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution===
In early January 1923, the rebels had taken an offensive over Tropojë, followed by a broader one on [[Has District]]. They had surrounded Krumë (center of the Prefecture of Kosovo), attacked the gendarme stations in [[Nikaj-Mërtur]] and arrived by the [[Drin river]]. The most severe fighting took place near Krumë town, which was attacked from two sides by the guerrillas of Azem Galica and [[Sadik Rama]].
&lt;br&gt;Following the events, Ahmet Zogu ordered a major offensive. After pushing the insurgents back to the Neutral Zone, in late January 1923 the Albanian army entered Junik. The Kachaks left the area and went inside Kosovo. Later, the area was handed over to the Yugoslavs, and a joint-border patrolling was established. The Yugoslav army burned down the houses which had served as kachak basis and executed around 60 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://kk.rks-gov.net/junik/files/images/pzhu-final_1.aspx| publisher=Municipality of Junik| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-18| page=22| quote=Si rezultat i rezistencës dhe luftërave kundër pushtuesit në dhjetor 1921 deri në shkurt 1923 u formua Zona Neutrale e Junikut, ku gjetën strehë dhe përkrahje shumë kryengritës dhe luftëtarë kundër pushtuesit serbo-malazez.

The '''''Oxcars''''' (stylized as '''''OXcars''''' or '''''oXcars''''') are a non-competitive awards ceremony held at Sala Apolo in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], in October each year. They are a public showcase that puts the spotlight on cultural creation and distribution carried out under the paradigms of shared culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= La gala de los oXcars exalta la circulación libre de la cultura |publisher=El País|url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/gala/oXcars/exalta/circulacion/libre/cultura/elpepucul/20081023elpcat_20/Tes |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Through presentations and symbolic mentions of works in a series of categories, real legal solutions are shown using parody as a strategy. The award categories include: Music, Animation, Theatre, Human Tools, Future Markets and Great Leftovers of Spanish Culture, among others .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xnet-x.net/proyectos/las-categorias-y-los-exponsors |title= Las categorías y los eXponsors|accessdate=7 March 2011|publisher=Xnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the Oxcars ==

The Oxcars are an awards ceremony organised by [[Xnet]] (previously eXgae, until November 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/29/navegante/1291045521.html |title=EXGAE cambia de nombre a'La EX' tras las amenazas de la SGAE |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |date=November 29, 2010 |publisher=El Mundo }}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organisation that explores alternative models for cultural diffusion and [[royalties]] management. In 2008 and 2009 the oXcars were organised with the collaboration of Conservas, and in 2010 with Conservas, Red Sostenible and Telenoika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xnet-x.net/english/the-oxcars/oxcars08/program/|title=Program|accessdate=March 7, 2011|publisher=oxcars10.xnet-x.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011182621/https://xnet-x.net/english/the-oxcars/oxcars08/program/|archivedate=October 11, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony is an overview of the most outstanding projects in the field of free/libre culture and knowledge, with live music, videos, brief presentations, performances and readings.
Since 2009, the oXcars have coincided with the [[Free Culture Forum|FCForum]], an international conference in which organisations and experts in the field of [[Free Culture Movement|free/libre culture]] and knowledge gather for the purpose of devising a global strategic framework and an international framework for coordination.

The High Court held that the [[Australian Constitution#The Judicature|judicial power of the Commonwealth]] could not be vested in a tribunal that also exercised non-judicial functions. It is a major case dealing with the [[separation of powers]] in [[Australian law]].

==Background==

===Separation of Powers===
{{main|Separation of powers in Australia}}

The High Court had consistently held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be exercised by any body except a court established under [[Chapter III Court|Chapter III]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] or a state court invested with federal jurisdiction. This was because the separation of judicial and other powers was a fundamental principle of the Constitution.{{refn|name=Wheat|{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1915|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915) |litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 54]}}: the Inter-State Commission could not exercise judicial power despite the words of section 101 of the Constitution,&lt;ref name=s101&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; because it was set up by the executive and violated the conditions for being a Chapter III court.}}{{refn|name=Alexander's case|{{cite AustLII|HCA|litigants=[[Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd]] |year=1918 |court=HCA |num=56 |parallelcite=
[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/56.pdf (1918) 25 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 434]}}: there was a distinction between judicial and arbitral functions, and the Arbitration Court could not exercise judicial powers of the Commonwealth because the President of the court was appointed for 7 years and not life as required by Chapter III of the Constitution.}}{{refn|name=British Imperial Oil|{{cite AustLII|HCA|4|1925|litigants=British Imperial Oil Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1925/4.pdf (1925) 35 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 422]}}: a power of appeal against an income tax assessment was part of the Judicial power of the Commonwealth which could not be conferred upon a Board of Appeal.}}{{refn|name=Silk Bros|{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1943|litigants=Silk Bros Pty Ltd v State Electricity Commission (Vict) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/2.pdf (1943) 37 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 1]}}: a power to determine applications by landlords for recovery of premises and providing for the enforcement of the Board's orders were an invalid attempt to confer judicial power on a body that was not a Federal Court.}}{{refn|name=R v Davison|{{cite AustLII|litigants=R v Davison |year=1954 |court=HCA |num=46 |parallelcite=[http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/1954/HCA/46 (1954) 90 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 353] [[File:Icons-mini-file_acrobat.gif]]}}: a registrar was not an officer of the Bankruptcy Court and a legislative attempt to confer upon a registrar the power of making a judicial order was therefore void.}}

The High Court had held that the separation of powers did not prevent a Federal court or Federal judge from discharging other functions.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1938|litigants=R v Federal Court of Bankruptcy; Ex parte Lowenstein |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1938) 59 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 556] at pp 564–566, 576 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|18|1943|litigants=Johnston Fear, &amp; Kingham &amp; the Offset Printing Co Pty Ltd v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/18.pdf (1943) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 314] a p 326 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1944|litigants=Rola Co (Australia) Pty Ltd v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1944/17.pdf (1944) 69 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 185] at p 210 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Latham (judge)|Latham]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]] stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus, in my opinion, it is not possible to rely upon any doctrine of absolute separation of powers for the purpose of establishing a universal proposition that no court or person who discharges Federal judicial functions can lawfully discharge any other function which has been entrusted to him by statute. This proposition, however, does not involve the further proposition that any powers or duties, of any description whatsoever, may be conferred or imposed upon Federal courts or Federal judges. If a power or duty were in its nature such as to be inconsistent with the co-existence of judicial power, it might well be held that a statutory provision purporting to confer or impose such a power or duty could not stand with the creation of the judicial tribunal or the appointment of a person to act as a member of it.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein"/&gt;{{rp|p 566–7}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The power of the Arbitration Court was contained in the [[Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904|''Conciliation and Arbitration Act'' 1904]] which relevantly provided that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
29. The Court shall have power-&lt;p&gt;
(b) to order compliance with an order or award proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been broken or not observed&lt;p&gt;
(c) by order, to enjoin an organization or person from committing or continuing a contravention of this Act or a breach or non-observance of an order or award;&lt;p&gt;
29A (1) The Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority, whether in relation to its judicial powers and functions or otherwise, as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|ccaaa1947101947422|Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1947}} amended by {{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|caaa21951181951319|Conciliation and Arbitration Act (No 2) 1951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Facts===

The Metal Trades Award was made by a conciliation commissioner on 16 January 1952 and included a prohibition on [[industrial action]] as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{ba) (i) No organization party to this award shall in any way, whether directly or indirectly be a party to or concerned in any ban, limitation or restriction upon the performance of work in accordance with this award.&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) An organization shall be deemed to commit a new and separate breach of the above sub-clause on each and every day in which it is directly or indirectly a party to such ban, limitation or restriction.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Trades Award'' (1952) 73 [[Commonwealth Arbitration Reports|CAR]] 325 at p 442 (16 January 1952) [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Members of the [[Federated Ironworkers Association]] (FIA) at the [[Morts Dock]] at Balmain, including FIA delegate [[Nick Origlass]], went on [[Strike action|strike]] from 16 February 1955 seeking an increase in pay of [[Australian pound|A£]]1 per week. Other workers were supporting the strikers by paying a levy of 8 [[shillings]] per week.&lt;ref name="CPA 2 Mar 55"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article236259303 |title=Mort's Dock |newspaper=Tribune: The People's Paper |publisher=[[Communist Party of Australia]] |date=2 March 1955 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was portrayed by the [[Communist Party of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article236259454 |title=Two lacings for Short |newspaper=Tribune: The People's Paper |publisher=[[Communist Party of Australia]] |date=10 August 1955 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a contest between the union members and the National Secretary of the {{abbr|FIA|Federated Ironworkers Association}}, [[Laurie Short]], who was a grouper, part of the informal [[Industrial Groups]] set up by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] within trade unions to counter the perceived threat of Communist Party influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holt |first=S |title=Labor's Other Jack Ferguson |journal=[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]] |volume=XLVII |issue=12 |date=December 2003 |url=http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/article_view.php?article_id=542 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402060021/http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/article_view.php?article_id=542 |archivedate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbitration Court made orders against the {{abbr|FIA|Federated Ironworkers Association}} requiring it to comply with the Metal Trades Award.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Trades Employers Association v Federated Ironworkers Association'' (1955) 80 [[Commonwealth Arbitration Reports|CAR]] 325 (23 March 1955) [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].&lt;/ref&gt; The strike continued and on 20 May 1955 the FIA was found to be [[contempt of court]] despite genuine attempts to have the employees return to work. No fine was imposed however the FIA had to pay legal costs of 160 [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Trades Employers Association v Federated Ironworkers Association'' (1955) 81 [[Commonwealth Arbitration Reports|CAR]] 102 (20 May 1955) [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior actions===
[[File:Poul Carl.tif|thumb|The cargo ship MV Poul Carl]]
Members of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union (Australia)#History|Boilermakers Society of Australia]] were among those supporting the strikers by paying the levy of 8 shillings per week. They also put a ban on repair work on the cargo ship Poul Carl.&lt;ref name="CPA 2 Mar 55"/&gt; and the Metal Trades Employers Association sought an order requiring the Boilermakers to comply with the Metal Trades Award. On 21 May 1955 the Arbitration Court, [[Richard Kirby (arbitrator)|Kirby]], [[Edward Arthur Dunphy|Dunphy]] and [[Richard Ashburner|Ashburner]] JJ, held that it had no alternative but to make the orders.&lt;ref name="Orders"&gt;Breach of award: ''Metal Trades Employers Association v Boilermakers Society of Australia'' (1955) 81 [[Commonwealth Arbitration Reports|CAR]] 112 (31 May 1955) [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1957/1957_4(image3).pdf |title=Transcript and orders |pages=14–26 |via=Privy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boilermakers were subsequently found to be in contempt of court by permitting its members to contribute "strike pay", thereby actively subsidiing the strike and prolonging it. The Boilermakers were fined A£500 and ordered to pay the employers legal costs.&lt;ref name="Contempt"&gt;Contempt of court: ''Metal Trades Employers Association v Boilermakers Society of Australia'' (1955) 81 [[Commonwealth Arbitration Reports|CAR]] 231 (28 June 1955) [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1957/1957_4(image3).pdf |title=Transcript and orders |pages=37–55 |via=Privy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The High Court application===

The Boilermakers applied to the High Court for a [[writ of prohibition]] compelling Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner and the Metal Trades Employers Association, to appear before the High Court to show cause why they should not be prohibited from further proceeding on orders.&lt;ref name="prohibition"&gt;A writ of prohibition is one of the [[prerogative writ]]s, which are traditionally brought in the name of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch]] and the person who must show cause is named as the defendant. In this usage [[Ex parte#Australia|Ex parte]] means 'on the application of' rather than its other use as a case heard in the absence of a party. Thus the case name means the Queen (R) v the defendants (the judges and Employers' Association); on the application of (Ex parte) the Boilermakers. The order to show cause is a [[Decree nisi|rule nisi]], and if prohibition is granted, the rule is made absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boilermakers challenged the orders on the grounds that sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were invalid in that the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was given non-judicial powers (administrative, arbitral, executive and legislative powers) as well as judicial powers and the separation of powers in Chapter III of the Constitution meant that the same body could not exercise judicial and non-judicial powers. Eggleston {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} appeared for the Boilermakers. [[Douglas Menzies|Menzies]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} appeared for the Arbitration Court and the [[Attorney General of Australia|Attorney-General]]. [[Bruce MacFarlan|Macfarlan]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} appeared for the Metal Trades Employers Association.

==Judgment of the High Court==

The High Court held that the [[Australian Constitution#The Judicature|judicial power of the Commonwealth]] could not be vested in a tribunal that also exercised non-judicial functions. It is a major case dealing with the [[separation of powers]] in [[Australian law]].

===Grant of both judicial and non-judicial powers===

Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ held that is was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;impossible to escape the conviction that Chap. III does not allow the exercise of a jurisdiction which of its very nature belongs to the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a body established for purposes foreign to the judicial power, notwithstanding that it is organized as a court and in a manner which might otherwise satisfy ss. 71 and 72, and that Chap. III does not allow a combination with judicial power of functions which are not ancillary or incidental to its exercise but are foreign to it.&lt;ref name="boilermakers"/&gt;{{rp|p 296}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were three key elements to the majority decision
# The constitution embodied the separation of judicial power from legislative and executive power;
# Chapter III &amp; matters incidental thereto were the sole source of power for a federal court or judge; and
# The arbitration power was foreign to the judicial power.&lt;ref name="Thomson 1958"/&gt;

Each of the dissenting judges took a slightly different approach. Williams J agreed that only a court could exercise judicial power, but held that there was no express prohibition on a court exercising non-judicial powers, rejecting an "implication in the Constitution arising from the vague concept of the separation of powers".&lt;ref name="boilermakers"/&gt;{{rp|p 306}} Webb J held that the Constitution should be interpreted liberally and the previous decisions of the High Court should be followed. Taylor J saw difficulties in defining or identifying judicial functions, including the overlapping powers or functions that could not be clearly defined as exclusively legislative, executive or judicial.&lt;ref name="Thomson 1958"&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomson, D C |title=Separation of Powers: The Boilermakers' Case |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/1958/5.html}} (1958) 2 [[Sydney Law Review]] 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Is it the grant of judicial or of non-judicial powers which fails===
The majority, Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, held simply that the Arbitration Court was "a tribunal established and equipped primarily and predominantly for the work of industrial conciliation and arbitration" and thus held it was the attachment of powers of judicial enforcement that were invalid.&lt;ref name="boilermakers"/&gt;{{rp|p 286}}

Williams J held that if the combination of powers was not permissible, it would be the arbitral functions that would be invalid.&lt;ref name="boilermakers"/&gt;{{rp|pp 305–6}} Webb J took a different approach, holding that while judicial power could only be exercised by judges, the arbitral functions could be exercised by anyone, including by individuals who happened to be judges, referred to as [[persona designata]].&lt;ref name="boilermakers"/&gt;{{rp|pp 305–6}} Taylor J did not address this issue.

==Privy Council==
On 1 June 1956 the Attorney General obtained leave to appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1957/1957_4(image3).pdf |title=Order in council granting leave to appeal |pages=121–3 |via=Privy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was represented by the [[Solicitor-General of Australia|Solicitor-General]], [[Kenneth Bailey (lawyer)|Bailey]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}}. The Boilermakers filed submissions by Eggleston {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1957/1957_4(image2).pdf |title=Case for the Respondent |via=Privy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they did not appear at the hearing.&lt;ref name="Boilermakers PC"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Attorney-General (Cth) v The Queen |year=1957 |court=UKPC |num=4 |format=1|parallelcite=[1957] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 288}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1957|parallelcite=(1957) 95 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 529 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advice of the Privy Council was delivered by [[Viscount Simonds]].{{refn|name=Dissent|At the time there was no provision for dissent or separate judgments in the Privy Council. Instead the advice to the Queen was determined by a majority of judges who heard the appeal and one judge would be chosen to write the judgment. Decisions of the Privy Council tended to be expressed on narrow grounds, a tendency attributed to the need to reflect the agreement of the majority of judges.&lt;ref name="Gleeson 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_18jun08.pdf |title=The Privy Council – An Australian Perspective |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Privy Council largely followed the reasoning of the majority of the High Court.&lt;ref name="Zines 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zines, L |title=The High Court and the Constitution |pages=214–5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaxIwndVi1UC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2008 |publisher=Federation Press |ISBN=9781862876910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question in whatever for it is stated is whether and how far judicial and non-judicial power can be united in the same body. Their Lordships do not doubt that the decision of the High Court is right and that there is nothing in Chap. III, to which alone recourse can be had, which justifies such a union.&lt;ref name="Boilermakers PC"/&gt;{{rp|p 539}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Privy Council concluded that "The true criterion is not what powers are expressly or by implication excluded from the scope of Chapter III but what powers are expressly or by implication included in it".&lt;ref name="Boilermakers PC"/&gt;{{rp|p 544}}

==Aftermath==
The significance of the case was that it restricted the use of judicial power only to Chapter III courts (under the Australian Constitution), as well as establishing that these courts could exercise no other power. In this way, it clarified the separation of powers doctrine in Australia.

The decision led to the abolition of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the creation of two new Australian industrial relations bodies: the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (later known as the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission]]), whose limited-term members could create industrial awards and settle interstate industrial disputes, and the [[Commonwealth Industrial Court]], whose judges could interpret and enforce awards made by the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Constitutional Law, Materials and Commentary |edition=4th |author=Hanks, PJ |publisher=Butterworths |year=1990 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few Privy Council decisions about the Australian Constitution that are cited in the High Court.&lt;ref name="Gleeson 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_31may07.pdf |title=The influence of the Privy Council on Australia |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the decision in Boilermakers is often cited, it is High Court decision that is cited, with the notation that it was affirmed by the Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;eg {{cite AustLII|HCA|41|2015|litigants=North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency Limited v Northern Territory |parallelcite= (2015) 256 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 569 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radcliffe Science Library''' ('''RSL''') is the main teaching and research [[science]] [[library]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]].

Being officially part of the [[Bodleian Libraries]], although with a completely separate building, the library holds the Legal Deposit material for the sciences and is thus entitled to receive a copy of all [[United Kingdom|British]] scientific publications. The library holds around a million items, with about a quarter of the holdings on display in the reading rooms and the rest held in storage. It is one of the busiest libraries in Oxford, with just over 120,000 visits by approximately 16,000 individuals, and 272,000 items checked out or renewed, in 2008/9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==History==
The scientific books housed in the [[Radcliffe Camera]] were transferred to the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in 1861. On land next to the museum (on the corner of [[Parks Road]] and [[South Parks Road]]) a new library building opened in 1901, the '''Radcliffe Library'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/MU%20Introduction.pdf |format=PDF |title=University Museum of Natural History |publisher=Oua.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a number of other buildings in Oxford, the library was named after [[John Radcliffe (English physician)|John Radcliffe]], a major benefactor of the University.

In 1927, the library lost its independence, for financial efficiency becoming part of the [[Bodleian Library]]. The library took on its current name, the '''Radcliffe Science Library''', and gained the right as a legal deposit library to receive a copy of all new British scientific publications.&lt;ref name="rsl-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/science/about/rsl_history |title=Radcliffe Science Library &amp;#124; RSL History |publisher=Bodleian.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library has doors with relief wood carvings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://insideoxfordlibraries.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/radcliffe-science-library/radcliffe-science-library-6/ | title=Radcliffe Science Library: Door | work=Inside Oxford Libraries | publisher=[[WordPress]] | date=26 November 2012 | accessdate=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Don Potter]], undertaken while he was studying with the sculptor [[Eric Gill]].&lt;ref name="guardian04"&gt;{{cite news| last=MacCarthy | first=Fiona | date=8 June 2004 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | title=Obituary: Donald Potter | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=UK | accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the construction of a basement in the 1970s, part of the building was used to form '''The Hooke Library''', a (separate) science lending library for undergraduates, which was named after [[Robert Hooke]], a scientist who worked in Oxford. The Hooke Library housed its collection in the ground floor of the [[Abbot's Kitchen, Oxford|Abbot's Kitchen]] which was originally part of the University Museum and on the staircase at the eastern end of the Jackson Wing of the RSL. The area which housed the Hooke Library collection is now part of the RSL with the ground floor of the Abbot's Kitchen transformed into a refreshment area and a training room.&lt;ref name="rsl-history"/&gt;

Until 2007, the library was a [[reference library]] rather than a [[lending library]]. During 2007 the building and collection of the Hooke Library was integrated into the RSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouls.ox.ac.uk/rsl/changes |title=Radcliffe Science Library - RSL and Hooke building works 2007 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117070926/http://www.ouls.ox.ac.uk/rsl/changes |archivedate=January 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
The RSL building consists of three parts, developed as expansion of the library was necessary:

# '''The Jackson Wing''', parallel to South Parks Road, is [[Grade II]] listed. Designed by [[Thomas Graham Jackson|Sir Thomas Jackson]] it opened in 1901. This wing currently houses parts of the RSL and formerly housed part of the [[Hooke Library]] on the staircase at its east end. It is arranged over 3 floors, all above ground, with two reading rooms and administration offices.
# '''The Worthington Wing''', parallel to Parks Road, was designed as an extension to the Jackson Wing in 1934 by [[Hubert Worthington]]. The wing extends to the north of the western end of the Jackson Wing and contains two reading rooms, on the first and second floors, and the library entrance hall on the ground floor.
# '''The Lankester Room and Main Stack''', a two-storey extension under the lawn of the museum, built 1972-5. The Lankester Room is a large reading room of the library containing the book collection. The stack contains additional storage for library materials - readers do not have direct access to this, but can request items from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15573">:''For the [[English law]], see [[Standard of care in English law]]. For other uses, see [[Standard of care (disambiguation)]].''
In [[tort law]], the '''standard of care''' is the only degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a [[duty of care]].

The requirements of the standard are closely dependent on circumstances.&lt;ref name="275 U.S. 66"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/275/66/case.html |title=Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. Goodman, 275 U.S. 66 |journal=[[United States Reports]] |volume=275 |page=66 |date=October 31, 1927 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |quote=In an action for negligence, the question of due care is not left to the jury when resolved by a clear standard of conduct which should be laid down by the courts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the standard of care has been breached is determined by the [[trier of fact]], and is usually phrased in terms of the [[reasonable person]]. It was famously described in ''[[Vaughn v. Menlove]]'' (1837) as whether the individual "proceed[ed] with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances".

== Professional standard of care ==
In certain industries and professions, the standard of care is determined by the standard that would be exercised by the reasonably prudent manufacturer of a product, or the reasonably prudent professional in that line of work. Such a test (known as the "[[Bolam Test]]") is used to determine whether a doctor is liable for [[medical malpractice]]. The standard of care is important because it determines the level of negligence required to state a valid cause of action. In the business world the standard of care taken can be described as [[Due diligence|Due Diligence]] or performing a [[Channel check|Channel Check]].

== Medical standard of care ==
A '''standard of care''' is a medical or psychological treatment guideline, and can be general or specific. It specifies appropriate treatment based on scientific evidence and collaboration between medical and/or psychological professionals involved in the treatment of a given condition.

Some common examples:
* Treatment standards applied within public hospitals to ensure that all patients receive appropriate care regardless of financial means.
* [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People]]

1. Diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is "a new standard of care, but not necessarily the only standard of care". (''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', 2004)

2. In legal terms, the level at which an ordinary, prudent professional with the same training and experience in good standing in a same or similar community would practice under the same or similar circumstances. An "average" standard would not apply because in that case at least half of any group of practitioners would not qualify. The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the appropriate standard of care and demonstrate that the standard of care has been breached, with expert testimony.

3. A physician also has a "duty to inform" a patient of any material risks or fiduciary interests of the physician that might cause the patient to reconsider a procedure, and may be liable if injury occurs due to the undisclosed risk, and the patient can prove that if he had been informed he would not have gone through with the procedure, without benefit of hindsight. (Informed Consent Rule.) Full disclosure of all material risks incident to treatment must be fully disclosed, unless doing so would impair urgent treatment.  As it relates to mental health professionals standard of care, the California Supreme Court, held that these professionals have "duty to protect" 
individuals who are specifically threatened by a patient. [''Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California'', 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976)].

4. A recipient of ''[[pro bono]]'' (free) services (either legal or medical) is entitled to expect the same standard of care as a person who pays for the same services, to prevent an indigent person from being entitled to only substandard care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wirth|first1=Stephen|title=Pro Bono: Stay Current on EMS Standards of Care to Avoid Liability Risk|url=http://www.jems.com/articles/print/volume-42/issue-1/departments-columns/pro-bono/pro-bono-stay-current-on-ems-standards-of-care-to-avoid-liability-risk.html|website=Journal of Emergency Medical Services|publisher=PennWell Corporation|accessdate=12 January 2017|ref=probono}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical standards of care exist for many conditions, including [[diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes|url=http://professional.diabetes.org/content/clinical-practice-recommendations|website=Diabetes Professional Resources Online|publisher=American Diabetes Association|accessdate=12 January 2017|ref=diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[cancer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=346525|website=National Cancer Institute|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=12 January 2017|ref=cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Guidelines, Standards &amp; Quality of Care|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/protocols_and_guidelines/|website=New York State|publisher=New York Department of Health|accessdate=12 January 2017|ref=sexualabuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children ==
A special standard of care also applies to children, who, in a majority of jurisdictions, are held to the behavior that is reasonable for a child of similar age, experience, and intelligence under like circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|13|1966|litigants=McHale v Watson |parallelcite=(1966) 115 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 199 |date=7 March 1966 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Restatement (Second) of Torts]] §283A; ''[[Cleveland Rolling Mill|Cleveland Rolling-Mill]] Co. v. Corrigan'', 46 Ohio St. 283, 20 N.E. 466 (1889).)  In some cases it means that more may be required of a child of superior intelligence. (Compare ''Jones v. Fireman's Insurance Co. of Newark, New Jersey'', 240 So.2d 780 [La.App. 1970] with ''Robinson v. Travis'', 393 So.2d 304 (La.App. 1980). An exception is for children engaged in "adult activity." ''Dellwo v. Pearson'', 107 N.W.2d 859 (Minn 1961) ''Nicholsen v. Brown'', 232 Or. 426, 374 P.2d 896 (1962) (automobile); ''Daniels v. Evans'', 102 N.H. 407, 224 A. 2d 63 (1966) (motor scooter); ''Neumann. v. Shlansky'', 58 Misc. 2d 128, 294 N.Y.S.2d 628 (1968 (playing golf)) What constitutes an "adult standard" may depend on local statute, and some have arbitrary age distinctions. Another exception is if the child is engaged in an "inherently dangerous activity." It is up to the trier of fact to decide if the activity is inherently dangerous. If they find that it is, the child must be held to an adult standard of care. ''Robinson v. Lindsay'', 92 Wash.2d 410, 598 P.2d 2392 (1979) (snowmobile);

== Persons with disabilities ==
A person with a disability is held to the same standard of care that an ordinary reasonable person would observe if he suffered from that same disability.  (''Roberts v. State of Louisiana'', 396 So.2d 566 (1981) (blind postal employee))  However, courts do not recognize a person with a ''mental'' disability to be subject to any such special standard, and are held to the "reasonable prudent person" standard, except when the onset of mental illness is unforeseeable and sudden (e.g., ''Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co''., 45 Wis.2d 536, 173 N.W.2d 619 (1970) (sudden hallucinations while driving).)  In some situations, this could work an injustice. Physical handicaps and infirmities, such as blindness,
deafness, short stature, or a club foot, or the weaknesses of age or sex, are treated merely
as part of the “circumstances” under which a reasonable man must act.

== Duty to inform self of responsibilities ==
A person engaged in a special and potentially dangerous activity must know or inquire of possible hazards or of any special duties and responsibilities inherent in that activity that might affect their ability to exercise reasonable prudent caution (''cf, Delair v. McAdoo'', 324 Pa. 392, 188 A. 181 (1936) (driving on worn tires).) Custom and practice of usage may be useful evidence for determining the usual standard, but not determinative of what a reasonable prudent person ''ought'' to be required to do or know (cf., ''Trimarco v. Klein'', 58 N.Y. 2d 98 (1982) (showerdoor glass).) As Justice Holmes classic statement expresses it, "What usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done, but what ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it is complied with or not."

== Person of below average intelligence ==
A person of substandard intelligence is held under common law to the same standard of a reasonable prudent person, to encourage them to exert a decreased effort of responsibility to their community, in light of their handicap, and as a result of the practical difficulty of proving what reduced standard should apply (''Vaughn v. Menlove'', 3 Bing. (N.C.) 468, 432 Eng.Rep.490 (1837).)  Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 289 cmt. n (noting that the “reasonable person” standard makes allowances for age and physical disability but not “attention, perception, memory, knowledge of other pertinent matters, intelligence, and judgment. Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common Law, 108 (Little, Brown, &amp; Co. 1881): “The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men.”&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] |author=[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |date=1881 |page=108 |chapter=Lecture III—D. Liability for unintended Harm is determined by what would be Blameworthy in Average man |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/commonlaw00holmuoft#page/108/mode/2up |quote=The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attorney ==
An attorney is held to the standard that any reasonable attorney in possession of the same knowledge and skill that an ordinary member of his or her profession possesses, as long as he is acting with reasonable care and diligence, in good faith and honest belief that his advice and acts are well founded at the time.  Here, mere errors in judgment are excusable (Best Judgment Rule) and cannot be judged solely with the gift of hindsight without substantial injustice. He or she is required to exercise ordinary care and caution (diligence) in the use of that skill (Due Care Rule), and procedural and technical failures are held to be the most common breaches.  (cf, ''Hodges v. Carter'', 239 N.C. 517, 80 S.E.2d 144 (1954). (failed service of process).)

== Person subjected to unexpected danger ==
In ''Cordas v. Peerless Taxi Company'', 27 N.Y.S.2d 198 (1941), Justice Carlin held that a taxicab driver hijacked at gunpoint by a fleeing mugger in New York City may be excused from negligence for jumping out of the moving taxicab to save his own life, leaving the cab on an unguided trajectory towards bystanders. While some persons might choose to be singularly heroic, that standard is not one that is required for an ordinary prudent person. Such a person is held excused from liability, even if such failure might endanger others. An ordinary prudent person is not under any obligation to undertake a heroic duty at the risk of his own life. "The first duty in an emergency is to one's own self, as long as that person did not contribute to or cause the emergency." (Emergency Doctrine.)

== Negligence ''per se'' ==

When a state criminal statute is violated in the course of performing an assertedly negligent act, under certain circumstances a court may adopt the statute as establishing a standard of care for tortious liability as well.  This is [[negligence per se|negligence ''per se'']].  It follows the reasoning that if a legislature reached findings of public interest in enacting the statute, these same considerations could arguably apply in cases of negligence. There is no negligence ''per se'' doctrine in federal law.

Four elements are deemed necessary for a statute to apply in a negligence case.  First the person harmed must be a member of the class of persons which the law was intended to protect. Second, the danger or harm must be one that the law was intended to prevent.  Thirdly, there must be some causal relationship established between the breach of the statute and the harm caused.  Fourthly, the criminal statute must be concrete, specific and measurable enough to clearly establish a standard of breach. Courts are reluctant to create new torts out of criminal statutes. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts, sections 297, 288.)

However, there are five valid excuses that are available for a defendant to defeat a standard of negligence ''per se''. (Restatement (Second) of Torts section 288.1(2).) First, the defendant may not know of the breach due to incompetence.  Secondly, he might either lack knowledge or reason to know of the breach or duty.  Furthermore, for some explainable reason, he may be unable to comply, despite diligence.  The breach may be due to a sudden emergency not of one’s own making. And lastly, in special situations it may be safer to not comply than to comply.  In cases where these defenses are applied, negligence ''per se'' doctrine creates no more than a rebuttable presumption of negligence that shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.

== Reasonable person/ordinary care ==

In balancing risks to establish a [[reasonable person]]'s standard of ordinary care, the [[calculus of negligence]] establishes that the probability of the harm potentially caused (P) must be balanced along with the gravity of the harm which could result (G), against the burden of conforming to a new and less dangerous course of action (B) along with the utility of maintaining the same course of action as it was (U). This is sometimes noted in shorthand as P+G v. B+U, deriving from a formulation expressed by Judge [[Learned Hand]]. (''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'', 159 F.2d 169 (1947).)

==Common Carrier or Innkeeper Standard of Care ==
In the Hospitailty industries, the standard of care is higher, as the Innkeeper is expected to seek out potential danger and prevent it. " Innkeeper/Common Carrier - very high degree of care - liable for slight negligence" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cramberry.net/sets/35361-torts-negligence|title=TORTS - Negligence // Cramberry: Create &amp; study flash cards online|author=|date=|website=cramberry.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is located on the [[San Joaquin River]] in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]] and had  an estimated population of 320,554 by the California Department of Finance for 2017. Stockton is the [[List of largest California cities by population|13th]] largest city in California and the [[List of United States cities by population|63rd]] largest city in the United States. It was named an All-America City in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.

Built during the [[California Gold Rush]], Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The University of the Pacific (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. As a result of the [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]], Stockton was the second largest city in the United States to file for bankruptcy protection. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.

==Geography==

Stockton is situated amidst the [[Arable land|farmland]] of California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], a subregion of the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of [[waterways]], which make up the [[California Delta]].

[[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]], inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] and the dredged [[San Joaquin River]] connect the city with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to its west. Stockton and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] are California's only [[Inland port|inland sea ports]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city occupies a total area of {{convert|64.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi}} (4.76%) is water.

==History==

When Europeans first  visited the Stockton area, the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley [[Yokuts people|Yokuts Indians]], occupied the Stockton area. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods.  A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the Stockton Channel in downtown Stockton.&lt;ref name="historycity"&gt;{{cite web|title=History A Look into Stockton's Past Before the Gold Rush|url=http://www.stocktongov.com/discover/history/hist.html|publisher=City of Stockton|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siskiyou Trail]] began in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that lead through the [[Sacramento Valley]] over the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and into present-day [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/592072/Archaeological_Investigations_of_the_Siskiyou_Trail_Cascade-Siskiyou_National_Monument_Jackson_County|title=Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Jackson County|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

; Mexican era

Captain [[Charles Maria Weber]], a German, immigrated to America in 1836.  After spending time in [[Texas]], he came overland from Missouri to California with the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] in 1841. Shortly after his arrival, Karl called himself Charles. Weber went to work for [[John Sutter]] who vouched for "Carlos Maria Weber" to the Mexican authorities. In 1842, Weber settled in the [[Pueblo of San José]] and became a business partner of Guillermo (William) Gulnac.

As an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with William Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to [[Mexico]], which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]] a land grant of eleven square [[league (unit)|leagues]] on the east side of the San Joaquin River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWEtAAAAYAAJ|title=A History of Stockton from Its Organization up to the Present Time | first=George Henry|last=Tinkham |year=1880|page=397 |publisher=W.M. Hinton &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired the Rancho Campo de los Franceses from Gulnac in 1845.  In 1846, Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the [[Mexican–American War]] broke out.  Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captaincy by Mexican General [[José Castro]], which he declined, and he later accepted the position of Captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Captain Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, Weber moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.

; Gold rush era

At the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area  of Webers rancho on their way to the goldfeilds. When Captain [[Charles Maria Weber]], a German immigrant, decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to [[California Gold Rush|gold-seekers]] was more profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.stockton.ca.us/Awards/WeberAward.cfm |title=Captain Charles M.

As the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, a city grew rapidly as a miners' supply point during the California Gold Rush.  Weber built the first permanent residence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] on a piece of land now known as Weber Point.&lt;ref name="historycity"/&gt;  During the California Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]].  During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including "Weberville," "Fat City," "Mudville," and "California's Sunrise Seaport."&lt;ref name="uopabout"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Stockton|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/General-Questions/About-Stockton.html|website=www.pacific.edu|publisher=University of the Pacific|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1849, Weber laid out a town, which he named "Tuleburg," but soon decided on "Stockton" in honor of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Robert F. Stockton]]. Stockton was the first community in California to have a name that was neither Spanish nor [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] in origin.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|title=Stockton Facts|url=http://www.visitstockton.org/about-us/fun-facts/|publisher=Stockton Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Chinese immigration

Thousands of Chinese came to Stockton from the [[Kwangtung]] province of China during the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China and the discovery of gold in California. After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] and remained in Stockton. By 1880, Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property. The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton's finest hotels of the time. Only after the [[Magnuson Act]] was repealed in  1962, were American-born Chinese allowed to buy property and own buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit of Stockton's Chinatown|url=http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|publisher=Downtown Stockton Alliance|accessdate=21 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202214924/http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|archivedate=February 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some State of California and City of San Francisco Anti-Chinese Legislation and Subsequent Action|url=http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/resources/resource_2_4.pdf|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stockton California circa 1860.jpg|thumb|Stockton, circa 1860.]]

; Incorporation

The city was officially incorporated on July 23, 1850, by the county court, and the first city election was held on July 31, 1850. In 1851, the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals, and in the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870, the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian.

[[Benjamin Holt]] settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the [[Holt Manufacturing Company]]. On Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable [[continuous track|track-laying]] machine, plowing soggy [[Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta|San Joaquin Valley Delta]] farmland.&lt;ref name="laird"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&amp;tier=4 |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Benjamin Holt (1849–1920): The Father of the Caterpillar tractor |first=Gwenyth Laird |last=Pernie }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor.

===20th century===

On April 22, 1918 British Army officer Colonel [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton]] visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors to haul heavy guns and supplies during [[World War I]], and Swinton publicly thanked Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''Caterpillar Times'' report, May 1918, pages 5 to 8.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort of armored fighting vehicle on Holt's caterpillar tractors, but without success. (Although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate source and were not directly derived from Holt machines).&lt;ref&gt;''Eyewitness, being Personal Reminiscences of Certain Phases of the Great War, Including the Genesis of the Tank,'' by Major-General Sir Ernest D. Swinton.

The extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by [[Plains and Sierra Miwok|Miwok Indians]] for centuries. During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[San Joaquin River]] was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products. By 1931 the Stockton Electric Railroad Company operated forty [[streetcar]]s over 28 miles of track.&lt;ref name="hwd"&gt;{{cite book | author=Demoro, Harre W.| title=California's Electric Railways| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|location=[[Glendale, California]]| year=1986| page=202| isbn=0-916374-74-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stockton is the site of the first [[Sikh]] temple in the United States; [[Gurdwara Sahib Stockton]] opened on October 24, 1912. It was founded by Baba Jawala Singh and Baba Wasakha Singh, successful Punjabi immigrants who farmed and owned {{convert|500|acres|0|abbr=on}} on the Holt River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Stockton Gurwara|url=http://sikhcentury.us/stockton-gurdwara-history/|accessdate=September 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927184319/http://sikhcentury.us/stockton-gurdwara-history/|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the [[Port of Stockton|port]] was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to [[San Francisco Bay]], was deepened and completed. This created commercial opportunities that fueled the city's growth. [[Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot]] was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Historic California Posts: Stockton Ordnance Depot |url=http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/StocktonOrdDepot.html |website=californiamilitaryhistory.org |publisher=The California State Military Museum |accessdate=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214014614/http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/StocktonOrdDepot.html |archive-date=14 December 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the town's canning industry became the battleground of a labor dispute resulting in the [[Stockton Cannery Strike of 1937|Spinach Riot]] of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19370427.2.62#|title=The Cornell Daily Sun 27 April 1937 — The Cornell Daily Sun|website=cdsun.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commons category|Stockton Assembly Center}}
During [[World War II]], the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. One of fifteen temporary detention sites run by the [[War Relocation Authority|Wartime Civilian Control Administration]], the center held some 4,200 [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans removed]] from their West Coast homes under [[Executive Order 9066]], while they waited for transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. The center opened on May 10, 1942 and operated until October 17, when the majority of its population was sent to [[Rohwer War Relocation Center|Rohwer]], Arkansas. The former incarceration site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stockton%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |title=Stockton (detention facility) |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] announced the final closure of Stockton's Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island. Formerly known as [[Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot]], the island's facilities had served as a major communications outpost for submarine activities in the Pacific during the Cold War. The site is slowly being redeveloped as commercial property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/article/20100815/A_BIZ/8140312|title=Ready, no longer Rough|last=|first=|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic history==

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}

Historically an agricultural community, Stockton's economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications and [[manufacturing]].

Stockton's central location, relative to both San Francisco and [[Sacramento]], as well as its proximity to the state and interstate freeway system, together with its comparatively inexpensive land costs, have prompted several companies base their regional operations in the city.

===Construction and public spending===

[[File:Kluft-photo-Stockton-Metro-Airport-July-2009-Img 0085c.jpg|thumb|View across Stockton metropolitan airport, 2009.]]

Beginning in the late 1990s, under the mayorship of Gary Podesto, Stockton had commenced some revitalization projects.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Newly built or renovated buildings include the Bob Hope Theater, Regal City Centre Cinemas and IMAX, [[San Joaquin Regional Transit District|San Joaquin RTD]] Downtown Transit Center, Lexington Plaza Waterfront Hotel, Hotel Stockton, [[Stockton Arena]], San Joaquin County Administration Building, and the [[Banner Island Ballpark|Stockton Ballpark]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The "sunken parking lot" in front of the Hotel Stockton was transformed in the late 1990s into a public space named "Dean DeCarli Waterfront Square." The area is designed to include a variety of spaces and flexible uses: a sunken plaza, shade structure, numerous trees and planters, stadia seating, bench seating, viewing platforms, a weir at the west end, and a cascading waterfall at the east end. DeCarli Square has become a popular urban place hosting music, art and religious events, festivals, farmers' markets, and social gatherings.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A new downtown marina and adjacent Joan Darah Promenade were added along the south shore of the Stockton Deep Water Channel during 2009. Various public art projects were also installed throughout the area (see Stockton's public art section).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Other projects under consideration by the [[city council]] as of January 2009 include South Shore housing, the revitalization of the [[Robert J. Cabral Station|Robert J. Cabral Train Station]] neighborhood, bridges across the Stockton Deep Water Channel, and a new San Joaquin County Court House.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In the summer 2018 the major of Stockton will test a Universal Basic Income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/09/technology/stockton-california-basic-income-experiment/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-income/california-city-fights-poverty-with-guaranteed-income-idUSKCN1J015D}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Real estate bubble===

The Stockton real estate market was disproportionately affected by the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]], and the city led the United States in [[foreclosure]]s for that year, with one of every 30 homes posted for foreclosure.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/14/real_estate/California_cities_lead_foreclosure/index.htm |title=California cities fill top 10 foreclosure list |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=August 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 2006 to September 2007, the value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/real_estate/REOs_tough_on_sellers/index.htm |title=Home sellers suffer amid wave of foreclosures |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stockton's [[Weston Ranch]] neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], a now defunct national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families. Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the United States' speculative [[housing bubble]] in the 2000s. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in United States.&lt;ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/most-dangerous-cities-lifestyle-real-estate-dangerous-american-cities_slide_12.html| title=America's Most Dangerous Cities| work=Forbes| publisher=Forbes.com| date=2009-04-23| accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal year, and the city had the country's highest [[foreclosure]] rate (9.5%) as well. Because of the shrinking economy, Stockton also had an unemployment rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton was rated by [[Forbes]] in 2009 as America's fifth most dangerous city because of its [[crime rate]].&lt;ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities"/&gt; In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, Forbes named it one of the three worst places to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589887,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Forbes Magazine Names Worst Places to Live in America | date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City bankruptcy===

Following regional losses to the economy due to the 2008 financial crisis, in July 2012, Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. It was surpassed by [[Detroit bankruptcy|Detroit]] in July 2013. The city approved of a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131004/A_NEWS/310040326 |title=Council approves Chap. 9 exit plan |first=Scott |last=Smith |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |work=[[The Record (Stockton)|The Record]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013 to help fund the exit.&lt;ref name="Marcum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-tax-measure-election-20131106,0,5437212.story#axzz2jt4QaQcs |title=Stockton voters approve of new tax measure for bankrupt city | first=Diana | last=Marcum |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse in real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city's revenue base.   On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9 bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stockton, California Chapter 9 Voluntary Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/7DR4LZQ/City_of_Stockton_California__caebke-12-32118__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|publisher=PacerMonitor|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2013, a federal judge accepted the bankruptcy application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Judge: Stockton eligible for bankruptcy; implications for San Bernardino | date= 2013-04-01 | first= Tracie | last= Cone | work= [[The San Bernardino Sun]] | url= http://www.sbsun.com/rss/ci_22916717?source=rss | accessdate= 2013-04-01 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130517075257/http://www.sbsun.com/rss/ci_22916717?source=rss | archivedate= May 17, 2013 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/29/us-stockton-bankruptcy-idUSBRE85S05120120629|publisher=Reuters|title= Stockton, California files for bankruptcy|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2013, judge Christopher M. Klein, United States Bankruptcy Court Easter District of California, Sacramento Division, ruled that Stockton was eligible for bankruptcy protection.

The Stockton bankruptcy case lasted more than two years and received nationwide attention.  While there were many possible factors that led to the Chapter 9 filing including the real estate crash and failed city projects, Stockton was watched along with [[Detroit]] to see whether a federal judge will override state law and rule that pensions for municipal employees could be at risk.  At issue were the contractual obligations to [[CalPERS]] that cities throughout California have undertaken.  Pensions in California are protected by the so-called "California Rule," which says that public workers are guaranteed the pension in place the day they were hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California promised public employees generous retirements. Will the courts give government a way out?|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-pension-legal/|website=www.latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved a bankruptcy exit plan by a six-zero vote &lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento.  Voters approved a 3/4-cent sales tax, which would help fund the bankruptcy exit, on November 5, 2013.&lt;ref name="Marcum"/&gt;

If federal courts rule on this aspect of the bankruptcy exit plan it could set a precedent for a state with one of the largest [[municipal bond]] markets in the country.  According to the [[US Constitution]] and laws passed by the US Congress all bankruptcies in the US are administered by federal courts according to federal law with some allowances for state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Dan|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/14/6553979/dan-walters-stockton-bankruptcy.html|website=www.sacbee.com|title=Dan Walters: Stockton bankruptcy judge seeks final answer on pension status|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2014, a [[federal bankruptcy judge]] approved the city's bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned pension payments to retired workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lifsher|first1=Marc|last2=Petersen|first2=Melody|title=Judge approves Stockton bankruptcy plan; worker pensions safe|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stockton-pension-court-ruling-cuts-20141029-story.html|accessdate=30 October 2014|work=LA Times|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city exited from Chapter 9 bankruptcy on February 25, 2015.

The county government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. The county government is primarily composed of the elected five-member [[San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]] and other elected offices including the [[San Joaquin County Sheriff|Sheriff]], [[San Joaquin County District Attorney|District Attorney]], and [[San Joaquin County Assessor|Assessor]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Police department===

; 19th century history

The Stockton Police Department was founded on August 14, 1850.  The first chief of police was City Marshal W. W. Willoughby.  The city marshal was authorized to hire no more than 20 men as day and night policemen. He was required to structure his department with a police captain, an assistant captain and two sergeants.  The first station house was located on the corner of Center Street and Market Street.  In February 1861, the city council created the position of Chief of Police.  His annual salary was $900 and the chief would be elected by the public.  On May 6, 1862, George E. Taber was elected the first Chief of Police for the city of Stockton.

In 1886 Stockton police officers were required to wear blue uniforms and a six-point star badge. In October 1889 a new uniform was decided upon by the chief.  The uniform frock coat worn by Oakland police officers was cost around $50 or $60 each.  The San Francisco style star was chosen as the badge and was made of silver.  Each badge cost $5.

By 1907 the department had grown to 18 members, which included the chief, officers and clerks.  The population was around 25,000 and the police department handled about 600 cases per year.  In 1908 the chief required all police officers to appear for a day of field efficiency testing; this included each officer running 100 yards and a 50-yard revolver practice.

; Modern history

On March 1, 2012 Eric Jones was sworn in as Chief of Police. The city cut its police force by more than 20% during the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|2008 subprime mortgage crisis]], but voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013 that provided funds to hire an additional 120 police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcra.com/news/local-news/news-stockton/stockton-pd-reaches-highest-staff-in-5-years/-/12969936/21767084/-/7ek3s6/-/index.html |first=Tom |last=DuHain |work=KCRA |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |title=Stockton PD reaches highest staff in 5 years |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212130140/http://www.kcra.com/news/local-news/news-stockton/stockton-pd-reaches-highest-staff-in-5-years/-/12969936/21767084/-/7ek3s6/-/index.html |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131103/A_NEWS0801/311030303/-1/A_NEWS04/ |first=Mike |last=Klocke |work=[[The Record (Stockton)]] |date=2013-11-03 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |title=Important step to filling out the thin blue line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Cleveland Elementary School shooting

{{main|Cleveland Elementary School shooting (Stockton)}}

On January 17, 1989, the Stockton Police Department received a threat against Cleveland Elementary School from an unknown person. Later that day, Patrick Purdy, who was later found to be mentally ill, opened fire on the school's playground with a semi-automatic rifle, killing five children, all Cambodian or Vietnamese refugees, and wounding 29 others, and a teacher, before taking his own life. The [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (Stockton)|Cleveland Elementary School shooting]] received national news coverage and is sometimes referred to as the [[Cleveland School massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,151105,00.html |title=Slaughter in A School Yard |work=Time |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-Mayor Barbara Fass' subsequent work on gun control received national attention and sparked nationwide efforts that sought to ban [[assault weapons|semi-automatic rifles]] like the one used in the shooting.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Fire department ===

The Stockton Fire Department was first rated as a Class 1 fire department by the [[Insurance Services Office]] in 1971. In 2005, all 13 of the city's stations met the [[National Fire Protection Association]] standard of a 5-minute response time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Response Times Investigated {{!}} Firehouse|url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/10503917/california-response-times-investigated|website=Firehouse|publisher=KCRA|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it had 13 fire stations and over 275 career personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Stockton, CA Homepage- Official City Government Website|url=https://user.govoutreach.com/stockton/faq.php?cid=3541|website=user.govoutreach.com|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to staffing levels that placed five staff on ladder companies and four staff on engines, it was one of only 57 departments among 44,000 to receive the Class 1 rating in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Valley Business Times|url=http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=15231|website=www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2016|date=May 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104075939/http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=15231|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department maintained this rating until 2011, when during the city's Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings and following a Civil Grand Jury investigation, the city reduced staffing levels from 220 full-time staff to 177, and the 2011 budget from $59 million to $40 million. The department was cut by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funkhouser|first1=Mark|title=Sharing the Burdens of a Broken City|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-institute/funkhouser/col-stockton-california-bankruptcy-stakeholders-negative-fiscal-spiral.html|website=www.governing.com|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy was due in part to a 1996 decision made by the city to provide firefighters with free health care after retirement, which they later expanded to all city employees. The benefit gradually grew into a $417 million liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=C.

{{as of|2016}}, the department consists of 12 firehouses that house 12 Engine Companies and three Truck Companies. In 2015 the Fire Department responded to over 40,000 emergency calls for service, including more than 300 working structure fires. The department is one of the busiest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Stockton Fire Department Year In Review|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwHaD18NV4|publisher=2015 Stockton Fire Department Year In Review|accessdate=3 November 2016|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2010, [[Allegiant Air]] implemented non-stop service to and from Long Beach, California.&lt;ref name="sjgov.org"/&gt; With respect to international service, in 2006 [[Aeromexico]] had plans to provide flights to and from [[Guadalajara]], Mexico, but the airport's plan to build a customs station at the airport was initially rejected by the customs service. However, the possibility of building this station is currently a continuing matter of negotiation between the airport and the customs service, and Aeromexico has indicated a continuing interest in eventually providing service. Ground transportation is available from Hertz, Enterprise, Yellow Cab and Aurora Limousine.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

{{Quote|We used popular records at that time, mainly Caruso records, because they were very good and loud; we needed a boost... we started on an experimental basis and then, because this is novel, we stayed on schedule continually without leaving the air at any time from that time on except for a very short time during World War I, when the government required us to remove the antenna... Most of our programming was records, I'll admit, but of course we gave out news as we could obtain it...&lt;ref name="Secret" /&gt;|Ray Newby, ''I've Got a Secret'' (1965)}}

The '''Supreme Constitutional Court''' ({{lang-arz|المحكمة الدستورية العليا}}, ''El Mahkama El Dustūrīya El ‘Ulyā'') is an independent judicial body in [[Egypt]], located in the [[Cairo]] suburb of [[Maadi]].

The Supreme Constitutional Court is the highest judicial power. It alone undertakes the judicial control in respect of the constitutionality of the laws and regulations and shall undertake the interpretation of the legislative texts in the manner prescribed by law. In addition, the court is empowered to settle competence disputes between the judicial and the administrative courts.

== History ==
The establishment of the Supreme Constitutional Court goes back to the argument which was raised over the right of courts or any judicial bodies to pronounce on the constitutionality of the laws issued by the Legislative power. Such a judicial argument has been advocated in arguing that considering the issue of the constitutionality of laws is included in the competence of the courts. Therefore, it does not prejudice in any way the principle of separation of powers. The argument of such a party was, however, based on a basic assertion that discussing this issue is but a sheer legal act as the core and crux of this matter is represented in interpreting the laws which were appealed against as unconstitutional, a matter of a legal nature in the first place. Indeed, the Egyptian legislator adopted this approach when the court was established in 1969 and was then called the ''Supreme Court'' entrusted to censoring the laws' constitutionality. The aforementioned court was existent till its replacement with the SCC in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hccourt.gov.eg/About/history.asp |title=Historical Overview |publisher=Official website of the Supreme Constitutional Court |accessdate=2010-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135646/http://www.hccourt.gov.eg/About/history.asp |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The establishment of the Court has been stipulated in the body of the [[1971 Constitution of Egypt|Egyptian Constitution]] in 1971. Judges are [[term of office|appointed for life]] by the [[President of Egypt|president]], with [[mandatory retirement]] at the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/egypt.php&lt;/ref&gt; Articles from 174 to 178 talked about this court, its competences and its staff. And, according to Article 174, the Court is an independent judicial authority whose headquarters is in Cairo. The SCC is alone responsible for censoring the constitutionality of the laws and regulations and it assumes interpreting legislative texts. By virtue of constitutional provisions, the law No. 48/1979, known as that of the Supreme Court, has been issued. Article No. 25 of this law has specified the competences of this court as follows:

* To censor the constitutionality of the laws and regulations.
* To decide on the disputes over the competent authority among the judicial bodies or authorities of judicial competence.
* To decide on the disputes that might take place as to carrying out two final contradictory rulings where one of the aforementioned rulings has been issued by one of the judicial body and the other by another body of judicial competence.
* And by virtue of the provision of Article No. 26 of the aforementioned law, the SCC alone has the power to interpret the laws issued by the Legislative Authority and the decrees issued by the Head of the State in case of any divergence as regards their implementation.
The SCC can, in all cases, judge on the unconstitutionality of any provision in a law or a regulation being presented to it when assuming its competences and connected to the dispute presented before it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Templates/Articles/tmpArticles.aspx?CatID=250# |title=Supreme Constitutional Court |publisher=Egypt State Information Service |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Supreme Court was the head of the Presidential Election Commission that supervised and ran the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|country's first multi-candidate presidential elections in 2005]].

The '''legal aspects of [[surrogacy]]''' in any particular jurisdiction tend to hinge on a few central questions:
* Are surrogacy agreements [[enforceable]], void, or prohibited? Does it make a difference whether the surrogate mother is paid (commercial) or simply reimbursed for expenses (altruistic)?
* What, if any, difference does it make whether the surrogacy is traditional or gestational surrogacy?
* Is there an alternative to post-birth [[adoption]] for the recognition of the intended parents as the legal parents, either before or after the birth?

Laws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], all jurisdictions except the [[Northern Territory]] allow altruistic surrogacy; with commercial surrogacy being a [[criminal offense]]. The Northern Territory has no legislation governing surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcm.nt.gov.au/strong_service_delivery/supporting_government/register_of_legislation dcm.nt.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; In New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory it is an offence to enter into [http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/36a_surrogacy.htm international commercial surrogacy] arrangements with potential penalties extending to imprisonment for up to one year in Australian Capital Territory, up to two years imprisonment in New South Wales and up to three years imprisonment in Queensland.

In 2004, the Australian Capital Territory made only altruistic surrogacy legal.&lt;ref&gt;''Parentage Act 2004''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Australian senator [[Stephen Conroy]] and his wife Paula Benson announced that they had arranged for a child to be born through egg donation and gestational surrogacy. Unusually, Conroy was put on the [[birth certificate]] as the father of the child. Previously, couples who used to make surrogacy arrangements in Australia had to [[adopt]] the child after it was registered as born to the natural mother; rather than being recognized as birth parents, however now that surrogacy is more regular practice for childless parents; most states have switched to such arrangements to give the intended parents proper rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After the announcement, Victoria passed the ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/arta2008360/ Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 2008]'', effective since 1 January 2010 to make only altruistic surrogacy legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e92000e23be/3ADFC9FBA2C0F526CA25751C0020E494/$FILE/08-076a.pdf Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 2008 No. 76 of 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Western Australia&lt;ref&gt;''Surrogacy Act 2008''&lt;/ref&gt; passed a law to allow only altruistic surrogacy for couples of the opposite-sex only, and to prohibit it for single people and same-sex couples. In 2010, Queensland made only altruistic surrogacy legal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/S/SurrogacyA10.pdf|title=In force legislation - Queensland Legislation - Queensland Government|website=www.legislation.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;''Surrogacy Act 2010 No 102''&lt;/ref&gt; and Tasmania did the same in 2013 with the ''Surrogacy Act No 34'' and the ''Surrogacy (Consequential Amendments) Act No 31''&lt;ref name="dpac.tas.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/opc/publications.html?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZhcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMuZHBhYy50YXMuZ292LmF1JTJGb3BjJTJGYWN0czIwMTJudW0uaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424090924/http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/opc/publications.html?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZhcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMuZHBhYy50YXMuZ292LmF1JTJGb3BjJTJGYWN0czIwMTJudW0uaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premier.tas.gov.au/media_room/media_releases/parliament_passes_landmark_surrogacy_laws |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055047/http://www.premier.tas.gov.au/media_room/media_releases/parliament_passes_landmark_surrogacy_laws |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/content.w3p;doc_id=4++1993+AT@EN+20091228000000;rec=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055726/http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/content.w3p;doc_id=4++1993+AT@EN+20091228000000;rec=0 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080208184151/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/sca1993243/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Medicare rebate is not available for IVF treatment for surrogacy.

== Belgium ==
Altrustic surrogacy is legal in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/publications/viewPub.html&amp;COLL=S&amp;LEG=4&amp;NR=633&amp;VOLGNR=1&amp;LANG=fr|title=Document législatif n° 4-633/1|website=www.senate.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Canada ==
The [[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]] (AHRC) permits only altruistic surrogacy: surrogate mothers may be reimbursed for approved expenses but payment of any other consideration or fee is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-13.4/index.html Assisted Human Reproduction Act], 6(1), 12(1)c, 12(2), 12(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec law, however, does not recognize surrogacy arrangements, whether commercial or altruistic.

=== Quebec ===
The [[Quebec Civil Code]] renders all surrogacy contracts, whether commercial or altruistic, unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/CCQ/CCQ_A.html Civil Code of Quebec], 1991, c.64, [http://ccq.lexum.org/ccq/section.do?lang=en&amp;article=541 article 541]: "any agreement whereby a woman undertakes to procreate or carry a child for another person is absolutely null"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==
There are no clear rules in Colombia as of today regarding surrogacy and a loophole persists. The current laws applied are those from a natural childbirth. This means the child must be registered with the surnames of the surrogate mother and her partner or spouse, if she has any. Only through a challenging paternity lawsuit before a judge may the commissioning parents be recognized as legal parents, and it may include genetic tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/alquiler-de-vientres-en-colombia/14495962|title=Justicia : Noticias, Fotos y Videos de Justicia - ELTIEMPO.COM|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|website=El Tiempo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, a right wing political party, [[Democratic Center (Colombia)|Democratic Center]], has introduced for the second time a bill in order to determine the concept of surrogacy and to forbid any types of it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/senadores-noticias/item/23755-radicado-proyecto-de-ley-que-prohibe-alquiler-de-vientres-en-colombia

== Czech Republic ==
Surrogacy is not legally regulated in the [[Czech Republic]] and so is generally considered legal.&lt;ref&gt;24903-surogatni-materstvi&lt;/ref&gt; The only mention of the phrase "surrogate motherhood" can be found in § 804 of the law n. 89/2012, where the law designates an exception to the ban of adoption by siblings for siblings carried by a surrogate mother.&lt;ref&gt;zakony.kurzy.cz/89-2012-obcansky-zakonik/paragraf-804/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denmark ==
Altruistic surrogacy is legal in [[Denmark]].

== Finland ==
All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) have been illegal since 2007. Commercial surrogacy arrangements were illegal even before 2007.

== France ==
In France, since 1994, any surrogacy arrangement that is commercial or altruistic, is illegal or unlawful and is not sanctioned by the law (art 16-7 of the Code Civil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/code_civil_textA.htm#CHAPTER%20II%20%20THE%20OF%20RESPECT%20OF%20THE%20HUMAN%20BODY9|title=French civil code|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629090905/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/code_civil_textA.htm#CHAPTER%20II%20%20THE%20OF%20RESPECT%20OF%20THE%20HUMAN%20BODY9|archivedate=29 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] already took this point of view in 1991. It held that if any couple makes an agreement or arranges with another person that she is to bear the husband's child and surrender it on birth to the couple, and that she is choosing that she will not keep the child, the couple making such an agreement or arrangement is not allowed to adopt the child. In its judgement the court held that such an agreement is illegal on the basis of articles 6, 353 and 1128 of the Code Civil.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Beale, Arthur Hartkamp, Hein Kotx, Dennis Tallon, Cases, materials and text on contract law, ius commune casebooks on the Common Law of Europe, Hart Publishing, 2002, pp. 302f. [http://www.casebooks.eu/contractLaw1/chapter3/excerpt.php?excerptId=2663 casebooks.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, France government plans to allow surrogacy in France.

== Germany ==
All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. German party [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] wants to allow altruistic surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdp.de/forderung/121-2|title=Eizellspenden und Leihmutterschaft unter Auflagen - FDP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgia==
Surrogacy, along with ovum and sperm donation, has been legal in the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] since 1992. A donor or surrogate mother has no parental rights over such a child.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Greece ==

Law 3305/2005 (“Enforcement of Medically Assisted Reproduction”)
Surrogacy in Greece is fully legal and is only one of a handful of countries in the world to give legal protection to intended parents.  Intended parents must meet certain qualifications, and will go before a family judge before starting their journey.  As long as they meet the qualifications, the court appearance is procedural and will be granted their application. At present, intended parents must be in a heterosexual partnership or be a single female.  Females must be able to prove there is a medical indication they cannot carry and be no older than 50 at the time of the contract.  As in all jurisdictions, surrogates must pass medical and psychological tests so they can prove to the court that they are medically and mentally fit.  What is unique about Greece is that it is the only country in Europe, and one of only countries in the world where the surrogate then has no rights over the child.  The intended parents become the legal parents from conception and there is no mention of the surrogate mother anywhere on hospital or birth documents.  The intended parent(s) are listed as the parents.  This even applies if an egg or sperm donor is used by one of the partners.
An added advantage for Europeans is that, due to the Schengen Treaty, they can freely travel home as soon as the baby is born and deal with citizenship issues at that time, as opposed to applying at their own embassy in Greece.
The old regime (pursuant to art. 8 of Law 3089/2002), one of the prerequisites for granting the judicial permission for surrogacy was also the fact that the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents should be Greek citizens or permanent residents.
However, the law has recently (in July 2014) changed and the new provisions of L. 4272/2014 foresee now that the surrogacy is allowed to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent or temporary residence in Greece.
With this new law Greece becomes the only EU country with a comprehensive framework to regulate, facilitate and enforce surrogacy, as according to the explanatory statement of the art. 17 of the L. 4272/2014: “The possibility is now extending also to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent residence outside Greece”.

== Hong Kong ==
Commercial surrogacy is criminal under the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance 2000. The law is phrased in a manner that no one can pay a surrogate, no surrogate can receive money, and no one can arrange a commercial surrogacy (the same applies to the supply of gametes), no matter within or outside Hong Kong. Normally only the gametes of the intended parents can be used.

In October 2010, Peter Lee, the eldest son and one of the presumed heirs of billionnaire [[Lee Shau Kee]] obtained three sons through a surrogate mother, reportedly from California. Since the junior Lee is single, the news attracted criticism on both moral and legal grounds. A [[vicar general]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|territory's Roman Catholic diocese]] was critical. In December the case was reportedly referred to police after questions were asked in [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=2f202f2ae82ac210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=&amp;s=News Peter Lee surrogacy case referred to police], SCMP, 2 Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
There is no law in Ireland governing surrogacy. In 2005 a Government appointed Commission published a very comprehensive report on Assisted Human Reproduction, which made many recommendations on the broader area of assisted human reproduction. In relation to surrogacy it recommended that the commissioning couple would under Irish law be regarded as the parents of the child. Despite the publication there has been no legislation published and the area essentially remains unregulated. Due to mounting pressure from Irish citizens going abroad to have children through surrogacy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published guidelines for them on 21 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailand-surrogacy-law.com/ireland-and-surrogacy-thailand/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812193832/http://www.thailand-surrogacy-law.com/ireland-and-surrogacy-thailand/ |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In March 1996, the Israeli government legalized gestational surrogacy under the "Embryo Carrying Agreements Law." This law made Israel the first country in the world to implement a form of state-controlled surrogacy in which each and every contract must be approved directly by the state.&lt;ref name="isbn9780520259645"&gt;{{cite web |last=Teman |first=Elly |year=2010 |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520259645 |title=Birthing a Mother: The Surrogate Body and the Pregnant Self |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state-appointed committee permits surrogacy arrangements to be filed only by Israeli citizens who share the same religion.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly. 2005. The Birth of Surrogacy in Israel. Florida: University of Florida Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The numerous restrictions on surrogacy under Israeli law have prompted some intended parents to turn to surrogates outside of the country. Same-sex couples can enter a surrogacy arrangement outside of Israel and have their legal parenthood recognized within Israel.

== Portugal ==

In 2016, Gestational surrogacy was legalized in Portugal. Discussions on the adoption of this law lasted more than 3 years. The first version of the law was adopted May 13, 2016, but the president vetoed it. He demanded that the law contained rights and obligations of all participants in the process of surrogacy. As a result, the text of the law has been updated, and now surrogacy is legalized and regulated by law in Portugal.

The basic rules of the law on surrogacy in Portugal
Use the surrogacy services can only those couples, where the woman can not carry and give birth to a child for medical reasons. This should be documentally confirmed.
Surrogate motherhood should be altruistic, the woman who agrees to carry and give birth to a child, shouldn’t pay for services.
The written agreement must be necessarily issued between the surrogate mother and the genetic parents. The rights and obligations of the parties as well as their actions in cases of force majeure should be included in it.
After the birth, parental rights over the child belong to the genetic parents.
According to the law, the surrogate mother is a woman of child-bearing age who agrees to carry and give birth to a child for the genetic parents, and she doesn’t lay claim to be his mother.

Traditional surrogacy is illegal in Portugal except for some situations that give the right for a surrogate mother to be genetic (for example, if the future adoptive mother is completely barren).

Adoption of the law caused some debate within several Portuguese Christian Churches, though not among the once dominant Roman Catholic Church. Representatives of Brazilian and US based evangelical and Pentecostal churches condemn surrogacy and suggest that infertile couples can/must (depending on the Church) pursue conventional adoption (national or transnational even though the later is banned by law).

Heterosexual and Lesbian Couples can become parents via surrogacy in Portugal as by 2016 all the risks of the program are provided and regulated by law (for example, the occurrence of developmental defects of the baby, miscarriage or abortion). Male Homosexual couples and single men and women of any sexual orientation have not yet been included, but they are not addressed specifically by the law which leaves an opening for a future revision in a more encompassing way. One such revision is on the current manifestos of several parties: the [Left Bloc (B.E)], [People–Animals–Nature (PAN)-and [(Ecologist Party "The Greens" (Os Verdes - The Greens)]. They can count on the repeated opposition of the populist right party [[CDS – People's Party (PP-CDS)]] and the Social Democratic Party (PPD-PSD), the most socially conservative parties in parliament. The Communist Party (P.C.P) voted against the first proposal, because it was against the recommendations of the National Ethics Counsil, this was also President's argument to decline its approval. 
Most of the Socialist Party voted favourably, as well. By now, this means that gay couples are banned from altruistic surrogacy within Portugal and since the [[Constitution of Portugal]] explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]], this could be unconstitutional, which is being discussed by the Portuguese Constitutional Court.

The first surrogacy program in Russia was successfully implemented in 1995 at the IVF centre of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Institute in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrogacy.ru/eng/history/|title=SURROGACY.RU - Суррогатное материнство в России и мире|website=surrogacy.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion in general is surrogacy-friendly; recent cases of a famous singer and a well-known businesswoman who openly used services of gestational surrogates received positive news coverage. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox Church has officially condemned surrogacy. As regards the baptism of the children born through surrogacy, the Russian Orthodox Church holds that a "child born with the assistance of “surrogate motherhood” can be Baptized according to the wishes of the party that will be raising it, if such are either its “biological parents” or its “surrogate mother,” only after they have recognized that, from the Christian point of view, such reproductive technology is morally reprehensible and have borne ecclesial repentance – regardless of whither they ignored the Church’s position consciously or unconsciously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/on-the-baptism-of-children-born-to-surrogate-mothers/lOn|title=London: Exhibition of work by Krakow Icon School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Russian women, such as [[Ekaterina Zakharova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrogacy.ru/eng/history/|title=SURROGACY.RU - Суррогатное материнство в России и мире|website=surrogacy.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalija Klimova]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/paternity-grave-surrogacy/ Paternity Beyond the Grave RT (Russia Today TV)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lamara Kelesheva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2011/06/16/posthumous_grandchildren_13047.html|title="Pulya I. Posthumous Grandchildren"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; became grandmothers through post-mortem gestational surrogacy programs, their surrogate grandsons being conceived posthumously after the deaths of their sons.

Registration of children born through surrogacy is regulated by the Family Code of Russia (art. 51-52) and the Law on Acts on Civil Status (art. 16). A surrogate’s consent is needed for that. Apart from that consent, no adoption nor court decision is required. The surrogate’s name is never listed on the birth certificate.
There is no requirement for the child to be genetically related to at least one of the commissioning parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrogacymed.com/legal-matters/the-surrogacy-law.html|title=S. Lebedev:|first=Super|last=User|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children born to heterosexual couples who are not officially married or single intended parents through gestational surrogacy are registered in accordance to analogy of jus (art. 5 of the Family Code). A court decision may be needed in that case. On 5 August 2009 a St. Petersburg court definitely resolved a dispute as to whether single women could apply for surrogacy and obliged the State Registration Authority to register a 35-year=old single intended mother, Nataliya Gorskaya, as the mother of her surrogate son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurconsult.ru/publications/reproductiveBioMed.pdf|title=jurconsult.ru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2010 a Moscow court ruled that a single man who applied for gestational surrogacy (using donor eggs) could be registered as the only parent of his son, becoming the first man in Russia to defend his right to become a father through court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrogacy.ru/eng/news/news4.php|title=SURROGACY.RU - ‘уррогатное материнство в ђоссии и мире|website=www.surrogacy.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrogate mother’s name was not listed on the birth certificate; the father was listed as the only parent. After that a few more identical decisions concerning single men who became fathers through surrogacy were issued by different courts in Russia, listing men as the only parents of their surrogate children and confirming that prospective single parents, regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can exercise their right to parenthood through surrogacy in Russia.

Liberal legislation makes Russia attractive for "reproductive tourists" looking for techniques not available in their countries. Intended parents go there for oocyte donation because of advanced age or marital status (single women and single men) and when surrogacy is considered. Foreigners have the same rights for assisted reproduction as Russian citizens. Within 3 days after the birth, the commissioning parents obtain a Russian birth certificate with both their names on it. Genetic relation to the child (in case of donation) does not matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Svitnev K |title=Posters • Ethics and Law |journal=Hum.

==Serbia==
All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. A draft of the new civil law is said to allow surogacy mother, but Serbian Assembly still did not adopt this law yet. On April 21, 2017, the Serbian Assembly started a discussion a legislation on assisted reproductive technology that bans all forms of surrogacy. (The legislation is being discussed.)

==South Africa==
The [[Children's Act, 2005|South Africa Children's Act of 2005]] (which came fully into force in 2010) enabled the "commissioning parents" and the surrogate to have their surrogacy agreement validated by the [[High Courts of South Africa|High Court]] even before fertilization. This allows the commissioning parents to be recognized as legal parents from the outset of the process and helps prevent uncertainty - although if the surrogate mother is the genetic mother she has until 60 days after the birth of the child to change her mind. The law permits single people and gay couples to be commissioning parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_116639.asp Christie, Annabel], "South Africa shows a way to ensure more predictability in surrogacy arrangements," BioNews, January 9, 2012. Retrieved 1-11-2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, only those domiciled in [[South Africa]] benefit from the protection of the law, no non-validated agreements will be enforced, and agreements must be altruistic rather than commercial. If there is only one commissioning parent, s/he must be genetically related to the child. If there are two, they must both be genetically related to the child unless that is physically impossible due to infertility or sex (as in the case of a same sex couple). The Commissioning parent or parents must be physically unable to birth a child independently. The surrogate mother must have had at least one pregnancy and viable delivery and have at least one living child. The surrogate mother has the right to unilaterally terminate the pregnancy, but she must consult with and inform the commissioning parents, and if she is terminating for a non-medical reason, may be obliged to refund any medical reimbursements she had received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-038%20childrensact.pdf South Africa Children's Act of 2005], Chapter 19 (ss292-303).

==South Korea==
As of mid-2010s, surrogacy was available and mostly unregulated in South Korea. The practice is often morally stigmatized. Surrogacy has declined since mid-2000s, as some aspects of commercial surrogacy became illegal.&lt;ref name="Sills2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jung-ok Ha|chapter=Gestational Surrogacy in Korea|editor=E.

==Spain==
Whereas surrogacy is not legal in Spain (the biological mother's renouncement contract is not legally valid), it is legal to perform the surrogacy in a country where it is legal, having the mother the nationality from that same country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gestacionsubrogadaenespaña.es/index.php/sobre-la-gestacion-subrogada/que-es-y-cual-es-su-situacion-en-espana Asociación por la gestación subrogada en España - ¿Cuál es la situación?] (In Spanish) Retrieved 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the surrogate mother has the right to keep the child if she changes her mind before the adoption. The biological father may nevertheless claim the right to the child.

It is illegal for Swedish fertility clinics to make surrogate arrangements. As an alternative, Sweden sanctioned the world's first uterus transplant in an infertile woman. The woman was 36 years old.

==Switzerland==
Surrogacy is regulated in the "Bundesgesetz über die medizinisch unterstützte Fortpflanzung (Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz, FMedG) vom 18. Dezember 1998" and illegal in Switzerland. Art. 4 forbids surrogacy, Art. 31 regulates the punishment of clinicians who apply in vitro fertilisation for surrogacy or persons who arrange surrogacy. The surrogate mother is not punished by law. She will be the legal mother of the child.

In response to the controversial [[Baby Gammy incident]] in 2014, Thailand since July 30, 2015, has banned foreign people travelling to Thailand, to have commercial surrogacy contract arrangement, under the ''Protection of Children Born from Assisted Reproductive Technologies Act''. Only opposite-sex married couples as Thailand residents are allowed to have a commercial surrogacy contract arrangement.

==Ukraine==

Since 2002, surrogacy and surrogacy in combination with egg/sperm donation has been absolutely legal in [[Ukraine]]. According to the law a donor or a surrogate mother has no parental rights over the child born and the child born is legally the child of the prospective parents.

In Ukraine the start of introduction of methods of supporting reproductive medicine was given in eighties of the preceding century. It was Kharkov where the extracorporeal fertilization method was for the first time successfully applied in [[Ukraine]], and in 1991 a girl named Katy was born. Kharkiv was also the first city in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries to realize surrogacy. Many clinics dealing with surrogacy have been opened in [[Kiev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrogacy.in.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=12:faq&amp;Itemid=7&amp;layout=default&amp;lang=en|title=Главная - Вспомогательное материнство|website=surrogacy.in.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lviv]].

Ukrainian surrogacy laws are very favorable and fully support the individual's reproductive rights. Surrogacy is officially regulated by Clause 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine and the order of the Ministry of health of Ukraine "On approval of the application of assisted reproductive technologies in Ukraine" from 09.09.2013 № 787. You can choose between Gestational Surrogacy, Egg/sperm Donation, special Embryo adoption programs and their combinations. No specific permission from any regulatory body is required for that. A written informed consent of all parties (intended parents and surrogate) participating in the surrogacy program is mandatory.

Ukrainian legislation allows intended parents to carry on a surrogacy program and their names will be on Birth certificate of the child born as a result of the surrogacy program from the very beginning. The child is considered to be legally "belonging" to the prospective parents from the very moment of conception. The surrogate’s name is never listed on the birth certificate. The surrogate can't keep the child after the birth. Even if a donation program took place and there is no biological relation between the child and the intended mother, their names will be on Birth certificate (Clause 3 of article 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine).

Embryo research is also allowed, gamete and embryo donation permitted on a commercial level. Single women can be treated by known or anonymous donor insemination. Gestational surrogacy is an option for officially married couples only (a man and a woman). Surrogacy in Ukraine is not regulated in law as commercial, it is more close to altruistic, as the so-called "payment" is not performed to the surrogate mother, it is called a compensation and is not under obligation to pay taxes.

== United Kingdom ==
Commercial surrogacy arrangements are not legal in the [[United Kingdom]]. Such arrangements were prohibited by the [[Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3562435 |author=Brahams D |title=The hasty British ban on commercial surrogacy |jstor=3562435 |journal=Hastings Cent Rep |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=16–9 |date=February 1987 |pmid=3557939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst it is illegal in the UK to pay more than expenses for a surrogacy, the relationship is recognised under section 30 of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. Regardless of contractual or financial consideration for expenses, surrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable so a surrogate mother maintains the legal right of determination for the child, even if they are genetically unrelated. Unless a parental order or adoption order is made, the surrogate mother remains the legal mother of the child.

==United States==
Surrogacy and its attendant legal issues fall under state jurisdiction and the legal situation for surrogacy varies greatly from state to state.  Some states have written legislation, while others have developed common law regimes for dealing with surrogacy issues. Some states facilitate surrogacy and surrogacy contracts, others simply refuse to enforce them, and some penalize commercial surrogacy. Surrogacy friendly states tend to enforce both commercial and altruistic surrogacy contracts and facilitate straightforward ways for the intended parents to be recognized as the child's legal parents. Some relatively surrogacy friendly states only offer support for married heterosexual couples. Generally, only gestational surrogacy is supported and traditional surrogacy finds little to no legal support.

States generally considered to be surrogacy friendly include California,&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&amp;context=ggulrev&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaml.org/sites/default/files/Illinois%20Becomes%20Surrogacy%20Friendly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas,&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Sunday, August 5, 2007, reproduced on [http://simplesurrogacy.com/news/65-surrogates-families-find-state-eases-way.html Simple Surrogacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929005109/http://www.simplesurrogacy.com/news/65-surrogates-families-find-state-eases-way.html |date=29 September 2011 }}.

Both [[New Jersey]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] commercial surrogacy laws become effective from 1/1/2019.

For legal purposes, key factors are where the contract is completed, where the surrogate mother resides, and where the birth takes place. Therefore, individuals living in a non-friendly state can still benefit from the policies of surrogacy friendly states by working with a surrogate who lives and will give birth in a friendly state.

===Arkansas===
[[Arkansas]] was one of the first states to enact surrogacy friendly laws. In 1989, under then Governor [[Bill Clinton]], it passed Act 647, which states that in a surrogacy arrangement, the biological father and his wife will be recognized as the child's legal parents from birth, even if his wife is not genetically related to the child (i.e., in a traditional surrogacy arrangement). If he is unmarried, he alone will be recognized as the legal parent. A woman may also be recognized as the legal mother of the surrogate birth mother's genetic child as long as that child was conceived with anonymous donor sperm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offthemarble.com/arkcode/Title09/9-10-201.html Arkansas Code, Title 9-10-201], retrieved 12-19-2011&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is unclear how or whether same sex couples could benefit these laws, since the 2008 ballot measure that made it illegal for unmarried, cohabiting individuals to adopt or provide foster care to minors.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Campaign, [http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/entry/arkansas-surrogacy-law Arkansas Surrogacy Law], retrieved 12-19-2011&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2015, the 2008 ballot issue is [[mootness|moot]] because of [[Obergefell v. Hodges]].

===California===
[[California]] is known to be a surrogacy-friendly state.  It permits commercial surrogacy, regularly enforces gestational surrogacy contracts, and makes it possible for all intended parents, regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, to establish their legal parentage prior to the birth and without adoption proceedings (pre-birth orders).&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Dale Elizabeth, "[http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&amp;context=ggulrev Surrogacy in California: Genetic and Gestational Rights]", Golden Gate University Law Review, Vol. 21, Iss. 3 [1991], Art. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8345513 |title=Buying babies, bit by bit |date=19 December 2006 |newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan===
[[Michigan]] forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements. It is a felony to enter into such an agreement, punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 and up to five years in prison. The law makes surrogacy agreements unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;MICH. COMP. LAWS §722.851-861 (2009); Doe v. Att’y Gen., 487 N.W.2d 484 (Mich. Ct. App. 1992); Doe v. Kelley, 307 N.W.2d 438 (Mich. Ct. App. 1981); Syrkowski v Appleyard, 362 N.W.2d 211 (Mich. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire===
Since 2014, New Hampshire is recognized as a surrogacy friendly state, with laws in place to protect all parties to a surrogacy arrangement.  All intended parents, irrespective of marital status, sexual orientation, or a genetic connection to the child, are able to establish their legal parental rights through pre-birth orders placing their names directly on the child's initial birth certificate. Reasonable compensation to the surrogate is permitted by statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2014/SB0353.html Title XII: Chapter 168-B: Surrogacy] NH RSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
[[New York (state)|New York]] law holds that commercial surrogacy contracts contravene public policy and provides for civil penalties for those who participate in or facilitate a commercial surrogacy contract in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/new-york/domestic-relations/article8.html|title=NY Domestic Relations Law Art 8, pp121-124|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic surrogacy contracts are not penalized, but neither are they enforced. New York does recognize pre-birth orders from other states, and has provided a post-birth adoption alternative for altruistic surrogate parents via orders of maternal and paternal filiation.&lt;ref&gt;Bognar, Tara, "[http://www.tarabognar.com/birth-orders-in-new-york Birth Orders in New York]", 11/29/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
[[Baby M]]: New Jersey 1988. The surrogate mother in a gestational surrogacy arrangement decided to keep the resulting child. The intended parents sued to have themselves recognized as the legal parents. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that the surrogacy contract was invalid as a matter of New Jersey public policy. However, the intended parents were given custody of the child because the courts thought they would provide a better home for the baby than the surrogate mother, who was instead given visitation rights.

==Vietnam==
Surrogacy for humanitarian purposes have been allowed in Vietnam from 2015 after The amended Family and Marriage Law passed with nearly 60 percent of votes from the National Assembly.

Under the new law, surrogacy will only be allowed among married couples, who do not have any common child, after doctors confirm the wife can not give birth even with technical support. The surrogate must be a relative of either the husband or wife, and have already given birth successfully. A woman is only allowed to be a surrogate once in her life and must produce her husband’s approval if she’s married. The embryo must be created by the intended parents' sperm and ovum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(14)00600-2/fulltext&lt;/ref&gt; The process must be voluntary and follow in-vitro fertilization regulations.

{{For|the United States economic stimulus rebate|Economic Stimulus Act of 2008}}{{Taxation}}

A '''tax refund''' or '''tax rebate''' is a refund on [[tax]]es when the tax liability is less than the taxes paid. Taxpayers can often get a tax refund on their income tax if the tax they owe is less than the sum of the total amount of the [[withholding tax]]es and [[Form 1040#Estimated payments and withholding|estimated taxes]] that they paid, plus the [[refundable tax credit]]s that they claim. (Tax refunds are often paid after the end of the tax year.)

==By country==

===United States===
According to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], 77% of tax returns filed in 2004 resulted in a refund [[cheque|check]], with the average refund check being $2,100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnwin0405/tax.html FDIC: FDIC Consumer News Winter 2004/2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926070635/http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnwin0405/tax.html |date=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the average tax refund was $2,913.&lt;ref&gt;[[USA Today]] page 1B published April 13, 2012 "Tax refund provides cash to file bankruptcy"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20130104/GPG03/301040162/Changes-don-t-worry-tax-preparers&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers may choose to have their refund directly deposited into their [[bank account]], have a check mailed to them, or have their refund applied to the following year's [[income tax]]. As of 2006, tax filers may split their tax refund with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their refund (rather than only spend their refund).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=161493,00.html&lt;nowiki/&gt;  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715104347/https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D161493%2C00.html |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96596,00.html|title=Where's My Refund? - It's Quick, Easy and Secure.|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax refunds even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and the [[earned income tax credit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n797.pdf|title=Notice 797 Possible Federal Tax Refund Due to the Earned Income Credit (EIC)|last=|first=|date=December 2015|website=irs.gov|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed for a long period of time will have more tax than is owed withheld. [[Refund anticipation loan]]s are a common means to receive a tax refund early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/tax-refund-anticipation-loans-1289985|title=Tax Refund Anticipation Loans|last=Vohwinkle|first=Jeremy|date=June 16, 2016|website=thebalance.com|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, refunds could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; however, the average time for a refund is now six weeks, with refunds from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc152.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 152 Refund Information|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe that getting a large tax refund is not as desirable as more accurate withholding throughout the year, as a large refund represents a loan paid back by the government interest-free. Optimally, a return should result in a payment owed of just less than the amount that would cause a penalty charge, which is 100% of the prior year's tax (110% for high income individuals), 90% of the current year's tax, or $1,000 for individuals who have direct withholding and do not pay [[PAYE|estimated tax]]. In order to decrease the amount of the tax refund which has to be received by taxpayers, they can turn to one or several of the following methods:
* adjust the amount of tax the federal government withholds from the paycheck. It is recommended for taxpayers to do this in cases where their adjustments to income, exemptions, and deductions remain relatively steady from year-to-year, and if the government consistently is required to give a large refund.
* in the case of people entirely exempt from state tax, they can check with their state income tax authority to see if there is an appropriate form that can be completed and filed, which would exempt them from state withholding
* check tax rates and adjusted gross income thresholds (applicable if taxpayers are hovering near the bottom of certain tax brackets and changes have been made to the thresholds and/or tax rates)
* take advantage of the medical expense deduction (applicable for medical expenses now imposed for tax years starting in 2013)
* maximizing the amount allowed to save tax-free for retirement&lt;ref name="Presti &amp; Naegele Accounting Offices"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/using-your-2012-tax-year-return-to-plan-for-the-future Using your 2012 tax-year return to plan for the future] Presti &amp; Naegele Accounting Offices&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some people use the tax refund as a simple "savings plan" to get money back each year (even though it is excess money that they paid earlier in the year). Another argument is that it is better to get a refund rather than to owe money, because in the latter case one might find oneself without sufficient funds to make the necessary payment. When properly filled out, the [[Form W-4]] will withhold approximately the correct amount of tax to eliminate a refund or amount owed, assuming the W-4 was filled out at the beginning of the tax year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96196,00.html|title=IRS Withholding Calculator|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make [[payment system|electronic payments]] by 1999. In 2008, the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] paired with [[Comerica Bank]] to offer the Direct Express Debit [[MasterCard]] [[prepaid debit card]]. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account. '''Tax refunds''', however, are exempt from the electronic payments requirement. However, many U.S. states send tax refunds in the form of prepaid debit cards to [[unbanked|people who do not have bank accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bankcreditnews.com/news/federal-government-chooses-direct-deposit-and-prepaid-cards-over-mailing-checks/9413/ “Federal government chooses direct deposit and prepaid cards over mailing checks”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423044908/http://bankcreditnews.com/news/federal-government-chooses-direct-deposit-and-prepaid-cards-over-mailing-checks/9413/ |date=2013-04-23 }}, BankCreditNews, 15 Apr 2013, Accessed 22 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. This information is collected and held by the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)]] (IRD) and is not automatically processed. However individual earners can request a summary of earnings to see if they have overpaid or underpaid their tax for each given financial year. To claim a tax refund, a personal tax summary must be filed; this can be done by dealing with the IRD directly or through a Tax Agent. If a personal tax summary is requested in a situation where tax would be owing, a debt is created, so correct calculations prior to this request are important, and these core services are offered by third party Tax Agents. Tax Agents in New Zealand are largely self-regulating, with the [http://www.otanz.org Online Tax Association of New Zealand (OTANZ)] providing guidance and governing rules for New Zealand's largest 4 tax refund agencies whom serve most of the market for personal tax refunds.

===India===
In India, there is a provision of refund of excess tax along with interest. For claiming a refund one has to file the [https://tax2win.in income tax return] within a specified period. However, under Sections 237 and 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Income Tax are empowered to condone a delay in the claim of a refund.&lt;ref&gt;"Whether Board should condone delay if failure to condone delay causes genuine hardship to assessee, no matter whether delay in filing return is meticulously explained or not - Held, yes"  167 TAXMAN 238 (ker.)  ''Pala Marketing Co-operative Society Ltd. v. Union of India'' WP (C) No. 21977 of 2007 (N) (November 26, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions of refund of duty exists in indirect taxation. In Section 11 B of the Central Excises Act, 1944 which is also applicable in the cases of Service Tax (Finance Act, 1994).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, income tax is deducted by the employer under the [[PAYE]] (Pay As You Earn) tax system via [[HMRC]]. Some refunds such as those due to changing tax codes or similar circumstances will be automatically processed via a P800 form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/tax-overpayments-and-underpayments/if-youre-due-a-refund|title=Tax overpayments and underpayments|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A change of circumstances, such as a change of employment or second job, sometimes results in overpaid tax which can be claimed back &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/tax/tax-refunds-claiming-back-overpaid-tax/tax-refunds/|title=Tax refunds - Citizens Advice|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also possible to make more complex claims under both PAYE and self-employment circumstances, for example if employed by the [[Ministry of Defence]] or Construction Industry Scheme used by construction trade subcontractors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.out-law.com/topics/tax/property-tax-/the-construction-industry-scheme/|title=The Construction Industry Scheme|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In such cases tax refunds for various work related expenses can also be claimed for up to the last four tax years; common examples include costs for accommodation (for example for offshore workers staying overnight before transport to a rig), food purchased while travelling between workplaces, or the purchase or hire or specialist equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riftrefunds.co.uk/tax-refunds/|title=Tax Refunds - Am I Due A Tax Refund?|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. If incorrect tax credits are applied by the employer, then a refund of tax is due. Tax refunds may also be due for income deductions that are applied after the tax year has ended, if one finishes working prior to the year end, or for joint assessment of taxes for a married couple. Tax refunds must be claimed within four years of the end of the tax year if the one is assessed under the PAYE tax system.

[[Image:Recycled timber.jpg|thumb|Demolishers pulling timber from an old wool store in Sydney, which will later be re-used for timber flooring]]

'''Timber recycling''' or '''wood recycling''' is the process of turning waste [[timber]] into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber is the [[environmentally friendliest]] form of timber production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. Timber can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants.

==Benefits==
[[Image:Finished recycled product.jpg|thumb|Example of recycled timber as a final product]]
Recycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product. Common belief among consumers is that by purchasing recycled wood, the demand for "green timber" will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Greenpeace also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website. The arrival of recycled timber as a construction product has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.

Recycling one ton of wood can save 18,000,000 btus of energy 

==Drawbacks==
Some hurdles facing the widespread adoption of recycled timber: sometimes the ends of wall studs need to be trimmed off to stop decay and cracking, thus resulting in a shorter piece of wood; this trimming may result in pieces of wood that do not meet building codes.  Though the price may be less than for new wood, the process of selecting usable pieces of salvaged wood, pulling out nails, and refinishing for a new use can be laborious and time-consuming.  Demolition must happen in such a way as to preserve as much of the timber as possible in a building, which means more time spent dismantling a building rather than just tearing it down quickly.  The trade in recycled timber is not well-established everywhere, so a reliable supply of usable wood may be hard to come by for builders.  There may be a stigma associated with using "used" or "cheap" wood that is perceived to be of not as high quality as "new" wood.  Not all pieces of wood in a dismantled building will fit in a new building, and it may be cheaper and easier, from a design and labor perspective, to simply get new wood (ex: wood from a 6-foot (1.8 m) deck being used in a 7-foot (2.1 m) deck).  Of course, none of these issues are insurmountable, and they are issues of convenience and logistics rather than structural integrity, but many builders find it easier and less time-consuming to simply get new wood in standard uniform sizes. 

==Recycling timber==
{{Main|Reclaimed lumber}}
[[Image:Thai House Recycled Timber.JPG|thumb|Recycled timber salvaged from a demolished building in [[Trat Province|Trat]], [[Thailand]], is applied to make a new roof.]]
Recycled timber most commonly comes from old buildings, bridges and wharfs, where it is carefully stripped out and put aside by demolishers. At the same time any usable [[dimension stone]] is set aside for reuse. The demolishers then sell the salvaged timber to merchants who then re-mill the timber by manually scanning it with a metal detector, which allows the timber to be de-nailed and sawn to size. Once re-milled the timber is commonly sold to consumers in the form of timber flooring, beams and decking.

==Examples==
Use of recycling timber is not new. As early as 1948, the 100 metre tall tower of [[Golm transmitter]] near Potsdam, Germany was built from recycled timber. It stood for 31 years.
It was common to reuse wood of dismantled radio towers in the 1930s in Germany, e.g. the former tower of [[Koblenz radio transmitter]] was built of wood from a dismantled tower, which carried a T-antenna at [[Transmitter Muehlacker]]. The upper parts of the 157-metre-tall wood tower of [[Ismaning radio transmitter]], which stood for 49 years, were built of wood from a smaller radio tower dismantled in 1934.

John's attempt to defeat Philip II in 1214, failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the [[battle of Bouvines]]. A peace agreement was signed in which John forfeited the Counties of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[County of Poitou|Poitou]] and the [[Duchy of Brittany]] and pay £60,000 pounds in reparations to the French crown. The truce was intended to last until Easter 1220.

'''''United States v. Bell Telephone Co.''''', 167 U.S. 224 (1897),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Bell Telephone Co.|volume=167|page=224|year=1897}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an 1897 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] that held that the United States lacked standing to challenge the validity of its issued patents “on the mere ground of error of judgment” in issuing them. The United States had standing to seek to invalidate patents, however, on grounds of fraudulent procurement and also as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. The decision operated for many decades as a bar to government efforts to seek invalidation of patents that it considered spurious until the Supreme Court limited ''Bell Telephone'', first to a limited extent in ''United States v. United States Gypsum Co.'',&lt;ref name=Gypsum&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. United States Gypsum Co.|link=|volume=333|page=364|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then more broadly in ''[[United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.]]''&lt;ref name=Glaxo&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.|link=|volume=410|page=52|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On February 1, 1893, the United States filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts a [[bill in equity]] against the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] and Emile Berliner, praying a [[Decree#United States|decree]] to set aside and cancel [https://www.google.com/patents/US463569?dq=patent:463569+ininventor:Emile+ininventor:Berliner&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6wEwAGoVChMI0Pzv_duUxgIV5GOMCh1viwC_ U.S. patent No. 463,569], issued on November 17, 1891, to Bell as assignee of the inventor Berliner. According to the opinion in the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The application by Berliner was made on June 4, 1877, he having filed a caveat on April 14, 1877. In 1878, and prior to October 23, the telephone company purchased Berliner's invention, and on November 17, 1891, a patent was issued to the telephone company, as assignee of Berliner. The application was therefore pending in the department fourteen years, during thirteen of which the invention was the property of the telephone company.&lt;ref name=Bell243&gt;''Bell Telephone Co.'', 167 U.S. at 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The government made two allegations on which the circuit court passed:

::1. Bell delayed the patent application in the patent office for thirteen years. That was, under the circumstances alleged in the bill, unlawful and fraudulent. According to the government, this enabled Bell to enjoy a monopoly on the telephone because of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s patent, and then when it expired an additional monopoly under Berliner's, thus prolonging the period of monopoly over the telephone. "So that, while the public has today, by reason of the expiration of the Bell patent, the right to use as it pleases his invention, such right is a barren one, and the telephone monopoly is practically extended to the termination of the Berliner patent, and this extension of the time of the monopoly has been accomplished by means of the delay in the issue of the Berliner patent—the long pendency of the application in the Patent Office."&lt;ref name=Bell243/&gt;

::2. Bell received two patents, one in 1880 and another in 1891, upon a [[Divisional patent application|division]] of the original application. Both patents cover the same invention so that Bell got two patents on the same invention, one of which expires eleven years after the other one. The patent commissioner did not have legal power to issue more than one patent on one invention.

Upon amended pleadings and proofs, the circuit court on January 3, 1895, 65 F. 86, entered a decree as prayed for in favor of the United States. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, this decree was on May 18, 1895, reversed, and a decree entered directing a dismissal of the bill. 68 F. 542. Thereupon the United States took an appeal to the Supreme Court.

==Ruling of the Supreme Court==

The Court's majority opinion, by Justice Brewer, began by noting that this was the first case by the United States "to set aside a patent for an invention as wrongfully issued."&lt;ref&gt;167 U. S. 237-38.&lt;/ref&gt; There were prior cases as to land patents, however, and the Court looked to them for guidance. 
These cases required "clear, convincing, and unambiguous" evidence from the government to overcome "the presumption that all the preceding steps required by the law had been observed before its issue, [given] the immense importance and necessity of the stability of titles dependent upon these official instruments."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying this principle to the government's first argument, the Court asked what caused the thirteen years of delay—"It may have been caused either by the negligent or wrongful action of the officers of the department, and without any connivance, assistance, or concurrence on the part of the applicant, or it may have been brought about by the applicant, either through its corruption of the public officers or through other misconduct on its part."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 250-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said that the burden was on the government to prove bribery or other misconduct to cause delay, and no evidence of that was in the record. The government's only evidence was of "the supine submission of the company to such extraordinary delay."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said that the patent officials could have acted more expeditiously, but there is no evidence that "they acted wrongfully, and [that] their action was induced by or at the instance of the defendants."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the government's first argument failed.

As for the second argument—[[double patenting]]—the Court said the patent office had made a determination on that point that "was adverse to the [present] contention of the government, and such judgment cannot be reviewed in this suit."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason was the government lacked standing to litigate that issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hen it has no proprietary or pecuniary result in the setting aside of the patent, is not seeking to discharge its obligations to the public, when it has brought the suit simply to help an individual, making itself, as it were, the instrument by which the right of that individual against the patentee can be established—then it becomes subject to the rules governing like suits between private litigants.&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To be sure: "Doubtless the removal from the public of the burden of a monopoly charged to have been wrongfully created was also one of the objects, and perhaps the principal object."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 266.&lt;/ref&gt; But the patent law gives the patent office exclusive power to determine whether to issue a patent. "[T]he argument is a forcible one that such determination[s] should be held conclusive upon the government."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 268.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States may sue to cancel a patent procured by fraud, but this is not such a case. "Least of all was it intended .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the courts of the United States, sitting as courts of equity, could entertain jurisdiction of a suit by the United States to set aside a patent for an invention on the mere ground of error of judgment on the part of the patent officials."&lt;ref&gt;167 U.S. at 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Harlan dissented without opinion.

==Later developments==

In ''United States v. United States Gypsum Co.'',&lt;ref name=Gypsum/&gt; the Supreme Court recognized that ''Bell Telephone'' held that the United States was "without standing to bring a suit in equity to cancel a patent on the ground of invalidity," but went on to declare that, to vindicate the public interest in enjoining violations of the Sherman Act, the United States is entitled to attack the validity of patents relied upon to justify anticompetitive conduct otherwise violative of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Gypsum Co.'', 333 U.S. at 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if a patentee defended price-fixing on the ground that it was permissible under [[United States v. General Electric Co.|the 1926 ''General Electric'' case]], the government could overcome that defense by showing the patent was invalid.

In ''[[United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref name=Glaxo/&gt; the government showed that the defendants used their patent power to secure restrictive patent licenses that violated the antitrust laws. Then, the government sought a declaration that the patents were invalid and as relief compulsory licensing of the patents and mandatory sales of the patented product, on reasonable terms. The district court refused the relief, accepting the defendants' arguments that the government would "deny defendants an essential ingredient of their rights under the patent system," and that there was no warrant for "such a drastic forfeiture of their rights." The district court cited ''Bell Telephone'' as authority for the government's lack of standing to challenge patent validity. The Supreme Court reversed. Whether the patents were valid or invalid could significantly affect what remedies were appropriate. It held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this context, where the court would necessarily be dealing with the future enforceability of the patents, we think it would have been appropriate, if it appeared that the Government's claims for further relief were substantial, for the court to have also entertained the Government's challenge to the validity of those patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Glaxo Group'', 410 U.S. at 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''United States v. Ninety-Five Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar''''', 265 U.S. 438 (1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Ninety-Five Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar|volume=265|page=438|pin=|year=1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was an ''[[In rem jurisdiction|in rem]]'' case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that [[apple cider vinegar]] is mislabeled when that vinegar is made from dried apples. The label at issue indicated that the vinegar was made from "selected" apples. Douglas Packing Company, the manufacturer, admitted to dehydrating fresh apples and then re-hydrating the apples with pure water to produce vinegar.

Additional chemicals were used in the manufacturing process for vinegar made from dried apples, but neither party alleged that this affected the vinegar. Other than this and the difference in apples, the manufacturing process was the same. The trial judge, who tried samples of the vinegar at issue and apple cider vinegar made from fresh apples, concluded that there were only slight differences in appearance and taste. Chemical comparison yielded similar results for both liquids.

There was no claim that vinegar from dried apples was of inferior quality. However, the court found first that the dried apple vinegar was not identical to [[vinegar]] as commonly understood—that produced from fresh ingredients. Second, fresh apples contain the apple juice that is normally used in the production of apple cider vinegar, whereas Douglas Packing used water as a substitute ingredient. Finally, the court found that "made from selected apples" misled the reader into thinking that the apples were fresh instead of dried. These three issues—an imitation under the same name, false or misleading ingredient listing, and misleading labelling—were all a part of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] section defining "[[Standards of identity for food|misbranded]]". For this reason, the Supreme Court found that the apple cider was misbranded under the statute.

The '''Usages of Barcelona''' ({{lang-ca|Usatges de Barcelona}}, {{IPA-ca|uˈzadʒəz ðə βəɾsəˈlonə|IPA}}; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Usatici Barchinonae'') were the customs that form the basis for the [[Catalan Constitutions]]. They are the fundamental laws and basic rights of [[Catalonia]], dating back to their codification in the twelfth century.

The Usages combined fragments of [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Lex Visigothorum|Visigothic law]] with the resolutions of the [[Count of Barcelona|comital court of Barcelona]] and the religious [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]]s of ecclesiastic synods. The first Usages were compiled and codified by [[Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona]] (1035–1076), to repair the deficiencies of Gothic law. However, the evidence for Ramon's work dates from the codes of [[James the Conqueror]] of a later date (reigned 1213–1276). James, seeing that some judges ruled by Gothic law and some by Roman law, according to a tradition of ''usus terrae'' (local custom), approached the [[Catalan Courts]] in 1251 to establish the primacy of the Usages. Though the Usages applied legally only to the [[Barcelona]]n county, in practice they were applied to the entire [[Principality of Catalonia]].

The Usages incorporated several other competing codes of the same era:

*Usages of [[Girona]]
*Customs of [[Lleida]]
*Customs of [[Tortosa]]
*[[Furs of Valencia|''Furs'' of Valencia]]
*''Franquesas'' of [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]]
*Chapter of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Neopatria]]

The oldest manuscript containing the Usages dates from the end of the 12th century. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, they were copied frequently. The [[Nueva Planta decrees]] superseded them with the central legislation of the [[Bourbons]], though continued to have some force.

'''Veritas''' ([[Latin]]: truth) was a [[list of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party in the United Kingdom]], formed in February 2005 by [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]] following a split from the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP). Kilroy-Silk served as party leader from formation, through the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]], until his resignation in July that year. He was succeeded by Patrick Eston, who resigned the leadership on 15 June 2008 citing frustrations of his efforts to reform the party. The party merged into the [[English Democrats]] in June 2015.&lt;ref name="Merge"&gt;{{cite web|title=English Democrats and Veritas to Merge|url=http://www.englishdemocrats.org.uk/latest-news/item/439-english-democrats-and-veritas-to-merge.html|publisher=English Democrats|accessdate=7 October 2015|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veritas had no representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], although it had members serve in the [[European Parliament]] and the [[London Assembly]], elected as UKIP members and defecting upon Veritas' formation. At the time of its merger, the party had not put forward General Election candidates since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Jamie|title=We Asked 11 Obscure Political Parties If They Should Be In The TV Debates|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamieross/beer-baccy-and-tv-debates#.vxYN6ZVgv|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=BuzzFeed News|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Robert Kilroy-Silk, a former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] shadow cabinet member and television presenter, was elected as a UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European Parliament election]] for the [[East Midlands]] region. His ambition to attain the leadership of that party was announced in October 2004, but it proved very unpopular within the party. Instead of risking disciplinary action for continuing this action, Kilroy-Silk resigned the party [[Whip (politics)|whip]], while remaining a full member and asserting his continued challenge. The plan ultimately failed, and Kilroy-Silk finally resigned from the party – as had been long expected – on 20 January 2005. Rumours circulated immediately that Kilroy-Silk was set to form his own party, fuelled by the registration of the domain name "veritasparty.com" a month earlier. An earlier rumour suggested that he had been in negotiations with the [[English Democrats]] to join and lead their party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/diary/story/0,,1372973,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Politics | first=Marina | last=Hyde | date=14 December 2004 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Veritas'' – [[Latin language|Latin]] for "truth" – was officially founded in a press conference on 2 February, during which Kilroy-Silk proclaimed "unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight", devoid of the other parties' "lies and spin". There were a number of defections from UKIP to the new party. They included UKIP London Assembly member [[Damian Hockney]], who became deputy leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227921.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party | date=2 February 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of formation, its primary policy was opposition to [[immigration to the United Kingdom]]. It was perceived to be more specific than UKIP's general [[euroscepticism]], and almost to the point of Veritas being labelled a [[single-issue party]]. Kilroy-Silk also proposed support for the introduction of [[flat tax]] in opposition to the existing system of income tax bands varying with income. Kilroy-Silk's preferred figure was 22%, the "basic rate" band in which most UK citizens fell at the time.

The party was immediately lambasted as nothing more than a vanity vehicle for Kilroy-Silk, and was nicknamed "Vanitas" by former allies.&lt;ref&gt;Burkeman, O., [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1404364,00.html Kilroy was there], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2005. Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Kilroy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Kilroy-Silk]], the founder and first leader of Veritas.]] --&gt;

==2005 election==
The first test of Veritas' ambitions was the general election on 5 May 2005 where it had hoped to overtake UKIP as the primary party opposing the [[European Union]]. Although ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper had suggested that Veritas hoped to run candidates in every constituency in [[Great Britain]], the party ended up fielding 65 candidates in England and Wales, polling 40,481 votes, an average of 623 (1.5%).

Kilroy-Silk contested the constituency of [[Erewash (UK Parliament constituency)|Erewash]] in [[Derbyshire]]. He came fourth with 2,957 votes (5.8%); [[Liz Blackman]] was elected for Labour with 22,472. No Veritas candidates were elected; Kilroy-Silk was the only one to save his deposit.

In the subsequent [[Cheadle by-election, 2005|Cheadle by-election]] on 14 July 2005 Les Leggett of Veritas polled 218 votes (0.6%).

==Aftermath of 2005 general election==
In the wake of the poor showing in the general election, it was reported that there were many resignations from the party. Some discontented party members came to oppose Kilroy-Silk and formed the Veritas Members Association (VMA).  One of its founders, Ken Wharton, challenged Kilroy-Silk for the leadership on 12 July 2005, during the Cheadle by-election campaign but his challenge faltered due to ill health.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4675795.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy faces leadership challenge | date=12 July 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilroy-Silk resigned as party leader on 29 July.  In a press statement he said "It was clear from the general election result – and more recently that of the Cheadle by-election – that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system.  We tried and failed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4728941.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy quits as leader of Veritas | date=29 July 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further resignations included that of his chief-of-staff David Soutter and deputy leader Damian Hockney. Hockney and London Assembly Veritas representative [[Peter Hulme-Cross]] (who, like Hockney, had defected from UKIP) subsequently formed the [[One London]] party.

A leadership election was held in September 2005. Acting leader Patrick Eston defeated Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Colin Brown, and former boxer [[Winston McKenzie]] on a 22% turnout.  This, combined with a poor turnout at the party's first Annual General Meeting, is believed to have brought about the subsequent resignation of Brown and the founders of the VMA. Eston appointed a new party chairman, Alan Ainscow, who resigned from that post and the party in November.  As defections and resignations continued, a number of members and former members from Veritas and UKIP, including [[Anthony Bennett (English politician)|Anthony Bennett]] and Ken Wharton, formed a new party, the [[Popular Alliance (UK)|Popular Alliance]] in March 2006.  Eston appointed a deputy, Howard Martin, who also is the main Veritas Party spokesperson, and seemed determined to continue with the party, despite the depletion of the Veritas membership.

==2005–15==
In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|2006 local elections]], Veritas stood four candidates: two each in [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] and [[Bolton]]. They polled an average of 98 votes each (3.5% of the total). In the 2007 elections, Veritas stood three candidates: two in English council elections and one – Iain James Sheldon in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)|Mid and West Wales]] Region for the Welsh Assembly, who received 502 votes (0.2% of the total).

In the summer of 2007, Patrick Eston contacted the leadership of other parties with similar political positions with a view to organising a meeting to discuss co-operation. While all parties were being contacted a later meeting was being arranged for September between Eston and the leaders of the [[Freedom Party (United Kingdom)|Freedom Party]] and [[United Kingdom Popular Democrats]] who had shown interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritasparty.com/news.html Proposed meeting on 31 August] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629182440/http://www.veritasparty.com/news.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2008 Patrick Eston announced that he could not take the Veritas Party in the direction he wanted and so would be resigning the party leadership.  In a resignation letter to the party membership he said:
:"I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the only way a new political party can move forward is for one person to have complete control and take all the decisions. However, I believe that members must have a say on whether that person stays as leader on a yearly basis. A sort of benevolent dictator that members can remove yearly if they so wish."

Therese Muchewicz, Party Secretary, served as Acting Leader until leadership elections in October 2008. She was subsequently elected as the new Party Leader. The party put forward no candidates in the 2010 or 2015 UK General Elections  It was subsequently announced that Veritas would merge into the English Democrats.

The '''Victims of Crime Trust''' was an English [[Charitable organization|charity]] which aimed at providing care assistance to victims of serious [[crime]], as well as raising awareness of the issues that are faced by victims of crime in the aftermath of the crime.

It was founded in 1994, and from 1996 was extensively involved in support for families of [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] victims.

Its founder and director was [[Norman Brennan]], a former police officer. 

Its accounts and Annual Returns which should have been sent to the [[Charity Commission]] were several years overdue in July 2010 and its website withdrawn from service.

The Charity Commission removed the trust's registration on 9 December 2010 on the grounds that it had "ceased to exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1032867}} ''No longer registered''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">The '''Virginia Slave Codes of 1705''' were a series of laws enacted by the [[Colony of Virginia]]'s [[House of Burgesses]] regulating activities related to interactions between slaves and citizens of the crown colony of [[Virginia]]. The enactment of the Slave Codes is considered to be the consolidation of [[slavery in Virginia]], and served as the foundation of Virginia's slave legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bush, Jonathan A.|chapter=The British Constitution and the Creation of American Slavery|editor=Finkelman, Paul|title=Slavery &amp; the Law|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7425-2119-3|page=392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YI0DvuukxkC&amp;pg=PA392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These codes effectively embedded the idea of white supremacy into law by the following devices:&lt;ref name="Foner"&gt;Eric Foner, ''Give Me Liberty!: An American History'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Established new property rights for slave owners
* Allowed for the legal, free trade of slaves with protections granted by the courts
* Established separate courts of trial
* Prohibited blacks, regardless of free status, from owning arms [weapons]
* Whites could not be employed by blacks
* Allowed for the apprehension of suspected runaways

{{Original research|section|date=September 2016}}
These new laws exhibited a grand departure from business as it once was, stripping from blacks many previously held rights. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}  Before this, indentured servants, while they served their term, and slaves were almost equals in their plight.  Now, a racial divide was a legal mandate. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}

Historians generally agree that this law was devised to establish a greater level of control over the surging African slave population of Virginia. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}} It also served to socially segregate white colonists from black slaves making them disparate groups hindering their ability to unite. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}  A unity of the commoners was a perceived fear of the Virginia aristocracy which had to be addressed, and who wished to prevent a repeat of events such as [[Bacon's Rebellion]], occurring 29 years prior.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''''Wisconsin v. Jonas Yoder''''', 406 U.S. 205 (1972), is the case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] found that [[Amish]] children could not be placed under [[compulsory education]] past [[junior high school|8th grade]].  The parents' fundamental right to [[freedom of religion]] was determined to outweigh the state's interest in educating its children. The case is often cited as a basis for [[Homeschooling in the United States#U.S. Supreme Court precedent|parents' right to educate their children]] outside of traditional private or public schools.

==Background of the case==
Three Amish students from three different families stopped attending the New Glarus High School in the [[New Glarus, Wisconsin|New Glarus]], [[Wisconsin]], school district at the end of the eighth grade because of their parents' religious beliefs.  The three families were represented by Jonas Yoder (one of the fathers involved in the case) when the case went to trial.  They were convicted in the [[Green County, Wisconsin|Green County]] Court. Each defendant was fined the nominal sum of $5. Thereafter the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] found in Yoder's favor. Thereupon, Wisconsin appealed that ruling in the US Supreme Court.

The Amish did not believe in going to court to settle disputes but instead follow the [[Christian Bible|biblical]] command to "turn the other cheek."   Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes to defending themselves in courts or before legislative committees.  However, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly as a result of this case) and then provided them with legal counsel.

Under Amish church standards, higher education was deemed not only unnecessary for their simple way of life, but also endangering to their salvation.&lt;ref name="syllabus"/&gt;  These men appealed for exemption from compulsory education on the basis of these religious convictions.  They sincerely held to the belief that the values their children would learn at home would surpass the worldly knowledge taught in school.&lt;ref name="opinion"/&gt;

==The court's decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of ''Yoder'' in its decision. Justice [[William O. Douglas]] filed a partial dissent, but voted with the court regarding Yoder's case. Justices [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court "sustained respondents' claim that application of the compulsory school-attendance law to them violated their rights under the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], made applicable to the States by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]."&lt;ref name="syllabus"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wisconsin v.

The U.S. Supreme Court held as follows:&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wisconsin v. Yoder ET AL. |work=U.S. Supreme Court Case Opinion | url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0406_0205_ZO.html | accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# States cannot force individuals to attend school when it infringes on their First Amendment rights. In this case, the state of Wisconsin interfered with the practice of a legitimate religious belief.
# Not all beliefs rise to the demands of the religious clause of the First Amendment. There needs to be evidence of true and objective religious practices, instead of an individual making his or her standards on such matters. The Amish way of life is one of deep religious convictions that stems from the Bible. It is determined by their religion, which involves their rejection of worldly goods and their living in the Biblical simplicity. The modern compulsory secondary education is in sharp conflict with their way of life.
# With respect to the State of Wisconsin’s argument that additional modern education beyond 8th grade is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and productively in America’s political system, the Court disagreed. It argued that the State provided no evidence showing any great benefit to having two extra years in the public schools. Furthermore, the Court contended that the Amish community was a very successful social unit in American society, a self-sufficient, law-abiding member of society, which paid all of the required taxes and rejected any type of public welfare. The Amish children, upon leaving the public school system, continued their education in the form of vocational training.
# The Court found no evidence that by leaving the Amish community without two additional years of schooling, young Amish children would become burdens on society. To the contrary, the Court argued that they had good vocational background to rely upon. It was the State’s mistaken assumption that Amish children were ignorant. Compulsory education after elementary school was a recent movement that developed in the early 20th century in order to prevent child labor and keep children of certain ages in school. The State of Wisconsin’s arguments about compelling the school attendance were therefore less substantial.
# Responding to Justice Douglas's dissent, the Court argued that the question before it was about the interests of the parents to exercise free religion, and did not relate to the child's First Amendment's rights. As such, the argument pertaining to the child's right to exercise free religion was irrelevant in this case.

==The dissenting opinion==
Justice [[William O. Douglas]], who dissented in part, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree with the Court that the religious scruples of the Amish are opposed to the education of their children beyond the grade schools, yet I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the matter is within the dispensation of parents alone. The Court's analysis assumes that the only interests at stake in the case are those of the Amish parents on the one hand, and those of the State on the other. The difficulty with this approach is that, despite the Court's claim, the parents are seeking to vindicate not only their own free exercise claims, but also those of their high-school-age children....

On this important and vital matter of education, I think the children should be entitled to be heard. While the parents, absent dissent, normally speak for the entire family, the education of the child is a matter on which the child will often have decided views. He may want to be a pianist or an astronaut or an oceanographer.  To do so he will have to break from the Amish tradition.

It is the future of the students, not the future of the parents, that is imperiled by today's decision. If a parent keeps his child out of school beyond the grade school, then the child will be forever barred from entry into the new and amazing world of diversity that we have today. The child may decide that that is the preferred course, or he may rebel. It is the student's judgment, not his parents', that is essential if we are to give full meaning to what we have said about the Bill of Rights and of the right of students to be masters of their own destiny.  If he is harnessed to the Amish way of life by those in authority over him and if his education is truncated, his entire life may be stunted and deformed. The child, therefore, should be given an opportunity to be heard before the State gives the exemption which we honor today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy of the Court's decision==
The ruling is cited as a basis for allowing people to be educated outside traditional private or public schools, such as with [[Homeschooling in the United States#U.S. Supreme Court precedent|homeschooling]][[̩|.]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The implications of the case for the Amish were characterized by one author as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since ''Wisconsin v. Yoder,''  all states must grant the Old Order Amish the right to establish their own schools (should they choose) or to withdraw from public institutions after completing eighth grade. In some communities Amish parents have continued to send their children to public elementary schools even after ''Wisconsin v. Yoder''.  In most places tensions eased considerably after the Supreme Court ruling, although certain difficulties remained for those Amish living in [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nolt |first=S.
