      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6907">The '''Academy Vivarium Novum''' (or ''Accademia'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) in [[Rome]] is the only [[college]] in the world where male students can spend one or more years immersed in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. These languages are spoken both in and outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116232817/http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/index.htm |archivedate=2011-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academy is directed by Luigi Miraglia, who according to the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine "speaks Latin more fluently than almost anyone else alive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|title=Latin lover; can a classicist's plan to revive a dead language save Europe?|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=15396&amp;startpage=page0000117|accessdate=25 June 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=17 Sep 2001|archiveurl=http://find.galegroup.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/gtx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;docId=A79347640&amp;source=gale&amp;srcprod=AONE&amp;userGroupName=gain40375&amp;version=1.0|archivedate=25 June 2011|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy Vivarium Novum was founded in order to restore the great tradition of the [[European Renaissance|Renaissance]] schools, their teaching methods, and the free and critical vision of the world that such an education fosters. The Academy is founded on the firm conviction that dignity (''dignitas hominis'') may be attained only by continuous self-examination. The male students of the Academy Vivarium Novum are dedicated to the pursuit of a comprehensive grasp of the Latin and Ancient Greek languages.&lt;ref name=viv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/academy/theacademy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301031913/http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/academy/theacademy.htm |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Vivarium Novum recalls the [[proto-humanistic]] community of [[Cassiodorus]], [[Theodoric]]'s [[magister officiorum]]. Vivarium was a place where [[liberal arts]] and lofty aspiration coincided; at the same time it evokes the isle of [[Vivara]] located in the [[Bay of Naples]], where the idea of a school prepared to offer an advanced education to future generations was first conceived.&lt;ref name=viv/&gt;

==Academic year==

The main programme offered by the Academy, which is held from the beginning of October up to the end of June, mainly aims to provide male students with a strong experience in the domain of the [[Humanities]]. The subjects of the courses are principally [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Latin literature]], [[Renaissance literature]], [[Ancient Greek]] language and literature and Roman History. The course of History of [[poetry]] and ancient [[prosody (music)|prosody]] deserves a special mention, as it combines ancient verses with music, in order to explain their metrical structure in a more efficient way.&lt;ref&gt;(it) https://vivariumnovum.net/it/lezioni/metrica-et-prosodia&lt;/ref&gt; The choir of the Academy, ''Tyrtarion'' (from the names of ''Tyrtaeus'' and ''Arion''), has already become well known in the domain of Latin and Greek poetry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1273E23FBFFABCA8 - http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news/56560335/#56560335&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite its unusual lingua franca, the programme's aim is not the mastery of the Latin and ancient Greek languages for their own sake. Rather these languages are thought of as instrumental in understanding the most significant aspects of the western world's literary, philosophical, and historical legacy, and how it has been shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://vivariumnovum.net/en/lessons&lt;/ref&gt;
Pupils from sixteen to twenty-five years of age are admitted to the Academy; every year, an application process is organised in order to receive scholarships and be admitted to the Academy for one year. Room, board, classes and didactic materials are all provided free to recipients.&lt;ref&gt;As for the year 2014-2015: http://apaclassics.org/apa-blog/announcement-of-competition-academy-vivarium-novum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer course==

In order to fund these scholarships and to foster effective methods of teaching Latin and Greek, the Academy and the ''Mnemosyne'' Foundation organise each year an intensive Summer Course of Latin. This course lasts exactly eight weeks, from the end of June to the middle of August, and aims to bring students to the easy reading of the classics without any previous knowledge. The course is divided into two modules of four weeks, and is opened to everyone. &lt;ref&gt;https://vivariumnovum.net/en/summer-school&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing house==

In order to achieve the best and fastest results in teaching Latin and Greek, the Academy has developed a new methodology which is today considered among the most effective in the world. &lt;ref&gt;The University of London (UCL) described the method as “''probably the best Latin method available''”: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/clie/learning-resources/sac/latin/course-books - See also (it) {{cite web|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/inchieste-ed-interviste/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/accademia-latino-papa-poe-19643/?cHash%3D96f448f0b5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215023628/http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/inchieste-ed-interviste/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/accademia-latino-papa-poe-19643/?cHash=96f448f0b5 |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is considered one of the main promoters of the so-called ''direct method'' for the teaching of ancient languages, which is based on the [[textbook]] ''Lingua Latina per se illustrata'', of the Danish author [[Hans Ørberg]], and on an adaptation and extension, for Ancient Greek, of the English book [[Athenaze]]. Both are published and distributed in Italy by the Academy, and have been adopted in many schools all around the world. Notably, the publishing and distribution of these books is entirely non-profit, with all profits providing scholarships to worthy male students.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation book (https://vivariumnovum.net/en/presentation, p.61) and Publishing house's website (https://vivariumnovum.it)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''America: A Tribute to Heroes''''' was a [[benefit concert]] created by the heads of the four major American broadcast networks; [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] and [[CBS]].  [[Joel Gallen]] was selected by them to produce and run the show. Actor [[George Clooney]] organized celebrities to perform and to staff the telephone bank.

It was broadcast live by the four major American television networks and all of the cable networks in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] in 2001. Done in the style of a [[telethon]], it featured a number of national and international entertainers performing to raise money for the victims and their families, particularly the [[FDNY|New York City firefighters]] and [[NYPD|New York City police officers]]. It aired September 21, 2001, uninterrupted and commercial-free, for which it won a [[Peabody Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/america-a-tribute-to-heroes 61st Annual Peabody Awards], May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on December 4, 2001, on [[compact disc]] and [[DVD]].

On a dark stage illuminated by hundreds of candles, twenty-one artists performed songs of mourning and hope, while various actors and other celebrities delivered short spoken messages. The musical performances took place at three studios in [[Los Angeles]] ([[CBS Television City]]), [[New York City|New York]], and [[London]], while the celebrity messages took place in Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some of the musicians, including [[Neil Young]] and [[Eddie Vedder]], were heard working the phone banks taking pledges. Over $200 million was raised and given to the [[United Way of America|United Way]]'s September 11 Telethon Fund.

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine selected this concert, along with [[The Concert for New York City]], as one of the 50 moments that changed rock and roll.

The show was also simulcast in Canada; Young and another Canadian singer, [[Celine Dion]], performed.

[[File:Arnulf Baring.jpg|thumb|Arnulf Baring (2002)]]

'''Arnulf Baring''' (born 8 May 1932 in [[Dresden]]) is a German lawyer, journalist, political scientist, contemporary historian and author. He is a member of the German-British [[Baring family]] of bankers.

==Life==
Arnulf Martin Baring earned a doctorate at the [[Free University of Berlin]] in 1958. In 1968 he was invited by [[Henry Kissinger]] to teach at the [[Harvard Center for International Affairs]], and the following year, he was appointed as Professor at the Free University of Berlin, where he taught until his retirement in 1998.

In 1997, he expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring was aware of the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans as economic policemen, predicting that the currency bloc would end up with blackmailing its member countries.&lt;ref name="WST16Jul2015NAGAB"&gt;[http://wolfstreet.com/2015/07/16/this-prediction-about-the-euro-deserves-a-nostradamus-award/ This Prediction about the Euro Deserves a ‘Nostradamus Award’] W.

'''Asger Hartvig Aaboe''' (26 April 1922 – 19 January 2007) was a [[History of science|historian of the exact sciences]] and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] who is known for his contributions to the history of ancient [[Babylonian astronomy]]. He studied mathematics and astronomy at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and in 1957 obtained a PhD in the [[History of Science]] from [[Brown University]], where he studied under [[Otto Neugebauer]], writing a dissertation "On Babylonian Planetary Theories". In 1961 he joined the Department of the History of Science and Medicine at [[Yale University]], serving as chair from 1968 to 1971, and continuing an active career there until retiring in 1992. In his studies of Babylonian astronomy, he went beyond analyses in terms of [[Algorithm#History: Development of the notion of .22algorithm.22|modern mathematics]] to seek to understand how the Babylonians conceived their computational schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Britten (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2007), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele (2007), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] in 1975, served as president of the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]] from 1970 to 1980, and was a member of many other scholarly societies.

Aaboe married Joan Armstrong on 14 July 1950. The marriage produced four children: Kirsten Aaboe, Erik Harris Aaboe, Anne Aaboe, Niels Peter Aaboe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8737">[[Image:BathingMachineGals.jpg|thumb|upright|Women posing near a bathing machine in 1902.]]
The '''bathing machine''' was a device, popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, to allow people to change out of their usual clothes, change into swimwear, and wade in the ocean at beaches.&lt;!-- commented out, see Talk: without violating [[Victorian morality|Victorian notions]] of [[modesty]]. --&gt; Bathing machines were roofed and walled wooden carts rolled into the sea. Some had solid wooden walls while others had canvas walls over a wooden frame.

The bathing machine was part of [[etiquette]] for [[sea-bathing]] more rigorously enforced upon women than men but to be observed by both sexes among those who wished to be proper.&lt;ref name="Byrde2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrde|first1=Penelope|title=‘That Frightful Unbecoming Dress’ Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath|journal=Costume|volume=21|issue=1|year=2013|pages=44–56|issn=0590-8876|doi=10.1179/cos.1987.21.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in Britain, men and women were usually segregated, so nobody of the opposite sex might catch sight of them in their bathing suits, which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen.

The bathing machines in use in [[Margate]], [[Kent]], were described in 1805 as
{{quote|four-wheeled carriages, covered with canvas, and having at one end of them an umbrella of the same materials which is let down to the surface of the water, so that the bather descending from the machine by a few steps is concealed from the public view, whereby the most refined female is enabled to enjoy the advantages of the sea with the strictest delicacy.|author=[[Walley Chamberlain Oulton]]|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Walley Chamberlain Oulton|last=Oulton|first= W.

People entered the small room of the machine while it was on the beach, wearing their street clothing. In the machine they changed into their bathing suit, although men were allowed to bathe nude until the 1860s,&lt;ref name="JASA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Jane Austen Society of Australia |title=Bathing - Jane Austen at the seaside |date=2007-03-26 |url=http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm |archive-url=https://archive.li/20130514035307/http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm |archive-date=2013-05-14 |quote=Tobias Smollett in The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. ... on each side a little window above ... 1789: ... over all their windows ...

Probably all&lt;!-- all the pictures on Commons, that include the whole machine, show windows --&gt; bathing machines had small windows,&lt;ref name="JASA"/&gt; but one writer in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' of May 26, 1906 considered them "ill-lighted" and wondered why bathing machines were not improved with a [[skylight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Evelyn |last=Sharp |title=How to dress in the water |date=1906-05-26 |newspaper=[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]] |url=http://www.guardiancentury.co.uk/1899-1909/Story/0,6051,126381,00.html |quote=ill-lighted |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would then be wheeled or slid into the water. The most common machines had large wide wheels and were propelled in and out of the surf by a horse or a pair of horses with a driver. Less common were machines pushed in and out of the water by human power. Some resorts had wooden rails into the water for the wheels to roll on; a few had bathing machines pulled in and out by cables propelled by a steam engine.

Once in the water, the occupants disembarked from the sea side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only one door would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy.
Some resorts employed a '''dipper''', a strong person of the same sex who would assist the bather in and out of the sea. Some dippers were said to push bathers into the water, then yank them out, considered part of the experience.&lt;ref name="Walton1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walton|first=John K. |title=The English Seaside Resort: A Social History, 1750-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VmlQgAACAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Leicester University Press|isbn=978-0-312-25527-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:BathingMachineDontBeAfraid.jpg|thumb|Man and woman in swimsuits, c. 1910. The woman is exiting a bathing machine. Once mixed-sex bathing became socially acceptable, the days of the bathing machine were numbered.]]
Bathing machines would often be equipped with a small flag which could be raised by the bather as a signal to the driver that they were ready to return to shore.

==History==
According to some sources, the bathing machine was developed in 1750 in [[Margate]], [[Kent]], though this may relate primarily to the "modesty hood" (bathing costumes were not yet common and most people bathed naked). "Mr. Benjamin Beale, a Quaker, was the inventor of the Bath Machine. Their structure is simple, but quite convenient; and by means of the umbrella, the pleasures of bathing may be enjoyed in so private a manner, as to be consistent with the strictest delicacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kentish Traveller's Companion | first=T. |last=Fisher |year=1776| url=https://archive.org/stream/kentishtravelle00fishgoog#page/n166/mode/2up|accessdate=25 Sep 2012|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scarborough, England|Scarborough]] Public Library there is an engraving by John Setterington dated 1736 which shows people bathing and popularly believed to be first evidence for bathing machines, however [[Devon]] claims this was a year earlier in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081011091002/http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/culturetourism/libraries/library_services/children/thezone/maxhome/maxcomix/max-devon-etchings.htm Library Etchings] (archived) at Devon&lt;/ref&gt;

Bathing machines were most common in the United Kingdom and parts of the [[British Empire]] with a British population, but were also used in France, Germany, the United States, Mexico, and other nations. Legal segregation of bathing areas in Britain ended in 1901, and the bathing machine declined rapidly. By the start of the 1920s, bathing machines were almost extinct, even on beaches catering to an older clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Manning-Sanders, Ruth. ''Seaside England''. B T Batsford, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bathing machines remained in active use on English beaches until the 1890s, when they began to be parked on the beach. They were then used as stationary changing rooms for a number of years. Most of them had disappeared in the United Kingdom by 1914.&lt;ref name=Austen&gt;[http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm Jane Austen Society of Australia page on bathing]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have survived to this day as [[beach hut|bathing boxes]] in many parts around the world.

'''''Belgitude''''' is a term used to express the [[Belgium|Belgian]] soul and identity.

==Context==

Contrary to most other countries [[Belgians]] have a mixed feeling towards their identity as one people. This is a result of being occupied by many foreign European powers throughout the centuries, which led to an [[inferiority complex]] about their status and power in the world. The regions were conquered by [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carolingian Empire|French]], [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgondia]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire|Austria-Hungary]], [[Napoleonic Empire|the French again]] and finally [[The Netherlands]] before becoming independent in [[1830]]. And even then they were occupied again by [[Germany|the Germans]] during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. Another aspect contributing to ''belgitude'' is the fact that many Belgians identify more with being [[Flanders|Flemish]], [[Wallonia|Walloon]] or part of [[Brussels]], but even within those groups many feel more attached to being part of a city or province than any national or community identity. There have been countless issues between the Flemish and Walloon [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]] throughout Belgian history that often lead to intense political discussions and crisises in Belgian parliament.

The Belgian identity is seen as a "hollow" identity: it is defined mostly by what it is not. For example, the Belgian is neither [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[German people|German]]. At the time of the term's coinage, it was not accepted by the general population, and the term seemed to have "more cultural than political weight". At the time, belgitude could be synonymous with [[Marginalization|marginality]].&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; [[Susan Bainbrigge]] defines it as  "a term  that represents [the] new approach to [[francophone]] [[Belgium]] specificity [that emerged] in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge&gt;{{cite book|last=Bainbrigge|first=Susan|title=Culture and identity in Belgian francophone writing: dialogue, diversity and displacement|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXY9keniD1UC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Belgitude&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yAvdTrHYKefnmAXS15XCCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Belgitude&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the extent of the questioning identity of Belgians with the sense of self-mockery that characterizes them.

==History of the Belgian feeling of identity==

During his conquest of [[Gaul]] in 54 before Christ [[Julius Caesar]] wrote in his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] about the three Celtic tribes that inhabited the country, namely the ''[[Aquitani]]'' in the southwest, the ''[[Gauls]]'' of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called ''Celtae'', and the ''[[Belgae]]'' in the north. Caesar famously wrote that the [[Belgae]] were ''"the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the [[Rhine]], with whom they are continually at war"''.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Conquest of Gaul Gallico'', trans. S. A. Handford, revised with a new introduction by Jane F. Gardner (Penguin Books 1982), I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Caesar referring to the Celtic tribe the Belgae and not modern day Belgium the quote was used a lot in Belgian history books from the 1830s on while the new independent state searched for its own identity.

The most famous quote about the Belgian identity was said by the Walloon socialist politician [[Jules Destrée]]. According to Destrée, Belgium was composed of two separate entities, [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], and a feeling of [[Belgian nationalism]] was not possible, illustrated in his 1906 work "Une idée qui meurt: la patrie" (''An idea that is dying: the fatherland''). In the "Revue de Belgique" of 15 August 1912 he articulated this in his famous and notorious "Lettre au roi sur la séparation de la Wallonie et de la Flandre" (''Letter to the king on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders''), where he wrote: {{quote|Il y a en Belgique des Wallons et des Flamands. Il n'y a pas de Belges.&lt;br&gt;''In Belgium there are [[Walloons]] and [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s. There are no [[Belgian]]s.''}} Contrary to later interpretations Destrée didn't favor separatism, but wanted a move to a [[federal state]]. King [[Albert I of Belgium]] wrote an official answer to the letter, which read:  ''I read the letter of Destrée, which, without uncertainty, is some literature of great talent. All that he said is absolutely true, but it is not less true that administrative separation would be an evil with more disadvantages and dangers than any aspect of the current situation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} J'ai lu la lettre de Destrée qui, sans conteste, est un littérateur de grand talent. Tout ce qu'il dit est absolument vrai, mais il est non moins vrai que la séparation administrative serait un mal entraînant plus d'inconvénients et de dangers de tout genre que la situation actuelle. Landro, 30 août, ''A Jules Ingebleek, secrétaire  privé du Roi et de la Reine'', lettre reproduite in extenso in M-R Thielemans et E. Vandewoude, ''Le Roi Albert au travers de ses lettres inédites'', Office international de librairie, Bruxelles, 1982, pp. 435-436.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 Flemish politician [[Gaston Eyskens]] modified this quote, saying "Sire, il n'y a plus de Belges" (''Sire, there are no more Belgians''), after the first steps were taken to transform Belgium into a [[federal state]].

==Etymology==

The [[neologism]] "belgitude" was coined in 1976, by [[Pierre Mertens]] and Claude Jevaeu in as issue of the ''Nouvelles littéraires'' called "L'autre Belgique".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; It alludes to the term ''[[négritude]]'' about feeling black, expressed by [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]]. The term caught on quick enough to be referred to in Belgian singer [[Jacques Brel]]'s song "Mai 1940" ("May 1940"), which was left off his final album ''[[Les Marquises]]'' in 1977, but made available in 2003. In the song Brel refers to German soldiers who occupied Belgium during [[World War Two]] and wiped out his belgitude:

''D'un ciel plus bleu qua'à l'habitude'',            ''(Translation: "From a heaven bluer than usual")''
 
''Ce mai 40 a salué''                                ''(Translation: "That May 1940 greeted")''
 
''Quelques Allemands disciplinés''                   ''(Translation: "Several disciplined Germans")''
 
''Qui écrasaient ma belgitude,''                   ''(Translation: "Who wiped out my belgitude".)'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003200301_01/_ons003200301_01_0174.php|title=Ons Erfdeel. Jaargang 46 · dbnl|first=|last=DBNL|website=DBNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the word "Belgitude" was listed in the French encyclopedia, the [[Petit Larousse]]'' &lt;ref&gt;« « Belgitude » dans le Petit Larousse illustré » dans [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/1284233/2011/06/27/Belgitude-dans-le-Petit-Larousse-illustre.dhtml 7sur7.be], 27 juin 2011, consulté le 28 juin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of belgitudes==

Belgitude is characterised by things that are unique to Belgian culture, such as [[Belgian Dutch]] and [[Belgian French]]. The Dutch in Belgium has many [[gallicism]]s and the French in Belgium many [[hollandism]]s, both in terms of words as well as grammar. The word "bourgemestre" ([[mayor]]) in Wallonia, for instance, is clearly inspired by the Dutch word "burgemeester" and differs considerably from the commonly accepted French word "maire". The word "plezant" ("amusing") in [[Flanders]] is a derivation of the French word "plaisant" and is hardly used in [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsetaal.be/artikel/171/franse-invloed|title=VlaamseTaal.be - Franse invloed|website=www.vlaamsetaal.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical foods and drinks, such as [[Belgian beer]], [[moules frites]], [[speculaas]], [[waterzooi]], [[witloof]], [[Brussels sprouts]], [[Belgian chocolate]],... are also seen as examples of belgitude, because they are often promoted abroad. People who were important to Belgian history are also often cited: [[Ambiorix]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Charles V of Spain]], [[Adolphe Sax]], [[Baudouin of Belgium]], as are cultural icons such as [[Manneken Pis]], the [[Carnival of Binche|Gilles of Binche]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Inspector Maigret]], the [[Atomium]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[René Magritte]], [[Soeur Sourire]], [[Django Reinhardt]],... In the fields of sport [[Eddy Merckx]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Red Devils]] are a good example. The song ''"[[Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)]]" (1998)'' by [[John Makin|Mr. John]] is also an expression of belgitude. The satirical comedy and film adaptation ''[[Sois Belge et tais-toi]]'', the films of [[Jan Bucquoy]] and the comedy team [[Les Snuls]] are all loving and mocking tributes to the Belgian identity.

'''Burmese ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Burmese art]]. The tradition of Burmese ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Myanmar and its neighbours.

The village of [[Kyaukmyaung (Sagaing)]] is an important traditional production centre.

The '''Casket letters''' were eight letters and some sonnets said to have been written by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], to the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], between January and April 1567. They were produced as evidence against Queen Mary by the Scottish lords who opposed her rule. In particular, the text of the letters was taken to imply that Queen Mary colluded with Bothwell in the murder of her husband, [[Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]]. Mary's contemporary supporters, including [[Adam Blackwood]] dismissed them as complete forgeries or letters written by the Queen's servant [[Mary Beaton]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood, Adam, ''History of Mary Queen of Scots'' (Maitland Club, Glasgow, 1834), pp.82-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of the letters, now known only by copies, continues to be debated. Some historians argue that they were forgeries concocted in order to discredit Queen Mary, and ensure that [[Queen Elizabeth I]] supported the kingship of the infant [[James VI of Scotland]], rather than his mother. The historian [[John Hungerford Pollen (Jesuit)|John Hungerford Pollen]], in 1901, by comparing two genuine letters drafted by Mary, presented a subtle argument that the various surviving copies and translations of the casket letters could not be used as evidence of their original authorship by Mary.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Pollen, ''Papal Negotiotions with Mary Queen of Scots'' (SHS, Edinburgh, 1901), 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background: the abdication and the letters==
[[File:Marysign.jpg|thumb|The genuine [[autograph]] signature of '''Mary Queen of Scots''']]
[[File:MaryBeaton.jpg|thumb|left|Some historians claim that the letters were written by the queen's lady, [[Mary Beaton]]]]
The Queen's husband, [[Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], was killed in mysterious circumstances at the [[Kirk o'Field]] in Edinburgh on 10 February 1567, and she married the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] on 15 May 1567. Bothwell was widely thought to be the main suspect for Darnley's murder. The [[Regent Moray|Earl of Moray]], Mary's half-brother, and the 'Confederate Lords' rebelled against Queen Mary and raised an army in Edinburgh.

Mary surrendered at the [[Battle of Carberry Hill]] on 15 June 1567, was imprisoned at [[Lochleven Castle]], and on 24 July 1567 [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicated]]. Her infant son was crowned as [[James VI of Scotland]] on 29 July 1567 and Moray was made [[Regent of Scotland]]. At this time rumours spread that Mary had abdicated because of the discovery of letters which incriminated her. At the end of July 1567, the Earl of Moray, who was in London, told Guzman de Silva, Spanish ambassador to England, that he had heard of the finding of a letter in Mary's own handwriting to Bothwell which implicated her in the murder of Lord Darnley. He had not revealed this to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=86798 ''Calendar State Papers Spain (Simancas)'', vol.1 (1892), no.434] via British History Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Guy|authorlink=John Guy (historian)|title=My Heart is my Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots|location=London|publisher=Fourth Estate|year=2004|isbn=1-84115-753-8|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of August 1567, [[Edmund Grindal]], [[Bishop of London]], had heard that letters in Mary's handwriting urging Bothwell to hurry up with the killing of Darnley had been found in a box of Bothwell's papers, and the Bishop sent this news to the Reformer [[Henry Bullinger]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Robinson, ed., ''Zurich Letters, 1558-1579, Epistolae Tigurinae'', (Cambridge 1842), 197-8 in English, 117 Latin, "Fama est, in scriniis Bothwellii inventas fuisse literas ipsiusmet Reginae manu scriptas, in quibus Bothwellius ad necem regis mariti accelerandum hortata est."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the document called "Hay's Book of Articles," compiled by the Confederate Lords in November 1568, which narrates events from Darnley's murder to Moray's Regency, the casket and letters were found and made known before Queen Mary agreed to abdicate, and public opinion after their discovery had brought her to that decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.2 (1900), p. 558, Hay's Articles&lt;/ref&gt; Moray convened his Privy Council on 4 December 1567. They made and signed a statement in preparation for the [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] to enact Mary's abdication, which stated the letters demonstrated Mary's involvement in the murder;&lt;blockquote&gt;"in so far as by diverse her previe letters writtin and subscrivit with hir awin hand and sent by hir to James erll Boithvile chief executor of the said horrible murthour, ..., it is maist certain that sche wes previe, art and part (complicit) and of the actuale devise (plot) and deid of the foir-nemmit murther of her lawful husband the King our sovereign lord's father."&lt;ref&gt;''CSP. Scotland'', vol.2 (1900), p.398 no.632&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mary escaped from Lochleven and made her way to England in May 1568. Her status was uncertain, as she had been accused of crimes and misrule. [[Elizabeth I of England]] ordered an inquiry into the question of whether Queen Mary should be tried for the murder of Darnley, as accused by the Scottish Lords who had deposed Queen Mary the year before. Moray came to England and showed the "casket letters" to Queen Elizabeth's officers.

==Conference at York, Westminster, and Hampton Court==
[[File:Thomas Howard 4th Duke of Norfolk 1565.jpg|thumb|In 1571, the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] was accused of trying to cover up the letters.]]
Nearly a year later, in October 1568, the Earl of Moray produced the Casket letters at a conference in [[York]], headed by [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. Moray again showed the casket letters at [[Westminster Palace|Westminster]] on 7 December 1568. The letters, sonnets, divorce and marriage contract were examined at [[Hampton Court]] on 14 December 1568, and the handwriting compared with Mary's letters to Queen Elizabeth. The evidence produced by the Scottish Earls, who were now sworn to secrecy by the English Privy council, was perhaps bewildering;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the whole writings lying altogether upoun the counsel table, the same were showed one after another by hap [chance], as the same did ly on the table, than with any choyse made, as by the natures thereof, if time had so served might have been."&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, ''Examination'', Volume 2, p. 256-259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For overriding political reasons, Queen Elizabeth neither wished to accuse Queen Mary of murder nor acquit her of the same, so the conference was intended as a political show. Queen Mary was refused the right to be present, though her accusers, including Moray, were permitted to be present.

The outcome was that the Casket letters were accepted by the English commissioners as genuine after a study of the handwriting, and of the information contained therein. However, Queen Mary's commissioners were refused access to the letters to review or to study them. Yet, as Queen Elizabeth had wished, the inquiry reached the conclusion that nothing was proven. The outcome of the enquiry was to prolong doubts about Mary's character that Elizabeth used to prevent the Queens meeting.

==Accusations of collusion at York==
[[File:King's Manor, York - DSC07900.JPG|thumb|left|Regent Moray first showed the letters to Norfolk at the [[King's Manor]], in York]]
The meeting at York was established as a conference to negotiate an Anglo-Scottish treaty. [[John Lesley]], Mary's secretary, heard from one of her accusers, [[William Maitland of Lethington]], that Elizabeth's purpose was "not to end her cause at this time, but to hold the same in suspense". Maitland had heard this from the presiding officer at York, the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], while they were out riding together to [[Cawood]] on 16 October 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary historian, [[George Buchanan]], who was present at York amongst the Scottish commissioners, described Maitland and Lethington's ride, and their agreement not to reach a decisive conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, George (1582). ''History of Scotland: Rerum Scoticarum Historia''. Book 19. Chap. 16-19. In: Aikman, James (1827). [https://books.google.com/books?id=sjgQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA543 ''History of Scotland'']. Volume 2. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Maitland of Lethington.jpg|thumb|[[William Maitland of Lethington]] was said to have played a double role at York]]

This conversation came to light, having been found in Lesley's correspondence, and was cited in the charges of treason against Norfolk in January 1571. He was also charged with planning to marry the Scottish Queen, and asking Moray to suppress evidence against her at York.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, ''A Collection of State Papers'', Volume 1, p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1571, Lesley testified that he had spoken with Norfolk in a gallery at York, after conferring with Lethington, and Norfolk was convinced that the publication of the letters would dishonour Mary forever.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Murdin, ''A Collection of State Papers'', Volume 2, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; When Norfolk was questioned about the conversations at York, he said that Lethington had told him he was working for Mary. Lethington, said Norfolk, began to make him think Mary was innocent and planted the idea that he should marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Murdin, ''A Collection of State Papers'', Volume 2, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Norfolk was executed for treason in 1572.

Lesley, who was a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]], said that Lethington had sent copies of the casket letters to Mary (who was at [[Bolton Castle]]), but Lethington's messenger, Robert Melville, denied it.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Andrew (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/miscellanyscott00socigoog#page/n152/mode/2up "Apology for Maitland"]. ''Miscellany of the Scottish History Society''. Volume 2. Edinburgh. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesley also alleged there had been a plot to murder Moray on his return as he passed through [[North Allerton]], but because Norfolk had persuaded Moray to be more favourable, the assassination was called off.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Murdin, ''A Collection of State Papers'', Volume 2, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the York-Westminster conference, on 22 January 1569, Queen Elizabeth wrote to the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (d. 1572)|Earl and Countess of Mar]], who were the keepers of James VI at [[Stirling Castle]], to counter rumours that Moray had made speeches and secret treaties in England to ensure that he would become King of Scotland to the prejudice of the young King.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reportonmanuscr03manugoog#page/n50 ''Report on the Manuscripts of the Earl of Mar and Kellie'']. Volume 1. York: Ben Johnson &amp; Co. 1904. pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent fate of the letters==
[[File:Informatics Forum - geograph.org.uk - 929224.jpg|thumb|The Casket letters were said to have been discovered in a house in Potterrow, now the [[University of Edinburgh]] [[Informatics Forum]]]]
The charges against Queen Mary, known as Hay's Articles, were drawn up in November 1568; they state that the Earl of Bothwell, while planning his escape from Scotland, sent his servant, George Dalgleish, to fetch the letters from [[Edinburgh Castle]], so that the "ground of the cause should never come to light". However, after recovering the letters, Dalgleish was captured by Mary's enemies, among them [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;Bain, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morton testified in December 1568 that on 20 June 1567,&lt;ref&gt;Morton's declaration, made in December 1568, was first noted in ''5th Report: Manuscripts of Alexander Malet'' (1883), p. 308-9. The document passed to the [[British Museum]] and was published in full by [[T.F. Henderson]] in ''Casket Letters'', pp. 90-104 &amp; appendix A, and in ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, p. 730-1. As T.F. Henderson points out, its detail undermines some arguments of previous historians.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalgleish offered, under the threat of torture, to take his captors to a house in Potterrow, Edinburgh. Under a bed, they found a silver box engraved with an "F" (perhaps for [[Francis II of France]]), containing the Casket letters and a number of other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate.&lt;ref name="MacRobert"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacRobert|first=A. E.|title=Mary, Queen of Scots and the casket letters|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2002|series=International Library of Historical Studies|volume=25|isbn=978-1-86064-829-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bain, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, pp. 569-571, 730-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Morton passed the casket and letters into the keeping of Regent Moray on 6 September 1568. Morton declared he had not altered the contents and Moray promised to kept them intact and available to Morton and the Confederate Lords in order that they could explain their actions in future; "quhen-so-evir thai sal haif to do thair-with, for manifesting of the ground and equitie of their procedingis."&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, 1545-1569'', vol.1 (1879), p.641&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Walsingham.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francis Walsingham]] had an agent in Scotland looking for the letters]]
The letters seem to have been retained by the [[Clan Douglas|Douglas family]] after the sudden arrest and execution of Regent Morton in 1581. There were hints that George Douglas, brother of [[William Douglas of Lochleven]], had merchandise of letters "worth the sight" in 1582, but this may refer to his attempts to negotiate for Queen Mary's return to Scotland at this time, called the "Association".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 6, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moysie, David (1830). ''Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland''. Volume 1. Bannatyne Club. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1582, the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] heard from James Douglas, [[Pluscarden Abbey|Prior of Pluscarden]], that both the coffer and the "originals of the letters betwixt the Scottish Queen and the earl of Bothwell" had been delivered to the [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Earl of Gowrie]], who was leading the government of Scotland at that time. Bowes had been trying to find the whereabouts of the originals for [[Francis Walsingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Correspondence of Robert Bowes'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes asked Gowrie if he would send them to Elizabeth, saying that he had made previous arrangements for this, and established that Gowrie got them from Sanders Jordan. Jordan was known as one of Regent Morton's confidential servants and had been forced to testify at Morton's trial.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 5, pp. 671, 684.&lt;/ref&gt; Gowrie explained that the letters were still relevant to those who deposed the Queen. Bowes argued that recent events and establishments were confirmed by acts of parliament and public instruments and the letters were not now significant. Gowrie would not give him the letters.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Correspondence of Robert Bowes'', p. 240-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes asked Gowrie again later in November, and wrote to Walsingham saying he had told Gowrie that Queen Mary was now claiming they were forgeries, and was hoping to obtain them herself to deface and destroy them (perhaps to further the "Association".) Bowes argued that Mary had the means to steal them from Scotland and they would be safer in England. Gowrie said he would have to tell the King about the request and Bowes preferred not.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Correspondence of Robert Bowes'', p. 253-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In their next interview, Gowrie told Bowes that James VI already knew where the letters were.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Correspondence of Robert Bowes'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The originals of the letters were probably destroyed in 1584 by James VI.&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, Caroline (1995). ''Darnley: A Life of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Consort of Mary Queen of Scots''. Constable. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Only copies exist; one is in French, and the others are translations from the French into [[Scots language|Scots]] and English. The nature of these documents – authentic, [[forgery|forged]], or only partly forged – has been the subject of much discussion for more than four hundred years.

Purportedly the silver casket itself was acquired by Mary Gordon, wife to the [[William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas|1st Marquis of Douglas]]. Following her death, it was sold to a goldsmith, but was later reacquired by her daughter-in law, [[Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton]]. The casket originally had the Queen's arms engraved upon it, but was replaced successively by the arms of the Marchioness, then the Duchess. Together with other memorabilia related to the Queen, the casket is currently on display at [[Lennoxlove House]], [[East Lothian]], which was formerly "Lethington House", Maitland's family home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamilton.rcahms.gov.uk/treasures11.html "Lennoxlove Casket"], Hamilton Palace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The copy letters==
Four translated copies were preserved by the descendents of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]]. The copies do not reproduce signatures or dates, and they contain endorsements made by the copyist that indicate how the letters were to be used against Queen Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', p. 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of some of the letters and sonnets were printed in [[George Buchanan]]'s polemic ''Detectio Mariæ Reginæ'' and ''Dectectioun'', and reprinted by James Anderson in 1727. [[Walter Goodall]], in 1754, printed parallel English, French, and Latin versions without the clerk's endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, ''Examination'', Volume 2, pp. 1-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century historian [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] pointed out that the Scottish edition of Buchanan's ''Detectioun'' appears to preserve the original French opening lines of the letters introducing their translations, while the complete French texts seem to be merely translations from printed Latin or English copies.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, William, "A critical dissertation concerning the murder of King Henry", in ''History of Scotland during the reigns of Queen Mary and of King James VI'', vol. 2, (1794), pp.364-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Four other copy letters and other copy documents were preserved in the English state papers and the [[Cotton library|Cotton Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;Bain, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotton Caligula C.I. folio 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were printed in the ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, ''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'', Volume 2, Appendix 2, pp. 722-730.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French sonnets, said to have been found in the casket, were printed in Anderson's ''Collections'', Volume 2, with [[Scots language|Scottish translations]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Collections'', Volume 2, pp. 115-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Goodall reprinted the twelve poems in ''Examination'', Volume 2.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, ''Examination'', Volume 2, Appendix 9, pp. 45-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The sonnets can be evaluated as French literature.&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin, Marie; Bell, Sandra; Brace, Patricia (2012).

[[File:Tiberius Capri Louvre Ma1248.jpg|thumb|Statue of the Emperor [[Tiberius]] showing the draped toga of the 1st century AD.]]
'''Clothing in ancient Rome''' generally comprised a short-sleeved or sleeveless, knee-length [[tunic]] for men and boys, and a longer, usually sleeved tunic for women and girls. On formal occasions, adult male citizens could wear a woolen [[toga]], draped over their tunic, and married citizen women wore a woolen mantle, known as a [[Palla (garment)|palla]], over a [[stola]], a simple, long-sleeved, voluminous garment that hung to midstep. Clothing, footwear and accoutrements identified gender, status, rank and social class, and thus offered a means of social control. This was probably most apparent in the segregation of seating tiers at public theatres, games and festivals, and in the distinctive, privileged official dress of [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]], [[Religion in ancient Rome#Public priesthoods and religious law|priesthoods]] and [[Ancient Roman military clothing|the military]].  
 
The toga was considered Rome's "national costume" but for day-to-day activities, most Romans preferred more casual, practical and comfortable clothing; the tunic, in various forms, was the basic garment for all classes, both sexes and most occupations. It was usually made of linen, and was augmented as necessary with underwear, or with various kinds of cold-or-wet weather wear, such as knee-breeches for men, and cloaks, coats and hats. In colder parts of the empire, full length trousers were worn. Most urban Romans wore shoes, slippers, boots or [[sandal]]s of various types; in the countryside, some wore [[clog]]s.

Most clothing was simple in structure and basic form, and its production required minimal cutting and tailoring, but all was produced by hand and every process required skill, knowledge and time. Spinning and weaving were thought virtuous, frugal occupations for Roman women of all classes. Wealthy matrons, including [[Augustus]]' wife [[Livia]], might show their traditionalist values by producing home-spun clothing, but most men and women who could afford it bought their clothing from specialist artisans. Relative to the overall basic cost of living, even simple clothing was expensive, and was recycled many times down the social scale. 
 
Rome's governing elite produced [[Sumptuary law|laws designed to limit]] public displays of personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful, as the same wealthy elite had an appetite for luxurious and fashionable clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk [[damask]]s, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or [[Tyrian purple]]. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The fastenings and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.

==Tunics and undergarments==
[[File:Mosaïque des bikinis, Piazza Armerina.jpg|thumb|right|4th-century mosaic from [[Villa del Casale]], [[Sicily]], showing "bikini girls" in an athletic contest]]
The basic garment for both genders and all classes was the ''[[tunic]]a'' (tunic). In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from the eastern part of the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility; nevertheless, very long-sleeved, loosely belted tunics were also fashionably ''louche'' and were adopted by some Roman men; for example, by [[Julius Caesar]]. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted.&lt;ref&gt;Heskel, J., p. 134 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; For comfort and protection from cold, both sexes could wear a soft under-tunic or vest (''subucula'') beneath a coarser over-tunic; in winter, the Emperor [[Augustus]], whose physique and constitution were never particularly robust, wore up to four tunics, over a vest.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'', 82&lt;/ref&gt; Although essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 71–72 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Loincloths, known as ''[[Subligaculum|subligacula]]'' or ''[[Subligaculum|subligaria]]'' could be worn under a tunic. They could also be worn on their own, particularly by slaves who engaged in hot, sweaty or dirty work. Women wore both loincloth and ''strophium'' (a breast cloth) under their tunics; and some wore tailored underwear for work or leisure.&lt;ref name="Goldman, N. 1994, pp. 223, 233"&gt;Goldman, N., pp. 223 and 233 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th-century AD Sicillian mosaic shows several "bikini girls" performing athletic feats; in 1953 a Roman leather bikini bottom was excavated from a well in London.

==Formal wear for citizens==

He wears senatorial shoes, and a ''[[toga praetexta]]'' of "skimpy" (''exigua'') Republican type.&lt;ref&gt;Ceccarelli, L. (2016) p. 33 in Bell, S., and Carpino, A. A. (eds) ''A Companion to the Etruscans''. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35274-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue features an inscription in the [[Etruscan alphabet]]]]

Roman society was graded into several citizen and non-citizen classes and ranks, ruled by a powerful minority of wealthy, landowning citizen-aristocrats. Even the lowest grade of citizenship carried certain privileges denied to non-citizens, such as the right to vote for representation in government. In [[Mos maiorum|tradition and law]], an individual's place in the citizen-hierarchy – or outside it – should be immediately evident in their clothing. The seating arrangements at theatres and games enforced this idealised social order, with varying degrees of success.

In literature and poetry, Romans were the ''gens togata'' ("togate race"), descended from a tough, virile, intrinsically noble peasantry of hard-working, toga-wearing men and women. The toga's origins are uncertain; it may have begun as a simple, practical work-garment and blanket for peasants and herdsmen. It eventually became formal wear for male citizens; at much the same time, respectable female citizens adopted the ''stola''. The morals, wealth and reputation of citizens were subject to [[Roman censor|official scrutiny]]. Male citizens who failed to meet a minimum standard could be demoted in rank, and denied the right to wear a toga; by the same token, female citizens could be denied the stola. Respectable citizens of either sex might thus be distinguished from freedmen, foreigners, slaves and [[Infamia|infamous persons]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, J. C., p. 25 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toga===
{{Main|Toga}}
The ''toga virilis'' ("toga of manhood") was a semi-elliptical, white woolen cloth some 6 feet in width and 12 feet in length, draped across the shoulders and around the body. It was usually worn over a plain white linen tunic. A commoner's ''toga virilis'' was a naturally off-white; the senatorial version was more voluminous, and brighter. The ''toga praetexta'' of curule magistrates and some priesthoods added a wide purple edging, and was worn over a tunic with two vertical purple stripes. It could also be worn by noble and freeborn boys and girls, and represented their protection under civil and divine law. ''Equites'' wore the ''[[trabea]]'' (a shorter, "equestrian" form of white toga or a purple-red wrap, or both) over a white tunic with two narrow vertical purple-red stripes. The ''toga pulla'', used for mourning, was made of dark wool. The rare, prestigious ''toga picta'' and ''tunica palmata'' were purple, embroidered with gold. They were originally awarded to Roman generals for the day of their triumph, but became official dress for emperors and Imperial consuls.

From at least the late Republic onward, the upper classes favoured ever longer and larger togas, increasingly unsuited to manual work or physically active leisure. Togas were expensive, heavy, hot and sweaty, hard to keep clean, costly to launder and challenging to wear correctly. They were best suited to stately processions, oratory, sitting in the theatre or circus, and self-display among peers and inferiors while "ostentatiously doing nothing" at ''[[Toga#Patrons and clients|salutationes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Braund, Susanna, and Osgood, Josiah, eds. (2012) ''A Companion to Persius and Juvenal'', Wiley-Blackwell, p. 79. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early morning, formal "greeting sessions" were an essential part of Roman life, in which [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]] attended their patrons, competing for favours or investment in business ventures. A client who dressed well and correctly – in his toga, if a citizen – showed respect for himself and his patron, and might stand out among the crowd. A canny patron might equip his entire family, his friends, freedmen, even his slaves, with elegant, costly and impractical clothing, impyling his entire extended family's condition as one of "honorific leisure" (''[[otium]]''), buoyed by limitless wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Braund, Susanna, and Osgood, Josiah eds. (2012) ''A Companion to Persius and Juvenal'', Wiley-Blackwell. p. 65. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast [[Plebeian|majority of citizens]] had to work for a living, and avoided wearing the toga whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vout|Vout]], pp. 205–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. the description of Roman clothing, including the toga, as "simple and elegant, practical and comfortable" by Goldman, B., p. 217 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Several emperors tried to compel its use as the public dress of true ''[[Romanitas]]'' but none were particularly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, J. C., p. 96 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy clung to it as a mark of their prestige, but eventually abandoned it for the more comfortable and practical [[Pallium (Roman cloak)|pallium]].

===Stola and palla===
[[File:Torso femenino romano - Iponuba (M.A.N.) 01.jpg|thumb|Roman marble torso from the 1st century AD, showing a woman's clothing]]
Besides tunics, married citizen women wore a simple garment known as a [[stola]] (pl. stolae) which was associated with traditional Roman female virtues, especially modesty.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow, M.E. ‘Dressing to please themselves: clothing choices for Roman Women’ in Harlow, M.E. (ed.) Dress and identity (University of Birmingham IAA Interdisciplinary Series: Studies in Archaeology, History, Literature and Art 2), 2012, Archaeopress, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt; In the early [[Roman Republic]], the ''stola'' was reserved to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] women. Shortly before the [[Second Punic War]], the right to wear it was extended to plebeian matrons, and to freedwomen who had acquired the status of matron through marriage to a citizen. Stolae typically comprised two rectangular segments of cloth joined at the side by [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] and buttons in a manner allowing the garment to be draped in elegant but concealing folds.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 48–50 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Over the stola, citizen-women often wore the [[Palla (garment)|palla]], a sort of rectangular shawl up to 11 feet long, and five wide. It could be worn as a coat, or draped over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then over the left arm. Outdoors and in public, a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#castus, castitas|chaste]] matron's hair was bound up in woolen bands (fillets, or ''vitae'') in a high-piled style known as ''tutulus''. Her face was concealed from the public, male gaze with a veil; her palla could also serve as a hooded cloak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/clothing2.html Roman Clothing, Part II]. Vroma.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., p. 228 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two ancient literary sources mention use of a coloured strip or edging (a ''limbus'') on a woman's "mantle", or on the hem of their tunic; probably a mark of their high status, and presumably purple.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J.

Some modern scholars doubt the "togate adulteress" as more than literary and social invective: cf Dixon, J., in Harlow, M., and Nosch, M-L., (Editors) ''Greek and Roman Textiles and Dress: An Interdisciplinary Anthology'', Oxbow Books, 2014, pp. 298–304. Some, on similar grounds, doubt both the "togate adulteress" and the "togate meretrix": see Knapp, Robert, ''Invisible Romans'', Profile Books, 2013, pp. 256 – 257, citing [[Horace]], ''Satires'' 1.2.63, 82., and ''Sulpicia'' (in [[Tibullus]], ''Elegies'', 3.16.3 – 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedmen, freedwomen and slaves==
For citizens, ''salutationes'' meant wearing the toga appropriate to their rank.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vout|Vout]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  For freedmen, it meant whatever dress disclosed their status and wealth; a man should be what he seemed, and low rank was no bar to making money. Freedmen were forbidden to wear any kind of toga. Elite invective mocked the aspirations of wealthy, upwardly mobile freedmen who boldly flouted this prohibition, donned a toga, or even the ''trabea'' of an ''equites'', and inserted themselves as equals among their social superiors at the games and theatres. If detected, they were evicted from their seats.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, J., pp. 31–34 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the commonplace snobbery and mockery of their social superiors, some freedmen and freedwomen were highly cultured, and most would have had useful personal and business connections through their former master. Those with an aptitude for business could amass a fortune; and many did. They could function as patrons in their own right, fund public and private projects, own grand town-houses, and "dress to impress".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, John R. (1992) ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 BC-AD 250. Ritual, Space and Decoration''. University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton. p. 4. {{ISBN|9780520084292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more general discussion see Wilson, A., and Flohr, M. eds.

There was no standard costume for slaves; they might dress well, badly, or barely at all, depending on circumstance and the will of their owner. Urban slaves in prosperous households might wear some form of [[livery]]; cultured slaves who served as household tutors might be indistinguishable from well-off freedmen. Slaves serving out in the mines might wear nothing. For [[Appian]], a slave dressed as well as his master signalled the end of a stable, well-ordered society. According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], tutor to [[Nero]], a proposal that all slaves be made to wear a particular type of clothing was abandoned, for fear that the slaves should realise both their own overwhelming numbers, and the vulnerability of their masters. Advice to farm-owners by [[Cato the Elder]] and [[Columella]] on the regular supply of adequate clothing to farm-slaves was probably intended to mollify their otherwise harsh conditions, and maintain their obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bradley, Keith R.|title=Roman Slavery and Roman Law|journal=Historical Reflections |volume=15|issue=3|year= 1988|pages=477–495|jstor=23232665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appian ''Civil Wars'', 2.120; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''On Mercy'', 1. 24. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Keith R.

==Children and adolescents==
Roman infants were usually [[swaddling|swaddled]]. Apart from those few, typically formal garments reserved for adults, most children wore a scaled-down version of what their parents wore. Girls often wore a long tunic that reached the foot or instep, belted at the waist and very simply decorated, most often white. Outdoors, they might wear another tunic over it. Boy's tunics were shorter.

Boys and girls wore amulets to protect them from immoral or baleful influences such as the evil eye and sexual predation. For boys, the amulet was a ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', worn around the neck; the equivalent for girls was a crescent-shaped [[Lunula (amulet)|lunula]]. The ''[[toga praetexta]]'', which was thought to offer similar [[apotropaic]] protection, was formal wear for freeborn boys until puberty, when they gave their ''toga praetexta'' and childhood ''bulla'' into the care of their family [[lares]] and put on the adult male's ''toga virilis''. According to some Roman literary sources, freeborn girls might also wear – or at least, had the right to wear – a ''toga praetexta'' until marriage, when they offered their childhood toys, and perhaps their maidenly ''praetexta'' to ''[[Fortuna|Fortuna Virginalis]]''; others claim a gift made to the family ''Lares'', or to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], as part of their passage to adulthood. In traditionalist families, unmarried girls might be expected to wear their hair demurely bound in a [[Fillet (clothing)|fillet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hersch, Karen K. (2010) ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 66–67. {{ISBN|9780521124270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., p. 47 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding such attempts to protect the maidenly virtue of Roman girls, there is little anecdotal or artistic evidence of their use or effective imposition. Some unmarried daughters of respectable families seem to have enjoyed going out and about in flashy clothing, jewellery, perfume and make-up;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Kelly (2008) ''Dress and the Roman Woman: Self-Presentation and Society''. Routledge. pp. 16–20. {{ISBN|9780415414760}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some parents, anxious to find the best and wealthiest possible match for their daughters, seem to have encouraged it.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Kelly, pp. 143–149 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans used a wide variety of practical and decorative footwear, all of it flat soled (without [[heel (shoe)|heel]]s). Outdoor shoes were often [[hobnail]]ed for grip and durability.&lt;ref name="Alexandra Croom"&gt;{{cite book |last=Croom |first=Alexandra |date=2010 |title=Roman Clothing and Fashion |location=The Hill, Stroud, Gloucestershire |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=978-1-84868-977-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of footwear were a one-piece shoe (''carbatina''), sometimes with semi-openwork uppers: a usually thin-soled [[sandal]] (''solea''), secured with thongs: a laced, soft half-shoe (''[[soccus]]''): a usually hobnailed, thick-soled walking shoe (''[[calcea]]''): and a heavy-duty, hobnailed standard-issue military marching boot (''[[caliga]]''). Thick-soled wooden [[clog]]s, with leather uppers, were available for use in wet weather, and by rustics and field-slaves&lt;ref name = "The World of Roman Costume 105-113"&gt;Goldman, N., pp. 105–113 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoemakers employed sophisticated strapwork and delicate cutting to create intricate decorative patterns. Indoors, most reasonably well-off Romans of both sexes wore slippers or light shoes of felt or leather.&lt;ref name = "The World of Roman Costume 105-113"/&gt; Brides on their wedding-day may have worn distinctively orange-coloured light soft shoes or slippers (''lutei socci'').&lt;ref&gt;Stone, S., ''in'' Edmondson, J. C., p. 27 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]; see also [[Clothing in ancient Rome#Colours and dyes|Colours and dyes]] in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public protocol required red ankle boots for senators, and shoes with crescent-shaped buckles for ''equites'', though some wore Greek-style sandals to  "go with the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;Shumba, L., ''in'' Edmondson, J. C., and Keith, A., (Editors), ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson, J. C., pp. 45–47 and note 75 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt; Costly footwear was a mark of wealth or status, but being completely unshod need not be a mark of poverty. [[Cato the younger]] showed his impeccable Republican [[Mos maiorum|morality]] by going publicly barefoot; many images of the Roman gods, and later, statues of the [[Divus|semi-divine]] [[Augustus]], were unshod.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, S., p. 16 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stout, A. M., p. 93 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]: the gods needed no footwear, having "no need to touch the ground"&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashions in footwear reflected changes in social conditions. For example, during the unstable middle Imperial era, the military was overtly favoured as the true basis for power; at around this time, a so-called "Gallic sandal" – up to 4 inches broad at the toe – developed as outdoor wear for men and boys, reminiscent of the military boot. Meanwhile, outdoor footwear for women, young girls and children remained elegantly pointed at the toe.&lt;ref name = "The World of Roman Costume 105-113"/&gt;

==Military costume==
{{Main|Ancient Roman military clothing}}
[[Image:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3bis.jpg|thumb|left|Levy of the army during the taking of the [[Roman census]], detail from the marble-sculpted [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], 122–115 BC, showing two [[Roman army of the mid-Republic|Polybian-era]] soldiers (''[[Roman legion|pedites]]'') wearing [[chain mail]] and wielding a ''[[gladius]]'' and ''[[Scutum (shield)|scutum]]'', opposite an aristocratic cavalryman (''[[eques (ancient Rome)|eques]]'')]]

For the most part, common soldiers seem to have dressed in belted, knee-length tunics for work or leisure. In the northern provinces, the traditionally short sleeved tunic might be replaced by a warmer, long-sleeved version. Soldiers on active duty wore short trousers under a military kilt, sometimes with a leather jerkin or felt padding to cushion their armour, and a triangular scarf tucked in at the neck.&lt;ref name="Goldman, N. 1994, pp. 223, 233"/&gt; For added protection from wind and weather, they could wear the ''[[sagum]]'', a heavy-duty cloak also worn by civilians. According to Roman tradition, soldiers had once worn togas to war, hitching them up with what was known as a "Gabine cinch"; but by the mid-Republican era, this was only used for sacrificial rites and a formal declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, S., p. 13 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, citizen-soldiers wore togas only for formal occasions. [[Cicero]]'s "sagum-wearing" soldiers versus "toga-wearing" civilians are rhetorical and literary trope, referring to a wished-for transition from military might to peaceful, civil authority.&lt;ref name="Phang, Sar Elise 2008, p. 82-83"&gt;[[#Phang|Phang]], pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, John, ''Making a New Man: Ciceronian Self-Fashioning in the Rhetorical Works'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 61–65, citing Cicero's ''Ad Pisonem'' (Against Piso).&lt;/ref&gt; When on duty in the city, the [[Praetorian guard]] concealed their weapons beneath their white "civilian" togas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phang|Phang]], pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sagum'' distinguished common soldiers from the highest ranking commanders, who wore a larger, purple-red cloak, the ''paludamentum''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sebesta|Sebesta]], pp. 133, 191&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of the ranker's ''sagum'' is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Its modern recreation as an intense red, or indeed any shade of red, is based on slender, unreliable literary evidence; see [[#Phang|Phang]], pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Roman military clothing was probably less uniform and more adaptive to local conditions and supplies than is suggested by its idealised depictions in contemporary literature, statuary and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The columns of [[Trajan's column|Trajan]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] represent such idealised forms of military clothing and armour.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Rome's levies abroad were supposed to represent Rome in her purest form; provincials were supposed to adopt Roman ways, not ''vice versa''. Even when foreign garments – such as trousers – proved more practical than standard issue, soldiers and commanders who used them were viewed with disdain and alarm by their more conservative compatriots, for undermining Rome's military ''virtus'' by "going native".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phang|Phang]], pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Erdkamp|Erdkamp]], pp. 237, 541&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Mediterranean climates, soldiers typically wore [[hobnail]]ed "open boots" (''[[Caligus|caligae]]''). In colder and wetter climates, an enclosing "shoeboot" was preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., pp. 122, 125 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Vindolanda tablets]] mention the despatch of clothing – including cloaks, socks, and warm underwear – by families to their relatives, serving at [[Brittania]]'s northern frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Alan K (1994) ''Life and Letters on the Roman Frontier'', British Museum Press. pp. 45–46, 71–72. {{ISBN|9780415920247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early and middle Republican era, conscripted soldiers and their officers were expected to provide or pay for all their personal equipment. From the late republic onwards, they were salaried professionals, and bought their own clothing from legionary stores, quartermasters or civilian contractors. Military needs were prioritised. Clothing was expensive to start with, and the military demand was high; this inevitably pushed up prices, and a common soldier's clothing expenses could be more than a third of his annual pay. In the rampant inflation of the later Imperial era, as currency and salaries were devalued, deductions from military salaries for clothing and other staples were replaced by payments in kind, leaving common soldiers cash-poor, but adequately clothed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Erdkamp|Erdkamp]], pp. 81, 83, 310–312&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious offices and ceremonies==
Most priesthoods were reserved to high status, male Roman citizens, usually magistrates or ex-magistrates. Most traditional religious rites required that the priest wore a ''toga praetexta'', in a manner described as ''capite velato'' (head covered [by a fold of the toga]) when performing augury, reciting prayers or supervising at sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Robert (1996) "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464, or the Hazards of Interpretation", p. 83 in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic''. Franz Steiner. {{ISBN|9783515069489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a rite prescribed the free use of both arms, the priest could employ the ''cinctus Gabinus'' ("Gabine cinch") to tie back the toga's inconvenient folds.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid|Scheid, John]] (2003) ''An Introduction to Roman Religion''. Indiana University Press, p. 80. {{ISBN|9780253216601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman statue of a ''[[#Vestalis Maxima|Virgo Vestalis Maxima]]'' (Senior Vestal)]]
The [[Vestal Virgins]] tended Rome's sacred fire, in Vesta's temple, and prepared essential sacrificial materials employed by different cults of the Roman state. They were highly respected, and possessed unique rights and privileges; their persons were sacred and inviolate. Their presence was required at various religious and civil rites and ceremonies. Their costume was predominantly white, woolen, and had elements in common with high-status [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Roman bridal dress]]. They wore a white, priestly ''infula'', a white ''suffibulum'' (veil) and a white [[Palla (garment)|palla]], with red ribbons to symbolise their devotion to Vesta's sacred fire, and white ribbons as a mark of their purity.&lt;ref&gt;Wildfang, R. L. (2006) ''Rome's Vestal Virgins: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire'', Routledge, p. 54. {{ISBN|9780415397964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Statue of Gallus priest.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Statue of a Gallus priest, 2nd century, [[Capitoline Museums|Musei Capitolini]].]]

The [[Flamen]] priesthood was dedicated to various [[Religion in ancient Rome|deities of the Roman state]]. They wore a close-fitting, rounded cap (''[[Apex (headdress)|Apex]]'') topped with a spike of olive-wood; and the ''laena'', a long, semi-circular "flame-coloured" cloak fastened at the shoulder with a brooch or [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]. Their senior was the [[Flamen dialis]], who was the high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and was married to the [[Flamen dialis#Flamenica dialis|Flamenica dialis]]. He was not allowed to divorce, leave the city, ride a horse, touch iron, or see a corpse. The laena was thought to predate the toga.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., pp. 229–230 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve [[Salii]] ("leaping priests" of Mars) were young patrician men, who processed through the city in a form of war-dance during the festival of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], singing the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''. They too wore the ''apex'', but otherwise dressed as archaic warriors, in embroidered tunics and breastplates. Each carried a sword, wore a short, red military cloak (''[[paludamentum]])'' and ritually struck a bronze shield, whose ancient original was said to have fallen from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William; Wayte, William and Marindin, G. E. (1890). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DS%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Dsalii-cn ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'']. Albemarle Street, London. John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome recruited many non-native deities, cults and priesthoods as protectors and allies of the state. [[Aesculapius]], [[Apollo]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Proserpina]] were worshiped using the so-called "Greek rite", which employed Greek priestly dress, or a Romanised version of it. The priest presided in Greek fashion, with his head bare or wreathed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Roman Sacrifice", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 204 BC, the [[Galli]] priesthood were brought to Rome from [[Phrygia]], to serve the "[[Troy|Trojan]]" Mother Goddess [[Cybele]] and her consort  [[Attis]] on behalf of the Roman state. They were legally protected but flamboyantly "un-Roman". They were eunuchs, and [[Fortune teller|told fortunes]] for money; their public rites were wild, frenzied and bloody, and their priestly garb was "womanly". They wore long, flowing robes of yellow silk, extravagant jewellery, perfume and make-up, and turbans or exotic versions of the [[Phrygian cap|"phrygian" hat]] over long, bleached hair.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Mary (1994) "The Roman and the Foreign: The Cult of the "Great Mother" in Imperial Rome", pp. 164–190 in Thomas, N., and Humphrey, C., (eds) ''Shamanism, History and the State'', Anne Arbor, The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|9780472084012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermaseren, Maarten J.

==Roman clothing of Late Antiquity (after 284 AD)==
Roman fashions underwent very gradual change from the late Republic to the end of the Western empire, 600 years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodgers|Rodgers]], p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this reflects the expansion of Rome's empire, and the adoption of provincial fashions perceived as attractively exotic, or simply more practical than traditional forms of dress. Changes in fashion also reflect the increasing dominance of a military elite within government, and a corresponding reduction in the value and status of traditional civil offices and ranks. In the later empire after [[Diocletian]]'s reforms, clothing worn by soldiers and non-military government beaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embellished strips, ''clavi,'' and circular roundels, ''orbiculi,'' added to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements usually comprised geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Graham (2003).

Osprey Publishing. pp. 7–9. {{ISBN|1841765597}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of silk also increased steadily and most courtiers in late antiquity wore elaborate silk robes. Heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, revealing the general militarization of late Roman government. Trousers — considered barbarous garments worn by Germans and Persians — achieved only limited popularity in the latter days of the empire, and were regarded by conservatives as a sign of cultural decay.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodgers|Rodgers]], p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; The toga, traditionally seen as the sign of true ''Romanitas'', had never been popular or practical. Most likely, its official replacement in the East by the more comfortable ''pallium'' and ''paenula'' simply acknowledged its disuse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vout|Vout]], pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;  In early medieval Europe, kings and aristocrats dressed like the late Roman generals they sought to emulate, not like the older toga-clad senatorial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, Chris.

===Animal fibres===
====Wool====
Wool was the most commonly used fibre in Roman clothing. The [[sheep]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] were renowned for the quality of their wool, although the Romans never ceased trying to optimise the quality of wool through cross-breeding. [[Miletus]] in Asia Minor and the province of [[Gallia Belgica]] were also renowned for the quality of their wool exports, the latter producing a heavy, rough wool suitable for winter.&lt;ref name="Gabucci, Ada 2005"&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionaries of Civilization: Rome| author=Gabucci, Ada| publisher=University of California Press| year=2005| p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most garments, white wool was preferred; it could then be further bleached, or dyed. Naturally dark wool was used for the ''toga pulla'' and work garments subjected to dirt and stains.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., p. 66 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the provinces, private landowners and the State held large tracts of grazing land, where large numbers of sheep were raised and sheared. Their wool was processed and woven in dedicated manufactories. [[Britannia]] was noted for its woolen products, which included a kind of [[duffel coat]] (the ''[[Birrus]] Brittanicus)'', fine carpets, and felt linings for army helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wild, J. P.|title=Soft-finished Textiles in Roman Britain|journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume =17|issue =1|year=1967|pages=133–135|jstor=637772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silk====
{{further|Sino-Roman relations|Indo-Roman trade relations}}
[[File:Menade.jpg|thumb|A [[maenad]] wearing a [[silk]] gown, a Roman fresco from the [[Casa del Naviglio]] in [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD]]
[[Silk]] [[Han dynasty|from China]] was imported in significant quantities as early as the 3rd century BC. It was bought in its raw state by Roman traders at the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] ports of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Beirut, Lebanon|Beirut]], then woven and dyed.&lt;ref name="Gabucci, Ada 2005"/&gt; As Roman weaving techniques developed, silk yarn was used to make geometrically or freely figured [[damask]], [[Plain weave|tabbies]] and [[tapestry]]. Some of these silk fabrics were extremely fine – around 50 threads or more per centimeter. Production of such highly decorative, costly fabrics seems to have been a speciality of weavers in the eastern Roman provinces, where the earliest Roman horizontal looms were developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wild, J. P.|title=The Roman Horizontal Loom |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=459–471 |doi=10.2307/505366 |jstor=505366 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[sumptuary laws]] and price controls were passed to limit the purchase and use of silk. In the early Empire the Senate passed legislation forbidding the wearing of silk by men because it was viewed as effeminate&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Susan (1999) ''Life Along the Silk Road'', Berkeley University of California Press. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-520-23214-3}}. &lt;/ref&gt; but there was also a connotation of immorality or immodesty attached to women who wore the material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Chinese-Silk-in-the-Roman-Empire.pdf| title=Chinese Silk in the Roman Empire| publisher=www.saylor.org| p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as illustrated by [[Seneca the Elder]]:

"I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency,
can be called clothes... Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be
visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any
outsider or foreigner with his wife's body." (Declamations Vol. 1)

The Emperor [[Aurelian]] is said to have forbidden his wife to buy a mantle of [[Tyrian purple]] silk. The [[Historia Augusta]] claims that the emperor [[Elagabalus]] was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk (''holoserica'') as opposed to the usual silk/cotton blends (''subserica''); this is presented as further evidence of his notorious decadence.&lt;ref name="Gabucci, Ada 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Historia Augusta Vita Heliogabali|p=XXVI.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral dimensions aside, Roman importation and expenditure on silk represented a significant, inflationary drain on Rome's gold and silver coinage, to the benefit of foreign traders and loss to the empire. [[Diocletian]]'s [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] of 301 AD set the price of one [[Kilogram|kilo]] of raw silk at 4,000 gold coins.&lt;ref name="Gabucci, Ada 2005"/&gt;

[[Wild silk]], cocoons collected from the wild after the insect had eaten its way out, was also known;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Nat.His'' XI, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; being of shorter smaller lengths, its fibres had to be spun into somewhat thicker yarn than the cultivated variety. A rare luxury cloth with a beautiful golden sheen, known as [[sea silk]], was made from the long silky filaments or [[byssus]] produced by ''[[Pinna nobilis]]'', a large Mediterranean clam.&lt;ref&gt;"The project Sea-silk – Rediscovering an Ancient Textile Material." ''Archaeological Textiles Newsletter'', Number 35, Autumn 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant fibres===

====Linen====
[[Pliny the Elder]] describes the production of linen from flax and hemp. After harvesting, the plant stems were [[Retting|retted]] to loosen the outer layers and internal fibres, stripped, pounded and then smoothed. Following this, the materials were woven. Flax, like wool, came in various speciality grades and qualities. In Pliny's opinion, the whitest (and best) was imported from Spanish [[Xàtiva|Saetabis]]; at double the price, the strongest and most long-lasting was from [[Robbio|Retovium]]. The whitest and softest was produced in Latium, Falerii and Paelignium. Natural linen was a "greyish brown" that faded to off-white through repeated laundering and exposure to sunlight. It did not readily absorb the dyes in use at the time, and was generally bleached, or used in its raw, undyed state.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 66, 72 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other plant fibres====
[[Cotton]] from [[India]] was imported through the same Eastern Mediterranean ports that supplied Roman traders with silk and [[Spice trade|spices]].&lt;ref name="Gabucci, Ada 2005"/&gt; Raw cotton was sometimes used for padding. Once its seeds were removed, cotton could be spun, then woven into a soft, lightweight fabric appropriate for summer use; cotton was more comfortable than wool, less costly than silk, and unlike linen, it could be brightly dyed; for this reason, cotton and linen were sometimes interwoven to produce vividly coloured, soft but tough fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 68–72 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; High quality fabrics were also woven from [[Urtica dioica|nettle stems]]; poppy-stem fibre was sometimes interwoven with flax, to produce a glossy smooth, lightweight and luxuriant fabric. Preparation of such stem fibres involved similar techniques to those used for linen.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, S., p. 39, and note 9 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]], citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 8.74.195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
Ready-made clothing was available for all classes, at a price; the cost of a new cloak for an ordinary commoner might represent three fifths of their annual subsistence expenses. Clothing was recycled down the social scale, until it fell to rags; even these were useful, and ''centonarii'' ("patch-workers") made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vout|Vout]], pp. 211, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of slave-run farms and sheep-flocks were advised that whenever the opportunity arose, female slaves should be fully occupied in the production of homespun woolen cloth; this would likely be good enough for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;The notoriously parsimonious [[Cato the Elder]], in his ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'', 57, advises that slaves on farming estates be given a cloak and tunic every two years. [[Columella]] gives similar advice, adding that while homespun would likely be "too good" for the lowest class of rustic slave, it would not be good enough for their masters; but cf Augustus' pride in his homespun clothes. Sebesta, J. L., p. 70 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]], citing Columella, 12, praef. 9–10, 12.3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-sufficiency in clothing paid off. The carding, combing, spinning and weaving of wool were part of daily housekeeping for most women. Those of middling or low income could supplement their personal or family income by spinning and selling yarn, or by weaving fabric for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family's wool-baskets, spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area  (''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]''), where the [[mater familias]] and her [[Pater familias#The Roman familia|familia]] could thus demonstrate their industry and frugality; a largely symbolic and moral activity for those of their class, rather than practical necessity.&lt;ref&gt;In reality, she was the female equivalent of the romanticised citizen-farmer: [[#Flower|Flower]], pp. 153, 195–197&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus was particularly proud that his wife and daughter had set the best possible example to other Roman women by spinning and weaving his clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flower|Flower]], pp. 153–154, citing Suetonius, ''Life of Augustus'', 73&lt;/ref&gt; High-caste brides were expected to make their own wedding garments, using a traditional vertical loom.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 55–61 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most fabric and clothing was produced by professionals whose trades, standards and specialities were protected by guilds; these in turn were recognised and regulated by local authorities.&lt;ref name="Goldman, B. 1994, p. 221"/&gt; Pieces were woven as closely as possible to their intended final shape, with minimal waste, cutting and sewing thereafter. Once a woven piece of fabric was removed from the loom, its loose end-threads were tied off, and left as a decorative fringe, hemmed, or used to add differently coloured "Etruscan style" borders, as in the purple-red border of the ''toga praetexta'', and the vertical coloured stripe of some tunics;&lt;ref name="Goldman, B. 1994, p. 221"&gt;Goldman, B., p. 221 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; a technique known as "tablet weaving".&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, G. E. (2016) p. 331 in Bell, S., and Carpino, A. A. (eds) ''A Companion to the Etruscans''. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35274-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving on an upright, hand-powered loom was a slow process. The earliest evidence for the transition from vertical to more efficient horizontal, foot-powered looms comes from Egypt, around 298 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carroll, D.L.|title= Dating the foot-powered loom: the Coptic evidence |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |year=1985 |volume=89|issue= 1 |pages=168–73|jstor=504781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even then, the lack of mechanical aids in spinning made yarn production a major bottleneck in the manufacture of cloth.

==Colours and dyes==
From Rome's earliest days, a wide variety of colours and coloured fabrics would have been available; in Roman tradition, the first association of professional dyers dated back to the days of [[Numa Pompilius|King Numa]]. Roman dyers would certainly have had access to the same locally produced, usually plant-based dyes as their neighbours on the [[Italian peninsula]], producing various shades of red, yellow, blue, green, and brown; blacks could be achieved using iron salts and oak gall. Other dyes, or dyed cloths, could have been obtained by trade, or through experimentation. For the very few who could afford it, cloth-of-gold ([[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]]) was almost certainly available, possibly as early as the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 62–68 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Regal, Republican and Imperial eras, the fastest, most expensive and sought-after dye was imported [[Tyrian purple]], obtained from the ''[[murex]]''. Its hues varied according to processing, the most desirable being a dark "dried-blood" red.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Mark (2011) ''Colour and Meaning in Ancient Rome''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 189, 194–195. {{ISBN|978-0521291224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple had long-standing associations with regality, and with the divine. It was thought to sanctify and protect those who wore it, and was officially reserved for the border of the ''toga praetexta'', and for the solid purple ''toga picta''. Edicts against its wider, more casual use were not particularly successful; it was also used by wealthy women and, somewhat more disreputably, by some men.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson, J. C., pp. 28–30 and note 75 in [[#Edmondson|Edmondson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith, A., ''in'' Edmonson, J. C., and Keith, A., (Editors), ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verres]] is reported as wearing a purple ''pallium'' at all-night parties, not long before his trial, disgrace and exile for corruption. For those who could not afford genuine Tyrian purple, counterfeits were available.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J., L., pp. 54–56 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of trade networks during the early Imperial era brought the dark blue of Indian [[indigo]] to Rome; though desirable and costly in itself, it also served as a base for fake Tyrian purple.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 68–69 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]], citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 33.163, 35.43, 35.46, 37.84, and Vitruvius, ''On architecture'', 7.9.8, 7.14; as indigo was imported as "bricks" of dye-powder, Vitruvius believed it a mineral.&lt;/ref&gt;

For red hues, [[Rose madder|madder]] was one of the cheapest dyes available. [[Saffron]] yellow was much admired, but costly. It was a deep, bright and fiery yellow-orange, and was associated with purity and constancy. It was used for the ''flammeum'' (meaning "flame-coloured"), a veil used by Roman brides and the [[Flamen Dialis#Flaminica Dialis|Flamenica Dialis]], who was virgin at marriage and forbidden to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;La Follette, L., pp. 54–56 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific colours were associated with chariot-racing teams and their supporters. The oldest of these were the Reds and the Whites. During the later Imperial era, the Blues and Greens dominated chariot-racing and, up to a point, civil and political life in Rome and Constantinople. Although the teams and their supporters had official recognition, their rivalry sometimes spilled into civil violence and riot, both within and beyond the circus venue.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, J. L., pp. 70–71 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leather and hide==
The Romans had two methods of converting animal skins to leather: [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] produced a soft, supple brown leather; [[Tanning (leather)#Tawing|tawing]] in alum and salt produced a soft, pale leather that readily absorbed dyes. Both these processes produced a strong, unpleasant odour, so tanners and tawers shops were usually placed well away from urban centres. Unprocessed animal hides were supplied directly to tanners by butchers, as a byproduct of meat production; some was turned to [[rawhide (material)|rawhide]], which made a durable shoe-sole. Landowners and livestock ranchers, many of whom were of the elite class, drew a proportion of profits at each step of the process that turned their animals into leather or hide and distributed it through empire-wide trade networks. The Roman military consumed large quantities of leather; for jerkins, belts, boots, saddles, harness and strap-work, but mostly for military tents.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., pp. 104–106 in [[#Sebesta|Sebesta]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Erdkamp|Erdkamp]], pp. 316, 327&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laundering and fulling==
[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Workers hanging up clothing to dry, wall painting from a [[Fulling|fuller's shop]] ''(fullonica)'' at [[Pompeii]]]]
The almost universal habit of [[Roman baths|public bathing]] ensured that most Romans kept their bodies clean, reducing the need for frequent washing of garments and bedsheets. Nevertheless, dirt, spillage and staining were constant hazards, and most Romans lived in [[Insula (building)|apartment blocks]] that lacked facilities for washing clothes on any but the smallest scale. Professional laundries (''fullonicae'', singular ''fullonica'') were highly malodorous but essential and commonplace features of every city and town. Small fulling enterprises could be found at [[Taberna|local market-places]]; others operated on an industrial scale, and would have required a considerable investment of money and manpower, especially slaves.&lt;ref name="Flohr, Miko 2013, pp. 31-34"&gt;[[#Flohr|Flohr]], pp. 31–34, 68–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic laundering and fulling techniques were simple, and labour-intensive. Garments were placed in large tubs containing aged urine, then well trodden by bare-footed workers. They were well-rinsed, manually or mechanically wrung, and spread over wicker frames to dry. Whites could be further brightened by bleaching with sulphur fumes. Some colours could be restored to brightness by "polishing" or "refinishing" with Cimolian earth. Others were less colour-fast, and would have required separate laundering. In the best-equipped establishments, garments were further smoothed under pressure, using screw-presses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flohr|Flohr]], pp. 57–65, 144–148&lt;/ref&gt; Laundering and fulling were punishingly harsh to fabrics, but purity and cleanliness of clothing was in itself a mark of status. The high-quality woolen togas of the senatorial class were intensively laundered to an exceptional, snowy white, using the best and most expensive ingredients. Lower ranking citizens used togas of duller wool, more cheaply laundered; for reasons that remain unclear, the clothing of different status groups might have been laundered separately.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flower|Flower]], pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt;

Front of house, ''fullonicae'' were run by enterprising citizens of lower social class, or by freedmen and freedwomen; behind the scenes, their enterprise might be supported discreetly by a rich or elite patron, in return for a share of the profits.&lt;ref name="Flohr, Miko 2013, pp. 31-34"/&gt; The Roman elite seem to have despised the fulling and laundering professions as ignoble; though perhaps no more than they despised all manual trades. The fullers themselves evidently thought theirs a respectable and highly profitable profession, worth celebration and illustration in murals and memorials.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flohr|Flohr]], pp. 2, 31–34&lt;/ref&gt; Pompeian mural paintings of launderers and fullers at work show garments in a rainbow variety of colours, but not white; fullers seem to have been particularly valued for their ability to launder dyed garments without loss of colour, sheen or "brightness", rather than merely whitening, or bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flohr|Flohr]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; New cloth and clothing may also have been laundered; the process would have partially felted and strengthened woolen fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flohr|Flohr]], pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Compurgation''', also called '''wager of law''' and '''oath-helping''', was a defence used primarily in medieval law.  A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an [[oath]] and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, ''com'' = with, ''purgare'' = make clean, cleanse, excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/compurgation.html |title=English etymology of compurgation |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''com'' is also an intensifier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last = Delbridge |editor-first = A ||display-editors=etal |title = Macquarie Australia's National Dictionary |publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty |year = 1997 |page = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to thoroughly clean or excuse'.

The wager of law was essentially a character reference, initially by kin and later by neighbours (from the same region as the defendant), often 11 or 12 men, and it was a way to give credibility to the oath of a defendant at a time when a person's oath had more credibility than a written record.  It can be compared to [[legal wager]], which is the provision of surety at the beginning of legal action to minimize frivolous litigation.

Compurgation was found in [[early Germanic law]], in early French law (''très ancienne coutume de Bretagne''), in [[Welsh law]], and in the English [[ecclesiastical courts]] until the seventeenth century. In [[common law]] it was substantially abolished as a defence in [[felonies]] by the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] in 1164. The defence was still permitted in [[civil action]]s for debt and vestiges of it survived until its statutory repeal at various times in common law countries: in England in 1833,&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; and [[Queensland]] at some point before the Queensland Common Practice Act of 1867&lt;ref name="QCLPA"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/C/CommLawPracA1867_01_.pdf |format = PDF |title=Common Law Practice Act 1867 |publisher=Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel |date=24 June 1994 |quote = Wager of law abolished – 3. No wager of law shall be allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

"Wager of Law, obsolete for centuries" was "a living fossil... a dead letter statute" and was repealed in England in 1833.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir

==Origins==
The procedure in a wager of law is traced by [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect on the development of the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2|wstitle=Wager |volume=28 |page=229 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri28chis#page/229/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[Compurgation] had originated in Anglo-Saxon England in the ties of kinship that bound people together in the period before the year 1000, a time when each man was responsible for the acts of his blood relatives. Later, kinship gave way to a more tribal affiliation and a loyalty to the place of one's birth. When disputes more often than not led to violence, it seemed natural that neighbors would band together. They aligned themselves with a neighbour who was accused in court and swore that in good conscience they believed he was telling the truth. The number of oath-helpers required depended on the defendant's rank and the character of the lawsuit. Eventually it became standard practice to bring eleven neighbours into court to swear for the defendant. The oath-helpers were called compurgators, and the wager of law was called compurgation.&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wager+of+law |title=Wager of law legal definition of Wager of law |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Wager of law, wager of battle and trial by ordeal==
The wager of law, also called compurgation, is an old legal practice, dating back to Saxon and feudal times, which was [[Contemporary history|contemporaneous]] to the appeal to God to prove fact by [[trial by battle]] (wager of battle, [[trial by combat]], or judicial duel), and of [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=hamowy&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj23n2/cj23n2-7.pdf |format=PDF |title=F. A. Hayek and the Common Law |first=Ronald |last=Hamowy
|journal=Cato Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat — [[Trial by combat#Great Britain and Ireland|real in English law]], feigned in Roman law — no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

==Surety==
A variation was for the defendant to give gage, or sureties, in an action of debt, and "that at a certain day assigned he would take a law, or oath, in open court, that he did not owe the debt, and at the same time bring with him eleven neighbors (called compurgators), who should avow upon their oaths that they believed in their consciences that he spoke the truth" (see the [[Tractatus of Glanvill|''Tractatus'' of Glanvill]], ca. 1188).

==Determining fact==
Wager of law was replaced by jury, from early times, to determine fact, at a time that judges managed legal procedure and did not determine fact. Trial "by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (legus terrae)" Cap. 29 of the [[Magna Carta]] 1215 to 1297.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html |title=Featured Document: The Magna Carta |publisher=Archives.gov |date=|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law was practised in England (and English  American colonies) until the 16th century, in criminal matters, and the 19th century, in civil matters.

==Supporting defendant's oath==
A defendant who elected to "make his law" was permitted to make a statement before the court, swear an oath that it was true, and present one or more individuals, often 12, who swore that they believed he had told the truth under oath. The predominant form of defense in the feudal courts, it persisted for a time in the common-law courts. The individuals "did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a man’s oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions (penalties), individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that 'wagers in law' were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130405/compurgation |title=compurgation |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh law]] allowed for a form of compurgation called [[assach]], which required not 12 but 300 compurgators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Maitland0161/CollectedPapers/Vol1/HTMLs/0242-01_Pt03_Essays1.html|title=The Laws of Wales|work=The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland|author=Fisher, H.A.L.|authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher| accessdate=2006-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of wager of law==
{{quote|As the kings consolidated their power, suppressing violence and increasing the authority of the courts, the wager of law lost some of its ancient power and became a nuisance to litigants, who suspected that it frequently opened the door to false swearing. Different forms of action developed that did not permit the wager of law as a defense, and plaintiffs used them as much as possible. The procedure of wager of law had long since been obsolete when it was abolished during the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413).&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"/&gt;}}

The taking of oaths was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form of action other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

Trial by ordeal was abolished by order of the Lateran Council of 1215. Trial by battle was abolished in 1819 and wager of law was abolished in 1833, although both had fallen into disuse before their formal abolition.&lt;ref name=hamowy/&gt;

Wager of law was used as late as 1829, when the Rev. Fearon Jenkinson of Gnosall, Staffordshire used it against a Stafford ironmonger who claimed he was owed money by him. Jenkinson and his compurgators did not appear on the date.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Chronicle, 5 June 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law survived to recent centuries and in many jurisdictions it has been abolished by statute. It was abolished in New South Wales in 1841 by the Advancement of Justice Act 1841 (both Victoria and Queensland were still part of New South Wales at this time). This was re-enacted after separation of Queensland from New South Wales in the Queensland Common Law Practice Act 1867, but was strictly unnecessary, given its earlier abolition in 1841 &lt;ref name="QCLPA" /&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

No wager of law was allowed in [[assumpsit]], even though the cause of action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of assumpsit — proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant — as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 William IV. c. 42).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

[[File:Dipesh Chakrabarty, 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dipesh Chakrabarty in 2012, in [[Herrenhausen]] at the conference [[The Limits to Growth|Already Beyond? - 40 Years Limits to Growth]].]]

'''Dipesh Chakrabarty''' (born 1948, [[Kolkata]]) is a historian, who has also made contributions to [[postcolonial theory]] and [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] studies. He is the [[Lawrence A. Kimpton]] Distinguished Service Professor in history at the [[University of Chicago]], and is the recipient of the 2014 [[Toynbee Prize Foundation#Toynbee Prize Foundation|Toynbee Prize]], named for Professor [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], that recognizes social scientists for significant academic and public contributions to humanity.&lt;ref name="toynbee2014"&gt;[http://toynbeeprize.org/toynbee-prize/dipesh-chakrabarty-named-2014-toynbee-prize-recipient/ Dipesh Chakrabarty Named 2014 Toynbee Prize Recipient], Toynbee Prize Foundation, 9 July 2014, accessed 22 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Dipesh Chakrabarty attended [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] of the [[University of Calcutta]], where he received his undergraduate degree in physics. He also received a [[Post Graduate Diploma in Management|Post Graduate Diploma in Management (MBA)]] from [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]. Later he moved on to the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], from where he earned a PhD in history.&lt;ref name="toynbee2014" /&gt;

He is currently the Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished Service Professor of History, South Asian Languages and Civilizations and the College at the [[University of Chicago]]. He was a visiting faculty at the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]]. Chakrabarty also serves as a contributing editor for [[Public Culture]], an academic journal published by [[Duke University Press]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

He was a member of the [[Subaltern Studies]] collective. He has recently made important contributions to the intersections between history and [[postcolonial theory]] (''Provincializing Europe'' [''PE'']), which continues and revises his earlier historical work on working-class history in Bengal (''Rethinking Working-Class History''). ''PE'' adds considerably to the debate of how postcolonial discourse engages in the writing of history (e.g., [[Robert J. C. Young]]'s "White Mythologies"), critiquing [[historicism]], which is intimately related to the West's notion of linear time. Chakrabarty argues that Western [[historiography]]'s historicism universalizes [[liberalism]], projecting it to all ends of the map. He suggests that, under the rubric of historicism, the end-goal of every society is to develop towards [[nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Chakrabarty has had an extensive program of visiting lecturships: Visiting Fellow, Humanities Institute, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], USA (2002); Hitesranjan Sanyal Visiting Professor of History, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, [[University of Calcutta]] (2003); Visitor, Humanities Center, [[State University of New York]], Stony Brook (2004); Visiting Fellow, [[University of Göttingen|Max Planck Institute for Historical Sciences, University of Göttingen]], [[Germany]] (2005); Faculty, Seminar in Experimental Critical Theory, [[University of California, Irvine]] (2005); Visiting Research Professor, [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (2005 and 2009); Visitor, Center for Historical Studies, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], [[Delhi]] (2005);  Scholar-in-Residence, [[Pratt Institute]], New York (2005); Visiting Professor, [[European Humanities University]], [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] (2006); Ida Beam Distinguished Visiting Professor, [[University of Iowa]] (2007); Distinguished Visitor, Institute of Advanced Study, [[University of Minnesota]] (2007); Fellow at the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]] (2008–09): Katz Professor in the Humanities, [[University of Washington]], Seattle (2009); Hallsworth Visiting Professor, [[University of Manchester]], U.K. (2009); [[Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen]], Vienna, Austria (2010); Lansdowne Lecturer, [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria University]], Canada (2012); Nicholson Distinguished Visiting Scholar, [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]] (2013).

Since 2017 allegations of sexual misconduct by Chakrabarty have become public &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UChicago and the Asymmetry of Power|url=https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/11/21/uchicago-asymmetry-power/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After a publishing an account of the incident &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#HimToo: A Reckoning|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinefair/himtoo-a-reckoning}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the previous University of Chicago student, [[C. Christine Fair]] contacted the University's [[Title IX]] office along with further communication made to her by self-identified victims. The University "concluded that the comment would not have constituted sexual harassment under the University policy in effect at that time." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fair |first1=C.

Chakrabarty is married to current UChicago professor Rochona Majumdar who completed her PhD at the university in 2003, with Chakrabarty as the chair of her dissertation committee, acceptable under university policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majumdar |first1=Rochona |title=Marriage, Modernity, and Sources of the Self: Bengali Women C. 1870-1956 |date=August 2003 |publisher=University of Chicago, Dept. of South Asian Languages and Civilizations, Dept. of History |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/66906434}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Gerald Horne''' is an [[African-American]] [[historian]] who currently holds the John J. and Rebecca Moores Chair of History and African American Studies at the [[University of Houston]].

==Background==
Gerald Horne was born on January 3, 1949, and was raised in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. After undergraduate education at [[Princeton University]] he received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] and a J.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Career==
Horne holds the John J. and Rebecca Moores Chair of [[History]] and [[African American Studies]] at the University of Houston.

Horne is a frequent contributor to ''[[Political Affairs]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalaffairs.net/gerald-horne "Gerald Horne"], ''Political Affairs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
A prolific author, Horne has published on [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and has written books on a wide range of neglected but by no means marginal or minor episodes of world history. He writes about topics he perceives as misrepresented struggles for justice, in particular [[communism|communist]] struggles and struggles against [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], [[fascism]], [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]]. Individuals whose lives his work has highlighted in their historical contexts have included the [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] Hollywood screenwriter [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Ferdinand Smith]] (a [[Jamaica]]n-born communist, sailor, labor leader, and co-founder of the [[National Maritime Union]]), the perplexing [[Lawrence Dennis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Younge|Younge, Gary]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/04/usa.race "The Fascist who 'passed' for white"] (review), ''The Guardian'', April 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; an African-American fascist and racist who passed for white, and the [[feminism|feminist]], anti-colonialist, internationalist intellectual [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]] whose own career was overshadowed by that of [[W. E. B. Du Bois|her famous husband]].

While many of Horne's books use a celebrated, intriguing or politically engaged individual as a prism to inspect the historical forces of their times, Horne has also produced broad canvas chronicles of infrequently examined periods and aspects of the history of white supremacy and imperialism such as the post-civil war involvement of the US ruling class—newly dispossessed of human chattels—with [[slavery in Brazil]], which was not legally abolished until 1888, or the attempts by Japanese imperialists in the mid-20th century to appear as the leaders of a global war against white supremacy, thus allies and instruments of "liberation" for people of color oppressed by "Anglo-American Empire".

[[Manning Marable]] has said: "Gerald Horne is one of the most gifted and insightful historians on racial matters of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookid=8798 NYU Press.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323075203/http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookid=8798 |date=2014-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography in and for the radical tradition==
Horne is a [[Marxism|Marxist]]. At the afternoon devoted to [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]] at the conference on ''Black Women and the Radical Tradition'' (held at Brooklyn College Graduate Center for Worker Education), he said:

{{quote|The purpose of my brief remarks this afternoon is to use the life and times of [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]] as a vehicle for trying to understand how and why we need to think about revitalizing the radical tradition through the means of revisioning and rewriting our history, our past. I argue in these remarks that like other historians - for Shirley Graham Du Bois was among other things an historian - she tended to stress in her history writing, like most of the writers of her generation, the "[[Crispus Attucks]]" aspect of our history, I'm sure you're familiar with Crispus Attucks, he goes down in history as the first person to be slain in the uprising against British rule in then-British North America and a symbol of how black people have shed their blood to help to construct this country. Which of course is true and is accurate. But it only begins to tell part of the story, as I'll try to elaborate on in my remarks. I think today it's particularly important to talk about revitalizing our past so that we can reinvigorate the radical tradition in light of this precipitous downturn that we see in the capitalist economy. ''[[Newsweek]]'' has been amongst the many journals that have told us "We're All Socialists Now", which some might be surprised to hear. In Latin America, certainly in the most recent election in [[El Salvador]], and in Latin American generally, one can easily espy a shift to the left. The quipsters are suggesting that the recently departed [[president of the United States|Pres]]. [[George W. Bush]] entered office in 2001 as a social conservative but then after being compelled to nationalize various enterprises he leaves office as a conservative socialist. When you note that in [[South Africa]] you have a Communist Party minister sitting in office in [[Pretoria]], and perhaps the same will take place in [[New Delhi]], after the elections that take place in the late spring, it's time to revive that aspect it seems to me reality is shouting at us, time to revitalize that aspect of black history that stresses our ancestors who as early as the 18th century were actually trying to ''overthrow'' the government of the United States of America, as opposed to shedding their blood to help to create the government of the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Video: [http://vimeo.com/10364725 "The Life &amp; Times of Shirley Graham Dubois".]&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In a speech given at an event marking the depositing of the Communist Party USA archives at the Tamiment Library at New York University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesworld.org/rethinking-the-history-and-future-of-the-communist-party/ "Rethinking the History and Future of the Communist Party"], ''People's World'', April 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Horne remarked at length on the writing of history, its importance, and what he perceives as the grievous proliferation of propagandistic historiography in the US:

{{quote|Now it is often said that every generation has to rewrite history. For example, at one time there was a prevalent "moonlight and magnolias" version of slavery and Reconstruction that fundamentally portrayed "happy Negroes" during the slave era and portrayed the period following slavery as a dastardly period of Negro misrule and [[corruption]]. This began to change in the 1930s with the publication of Du Bois’ magisterial ‘Black Reconstruction’ and changed decisively with the publication of [[Eric Foner]]’s ‘Reconstruction.’"

One of the reasons why I personally – and I daresay future generations – are so pleased by the depositing of these CPUSA archives is because it is painfully obvious that the history of the Communist movement in this nation is long overdue for a massive rewriting and these archives will prove indispensable in that process.

It is easy to see why future generations will be displeased with much of the present history that has been written to this point about the Communist Party because it has been incredibly biased, one-sided, deeply influenced by the conservative drift of the nation – not unlike pre-Du Bois histories of Reconstruction – and, fundamentally, anticommunist.|}}

'''Hayton of Corycus''' (also ''Hethum, Het'um'', and variants;&lt;ref&gt;variously  ''Aytonus'', ''Hetoum'', ''Haiton'', ''Haitho'', etc.; also [[Latinize]]d as {{lang|la|Antonius Curchinus}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Armenian known as  {{lang|hy|Հեթում Պատմիչ}} {{lang|hy|Hetʿowm Patmičʿ}} "Hethum the Historian" ; c.1240 - c.1310-1320&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HetumTheHistoriansFlowerOfHistoriesOfTheEast|title=Het'um the Historian's History of the Tartars [Flower of Histories of the East]|last=Het'um the Armenian|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7|language=English|translator-last=Bedrosian|translator-first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a medieval [[Armenians|Armenian]] nobleman, monk and historiographer.

Hayton is the author of '''{{lang|fro|La Flor des Estoires d'Orient}}''' ("Flower of the Histories of the East",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Latin  {{lang|la|Flos historiarum terre Orientis}}), a historiographical work about the [[history of Asia]], especially about the [[Muslim conquests]] and the [[Mongol invasion]],  which he dictated at the request of [[Pope Clement V]] in 1307, while he was at [[Poitiers]]. The [[Old French]] original text was recorded by one Nicolas Faulcon, who also prepared a Latin translation. The work was widely disseminated in the Late Middle Ages and was influential in shaping western European views of the [[Orient]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

The work consists of four books of unequal lengths, the main part being contained in book 3, after which the entire work is sometimes referred to as the "History of the Tartars". Book 1 gives an overview of the geography and history of Asia. Book 2 gives an account of the "Lordship of the Saracens", i.e. the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century and the succeeding [[Caliphate]]s. Book 3 comprises the bulk of the work, giving a  [[history of the Mongols]] and the  [[Mongol invasions]].
Book 4 discusses a proposed alliance of [[Christendom]] with the [[Mongol Empire]] to the end of a renewed  [[crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]. 
For his history of the Mongols Hayton names an ''Estoires des [[Tartars]]'' ("History of the Tartars") as his source for the time until the reign of [[Möngke Khan]] (1250s), while for more recent events, he relies on the accounts by his great-uncle, king [[Hethum I]], and on his own experiences. He is also informed by western sources on the history of the [[Crusades]], and most likely draws on the travelogues of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] and [[Marco Polo]].

==Biography==
[[File:HetoumIEnteringTheOrders.JPG|thumb|[[Hethum I of Armenia|Hethum I]] entering the Premonstratensian order.]]
As an influential member of the Armenian [[Hethumids|Hethumid]] dynasty in [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilicia]], Hayton was the son of prince Oshin (d. 15 Jan 1265), lord of [[Corycus]] (Korikos) and younger brother of king [[Hethum I]] and [[Sempad the Constable|Smbat Sparapet]] (d. after 1298) the chronicler and kingdom's Constable (d.1276).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ARMENIA.htm#OshinKorikosdied1329A|title=ARMENIA|website=fmg.ac|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mutafian|2001|p=77}} Likely born between c. 1230 and 1245, he was made governor of the city of [[Corycus]].{{sfn|Demurger|2009|p=115}}

In 1299, he made a pilgrimage to [[Paris]] to fulfill a [[Marian veneration|Marian]] vow. 
In 1305 joined the order of the [[Premonstratensian]]s at [[Bellapais Abbey]] in [[Cyprus]]. 
Cypriot chronology suggest that Hayton was forced into exile in 1294 because he conspired against his younger cousin, king [[Hethum II]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
By 1307, he was in [[Poitiers]], the main residence of [[Pope Clement V]], as prior   of the Premonstratensian abbey there.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=433}} It was here that he dictated his ''History'' at the request of the pope. His political aim in Poitiers was to gain support for [[Amalric of Tyre]] in his usurpation of the throne of Cyprus against the unpopular king [[Henry II of Cyprus]],{{sfn|Mutafian|2001|p=77}}
and to advocate for a new [[crusade]] in alliance with the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]].
After the assassination of Hethum II in 1307, Hayton returned to Cilician Armenia, where, leaving his monastic life behind, he became [[Sparapet|Constable]], commander of the armed forces. The date of his death is unknown; he is last recorded as having been alive in 1309, acting on behalf of Amalric. The suggestion (made by Charles Kohler in the preface to the 1906 edition of the ''History'') that one ''Haytonus, Armeniorum dux generalis'' recorded as present in the [[Council of Adana]] in 1314 is to be identified with Hayton of Corycus has not found mainstream acceptance due to the ubiquity of the Armenian name ''Hayton''.

Hayton's daughter [[Isabel of Korikos|Isabel]] (1282-1310) married [[Oshin, King of Armenia|Oshin]], the son of [[Leo II, King of Armenia|Leo II]], and king of Cilician Armenia from 1307 to 1320. His son [[Oshin of Korikos|Oshin of Corycus]] became regent of Cilician Armenia from 1320, presumably indicating that Hayton was no longer alive.{{sfn|Mutafian|2001|p=80}}

==''La Flor des Estoires d'Orient''==
{{anchor|History of the Tartars}}
{{further|Armenia under the Ilkhanate}}
While in France, Hayton compiled a geography of Asia, one of the first of the Middle Ages,  {{lang|fro|La Flor des Estoires d'Orient}} ({{Lang-la|Flos Historiarum Terre Orientis|links=no}}, "The flower of the stories of the Orient"). 
The work consists of four books of unequal lengths, the main part being contained in book 3, after which the entire work is sometimes referred to as the "History of the Tartars".

Book 1 describes the geography of Asia as divided into the kingdoms of [[Cathay]] (China), Tars ([[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghurs]]), Turkestan, [[Khwarazmia]], [[Cumania]], [[medieval India|India]], [[Persia]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Mesopotamia]], the "Land of the Turks" ([[Seljuks]]) and [[history of Syria|Syria]].

Book 2 gives an account of the "Lordship of the Saracens", i.e. the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century and the succeeding [[Caliphate]]s.

Book 3, known as the "History of the Tartars", provides an account of the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]], and of recent events in the Near East, especially relating to the history of the [[Armenian kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian kingdom]] and its interaction with the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], to which it had been tributary since 1236.
Hayton dictated his text to one Nicolas Faulcon using the French language. Faulcon then prepared a Latin translation of his French text.
The work was completed and presented to [[Pope Clement V]] in 1307.

The work concludes with a plan for a new crusade, which Hayton proposed should be organised in alliance with the Ilkhan. 
Hayton's promotion of this Ilkhanid alliance, and also his association with certain parties in the complex Armenian and Cypriot politics of the day, make this work rather tendentious.{{refn|"Echoes of Hayton's ''Flor des estoires'' ... can be found in many works that touch on the kingdom, [but] this is an extremely tendentious work, designed to be a piece of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 2001, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
Thus, Hayton is always keen to ascribe motives for Mongol actions that would endear them to his papal audience, as with his account of the Ilkhan Hülegü's rather destructive invasion of Syria (1259–60):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Khan (title)|Khan]] wanted to go to [[Jerusalem]] in order to deliver the Holy Land from the [[Saracens]] and to remit it to the Christians. The king [[Hethum I]] was very happy with this request, and assembled a great score of men on foot and on horse, because, in that time, the Kingdom of Armenia was in such a good state that it easily had 12,000 soldiers on horse and 60,000 soldiers on foot.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'',  Documents Arméniens vol. 2 (1906), [https://archive.org/stream/RecueilDesHistoriensDesCroisadesDocumentsArmeniensTomeSecond/RecCrosArm2#page/n437/mode/2up p. 170];{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--nothing of the kind is found on p. 170--&gt; cited by  René Grousset, ''Histoire des Croisades'',  p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Faulcon's text is preserved in numerous manuscripts, a total of 18 of the French text and 32 of the Latin text (two which  are not independent witnesses but notebooks or indices of variants).
Some of these manuscripts still date to the first half of the 14th century. 
For the French text: Turin University library IV.30, Paris BNF [[:commons:Category:BNF Nouvelle acquisition française 886|nouv. acq. fr. 886]], Vienna national library no. 2620; for the Latin text: Paris BNF lat. 5515 and lat. 14693.&lt;ref&gt;[[Recueil des historiens des croisades|Dardel (1906)]], [https://archive.org/stream/RecueilDesHistoriensDesCroisadesDocumentsArmeniensTomeSecond/RecCrosArm2#page/n380/mode/1up p. 112].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another French text, translated from Faulcon's Latin text by one Jean le Long in 1351 (preserved in 3 manuscripts).
In addition there is one Aragonese translation  made for Juan Fernández de Heredia, grand master of the Hospitallers, besides a former Catalan translation having maybe the same origin, and one English language manuscript of the 16th century, presumably made for Henry VIII.

The ''Editio princeps'' was prepared in Paris in 1510, based on Faulcon's French text.
Faulcon's Latin text appeared in Haguenau (1529), Basel (1532) and Helmstedt 1585, Jean le Long's French version in Paris (1529).
An English translation (independent of the English manuscript text) by  Richard Pynson was printed in London in the 1520s. Other translations included German  (Strasbourg 1534), Dutch (Antwerpen 1563), Italian (Venice 1559, 1562, 1562) and Spanish (Córdoba 1595) versions.

A modern edition of the text was prepared (with modern French translation and commentary) by [[Jean Dardel]] in 1906 for ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil des historiens des croisades, documents armeniens tome second'' (1906) [https://archive.org/details/RecueilDesHistoriensDesCroisadesDocumentsArmeniensTomeSecond archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 10.JPG|thumb|275px|Model of '''Herod's Jerusalem Palace-Fortress''' in the northwest corner of the Upper City walls. The three towers, from L to R, are Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne. Just beneath the latter two, a portion of the reconstruction of the palace building itself is visible.]]

'''Herod's Palace at Jerusalem''' was built in the last quarter of the 1st century BC by [[Herod the Great|Herod I the Great]], [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers|King of Judea]] from 37 BC to 4 BC. It was the second most important building in [[Jerusalem]], after the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] itself, in Herod’s day and was situated at the northwestern wall of the Upper City of Jerusalem (the Western Hill abandoned after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|sacking of Jerusalem]]). Herod lived in it as a principal residence, but not permanently, as he owned other palace-fortresses, notably at [[Masada]], [[Herodium]] and [[Caesarea Maritima]]. Nothing remains of the Jerusalem Palace today except for portions of the surrounding wall-and-tower complex, much altered and generally known as "the Citadel" (see [[Tower of David]]). The site of the former palace is now occupied by the [[Tower of David#Tower of David Museum|Tower of David Museum]], a police station, and a former Turkish barracks/prison known as the ''Kishle''.

[[Image:Jerusalem-TowerOfDavid 001.jpg|thumb|right|The "Tower of David"—seen here from the inner courtyard of the Citadel—was built on the base of the Tower of Hippicus.]]

Herod's palace-fortress in Jerusalem stood along the western city wall, in the area now taken by the [[Armenian Quarter]], starting in the north at the Kishle building and ending at the gate called by [[Bargil Pixner]] the Gate of the Essenes on [[Mount Zion]]. It consisted mainly of two palace wings placed north and south of a large garden. Immediately north of the complex, in the area of today's [[Tower of David|Citadel]] and [[Jaffa Gate]], Herod erected three huge towers, as an additional protection and last refuge in case of danger. These he called after people close to him - Hippicus after a friend, [[Phasael]] after his brother, and [[Mariamne I|Mariamne]] after his favourite wife. These towers strengthened the northwest corner of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First Wall]], the city wall built by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] sometime between 142-BC. Of the three towers, only the massive lower part of the [[Hippicus Tower]] (or the Phasael Tower, after some researchers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 27925783|title = The 'Tower of David'—Phasael or Hippicus?|journal = Israel Exploration Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1/2|pages = 57–65|last1 = Geva|first1 = Hillel|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have survived. Remains of two older, Hasmonean towers (the Southern and Middle Towers) have been found in the present Citadel courtyard, which are unrelated to the missing Herodian towers.

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the [[Tower of David]] - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as [[Mount Zion]], presumed it to be David's palace. This name is still in use today, although in the 19th century an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] minaret erected between 1635-65 over the southern wall of the Citadel took over the title of "Tower of David", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone.

==Description==
As with his [[Herod's Temple|Temple]], Herod's Jerusalem Palace was constructed on an elevated platform of about 1,000 feet (north-south) by 180 feet (east-west). Resting on a series of retaining walls rising 13 to 16 feet above ground level. It consisted of two main buildings, each with its own banquet halls, baths, and accommodations for hundreds of guests. The two wings were named after [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Augustus|Caesar]]. In the center of the palace were gardens with porticoes. The grounds included groves, canals, and ponds fitted with bronze fountains. The ''[[praetorium]]'' at the Palace was, after Herod's death, the official residence of the Roman governors when they came to Jerusalem during major Jewish festivals. This was probably the site of the trial of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] (see [[Pilate's court]]).

To the north of Herod's Palace were the three immense towers,
* The [[Phasael Tower]] was the largest. It was named after [[Phasael|Herod's brother]] and stood 145 feet high.
* The [[Hippicus Tower]] was named after a friend of Herod and stood 132 feet high.
* The [[Mariamne Tower]] was named after Herod’s [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Hasmonean wife]] whom he had executed. Josephus said that "the king considering it appropriate that the tower named after a woman should surpass in decoration those called after men." It stood 74 feet high and was accounted the most beautiful of the three.

==Josephus’ description==
The ancient writer and historian [[Josephus]] vividly described the "wondrous" palace in ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' 75 AD). Book 5, chapter 4 tells that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The largeness also of the stones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large ones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly united to one another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, so growing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into their present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the north side of the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor skill in its construction, but was entirely walled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers at equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would contain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the stones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were rare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful, both for the length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments. The number of the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures that were about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and the greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and gold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round about, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all the courts that were exposed to the air everywhere green. There were, moreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with brazen statues, through which the water ran out. There were withal many dove-courts of tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give a complete description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them is a torment to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings that fire which was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were not burnt by the Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already related, in the beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''The Wars of the Jews, or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem'', trans. [[William Whiston]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/book5.htm#noteref-11 Book V, Chapt. 4, Verse 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fate of the Palace==
At the creation of the Roman province of [[Roman Judea|Judaea]] in the year 6 CE, its governors—holding the rank of a [[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] until the year 41 and that of a [[Procurator (Roman Empire)|procurator]] after that—took up residence in Herod's palace.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 66 CE, the Roman governor [[Gessius Florus]] set up a mass crucifixion of Jews, sparking the [[First Jewish Rebellion]]. Rebelling Jews entered and burnt the palace. Only the three towers remained partially standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When the future Roman emperor [[Titus]] destroyed most of Jerusalem in 70 CE, he spared these and set up the camp of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion Fretensis]] in the area of the palace ruins, a camp which covered the entire Western Hill.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} One of the towers—a rebuilt Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower on its intact base—became known as the "[[Tower of David]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This was due to the fact that during the Byzantine Period, the Western Hill had been mistakenly identified as [[Mount Zion]] and the remains of the one surviving Herodian tower were presumed to be King David's palace.

Evidence shows that Crusaders fortified and heightened the 15 foot thick Hasmonean city wall and that Arabs, who [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|conquered Jerusalem]] in 637, did the same.{{dubious|Terrible mess. 1- If it only concerns the city walls outside the royal palace area, it's irrelevant here. 2- What Arabs? Early Isl. Period (Rashidun, Umayyad etc. through Fatimid) or post-Crusader (Ayyubid, Mamluk)? 900-year span! 3- Why mention 638 AFTER 12th c. Crusaders?|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

During the 1160s the kings of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem built in the same general area a royal palace of their own, of which close to nothing remains.&lt;ref name="BoasJlm"&gt;Adrian J. Boas. ''Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades: Society, Landscape and Art in the Holy City under Frankish Rule.'' Pages 79-82. Routledge 2009. {{ISBN|9780415488754}}.

''Jerusalem in the Crusader Period.'' Bar-Ilan University, Internet Educational Activities, 1997. "''Adjoining the Citadel to the south was the royal palace of the Crusader kings.''"  [http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_9.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century Egyptian barracks and later prison—locally known as the ''Kishle''—was built adjacent to the Citadel's southern moat and was used, successively, by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s troops (1834-40/41), the Turks (1840/41-1917), the British (1917–48), the Jordanians (1948–67) and in parts by the Israeli police after 1967. The very popular Tower of David Museum, located at the Citadel, is also administering the Kishle building, thus covering the northernmost part of the palace.

==20th and 21st century excavations==
In the 1970s, excavations outside the city wall disclosed the exit of a water drain belonging to Herod's Palace. This culvert transported water from the palace into the [[Hinnom Valley]]. Until recently, no portion of Herod's palace proper—excluding, that is, the surrounding walls-and-towers complex—had ever been uncovered. In 2001, however, excavations disclosed two palace walls, constructed of the easily recognizable Herodian hewn giant blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Schaalje, Jacqueline (2001),  [http://www.jewishmag.com/48mag/herod/herod.htm "Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace"], ''[[The Jewish Magazine]]'' (October 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Even these probably did not belong to the palace proper, but were part of the retaining walls for its base, a construction similar to that used by Herod at the Temple Mount. Excavations by [[Ruth Amiran]] and [[Avraham Eitan]] have also revealed some parts of the superstructure which included sections of painted plaster.

The ''Kishle'' prison excavations are accessible every Friday morning when guided tours are organised by the Tower of David Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Tower of David Museum: reservations for guided tours of the Kishle and Citadel moat  [http://www.tod.org.il/en/the-kishle-and-the-citadel-moat/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''İrfan Orga''' (October 31, 1908 – November 29, 1970) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[fighter pilot]], staff officer, and author, writing in English. He published books on many areas of Turkish life, [[cookery]], and history, as well as a life of [[Atatürk]], and a universally admired autobiography (''Portrait of a Turkish Family'', 1950). He also wrote two educational books for children.

==Early life==
Educated at [[Kuleli Military High School]], Harbiye Staff College, and [[Eskişehir]] Air College (1919–1933), Orga was born into a wealthy Ottoman Turkish family in Istanbul. Soon, with the outbreak of [[World War I]], his life was changed forever. His father Hüsnü died on the way to the [[Dardanelles]], his uncle Ahmet in [[Syria]]. Orga witnessed at first hand not only the hardships of war, but also the Allied [[Occupation of Constantinople]], the end of [[Ottoman Empire]], and the birth of the modern Turkish republic.

Orga opens his iconic [[memoirs]] with images of his childhood. He tells of his wealthy bourgeois family in Istanbul, Turkey, in the early 1900s. His mother, Şevkiye (1895–1940), is a young Balkan/Turkish beauty (aged fifteen at his birth). His father runs his own business. He describes his autocratic grandmother as an eccentric socialite.

In 1942/43, while he was in the UK on a three-year diplomatic posting from the Turkish Air Force, he met a young married [[Normans|Norman]]-Irish woman, Margaret Veronica Gainsboro ''née'' D'Arcy-Wright (1919 [?1914]-1974). Since living with a foreigner was then a military offence in Turkey, Orga, having resigned his commission in early 1947, eventually fled the country for the UK, arriving in London just before the Christmas of that year (''in absentia'', he was convicted and fined in an Ankara court in September 1949). He never returned. Once Margaret's divorce had been finalised in January 1948, they married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of a Turkish Family|url=http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/shop-online-books/portrait-of-a-turkish-family|website=Eland Books|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
In the UK, Orga sought various menial jobs, unsuccessfully, turning eventually to writing in 1949. ''Portrait of a Turkish Family'' received exceptional reviews from critics including [[John Betjeman]], [[Harold Nicolson]], [[Arthur J. O. Anderson|Arthur Anderson]], [[Barbara Worsley-Gough]] and [[Peter Quennell]]. His wife joined the publishers [[Secker &amp; Warburg]] in 1957, later being appointed editor at [[W. H. Allen &amp; Co.|W H Allen]] in the early 1960s.

Orga tells his stories with multiple layers of complexity. He quickly makes clear his changing environment, with the death of his grandfather, the main provider of two generations of his family and their servants. His father, being a worldly man, understands that war is imminent. He proposes that his family sell their hereditary home in Istanbul, and move to another less expensive place, outside the city. However, reluctance is voiced. Orga captures the fear that a man can be suddenly in charge of a large group of people who depend on him for their survival.

Orga was well-travelled, and wrote about his experiences. ''The Caravan Moves On'' (1958, Book Society Recommendation) is a story about the [[Yoruk]] [[nomad]]s of the [[Taurus mountains]] in southeastern Turkey. An earlier title, ''Cooking with Yogurt''. was the first book in post-war Britain to specifically promote yogurt and its properties.

[[Ateş Orga]], the writer and record producer, sums up his father as "a gentle and kind person, a man of wisdom and sensitivity, of psychology and perception, a man of honour [...] a dreamer, a questioner, a lover of life's spirit [...] the fortress of our existence [...] a good human being".

In journalism, '''jet set''' was a term for an international social group of [[wealth]]y people who travelled the world to participate in social activities unavailable to ordinary people. The term, which replaced ''[[café society]]'', came from the lifestyle of travelling from one stylish or exotic place to another via [[jet plane]].

The term "jet set" is attributed to [[Igor Cassini]], a reporter for the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' who wrote under the pen name "Cholly Knickerbocker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=[Oleg Cassini] and his younger brother Igor (who became the Hearst newspaper gossip columnist 'Cholly Knickerbocker' and coined the phrase 'jet set')…|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/oleg-cassini-470646.html|title=Oleg Cassini - Obituaries|work=[[The Independent]]|date=20 March 2006|first=Tom|last=Vallance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although jet passenger service in the 1950s was initially marketed primarily to the rich, its introduction eventually resulted in a substantial democratization of [[air travel]]. Hence though the term "jet set" is still in some use, its literal meaning of those who travel by jet is no longer relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=...air travel has been transformed from a luxury good to a mass-market product.|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/in_praise_of_cheap_flights/14440|title=In praise of cheap flights|work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=19 December 2013|author=Niemietz, K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues however to refer to those who have the independent wealth and time to travel frequently and widely for pleasure.

==History==
[[BOAC]] inaugurated the world's first commercial scheduled jet service on 2 May 1952, using the [[DH106 Comet|de Havilland Comet]], followed by the introduction of the Comet 4 in 1958 after a series of accidents in 1953-1954. The first successful service, from October 1958, was the typical "jet set" route, [[London]]&amp;ndash;[[New York City]]. [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] followed suit with the [[Boeing 707]], making its first scheduled flight between New York City and Paris on 26 October 1958.

Other cities on the standard jet set routes were [[Las Vegas]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Athens]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Tokyo]]. Jet set resorts, invariably with white sand and salt water, were circumspect by modern standards; [[Acapulco]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] with [[Huntington Hartford]]'s new [[Paradise Island]] (opened in 1962) were taking the place of [[Bermuda]]. Meanwhile, [[Cannes]], [[Capri]], [[St. Tropez]], [[Marbella]], [[Portofino]],&lt;ref&gt;"Portofino has long been fashionable with what we once called 'the jet set'." {{cite web |url=http://www.knowital.com/history/liguria/liguria-history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429213627/http://www.knowital.com/history/liguria/liguria-history.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and selected small towns on the [[French Riviera|French]] and [[Italian Riviera|Italian]] Riviera were on the jet set itinerary. Greek Islands such as [[Mykonos]] were included in the loop around 1974.

The original members of this elite, free-wheeling set were those "[[socialite]]s" who were not shy about publicity and entertained in semi-public places like restaurants and in [[night club]]s, where the "[[paparazzi]]" &amp;ndash; a jet set phenomenon &amp;ndash; photographed them. They were the first generation that might weekend in Paris or fly to Rome just for a party. The jet set was celebrated in popular culture, for example, [[Federico Fellini]] captured their lifestyle in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960), and many record albums of the era promoted flying to foreign lands for honeymoons and getaways, such as Capitol Records ''Honeymoon in Rome'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sign that "jet set" had lost its glamorous edge was ''[[Vogue Magazine]]'''s coinage of the term ''the Beautiful People'' in the spring of 1962, an expression that initially referred to the circle that formed around [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Readers of the 15 February 1964 ''Vogue'' could learn "What the beautiful people are doing to keep fit." The two phrases ran for a time in tandem; in 1970, [[Cleveland Amory]] could fear "that the Beautiful People and the Jet Set are being threatened by current economics."&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'' 15 February 1964:49 and ''[[The Ladies Home Journal]]'' September 1970:81, noted [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/beautiful_people/ Barry Popik, "Beautiful people"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more serious economic threat was the [[1973 oil crisis]], which cast a pall over the idea of jetting about for pleasure. A sign that "jet set" had passed from urbane use was the 1974 [[country music|country]] song "(We're Not) The Jet Set", in which [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]] claim they are "the old [[Chevrolet]] set," as opposed to leading a glamorous, "jet-setting" lifestyle. books and movies about or referencing to this class include ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1973 novel, 1975 film) and the 1986 [[teen film]] [[drama]], ''[[Fire with Fire (1986 film)|Fire With Fire]]'', the latter movie consisting of jet set parents who sent their daughter to a [[convent school]] and were planning to send her to a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[finishing school]] after graduation from the convent's high school, further depriving her of normal adolescent [[rites of passage]] and family contact.

The flagging "jet set" gained its second wind with the introduction in 1976 of the supersonic [[Concorde]]. Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London-[[Bahrain]] oil executive route and the distinctly jet-set Paris-[[Rio de Janeiro]] (via [[Dakar]]) route. From November 1977 the Concorde was flying between standard ''jet set'' destinations, London or Paris to New York City; passenger lists on initial flights were gossip-column material. The Concorde restored the term's cachet: "From rock stars to royalty, the Concorde was the way to travel for the jet set," according to the Nova retrospective special "Supersonic Dream".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3203_concorde.html On-line NOVA transcript] (18 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Concorde was doomed by its [[sonic boom]], inability to achieve global fly-over rights because of the boom, its huge thirst for jet fuel, and a [[Air France Flight 4590|disastrous crash]]. The aircraft was retired in 2003. Meanwhile, the [[Boeing 747]], densely packed with passengers, was the craft that took over and dominated air travel by reducing travel cost and increasing airport capacity, accelerating the social changes already brought about by the jet age.

Where English is a second language the term has seen continued usage - in the early 1980s, the Argentinian rock band [[Soda Stereo]] recorded a successful song "¿Por qué no puedo ser del Jet Set?" ("Why can't I belong to the jet set?"), and in 2000 the French comedy ''[[Jet Set (film)|Jet Set]]'' made fun of this ''art de vivre''.  The TV series Mad Men featured an episode titled "Jet Set".

'''(Franz) Joseph Haydn'''{{efn|See [[Haydn's name]]. Haydn was baptized "Franciscus Josephus" (Franz Joseph), but "Franz" was not used during Haydn's lifetime and is avoided by scholars today ("Haydn, Joseph" {{harvtxt|Webster|Feder|2001}}).}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfʁants ˈjoːzɛf ˈhaɪdn̩|lang|Franz Joseph Haydn.ogg}}; 31 March{{efn|The date is uncertain. Haydn told others he was born on this day (Geiringer (1982, 9); Jones (1810, 8)), but some of his family members reported 1 April instead (Geiringer). The difficulty arises from the fact that in Haydn's day official records recorded not the birth date but the date of baptism, which, in Haydn's case, was 1 April (Wyn Jones 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3).}} 1732{{spaced ndash}}31 May 1809) was an Austrian [[composer]] of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. He was instrumental in the development of [[chamber music]] such as the [[piano trio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Basil |last=Smallman |title=The Piano Trio: Its History, Technique, and Repertoire |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=16–19 |isbn=0-19-318307-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to [[musical form]] have earned him the epithets "Father of the [[Symphony]]" and "Father of the [[String quartet|String Quartet]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1997|pp=43–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy [[Esterházy]] family at their remote estate. Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, "forced to become original".{{efn|Haydn made the remark to his friend and biographer [[Georg August Griesinger]]; cited from English version by Vernon Gotwals {{harv|Griesinger|1963|p=17}}}} Yet his music circulated widely, and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe.

He was a [[Haydn and Mozart|friend and mentor of]] [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], a [[Beethoven and his contemporaries#Joseph Haydn|tutor of]] [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and the older brother of composer [[Michael Haydn]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:KapellhausStStephensVienna.PNG|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]]. In the foreground is the Kapellhaus (demolished 1804) where Haydn lived as a chorister.]]
Joseph Haydn was born in [[Rohrau, Austria|Rohrau]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], a village that at that time stood on the border with [[Hungary]]. His father was [[Mathias Haydn]], a [[wheelwright]] who also served as "Marktrichter", an office akin to village mayor. Haydn's mother Maria, {{née}} Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of [[Aloys Thomas Raimund, Count Harrach|Count Harrach]], the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music;{{efn|Haydn reported this in his 1776 [[Autobiographical sketch (Haydn)|Autobiographical sketch]].}} however, Mathias was an enthusiastic [[folk music]]ian, who during the [[journeyman]] period of his career had taught himself to play the [[harp]]. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=80–81}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]], that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg {{convert|12|km}} away; he never again lived with his parents.

Life in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=82}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his musical training there, and could soon play both [[harpsichord]] and [[violin]]. The people of Hainburg heard him sing [[Boy soprano|treble]] parts in the church [[choir]].

There is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739{{efn|{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}. Jones (2009:7) dates the visit to early summer, i.e. cherry season, since during the visit Reutter plied the child with fresh cherries as a means of inducing him to learn to sing a trill.}} he was brought to the attention of [[Georg von Reutter]], the director of music in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister.

Haydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones2009a|pp=12–13}}. A third brother, [[Johann Evangelist Haydn]], also pursued a musical career as a tenor, but achieved no distinction and was for some time supported by Joseph.&lt;/ref&gt; The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of [[music theory]] and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as chorister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since St. Stephen's was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landon|Jones|1988|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. As he later told his biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies]], Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences—where the singers were usually served refreshments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=87}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WhereHaydnLived.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map showing [[List of residences of Joseph Haydn|locations where Haydn lived]] or visited)]]

=== Struggles as a freelancer ===
By 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress [[Maria Theresa]] herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it "crowing".&lt;ref name=Dies1810_89&gt;{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=89}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister.{{r|Dies1810_89}} This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first [[Caning|caned]], then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.

[[File:Dolní Lukavice castle 01.JPG|thumb|[[The Morzin palace in Dolní Lukavice]], Czech Republic|280x280px]]
Haydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet–accompanist for the Italian composer [[Nicola Porpora]], from whom he later said he learned "the true fundamentals of composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly in [[Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz]]'s employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the [[Judenplatz]].&lt;ref&gt;Rita Steblin, "Haydns Orgeldienste 'in der damaligen Gräfl. Haugwitzischen Kapelle{{'"}}, in: ''Wiener Geschichtsblätter'' 65/2000, pp. 124–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition. As a remedy, he worked his way through the [[counterpoint]] exercises in the text ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' by [[Johann Joseph Fux]] and carefully studied the work of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], whom he later acknowledged as an important influence.&lt;ref name="Geiringer30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, ''[[Der krumme Teufel]]'', "The Limping Devil", written for the comic actor [[Johann Joseph Felix Kurz]], whose stage name was "Bernardon". The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to "offensive remarks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Beghin|author2=Sander M. Goldberg|title=Haydn and the Performance of Rhetoric|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226041292|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFBILY-jSUsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna. He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the ''Hofkapelle'') in Lent and Holy Week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dexter Edge]], "New Sources for Haydn's Early Biography", unpublished paper given at the AMS Montréal, 7 November 1993 (see ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (2001), vol. 11, p. 265).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day. Countess Thun,{{efn|Various individuals bore the title "Countess Thun" over time. Candidates for the countess who engaged Haydn are (a) "the elder Countess Maria Christine Thun", {{Harv|Webster|2002}}; (b) [[Maria Wilhelmine Thun]] (later a famous salon hostess and patroness of Mozart), ([[Volkmar Braunbehrens]], 1990, ''Mozart in Vienna'').}} having seen one of Haydn's compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher.{{efn|{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=8}}. Webster expresses doubts, since the source is the early biography of [[Nicolas-Étienne Framery]], judged {{Harv|Webster|2002|p=1}} the least reliable of Haydn's early biographers.}} In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Fürnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets. Fürnberg later recommended Haydn to [[Count Morzin]], who, in 1757,{{efn|This date is uncertain, since the early biography of {{Harvtxt|Griesinger|1963}} gives 1759. For the evidence supporting the earlier date see {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=34}} and {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=10}}.}} became his first full-time employer.&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph: {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The years as Kapellmeister===
[[File:AnnaHaydn.jpg|thumb|Haydn's wife. Unauthenticated miniature attributed to [[Ludwig Guttenbrunn]]]]
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
Haydn's job title under Count Morzin was ''[[Kapellmeister]]'', that is, music director. He led the count's small orchestra in [[Dolní Lukavice|Unterlukawitz]] and wrote his first symphonies for this ensemble. In 1760, with the security of a Kapellmeister position, Haydn married. His wife was the former Maria Anna Theresia Keller (1730–1800),&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/09/joseph-haydns-real-wife_11.html "Joseph Haydn's Real Wife"] (Vienna 2014). As Lorenz notes, the identity of Haydn's wife was mistaken for most of the history of Haydn scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; the sister of Therese (b. 1733), with whom Haydn had previously been in love. Haydn and his wife had a completely unhappy marriage,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which time permitted no escape. They produced no children, and both took lovers.{{efn|Mrs. Haydn's paramour (1770) was [[Ludwig Guttenbrunn]], an artist who produced the portrait of Haydn [[#Guttenbrunn|seen above]] {{Harv|Landon|Jones| 1988|p=109}}. Joseph Haydn had a long relationship, starting in 1779, with the singer [[Luigia Polzelli]], and was probably the father of her son Antonio {{Harv|Landon|Jones|1988|p=116}}.}}

Count Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince [[Paul II Anton Esterházy|Paul Anton]], head of the immensely wealthy [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy family]]. Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterházy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister [[Gregor Werner]] retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.{{anchor|Guttenbrunn}}

As a "house officer" in the Esterházy establishment, Haydn wore [[livery]] and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat [[Schloss Esterházy]] in [[Eisenstadt]] and later on [[Esterháza]], a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing [[chamber music]] for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload,{{efn|Robbins Landon and Jones (1988, 100) write: "Haydn's duties were crushing. We can notice the effect in his handwriting, which becomes hastier as the 1770s turn to the 1780s: the notation starts to become ever more careless in the scores and the abbreviations multiply."}} the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn.{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Landon|Jones|1988|p=37}} The Esterházy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762–1790 [[Nikolaus Esterházy|Nikolaus I]]) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterházy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.
[[File:Nikolaus Esterhazy.jpg|thumb|left|Prince [[Nikolaus Esterházy]], Haydn's most important patron]]

Much of Haydn's activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the [[baryton]], an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass [[viol]], but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126 [[Baryton trios (Haydn)|baryton trios]]. Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the prince had built at Esterháza came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year. Haydn served as company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote [[List_of_operas_by_Joseph_Haydn#Composed_during_Haydn's_service_for_the_Eszterházy_family|several of the operas performed]] and wrote substitution [[aria]]s to insert into the operas of other composers.

1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterházy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract "acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside."{{sfn|Jones|2009b|p=136}} The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op. [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|33]], [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|50]], 54/55, and [[String Quartets, Op. 64 (Haydn)|64]]). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the [[Paris symphonies]] (1785–1786) and the original orchestral version of ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ (Haydn)|The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'' (1786), a commission from [[Cádiz]], Spain.
[[File:Fertőd - The Eszterházy Castle or Palace.jpg|thumb|250px|View of [[Eszterháza]]]]

The remoteness of Esterháza, which was farther from Vienna than Eisenstadt, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there.&lt;ref&gt;For details see {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, a particularly important one was with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger]] (1754–1793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterháza and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his [[Variations in F minor|F minor variations]] for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=316}}, citing Robbins Landon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another friend in Vienna was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whom Haydn [[Haydn and Mozart|had met]] sometime around 1784. According to later testimony by [[Michael Kelly (tenor)|Michael Kelly]] and others, the two composers occasionally played in [[string quartet]]s together.&lt;ref&gt;Webster and Feder 2001, section 3.4. Deutsch 1965, 234&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn was hugely impressed with Mozart's work and praised it unstintingly to others. Mozart evidently returned the esteem, as seen in his dedication of a set of six quartets, now called the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|"Haydn" quartets]], to his friend.

=== The London journeys ===

In 1790, Prince Nikolaus died and was succeeded as prince by his son [[Anton Esterházy|Anton]]. Following a trend of the time,{{sfn|Jones|2009a}} Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus.&lt;ref&gt;Geiringer (1982, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from [[Johann Peter Salomon]], a German violinist and  [[impresario]], to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.

The choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of [[Johann Christian Bach]] in 1782, Haydn's music had dominated the concert scene in London; "hardly a concert did not feature a work by him" (Jones).&lt;ref name="Jones2009b_325"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn's work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman &amp; [[Robert Broderip|Broderip]] (who served as agent in England for Haydn's Vienna publisher [[Artaria]]).{{r|Jones2009b_325}} Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been undertaken since 1782, though Haydn's loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting.{{r|Jones2009b_325}}

After fond farewells from Mozart and other friends,&lt;ref&gt;For narratives of Haydn's last days in Mozart's company, see [[Haydn and Mozart]]&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn departed Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in [[Calais]] in time to cross the English Channel on New Year's Day of 1791. It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the ocean. Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near [[Piccadilly Circus]])&lt;ref name="Jones2009b_137"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in a borrowed studio at the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]] piano firm nearby.{{r|Jones2009b_137}}

It was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn; both the 1791–1792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794–1795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure.{{efn|According to Jones, the London visits yielded a net profit of 15,000 florins. Haydn continued to prosper after the visits and at his death left an estate valued at 55,713 florins. These were substantial sums; for comparison, the house he bought in Gumpendorf in 1793 (and then remodeled) cost only 1370 florins (all figures from Jones 2009:144–146).}} [[Charles Burney]] reviewed the first concert thus: "Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England."{{efn|From Burney's memoirs; quoted from {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=234}}}} Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Rebecca Schroeter]].
[[File:Hanover-Square-Rooms.png|thumb|The [[Hanover Square Rooms]], principal venue of Haydn's performances in London|left|240x240px]]

Musically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the ''[[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|Surprise]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|Military]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Drumroll]]'' and ''[[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|London]]'' symphonies; the ''Rider'' quartet; and the [[Piano Trio No. 39 (Haydn)|"Gypsy Rondo"]] piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his very first project, the commissioned opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]]'' was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario [[John Gallini]] was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theater he directed, the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]]. Haydn was well paid for the opera (£300) but much time was wasted.{{efn|The premier performance did not take place until 1951, during the [[Florence May Festival]]. [[Maria Callas]] sang the role of Euridice. The opera and its history are discussed in {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=342–343}}.}} Thus only two new symphonies, [[Symphony No. 95 (Haydn)|no. 95]] and [[Symphony No. 96 (Haydn)|no. 96 ''Miracle'']], could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the [[Professional Concerts]], who recruited Haydn's old pupil [[Ignaz Pleyel]] as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.

The end of Salomon's series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country ([[Hertingfordbury]]), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University. The symphony performed for the occasion, [[Symphony No. 92 (Haydn)|no. 92]] has since come to be known as the ''Oxford Symphony'', although it had been written in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford Symphony'', article by Jane Holland in Jones (2009b:266)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franz Joseph Haydn 1732-1809 by John Hoppner 1791.jpg|thumb|195px|Haydn as portrayed by [[John Hoppner]] in England in 1791]]
While traveling to London in 1790, Haydn had met the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in his native city of [[Bonn]]. On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and [[Beethoven and his contemporaries#Joseph Haydn|was Haydn's pupil]] up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to [[Eisenstadt]] for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some [[counterpoint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Geiringer|1982|pp=131–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.

By the time he arrived on his second journey to England, (1794–1795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. For 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining ‘vocal performers of the first rank from abroad’, and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]]. These were the venue of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn ("Dr. Haydn's night") at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn's biographer [[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]] wrote that Haydn "considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him".{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=37}}

=== Years of celebrity in Vienna ===
Haydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy|Nikolaus II]] proposed that the Esterházy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterházys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses]] for them.

[[File:Haydn by Thaler Wien SAM 350 2.jpg|thumb|210px|Wax sculpture of Haydn by Franz Thaler, c. 1800|right]]
By this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windmühle,{{efn|The house, at Haydngasse 19, has since 1899 been a Haydn museum ([http://www.planetware.com/vienna/haydn-museum-a-w-hayd.htm 16 Top-Rated Museums and Art Galleries in Vienna – 16. Haydn House] by Bryan Dearsley; [http://www.wienmuseum.at/de/standorte/haydnhaus.html Haydnhaus], [[Vienna Museum]]).}} and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor [[Gottfried van Swieten]], and with funding from van Swieten's [[Gesellschaft der Associierten]], he composed his two great oratorios, ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of ''The Creation'' and ''The Seasons'' for charity benefits, including [[Tonkünstler-Societät]] programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular ''[[Trumpet Concerto (Haydn)|Trumpet Concerto]]'', and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 2 ("Fifths")|Fifths]]'', ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 ("Emperor")|Emperor]]'', and ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 4 ("Sunrise")|Sunrise]]''. A theme used in the ''Emperor'' quartet, "[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]" (the "Emperor's Hymn"; 1797), achieved great success and became "the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War" (Jones); the melody was eventually used for the ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'', whose third stanza is now the [[national anthem]] of Germany.

During the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterházys, the ''[[Harmoniemesse]]''.

On [[February, 12]] [[1785]] Joseph was initiated to the [[Scottish Rite]] Freemasonry in the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]] "Zur Wahren Eintracht", Vienna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.austria.info/uk/things-to-do/cities-and-culture/joseph-haydn-life-and-works/in-the-services-of-esterhazy | title = Profile and context of the life of Joseph Haydn | website = austria.info | access-date = Nov 17, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090926074613/https://www.flaminioonline.it/Biografie/Haydn%20-%20biografia.html | archive-date = OcSep 26, 2009 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | title = Celebrating more than 100 years of the Freemasonry: famous Freemasons in the history | language = en | website = Mathawan Lodge No 192 F.A. &amp; A.M., New Jersey | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153526/http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | archive-date = May 10, 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Retirement, illness, and death===
By the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though Jones suggests [[arteriosclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;For symptoms see {{harvnb|Jones|2009a|p=146}}; for the arteriosclerosis hypothesis see {{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions.{{efn|Of Haydn's plight, {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}} wrote, "The last years of Haydn's life, with all his success, comfort, and celebrity, are among the saddest in music. More moving than the false pathos of a [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Funeral|pauper's grave for Mozart]] ... is the figure of Haydn filled with musical ideas which were struggling to escape, as he himself said; he was too old and weak to go to the piano and submit to the discipline of working them out."}} His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I must have something to do—usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If it's an [[allegro (music)|allegro]] that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If it's an [[Adagio (music)|adagio]], then I notice my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier."{{efn|"Clavier" in the original German is ambiguous; literally "keyboard", it is used by extension to denote a keyboard instrument such as the piano or harpsichord. {{harvnb|Dies|1810|p=141}}.}} Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said "I am really just a living clavier."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:HaydnsHouseInVienna.PNG|thumb|left|200px|The house in Vienna (now [[Vienna Museum#Haydn House|a museum]]) where Haydn spent the last years of his life]]
The winding down of Haydn's career was gradual. The Esterházy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they  appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment: Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister&lt;ref name=Jones2009a_209&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2009a|p=209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] as Konzertmeister in 1804.{{sfn|Jones|2009a|pp=214–215}} Haydn's last summer in Eisenstadt was in 1803,{{r|Jones2009a_209}} and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of ''[[The Seven Last Words]]'' on 26 December 1803. As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered ''[[Missa brevis (Haydn)|Missa brevis]]'' from his teenage years and complete his [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 103|final string quartet]]. The latter project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements.{{sfn|Jones|2009a|p=213}}

Haydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geiringe|1982|p=198}} gives the testimony of Haydn's early biographer [[Giuseppe Carpani]].&lt;/ref&gt; During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his "[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser|Emperor's Hymn]]". A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of ''The Creation'' was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy&lt;!--Speculation?: , many of whom probably sensed that they were saying goodbye to the elderly composer--&gt;. Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=186–187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bergkirchemitkalvarienberg.jpg|thumb|[[Bergkirche (Eisenstadt)|Bergkirche]] in Eisenstadt, site of Haydn's tomb]]
Haydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under [[Napoleon]] launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighborhood. According to Griesinger, "Four [[case shot]]s fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble."&lt;ref name=Griesinger1810_50&gt;{{harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May.&lt;ref name=Jones2009b_142&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named Sulémy came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from ''The Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;"Mit Würd' und Hoheit angetan", the aria narrating the creation of humankind; Griesinger (1810:51). According to the less-reliable Dies, the date was 25 May, the officer's name was Sulimi, and he sang an aria from ''The Seasons'' ({{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=193}}}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May Haydn played his "Emperor's Hymn" with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be to his deathbed.{{r|Griesinger1810_50}} He died peacefully at 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 31 May 1809, aged 77.{{r|Jones2009b_142}} On 15 June, a memorial service was held in the [[Schottenkirche, Vienna|Schottenkirche]] at which Mozart's [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] was performed. Haydn's remains were interred in the local Hundsturm cemetery until 1820, when they were moved to Eisenstadt by Prince Nikolaus. His head took a different journey; [[Haydn's head|it was stolen]] shortly after burial by [[phrenology|phrenologists]], and the skull was reunited with the other remains only in 1954.

==Character and appearance==
[[File:Joseph Haydn Signature.svg|thumb|300px|Haydn's signature on a work of music: ''di me giuseppe Haydn'' ("by me Joseph Haydn"). He writes in Italian, a language he often used professionally.]]
[[File:Page 729 (A Dictionary of Music and Musicians-Volume 1).jpg|thumb|300px|"Laus Deo" ("praise be to God") at the conclusion of a Haydn manuscript.{{efn|The inscription continues (in abbreviations) "et Beatae Virgini Mariae et omnibus sanctis" ("and to the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints"). The image is taken from the 1900 edition of ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; it does not identify the work in question.}}]]

[[James Webster (musicologist)|James Webster]] writes of Haydn's public character thus: "Haydn's public life exemplified the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of the ''honnête homme'' (''honest man''): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other. His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as [[Kapellmeister]], entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favorable reception of his music."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=44}}. These same traits, and his connection to the aristocracy contributed to the decline in his reputation in the nineteenth century: {{Harvnb|Proksch|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see [[Papa Haydn]] and the tale of the [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|"Farewell" Symphony]]. Haydn had a robust sense of humor, evident in his love of practical jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=92–93}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a "happy and naturally cheerful temperament",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=91}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger|Mrs. Genzinger]] and in Dies's biography, based on visits made in Haydn's old age.

Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his [[rosary]] when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He normally began the manuscript of each composition with "in nomine Domini" ("in the name of the Lord") and ended with "Laus Deo" ("praise be to God").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haydn's primary character flaw was greed as it related to his business dealings. Webster writes: "As regards money, Haydn was so self-interested as to shock [both] contemporaries and many later authorities&amp;nbsp;... He always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterházy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice' and occasionally in outright fraud. When crossed in business relations, he reacted angrily."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[New Grove]]'', online edition, "Haydn, Joseph", section 6&lt;/ref&gt; Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer—and that outside of the world of business, in dealings, for example, with relatives and servants and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Haydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of [[smallpox]]; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease.{{efn|The date of Haydn's bout with smallpox is not preserved. It was prior to the time he was hired by Countess Thun (i.e. as a young adult; see above), since it is recorded that when she first encountered Haydn she observed his scars as part of the generally poor impression his appearance made on her. See Geiringer (1983:34).}} His biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies|Dies]] wrote: "he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. 'They couldn't have been led to it by my beauty.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dies|1810}}, (in the English translation from Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, p. 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

His nose, large and aquiline, was disfigured by the [[Nasal polyp|polyps]] he suffered during much of his adult life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadden|2010|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; an agonizing and debilitating disease that at times prevented him from writing music.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Jack (1998), "The agony of nasal polyps and the terror of their removal 200 years ago", ''The Laryngoscope'' 108(9): 1311–13 (September 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
James Webster summarizes Haydn's role in the history of classical music as follows: "He excelled in every musical genre.&amp;nbsp;... He is familiarly known as the 'father of the symphony' and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres."&lt;ref&gt;''New Grove'', online edition, article "Joseph Haydn"; accessed 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure and character of his music ===
A central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical [[Motif (music)|motifs]], often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Sutcliffe|1989|p=343}} mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: "[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves'&amp;nbsp;... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart."}}

[[File:Haydn Kaiserlied Reinschrift.jpg|thumb|250px|Original copy of "[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]" in Haydn's hand|left]]
Haydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called [[sonata form]]. His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called [[Sonata form#Monothematic expositions|monothematic exposition]], in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive [[thematic development]].{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|p=112}} writes: "Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order."}}

Haydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the [[fugue]] into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see [[sonata rondo form]]). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the [[double variation]] form—variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.

Perhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humor.{{efn|[[Steven Isserlis]] calls him "the funniest of the great composers" (preface to Richard Wigmore, ''The Faber Pocket Guide to Haydn'' (Faber, 2011)). {{Harvtxt|Brendel|2001}} focuses on the humor of both Haydn and Beethoven. {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=111}} attributes to Haydn "an aptitude for the facetious that no other composer enjoyed".}} The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|"Surprise" symphony]]; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous [[False ending#Music|false endings]] (e.g., in the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Op. 33 No. 2]] and [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|Op. 50 No. 3]]), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)#Opus 50, No. 1|Op. 50 No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;The means by which Haydn fools the listener as to the location of the downbeat are discussed by
Danuta Mirka (2009) ''Metric Manipulations in Haydn and Mozart: Chamber Music for Strings, 1787–1791'', Oxford University Press, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the music was written to please and delight a prince, and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality. Occasional minor-key works, often deadly serious in character, form striking exceptions to the general rule. Haydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn's "rollicking" finale type are found in the [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|"London" Symphony No. 104]], the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)|Op. 76 Nos. 3 and 5]], the [[Symphony No. 98 (Haydn)|Symphonies No. 98]] and [[Symphony No. 102 (Haydn)|102]], and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The [[minuets]] tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into "[[Scherzo|scherzi]]" which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.

===Evolution of Haydn's style===
Haydn's early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the High [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (seen in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]) had gone out of fashion. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=57}}. "[T]he period from 1750 to 1775 was penetrated by eccentricity, hit-or-miss experimentation, resulting in works which are still difficult to accept today because of their oddities". Similar remarks are made by {{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|pp=111–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An older contemporary whose work Haydn acknowledged as an important influence was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]].&lt;ref name="Geiringer30" /&gt;

Tracing Haydn's work over the six decades in which it was produced (roughly from 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style.

In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as "[[Sturm und Drang]]" ("storm and stress"). This term is taken from [[Sturm und Drang|a literary movement]] of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years.{{efn|See {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=18}}: "the term has been criticized: taken from the title of a play of 1776 by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Maximilian Klinger]], it properly pertains to a literary movement of the middle and late 1770s rather than a musical one of about 1768–1772".}} The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as "longer, more passionate, and more daring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the [[Symphony No. 44 (Haydn)|"Trauer" (Mourning) Symphony No. 44]], [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|"Farewell" Symphony No. 45]], the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|six "Sun" Quartets Op. 20]], all from c. 1771–72. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing [[fugue]]s in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.

Following the climax of the "Sturm und Drang", Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes [[Trumpet|trumpets]] and [[timpani]]. These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from "pure" music and toward the production of [[Opera buffa|comic operas]]. Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works,&lt;ref&gt;Webster and Feder 2001, section 3.iii&lt;/ref&gt; which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.
[[File:HaydnPlaying.jpg|thumb|350x350px|''Joseph Haydn Playing Quartets'']]
In 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of "pure" music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|six Op. 33 String Quartets]], announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in "a new and completely special way".{{efn|Original German "Neu, gantz besonderer Art"; Sisman (1993, 219)}} [[Charles Rosen]] has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the [[Classical music era|Classical]] style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of "Classical [[counterpoint]]" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33.{{efn|Rosen's case that Opus 33 represents a "revolution in style" (1971 and 1997, 116) can be found in chapter III.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}. For dissenting views, see {{Harvtxt|Larsen|1980|p=102}} and {{Harvtxt|Webster|1991}}. For discussion of the development of the same trend in Haydn's style in the symphonies that preceded the Opus 33 quartets see {{harvtxt|Rosen|1988|pp=181–186}}.}}

In the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his "popular style", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure.{{efn|Rosen discusses the popular style in ch. VI.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}.}} An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of [[folk music|folk]] or folk-like material (see [[Haydn and folk music]]). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen (1997 and 2001), 333–337 {{incomplete short citation|date=November 2018|reason=What's Rosen 2001?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve [[London symphonies|"London" symphonies]], the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late [[oratorio]]s.

The return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on ''The Creation'' so long because he wanted it to last.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in Haydn's approach was important in the [[history of classical music traditions|history of classical music]], as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high.{{efn|For discussion, see [[Antony Hopkins]] (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven'', Heinemann, London, pp. 7–8.}}

===Identifying Haydn's works===
Haydn's works are listed in a comprehensive catalogue prepared by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]. This [[Hoboken-Verzeichnis|Hoboken catalogue]] provides each work with an identifying number, called its Hoboken number (abbreviation: H. or Hob.). The string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but are usually identified instead by their [[opus number]]s, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together; thus for example the string quartet [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 ("Emperor")|Opus 76, No. 3]] is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.

'''Juan de Grijalva''' ({{IPA-es|xwan de ɣɾiˈxalβa|lang}}; born around 1489 in [[Cuéllar]], [[Crown of Castille]] - 21 January 1527 in [[Nicaragua]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]], and relation of [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Diego Velázquez]].&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} He went to [[Hispaniola]] in 1508 and to [[Cuba]] in 1511. He was one of the early explorers of the Mexican coastline.

==1518 expedition==
In 1518 Grijalva was one of the earliest to explore the shores of [[Mexico]].  According to [[Hernán Cortés]], 170 people went with him, but according to [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Pedro Mártir]], there were 300 people.  The [[Maritime pilot|main pilot]] was [[Antón de Alaminos]], the other pilots were Juan Álvarez (also known as ''el Manquillo''), [[Pedro Camacho de Triana]], and Grijalva. Other members included [[Francisco de Montejo]], [[Pedro de Alvarado]], [[Juan Díaz (Spanish conquistador)|Juan Díaz]], [[Francisco Peñalosa]], Alonso de Ávila,&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|50}} Alonso Hernández, [[Julianillo]], [[Melchorejo]], and [[Antonio Villafaña]]. They embarked from the port of [[Matanzas]], [[Cuba]], with four ships in April 1518.

[[File:Expedición de Girjalva 1518.svg|thumb|300px|Juan de Grijalva, expedition in 1518. Discovery by the Europeans of the Grijalva River.]]
After rounding the [[Cape San Antonio, Cuba|Guaniguanico]] in Cuba, Grijalva sailed along the Mexican coast, discovered [[Cozumel]], and arrived on 1 May at the [[Tabasco]] region in southern Mexico. The [[Grijalva River|Río Grijalva]] in Mexico was named after him. He was also the first Spaniard to encounter [[Moctezuma II]]'s delegation. One of the natives joined them, being baptized as Francisco, and became an interpreter on Cortes' expedition. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] wrote about the travels of Juan de Grijalva in his book.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|27-43,82}}

In 1518 [[Hernan Cortes]] stayed at Juan's home in [[Trinidad, Cuba]], at the start of his Mexican expedition. He recruited men there, including the five Alvarado brothers.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|49-50}}

He was killed by natives in [[Honduras]] on 21 January 1527.

{{more citations needed|date=August 2014}}
The '''Junto''', also known as the '''Leather Apron Club''', was a club for mutual improvement established in 1727 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].  The Leather Apron Club's purpose was to debate questions of morals, politics, and [[natural philosophy]], and to exchange knowledge of business affairs.

==History==
Franklin organized a group of friends to provide a structured form of mutual improvement. The group, initially composed of twelve members, called itself the Junto (the word is a mistaken use of the masculine singular Spanish adjective "joined", mistaken for the feminine singular noun "junta", "a meeting".  Both derive from Latin "iunct-", past participle of "iungere", "to join"). The members of the Junto were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all shared a spirit of inquiry and a desire to improve themselves, their community, and to help others. Among the original members were [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, a [[cabinetmaker]], a clerk, and a bartender. Although most of the members were older than Benjamin Franklin, he was clearly their leader.

At just 21, he oversaw five men, including [[Hugh Meredith]], Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto.  Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day.  Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto.

All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business.  Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and [[scrivener]], who also loved poetry and natural history. [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]] was a [[glazier]], [[mathematician]], and inventor; and Nicholas Scull and William Parsons were both surveyors.  Scull was also a [[bibliophile]] and Parsons a cobbler and [[Astrology|astrologer]].  William Maugridge was a cabinetmaker, [[William Coleman (judge)|William Coleman]] a merchant's clerk, and Robert Grace a gentleman.  Grace's wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group and a fine library.  The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of [[Penn State]] discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments, and verified that shoemaker John Jones Jr. was an original member.  Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]].  The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political, and scientific topics of the day.

Franklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]:

{{quote|I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.}}

{{quote|Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.}}

===Prehistory===
Franklin was influenced by two predecessor organizations in particular.

====Dry Club====
One was an English group called the "Dry Club," which had philosopher [[John Locke]], [[William Popple]], and [[Benjamin Furly]] among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's "heretics of the Lantern" society).&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, S. &amp; Schuurman, P., eds. ''Studies on Locke: Sources, Contemporaries, and Legacy'' (2008) pp.&amp;nbsp;163–65&lt;/ref&gt; It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions:&lt;ref&gt;"Rules of a Society" in ''The Remains of John Locke, Esq.'' (1714) p.&amp;nbsp;113&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Whether he loves all Men, of what Profession or Religion soever?
# Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his Body, Name, or Goods, for mere speculative Opinions, or his external way of Worship?
# Whether he loves and seeks Truth for Truth's sake; and will endeavour impartially to find and receive it himself, and to communicate it to others?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each member of the club would take turns proposing topics for discussion and moderating these discussions. The discussions were to be held in a spirit of open-minded tolerance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That no Person or Opinion be unhandsomely reflected on; but every Member behave himself with all the temper, judgement, modesty, and discretion he is master of.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Neighborhood benefit and reforming societies====
The other important predecessors were the "neighborhood benefit societies" and "reforming societies" proposed in Massachusetts by [[Cotton Mather]]. Cotton Mather described the neighborhood societies as being composed of a dozen married couples who would meet at one anothers' homes in succession for prayer and other religious exercises, and also to consider questions like the following:&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Cotton ''Essays to do good'' (1825 ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;108–11)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Who are in any peculiar adversity; and what may be done to comfort them?
* What contention or variance may there be among our neighbours; and what may be done for healing it?
* In what open transgressions do any live? and who shall be desired to carry faithful admonitions to them?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similar reforming societies would entertain questions like these:&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Cotton ''Essays to do good'' (1825 ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;194–95)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Can any further methods be devised that ignorance and wickedness may be more chased from our people in general; and that domestic piety, in particular, may flourish among them?
* Is there any instance of oppression or fraudulence in the dealings of any sort of people, which may call for our efforts to rectify it?
* Is there any matter to be humbly recommended to the legislative power, to be enacted into a law for the public benefit?
* Do we know of any person languishing under severe affliction, and is there any thing we can do for the succour of that afflicted neighbour?
* Has any person a proposal to make, for our further advantage and assistance, that we may be in a better and more regular capacity for prosecuting these intentions?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Questions==
The Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. In fact, through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital.

===List of questions===
This is the list of questions Franklin devised to guide the discussions at Junto meetings (from Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and included in some editions of his autobiography):&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, ed. Benjamin Vaughan, (London, 1779), pp. 533-6 http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=1&amp;page=255a&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? Particularly in [[history]], [[morality]], [[poetry]], [[physics]], travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge?
# What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?
# Has any citizen in your knowledge failed in his business lately, and what have you heard of the cause?
# Have you lately heard of any citizen's thriving well, and by what means?
# Have you lately heard how any present rich man, here or elsewhere, got his estate?
# Do you know of any fellow citizen, who has lately done a worthy action, deserving praise and imitation? Or who has committed an error proper for us to be warned against and avoid?
# What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard? Of imprudence? Of passion? Or of any other vice or folly?
# What happy effects of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]? Of prudence? Of moderation? Or of any other virtue?
# Have you or any of your acquaintance been lately sick or wounded? If so, what remedies were used, and what were their effects?
# Who do you know that are shortly going [on] voyages or journeys, if one should have occasion to send by them?
# Do you think of any thing at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? To their country, to their friends, or to themselves?
# Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting, that you heard of? And what have you heard or observed of his character or merits? and whether think you, it lies in the power of the Junto to oblige him, or encourage him as he deserves?
# Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?
# Have you lately observed any defect in the laws, of which it would be proper to move the legislature an amendment? Or do you know of any beneficial law that is wanting?
# Have you lately observed any encroachment on the just liberties of the people?
# Hath any body attacked your reputation lately? And what can the Junto do towards securing it?
# Is there any man whose friendship you want, and which the Junto, or any of them, can procure for you?
# Have you lately heard any member's character attacked, and how have you defended it?
# Hath any man injured you, from whom it is in the power of the Junto to procure redress?
# In what manner can the Junto, or any of them, assist you in any of your honourable designs?
# Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service?
# What benefits have you lately received from any man not present?
# Is there any difficulty in matters of opinion, of justice, and injustice, which you would gladly have discussed at this time?
# Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?

Any person to be qualified as a member was to stand up, lay his hand upon his chest, over his heart, and be asked the following questions, viz.
# Have you any particular disrespect to any present members? ''Answer.'' I have not.
# Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever? ''Answer.'' I do.
# Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name, or goods, for mere speculative opinions, or his external way of worship? ''Answer.'' No.
# Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavor impartially to find and receive it yourself, and communicate it to others? ''Answer.'' Yes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3452">[[File:Juozas Ambrazevičius-Brazaitis.jpg|thumb|right|Juozas Ambrazevičius in 1925]]
'''Juozas Ambrazevičius''' or '''Juozas Brazaitis''' (December 9, 1903 in [[Trakiškiai (Marijampolė)|Trakiškiai]],&lt;!-- not to be confused with Trakiškiai (Varėna) or Trakiškės --&gt; [[Marijampolė parish]]&lt;!-- Marijampolės valsčius --&gt; – October 28, 1974 in [[South Orange, New Jersey]]), was a [[Lithuania]]n literary historian, better known for his political career and [[nationalist]]ic views. He was the acting [[Prime Minister of Lithuania|Prime Minister]] of the [[Provisional Government of Lithuania]] from June 23, 1941 to August 5, 1941.

==Academic career==

Ambrazevičius studied literature at [[University of Lithuania]] in Kaunas and [[University of Bonn]]. From 1927 he lectured on [[Lithuanian literature]] and folklore in [[Kaunas]]. By the end of the 1930s he got involved in numerous organizations for literature teachers and scientists. His major works include ''Theory of Literature'' (''Literatūros teorija'' in 1930), two-volume ''A History of World Literature'' (''Visoutinė literatūros istorija'' in 1931-1932), ''[[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas|Vaižgantas]]'' (in 1936), three-volume ''New Readings'' (''Naujieji skaitymai''), ''Lithuanian Writers'' (''Lietuvių rašytojai'' in 1938). He also worked on the editorial staff of national daily ''Lietuva'' (''Lithuania'') and Catholic daily ''XX amžius'' (''The 20th Century''). He would sometimes use [[pseudonym]] Servus to write for these newspapers. During [[World War II]] he edited an underground periodical ''Į laisvę'' (''Towards Freedom'') which he later revived in Germany and in the United States.

==Grave==
In 2012, Ambrazevičius remains were transported from the United States to Lithuania and were reburied in the [[churchyard]] of [[Christ's Resurrection Church, Kaunas|Christ's Resurrection Church]] in [[Kaunas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kaune perlaidojami 1941-ųjų Laikinosios vyriausybės vadovo Juozo Brazaičio palaikai |url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/kaune-perlaidojami-1941-uju-laikinosios-vyriausybes-vadovo-juozo-brazaicio-palaikai-56-219988 |website=15min.lt |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Halévy''' (4 January 1802 &amp;ndash; 2 September 1883) was a French civil servant, historian, and [[dramatist]].

==Early life==
Born to a Jewish family in Paris, Léon was the son of the writer and [[chazzan]] [[Élie Halévy (Chalfan)|Élie Halévy]] and the younger brother of the composer [[Fromental Halévy|Jacques François Fromenthal Halévy]]. He was educated at the [[Lycée Charlemagne]].

==Career==
Halévy became a disciple and collaborator of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], aiding in the foundation of his journal, ''Le Producteur,'' and writing the introduction to his work, ''Opinions Littéraires, Philosophiques et Industrielles,'' in which [[Olinde Rodrigues]] and Étienne-Martin Bailly also assisted. In 1828 he wrote a ''History of the Jews in Modern Times'', one of the earliest works on this topic.

In 1831, Halévy became an assistant professor of [[French literature]] at the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], where there was some discrimination against Jews. However he abandoned the position three years later.

In 1837, Halévy was attached to the Ministry of Public Instruction as chief of the bureau of scientific societies, and remained there until his retirement in 1853, after which he devoted the remainder of his life to literature, writing a large number of poems, translations, plays, and other works. Few of these are read today, although he was well regarded in his time. Amongst them was a biography of his brother Fromental, published after the latter's death in 1864.

==Personal life and death==
Halévy became [[baptism|baptised]] in order to marry the daughter of the architect [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]]. Their son [[Ludovic Halévy]] was one of the leading [[libretto|librettists]] of mid-century France. Ludovic's own children, [[Élie Halévy]] and [[Daniel Halévy]], were noted academics. Another son, by Léon's irregular liaison with an opera singer, was the politician [[Lucien-Anatole Prévost-Paradol]].

Halévy died, aged 81, at [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">The '''''Source of Genealogy'''''  or '''''Manba Al-Ansāb''''' (Arabic: منبع الانساب | Persian: منبع انساب) is a historical document outlining various topics including the [[genealogy]] of the Sayyids of [[Bukkur]] (Urdu بھاکری سادات) and [[Sufism]] written by Sayyid Muīn Al-Haqq around 1426 [[AD]] and the Islamic year 830. Sayyid Muīn is a notable [[Sayyid]] who descends from the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]] through his descendant, [[Ali al-Hadi]]. The work was extended by a lineal sixth degree descendant of Sayyid Muīn. Sayyid Ali Ghazanfar [[Pseudonym|alias]] Jārullah added more information other Sayyid ancestries and other [[Sufi]] orders. Sayyid Muīn lived in [[India]] where the book was originally written in [[Persian language|Persian]] and was later translated into [[Urdu]]. Manba Al-Ansāb can also be found in the manuscript form in [[The British Library]] and [[Allahabad]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;''Persian Literature: A Bio-Bibliographical Survey'', Volume 1, Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

'''Sayyid Muīn''' lived in [[Jhusi]] and belonged to the [[Suhrawardiyya]] Sufi order. He would often spend his time travelling and learning. His ancestors originally came from [[Bukkur]] in [[Sindh]], which was the home of Sayyids of Bukkur and settled in Jhusi where they established a centre for the propagation of [[Islam]]. In the course of his wanderings, he set out to ascertain and authenticate his ancestry which connected to [[Ali al-Hadi]]. He went to Bukkur, the home of his ancestors and obtained a certificate of his pedigree from relatives who are from the same line of descent. Sayyid Muīn was shown a family tree of ancestry which was brought from [[Mashhad]] in [[Iran]] to Sindh by [[Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki]], the common ancestor of all Bukkuri
/Bhakri Sayyids(Urdu: بهاكري سادات), on which he based this book. He outlined the essentials of [[Sufism]] and also made an account of the Sayyids of Bukkur and Allahabad.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Indo-Persian Literature'', Page 431&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Marcus Cluvius Rufus''' was a Roman consul, senator, governor, and historian who was mentioned on several occasions by [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Cassius Dio]], [[Josephus]] and [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Career==
Cluvius was [[Roman consul|consul ''suffectus'']] in AD 45, during the reign of the emperor [[Claudius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'' Life of Nero 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.14&lt;/ref&gt;  He had been involved in the conspiracy to assassinate [[Caligula]], but it is not known to what degree.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ex-consul during the early part of [[Nero|Nero's]] reign, Cluvius knew many members of the emperor's inner circle,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'' Life of Nero 21&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared as the emperor's herald at the games in which Nero made his appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'' Life of Nero 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.14&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[year of the four emperors]], Cluvius was governor of [[Hispania]].  Tacitus said "Spain was under the government of Cluvius Rufus, an eloquent man, who had all the accomplishments of civil life, but who was without experience in war."  Nobody had been endangered by his actions during Nero's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' I.8, ''Histories'' IV.43&lt;/ref&gt;  On the death of Galba, Cluvius first swore allegiance to [[Otho]], but soon afterwards he became a partisan of [[Vitellius]].  Hilarius, a freedman of Vitellius, accused him of aspiring to obtain the government of Hispania independent of the emperor, but Cluvius went to Vitellius, who was then in Gaul, and succeeded in clearing his name.  Cluvius is said to have pushed senators to demand more power from the emperor during the reign of [[Vitellius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' IV.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''The Parallel Lives'', Life of Otho 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
Cluvius Rufus was an important historian whose writing and testimony, though now lost, certainly shaped modern understanding of first century Rome.  He was a contemporary of Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, but little is known of the extent of his work except that it related to events during the reign of these emperors.  Cluvius was one of the primary sources for Tacitus' ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', Suetonius' ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Josephus]]' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', [[Plutarch|Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and probably for later historians.

'''Max Ludwig Cetto''' (February 20, 1903 &amp;ndash; April 5, 1980) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[architect]], [[historian]] of [[architecture]], and [[professor]].

== Life ==
Born in [[Koblenz]], [[Germany]], Max Cetto studied at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], [[Technical University of Munich|Munich]] and [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin]]. At the latter he studied with [[Hans Poelzig]], graduating as an engineer–architect in 1926 and worked then for the [[New Frankfurt]] project. After 1929 he taught also some years at the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach]].

In 1932 he took part in the competition for the design of the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. Founder-member [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]], 1928. He moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1938, where he worked for Los Angeles-based architect [[Richard Neutra]] on projects including the Kahn House (1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggener|first1=Keith|title=Postwar Modernism in Mexico: Luis Barragan's Jardines del Pedregal and the International Discourse on Architecture and Place|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|date=June 1999|volume=58|issue=2|pages=122–145|doi=10.2307/991481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Married Gertrud Catarina Kramis in 1940; children: Verónica, Ana María, and Bettina Cetto. He settled in [[Mexico]] and became a [[naturalized]] Mexican in 1947. As well as having a natural [[wikt:affinity|affinity]] with Mexico, he was able to incorporate his [[Europe]]an experiences into what he built there. The respect for nature he had learned from Neutra is evident in his handling of the volcanic terrain of the [[Jardines del Pedregal]], [[Mexico City]], where he [[collaboration|collaborated]] with [[Luis Barragán]], constructing various houses amid the impressive scenery of the place without disturbing the volcanic lava or the vegetation. He also showed skill and great sensitivity in using the materials and techniques of the region.

Notable examples of his work there are the studio house of 1944 for the surrealist painter [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in San Angel, the Quintana Weekend House at the Tequesquitengo Lake (1947), his own house (1949) and that built in 1951 for the painter [[Roberto Berdecio]] (b 1910). These and other houses elsewhere, where he combined a [[Modernist]] approach with a respect for [[ecology]], were highly influential in Mexican domestic architecture. He was [[Professor]] of Architecture at the Faculty of Architecture [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]], from 1965 to 1979. †Mexico City, 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Megullia''', surnamed '''Dotata''' ('richly dowered'), was an ancient Roman noblewoman.

==Life==
Megullia is one of the one hundred and six subjects of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]’s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' (''De mulieribus claris'', 1362).&lt;ref name=GB&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio, Giovanni]], ''Famous Women'', translated by Virginia Brown (Cambridge and London, [[Harvard University Press]], 2001) pp. 109-110 ({{ISBN|0-674-01130-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; She is famous (as Boccaccio says) "more through the lavishness of her ancestors than through the worthiness of any of her own deeds. For at that time it seemed such a marvellous thing to give 50,000 bronze coins as dowry to one's husband..."&lt;ref name=guarino&gt;Boccaccio, Giovanni, ''Concerning Famous Women'', translated by Guido A. Guarino (New Brunswick, [[Rutgers University Press]], 1963) pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  Boccaccio used manuscripts of [[Valerius Maximus]] as his source, but they "disagree widely about the amount of money in Megullia's dowry".&lt;ref name=guarino/&gt; Valerius says in his Book 4 (4.10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html Valerius Maximus — Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] wrote to the Senate from Spain asking to be replaced. He wanted to go home to build up a dowry for his daughter that just became of marrying age.&lt;ref&gt;Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome By Valerius Maximus translated by Henry J. Walker, P. 141, {{ISBN|0-87220-674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate wanted Scipio to stay in command, so they consulted with the bride to be and Scipio's family and agreed on an amount that would be acceptable for a dowry of a daughter of a person of such high rank. They raised a dowry for Scipio's daughter from the treasury of 40,000 [[As (coin)|asses]]. [[Valerius Maximus|Valerius]] compares this sum of a family fortune to those raised for "Tuccia, daughter of [[Caeso Quinctius]]" (10,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') and for Megullia, daughter of a consul (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') - from which the name "Dotata" (dowried) came when she entered her husband's house with this large amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5imDC6VN-FcC&amp;pg=PA141 translation of Valerius Maximus' Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to make then the name of the woman with such a large dowry that of '''''Megullia Dotata'''''. Besides Scipio and Fabricius, the Senate raised dowries for the daughters of others they wished to keep in service if there were no family funds for a dowry, like in the case of [[Fabricius Luscinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livy]], ''History of Rome'', Vol. 3 [10 AD], Book XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dotata==
At the beginning of the Roman republic [[dowry|dowries]] were small.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638349 Roman Dowry and the Devolution of Property in the Principate]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the dowry given by the senate to the daughter of [[Scipio Africanus]] was only 35 pounds or 11,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass.''&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Alexander; ''Roman antiquities: or An account of the manners and customs of the Romans'', p. 329; 1842 New York; New York public library 480576A&lt;/ref&gt; If the dowry was about five times this amount, 160 - 175 pounds (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass''), then it was considered a Great Fortune and ''Megullia'' was nicknamed ''Dotata''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, ''op. cit.'', p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''dotata'' was synonymous with "dowry girl" and was the name given to the bride that had a [[dowry]]. This trend continued for a long time and if anything above a normal amount was given then the female giver was called a ''Megullia Dotata''.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

For the 9th-century Byzantine Emperor with the byname Psellus, see [[Michael II]]. "Michael Psellus the Elder" redirects here and is covered below under [[#Pseudo-Psellus|Pseudo-Psellus]].''

[[File:Michael Psellos.jpg|thumb|240px|Michael Psellos (left) with his student, Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]].]]
'''Michael Psellos''' or '''Psellus''' ({{lang-el|Μιχαὴλ Ψελλός|translit=Mikhaēl Psellos}}; {{lang-la|Michaël Psellus}}) was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] monk, savant, writer, philosopher, politician and historian. He was born in 1017 or 1018, and is believed to have died in 1078, although it has also been maintained that he remained alive until 1096.

==Biography and political career==
The main source of information about Psellos' life comes from his own works, which contain extensive autobiographical passages. Michael Psellos was probably born in [[Constantinople]]. His family hailed from [[Nicomedia]] and, according to his own testimony, counted members of the consular and patrician elite among its ancestors. His baptismal name was '''Constantine'''; Michael was the monastic name he chose when he entered a monastery later in life. '''Psellos''' ('the stammerer') probably was a personal by-name referring to a speech defect.

Michael Psellos was educated in Constantinople. At around the age of ten, he was sent to work outside the capital as a secretary of a provincial judge, in order to help his family raise the dowry for his sister. When his sister died, he gave up that position and returned to Constantinople to resume his studies. While studying under [[John Mauropus]], he met the later Patriarchs [[Constantine III of Constantinople|Constantine Leichoudes]] and [[Patriarch John VIII of Constantinople|John Xiphilinos]], and the later emperor [[Constantine X|Constantine X Doukas]]. For some time, he worked in the provinces again, now serving as a judge himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Michael Psellus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time before 1042 he returned again to Constantinople, where he got a junior position at court as a secretary ({{lang|grc|ὑπογραμματεύς}}) in the imperial chancellery. From there he began a rapid court career. He became an influential political advisor to emperor [[Constantine IX|Constantine IX Monomachos]] (reigned 1042–1055). During the same time, he became the leading professor at the [[University of Constantinople]], bearing the honorary title of "Chief of the Philosophers" ({{lang|grc|ὕπατος τῶν φιλοσόφων}} ''hypatos tōn philosophōn'').

Despite his leading eminence and prowess in learning, his knowledge of [[Latin (language)|Latin]] was cloudy enough to confuse [[Cicero]] with [[Caesar]]. This is cited as one prime example of the paradigm of how the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] had lost nearly all of its connection to its nominal Roman roots by the High Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx|title=The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|website=orthodoxinfo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of Monomachos' reign, Psellos found himself under political pressure for some reason and finally decided to leave the court, entering the [[Olympus (monastery)|Olympus monastery]] on [[Uludağ|Mount Olympus]] in [[Bithynia]] in 1054. After Monomachos' death, however, he was soon recalled to court by his successor, Empress [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]] (reigned 1055–1056). Throughout the following years, he remained active in politics, serving as a high-ranking political advisor to several successive emperors. He played a decisive political role in the transition of power from [[Michael VI]] to [[Isaac I Komnenos]] in 1057; then from Isaac Komnenos to [[Constantine X]] Doukas (1059); and then again from [[Romanos IV]] Diogenes to [[Michael VII|Michael VII Doukas]] (1071). As Psellos had served as Michael's personal teacher during the reign of Michael's father Constantine, and as he had played an important role in helping Michael gain power against his adversary and stepfather Romanos, Psellos probably entertained hopes of an even more influential position as a teacher and advisor under him. However, Michael seems to have been less inclined towards protecting Psellos and after the mid-1070s there is no more information about any role played by Psellos at court. As his own autobiographic accounts cease at this point, there is little reliable information about his later years. Some scholars believe that Psellos  had to retreat into a monastery again at some time during the 1070s.&lt;ref name="refjoannou"&gt;Perikles P. Joannou: "Psellos et le monastère *{{lang|grc|Τὰ Ναρσοῦ}}". ''Byzantinische Zeitschrift'' 44: 283–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a remark by Psellos' fellow historian [[Joannes Zonaras]], it is believed by most scholars that Psellos died soon after the fall of Michael VII in 1078,&lt;ref name="refhunger"&gt;Herbert Hunger: ''Die hochsprachliche profane Literatur der Byzantiner.'' 2 vols. München 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars have also proposed later dates.&lt;ref name="refpolemis"&gt;Ioannes Polemis: "When did Psellos die?" ''Byzantinische Zeitschrift'' 58: 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; What is known is that Theophylaktos of Bulgaria wrote a letter to Psellos's brother comforting him on the death of his brother saying that, "Your brother has not died, but has departed to [[God]] released of both a painful life and disease".&lt;ref name="refTheophylaktos"&gt;P. Gautier, Theophylacte d'Achrida. Lettres. Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae. Series Thessalonicensis 16.2. Thessalonica: Association for Byzantine Research, 1986. Letter 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Chronographia''== 
&lt;!--[[Chronographia (Psellos)]] redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Rulers of Byzantine Empire in XI century..pdf|thumb|Rulers of the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century. Based on ''Chronographia'']]
Probably Psellos' best known and most accessible work is the ''Chronographia''. It is a history of the Byzantine emperors during the century leading up to Psellos' own time. It covers the reigns of fourteen emperors and empresses, beginning with the almost 50-year-long reign of [[Basil II|Basil II, the "Bulgar-Slayer"]] (976–1025), and ending some time during the reign of [[Michael VII Doukas]] (1071–1078). It is structured mainly as a series of biographies. Unlike most other historiographical works of the period, it places much more emphasis on the description of characters than on details of political and military events. It also includes very extensive autobiographical elements about Psellos' political and intellectual development, and it gives far greater weight to those periods when Psellos held an active position in politics (especially the reign of Constantine IX), giving the whole work almost the character of political memoirs. It is believed to have been written in two parts. The first covers the emperors up to [[Isaac I Komnenos]]. The second, which has a much more strongly apologetic tone, is in large parts an [[encomium]] on Psellus' current protectors, the emperors of the Doukas dynasty.

==Other works==
Psellos left many other writings:

#"Historia syntomos", a shorter, didactic historical text in the form of a world chronicle.
#A large number of scientific, philosophical and religious treatises. One well-known example of these is ''De Operatione Daemonum'', a [[Psellus' classification of demons|classification of demons]]. He wrote or compiled an important work on philosophy, the ''De omnifaria doctrina.'' Other works deal with topics such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[music]], [[jurisprudence]], [[physics]], and [[laography]].
# Various didactic poems on topics such as [[grammar]] and [[rhetorics]].
# Three ''Epitaphioi'' or funeral orations over the patriarchs [[Michael Cerularius|Michael Keroularios]], [[Constantine III of Constantinople|Constantine III Leichoudes]] and [[Patriarch John VIII of Constantinople|John Xiphilinos]].
#A funeral oration for his mother, including a large amount of autobiographic information.
#Several  [[panegyric]]s, persuasive speeches (including works against the [[Bogomils]] and [[Euchites]]) and speeches addressed to his patron emperors at court.
#Several hundred personal letters.
# [[Rhetoric]]al exercises and essays on set themes.
# Occasional, satirical, and epigrammatic verse.

==Personality==
Psellos was universally educated and had a reputation for being one of the most learned men of his time. He prided himself on having single-handedly reintroduced to Byzantine scholarship a serious study of ancient philosophy, especially of [[Plato]]. His predilection for Plato and other pagan (often [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]) philosophers led to doubts about the orthodoxy of his faith among some of his contemporaries, and at one point he was forced to make a public profession of faith in his defense.  He also prided himself on being a master of rhetoric, combining the wisdom of the philosopher and the persuasiveness of the rhetorician. This made him the model of a political leader and advisor. Among modern commentators, Psellos' penchant for long autobiographical digressions in his works has earned him accusations of vanity and ambition. At the same time, his political career and the contents of his ''Chronographia'' have led commentators to characterize him as obsequious and opportunistic, because of his ostensibly uncritical stance towards some of the emperors and because of the many shifts in his political loyalty over the course of his life. However, other commentators argue that there is a powerful ironic undercurrent running through his work, especially the ''Chronographia'', transmitting highly critical and subversive messages about the emperors portrayed,&lt;ref name="refpietsch"&gt;Efthymia Pietsch: ''Die "Chronographia" des Michael Psellos: Kaisergeschichte, Autobiographie und Apologie''. Wiesbaden 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; or even about Byzantine [[Christian]] beliefs and morality at large.&lt;ref name="refkaldellis"&gt;Anthony Kaldellis: ''The argument of Psellos' Chronographia.'' Boston 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, serious questions were raised during Psellos' lifetime concerning his religious beliefs. For example, according to Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis, "In 1054 he [Psellos] was accused by his erstwhile friend, the future Patriarch John Xiphilinos, of forsaking Christ to follow Plato." [Kaldellis, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;4] Even stronger doubts arose concerning Psellos' student, [[John Italos]], who succeeded Psellos as Chief of the Philosophers. Italos was publicly accused of teaching such "Hellenizing" ideas as [[metempsychosis]] and the [[eternity of the world]]. Italos faced such accusations twice, and both times he confessed and recanted.&lt;ref name="refclucas"&gt;Lowell Clucas: "The Trial of John Italos and the Crisis of Intellectual Values in Byzantium in the Eleventh Century", München 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudo-Psellos&lt;!--;Michael Psellos the Elder' and 'Pseudo-Psellos' redirect here--&gt;==
It was once thought that there was another Byzantine writer of the same name, '''Michael Psellos the Elder'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (now also called '''Pseudo-Psellos'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), who lived on the island of [[Andros]] in the 9th century, and who was a pupil of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and teacher of emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]]. Michael Psellos himself was also called "the younger" by some authors. This belief was based on an entry in a medieval chronicle, the {{lang|grc|Σύνοψις Κεδρηνοῦ-Σκυλίτση}}, which mentions the name in that context. It is now believed that the inclusion of the name Psellos in this chronicle was the mistake of an ignorant copyist at a later time, and that no "Michael Psellos the elder" ever existed.&lt;ref name="reflemerle"&gt;Paul Lemerle: ''Le premier humanisme byzantin: Notes et remarques sur enseignement et culture à Byzance des origines au Xe siècle.'' Paris 1971. (ch. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Pseudo-Psellos" is also used in modern scholarship to describe the authorship of several later works that are believed to have been falsely ascribed to Psellos in Byzantine times.

In the gloss of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', there is a reference to "the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus" as an authority on "the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels".

The British poet [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]] includes a poem about Psellus in his 1986 collection, ''[[Two Horse Wagon Going By]]'', 'Mezzomephistophelean Scholion'.

Psellos appears also in [[Tim Severin]]'s novel ''Viking: King's Man'', the final piece of the ''Viking trilogy''.

[[File:Tiny Tiny RSS English Interface.png|thumb|upright=1.5|User interface of the feed reader [[Tiny Tiny RSS]]]]
In computing, a '''news aggregator''', also termed a '''feed aggregator''', '''feed reader''', '''news reader''', '''[[RSS]] reader''' or simply '''aggregator''', is [[client (computing)|client software]] or a [[web application]] which aggregates [[web syndication|syndicated web content]] such as [[online newspaper]]s, [[blog]]s, [[podcast]]s, and [[Video logging|video blogs]] (vlogs) in one location for easy viewing. RSS is a synchronized subscription system. RSS uses extensible markup language (XML) to structure pieces of information to be aggregated in a feed reader that displays the information in a user-friendly interface. The updates distributed may include journal tables of contents, podcasts, videos, and news items.&lt;ref name="Miles 425–432"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = RIP RSS: Reviving Innovative Programs through Really Savvy Services|url = http://www-tandfonline-com.focus.lib.kth.se/doi/pdf/10.1080/15323260903253753|journal = Journal of Hospital Librarianship|pages = 425–432|volume = 9|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/15323260903253753|first = Alisha|last =  Miles|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Visiting many separate websites frequently to find out if content on the site has been updated can take a long time. Aggregation technology helps to consolidate many websites into one page that can show the new or updated information from many sites. Aggregators reduce the time and effort needed to regularly check websites for updates, creating a unique information space or ''personal newspaper''. Once subscribed to a feed, an aggregator is able to check for new content at user-determined intervals and retrieve the update. The content is sometimes described as being ''[[pull technology|pulled]]'' to the subscriber, as opposed to ''[[push technology|pushed]]'' with email or IM. Unlike recipients of some ''[[push technology|push]]'' information, the aggregator user can easily unsubscribe from a feed.

RSS uses extensible markup language (XML) to structure pieces of information to be aggregated in a feed reader that displays the information in a user-friendly interface.&lt;ref name="Miles 425–432"/&gt;  Before subscribing to RSS, users have to install either "feed reader" or "aggregator" applications in order to read RSS feed. The aggregator provides a consolidated view of the content in one browser display or desktop application. "Desktop applications offer the advantages of a potentially richer user interface and of being able to provide some content even when the computer is not connected to the Internet. Webbased feed readers offer the great convenience of allowing users to access up-to-date feeds from any Internet-connected computer."&lt;ref name="Doree 57–58"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = RSS: A Brief Introduction|journal = The Journal of Manual &amp; Manipulative Therapy|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1066-9817|pmc = 2565593|pmid = 19066644|pages = 57–58|volume = 15|issue = 1|first = Jim|last = Doree|doi=10.1179/106698107791090169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some applications will have an automated process to subscribe to a news feed, the basic way to subscribe is by simply clicking on the RSS icon and/or text link.&lt;ref name="Doree 57–58"/&gt; Aggregation features are frequently built into [[web portal]] sites, in the [[web browser]]s themselves, in [[email]] applications or in [[application software]] designed specifically for reading feeds. Aggregators with [[podcasting]] capabilities can automatically download media files, such as [[MP3]] recordings. In some cases, these can be automatically loaded onto [[portable media player]]s (like [[iPod]]s) when they are connected to the end-user's computer. By 2011, so-called ''RSS-narrators'' appeared, which aggregated text-only news feeds, and converted them into audio recordings for offline listening. The syndicated content an aggregator will retrieve and interpret is usually supplied in the form of [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] or other [[XML]]-formatted data, such as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/XML or [[Atom (standard)|Atom]].

== History ==
RSS began in 1999 "when it was first introduced by Internet-browser pioneer Netscape".&lt;ref name="Doree 57–58"/&gt; In the beginning, RSS was not a user-friendly gadget and it took some years to spread. "...RDF-based data model that people inside Netscape felt was too complicated for end users."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom|last = Hammersley|first = Ben|publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-596-00881-9|location = Sebastopol|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of RSS began in the early 2000s when the New York Times implemented RSS: "One of the first, most popular sites that offered users the option to subscribe to RSS feeds was the New York Times, and the company’s implementation of the format was revered as the 'tipping point' that cemented RSS’s position as a de facto standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Reader is dead but the race to replace the RSS feed is very alive|url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/google-reader-is-dead-but-the-race-to-replace-the-rss-feed-is-very-alive/#ixzz3usvMfKvJ|website = Digital Trends|accessdate = 2015-12-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "In 2005, major players in the web browser market started integrating the technology directly into their products, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari." As of the end of 2015, according to BuiltWith.com there were 20,516,036 live websites using RSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RSS Usage Statistics|url = http://trends.builtwith.com/feeds/RSS|website = trends.builtwith.com|access-date = 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Web aggregators gather material from a variety of sources for display in one location. They may additionally process the information after retrieval for individual clients.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 100–115"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = News aggregator services: user expectations and experience|journal = Online Information Review|pages = 100–115|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/14684520610659157|first = Sudatta|last = Chowdhury|first2 = Monica|last2 = Landoni|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Google News]] gathers and publishes material independent of customers' needs while [[Awasu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awasu.com/|title=Welcome to Awasu|website=www.Awasu.com|access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is created as an individual RSS tool to control and collect information according to clients' criteria. There are a variety of software applications and components available to collect, format, translate, and republish XML feeds, a demonstration of [[Separation of presentation and content|presentation-independent data]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

===News aggregation websites===
{{refimprove section|reason=The claim of examples having entirely automated aggregation is a very specific claim, and should be backed up with a citation to ensure correctness and allow verifiability.|date=January 2014}}

A news aggregator provides and updates information from different sources in systematized way. "Some news aggregator services also provide update services, whereby a user is regularly updated with the latest news on a chosen topic."&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 100–115"/&gt; Websites such as [[Google News]]&lt;ref name="webs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorsweblog.org/analysis/2009/03/google_news_and_newspaper_publishers_all.php|title=Google News and newspaper publishers: allies or enemies?|work=Editorsweblog.org|publisher=World Editors Forum|access-date=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Drudge Report]], [[Huffington Post]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1886214,00.html|title=Arianna Huffington: The Web's New Oracle|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|access-date=30 March 2009|quote=The Huffington Post was to have three basic functions: blog, news aggregator with an attitude and place for premoderated comments.| date=19 March 2009| first=Belinda| last=Luscombe|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Fark]], [[Zero Hedge]], [[Newslookup]], [[Newsvine]], [[World News (WN) Network]] and [[Daily Beast]] where aggregation is entirely automatic, using algorithms which carry out contextual analysis and group similar stories together, while other sites supplement automatically-aggregated news headline RSS feeds from a number of reputable mainstream and alternative news outlets, while including their own articles in a separate section of the website. Some [https://www.vable.com/ news aggregators] offer subscription services to professionals. 

News aggregation websites began with content selected and entered by humans, while automated selection algorithms were eventually developed to fill the content from a range of either automatically selected or manually added sources. Google News launched in 2002 using automated story selection, but humans could add sources to its search engine, while the older [[Yahoo News]], as of 2005, used a combination of automated news crawlers and human editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hansell | first=Saul | date=24 September 2002 | title=All the news Google algorithms say is fit to print | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/technology/24GOOG.html | access-date=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Brad|title=Google Search &amp; Rescue For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rawOLc1l8K8C&amp;pg=PA85|date=24 October 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-75811-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pamela&gt;{{cite news|last=LiCalzi O'Connell|first=Pamela|title=New Economy; Yahoo Charts the Spread of the News by E-Mail, and What It Finds Out Is Itself Becoming News.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/business/new-economy-yahoo-charts-spread-e-mail-what-it-finds-itself-becoming.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-based feed readers===
Web-based feeds readers allow users to find a web feed on the internet and add it to their feed reader. Online feed readers include [[Bloglines]], [[Feedly]], [[Inoreader]], [[Facebook News Feed]], [[Flipboard]], [[Digg]], [[News360]], [[My Yahoo!]], [[NewsBlur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/30/yc-backed-newsblur-takes-feed-reading-back-to-its-basics/|title=YC-Backed NewsBlur Takes Feed Reading Back To Its Basics|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-reader-alternative-newsblur-151541|title=Need A Google Reader Alternative? Meet Newsblur|publisher=[[Search Engine Land]]|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netvibes]] and [[Tiny Tiny RSS]].  These are meant for personal use and are hosted on remote servers. Because the application is available via the web, it can be accessed anywhere by a user with an [[internet]] connection. There are even more specified web-based RSS readers. For instance, a news aggregator created for scientists: "Michael Imbeault, an HIV researcher at the Université Laval in Quebec, launched his fully automated site called "e! Science News".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scientists get online news aggregator|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080625/full/4531149b.html|journal = Nature News|date = 2008-06-25|pages = 1149–1149|volume = 453|issue = 7199|doi = 10.1038/4531149b|first = Declan|last = Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More advanced methods of aggregating feeds are provided via [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] coding techniques and [[XML]] components called [[web widget]]s. Ranging from full-fledged applications to small fragments of [[source code]] that can be integrated into larger programs, they allow users to aggregate [[OPML]] files, email services, documents, or feeds into one interface. Many customizable homepage and portal implementations provide such functionality.

In addition to aggregator services mainly for individual use, there are web applications that can be used to aggregate several blogs into one. One such variety—called ''planet'' sites—are used by online communities to aggregate community blogs in a centralized location. They are named after the [[Planet aggregator]], a server application designed for this purpose.

===Feed reader applications===
{{main|Comparison of feed aggregators}}
Feed aggregation applications are installed on a PC, smartphone or tablet computer and designed to collect news and interest feed subscriptions and group them together using a user-friendly interface. The graphical user interface of such applications often closely resembles that of popular [[e-mail client]]s, using a three-panel composition in which subscriptions are grouped in a frame on the left, and individual entries are browsed, selected, and read in frames on the right. Some notable examples include [[NetNewsWire]], [[Flipboard]], [[Prismatic (app)|Prismatic]], and [[Zite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | date=22 May 2013 | first=Tom | last=Cheredar | url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/22/zite-holds-wake-for-google-reader/ | title=Zite’s new iOS app update welcomes (but doesn’t cater to) mournful Google Reader users | work=VentureBeat | access-date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3007003/tech-forecast/google-reader-dead-digg-zite-are-among-these-alternatives-updated | work=Fast Company | date=14 March 2013 | first=Addy | last=Dugdale | title=Google Reader is dead, but Digg, Zite are among these alternatives | access-date=24 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software aggregators can also take the form of [[news ticker]]s which scroll feeds like [[ticker tape]], alerters that display updates in windows as they are refreshed, web browser macro tools or as smaller components (sometimes called [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] or [[Software extension|extension]]s), which can integrate feeds into the [[operating system]] or software applications such as a web browser. Clients applications include [[Mozilla Thunderbird]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Subscribe to News Feeds and Blogs |website=Mozilla support for Thunderbird |url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-subscribe-news-feeds-and-blogs }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Microsoft Office Outlook]], [[iTunes]], [[FeedDemon]] and many others.

=== Social news aggregators ===
One of the examples of social news aggregators is [[Digg|Digg.com]]. The website collects the most popular stories on the Internet, selected and edited and proposed by a wide range of people. "In these social news aggregators, users submit news items (referred to as "stories"), communicate with peers through direct messages and comments, and collaboratively select and rate submitted stories to get to a real-time compilation of what is currently perceived as "hot" and popular on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are Friends Overrated? A Study for the Social News Aggregator Digg.com|arxiv = 1304.2974|journal = Computer Communications|issn = 0140-3664|pages = 796–809|volume = 35|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.comcom.2012.02.001|first = Christian|last = Doerr|first2 = Norbert|last2 = Blenn|first3 = Siyu|last3 = Tang|first4 = Piet|last4 = Van Mieghem|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social news aggregators based on engagement of community. Their responses, engagement level, and contribution to stories create the content and determine what will be generated as RSS feed. Some examples of social news aggregators: [[Reddit|Reddit.com]], ForensicFocus, [[Hacker News]] etc. More about social news aggregators: [[Social network aggregation|Social Network Aggregation]]

=== Personalized news aggregators ===
Personalized news aggregators like NewsPrompt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/newsprompt-breaking-news/gcajgpbafhkbkdpbaaipjoiajnangjhp|title=Newsprompt: Breaking News in New Tab|website=chrome.google.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CityFalcon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityfalcon.com|title=CityFALCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; collect user browsing history and recommend articles that users could be interested in based on their profiles. Browser extensions provide the best platform for personalized news aggregators as extensions can capture the entire browsing history of their users as opposed to links that they have seen on an individual site or application. Other news aggregators like [[Google News]] or [[Flipboard]] try to provide some level of personalization in this way.

=== Frame- and media bias-aware news aggregators ===
[[Media bias]] and [[Framing (social sciences)]] are concepts that fundamentally explain deliberate or accidental differences in news coverage. A simple example is coverage of media in two countries, which are in (armed) conflict with another: one can easily imagine that news outlets, particularly if state-controlled, will report differently or even contrarily on the same events (see for instance [[Ukrainian crisis]]). While media bias and framing have been subject to manual research for a couple of decades in the social sciences, only recently automated methods and systems have been proposed to analyze and show such differences. Such systems make use of text-features, e.g., NewsCube is a news aggregator that extracts key phrases that describe a topic differently, or other features, e.g., matrix-based news aggregation spans a matrix over two dimensions, such as in which articles have been published (first dimension) and on which country they are reporting (second dimension).&lt;ref name="Hamborg2017b"&gt;Felix Hamborg, Norman Meuschke, and Bela Gipp, [http://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/hamborg2017b.pdf Matrix-based News Aggregation: Exploring Different News Perspectives] in Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamborg2018b"&gt;Felix Hamborg, Norman Meuschke and Bela Gipp, [http://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/hamborg2018b.pdf Bias-aware News Analysis using Matrix-based News Aggregation] in the International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL), 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media aggregators==
Media aggregators are sometimes referred to as ''podcatchers'' due to the popularity of the term ''[[podcast]]'' used to refer to a web feed containing audio or video. Media aggregators are client software or web-based applications which maintain subscriptions to feeds that contain audio or video [[RSS enclosures|media enclosures]]. They can be used to automatically download media, playback the media within the application interface, or synchronize media content with a portable media player. Multimedia aggregators are the current focus. EU launched the project Reveal This to embedded different media platforms in RSS system. "Integrated infrastructure that will allow the user to capture, store, semantically index, categorize and retrieve multimedia, and multilingual digital content across different sources – TV, radio, music, web, etc. The system will allow the user to personalize the service and will have semantic search, retrieval, summarization."&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 100–115"/&gt;

==Broadcatching==
"Broadcatching is a promising mechanism to improve the experience of BitTorrent users by automatically downloading files advertised through RSS feeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental Study of Broadcatching in BitTorrent|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4784862|journal = 6th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009. CCNC 2009|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 1–5|doi = 10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784862|first = Zengbin|last = Zhang|first2 = Yuan|last2 = Lin|first3 = Yang|last3 = Chen|first4 = Yongqiang|last4 = Xiong|first5 = Jacky|last5 = Shen|first6 = Hongqiang|last6 = Liu|first7 = Beixing|last7 = Deng|first8 = Xing|last8 = Li|isbn = 978-1-4244-2308-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] [[List of BitTorrent clients|client software applications]] such as Azureus, μTorrent have added the ability to ''[[broadcatching|broadcatch]]'' torrents of distributed multimedia through the aggregation of web feeds. Broadcatching is the ervise for smart TV era. "Broadcatching is the act of downloading TV to be viewed on your computer." Files downloaded from BitTorrent have to be read by special screening tool DiVX.

==Feed filtering==
One of the problems with news aggregators is that the volume of articles can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when the user has many web feed subscriptions. As a solution, many feed readers allow users to [[tag (metadata)|tag]] each feed with one or more keywords which can be used to sort and filter the available articles into easily navigable categories. Another option is to import the user's [[Attention Profiling Mark-up Language|Attention Profile]] to filter items based on their relevance to the user's interests.

Some bloggers predicted the death of RSS when Google Reader was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/google-reader-shutting-down-date/26641/|title=R.I.P. RSS?

"Feedly, likely the most popular RSS reader today, has gone from around 5,000 paid subscribers in 2013 to around 50,000 paid subscribers in early 2015 – that’s a 900% increase for Feedly in two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is RSS Dead?

'''''Oniritti Höhlenbilder''''' ("oniritti cave pictures") is a 2016 book by the German writer [[Botho Strauß]]. It consists of fragmentary scenes and dreamlike imagery, with a focus on problems related to a lack of privacy and imagination in the [[Information Age|digital age]]. "Oniritti" is a combination of the Greek word "oneiros", meaning "dream", and "[[graffiti]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.hanser.de/hanser/docs/20161017_21611791722-105_978-3-446-25402-2-Leseprobe.pdf|title=Leseprobe aus: Botho Strauß: Oniritti Höhlenbilder|language=German|publisher=[[Carl Hanser Verlag]]|accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Björn Hayer of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote: "the cultural critic Strauß, known, in addition to his literary prose, for his social-accusatory essays such as "Anschwellender Bocksgesang" (1993) or "Das letzte Jahrhundert des Menschen. Was aber kommen wird, ist Netzwerk. Bemerkungen zu Sein und Zeit" (1999), spares no scorn and mockery on the virtual age." Hayer called Strauß "the grand seigneur of German literature", and described ''Oniritti Höhlenbilder'' as "a thoughtful ride—with a remainingly youthful joy of images—through the perception channels of our [[late modernity]]. Or in other words: a delight to read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hayer|first=Björn|date=2016-10-12|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/oniritti-hoehlenbilder-von-botho-strauss-rezension-a-1116125.html|title=''Oniritti Höhlenbilder'' von Botho Strauß: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Fantasie|language=German|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=2016-11-04|quote=der Kulturkritiker Strauß, neben seiner literarischen Prosa bekannt für seine gesellschaftsanklagenden Essays wie "Anschwellender Bocksgesang" (1993) oder "Das letzte Jahrhundert des Menschen. Was aber kommen wird, ist Netzwerk. Bemerkungen zu Sein und Zeit" (1999), spart nicht mit Hohn und Spott auf das virtuelle Zeitalter. ... ''Oniritti Höhlenbilder'' des Grandseigneurs der deutschen Literatur ist ein mit junggebliebener Bilderfreude ersonnener Ritt durch die Wahrnehmungskanäle unserer Spätmoderne. Oder anders gesagt: eine Verzückung zum Lesen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer Schaper reviewed the book for [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]], and wrote: "In dreams, dialogues, genre scenes and aphorisms he formulates objections, which sometimes are convincing, sometimes less. Successful are the scenes in which already the presentation is criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Schaper|first=Rainer|date=2016-11-04|url=http://www.srf.ch/kultur/literatur/mit-botho-strauss-gegen-das-digitale-antraeumen|title=Mit Botho Strauss gegen das Digitale anträumen|language=German|publisher=[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]]|accessdate=2016-11-04|quote=In Träumen, Dialogen, Genreszenen und Aphorismen formuliert er Einwände, die mal überzeugen, mal weniger.

'''Operation Elkayam''' ({{lang-he|מבצע אלקיים}}) also known as the '''Khan Yunis raid''', was an Israeli military operation that targeted Egyptian military positions in the [[Khan Yunis]] area. The successful operation resulted in the destruction of Egyptian military installations as well as the deaths of seventy-two Egyptian soldiers. There was one Israeli fatality.

==Background==
The [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] resulted in a decisive Israeli victory. However, the Arab nations remained intransigent and were only willing to sign armistice agreements with Israel. Thus, a static situation of “no war, no peace,” emerged. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Arab refugees now camped alongside Israel’s porous borders. The refugees lived in squalor, were kept under martial law and were prevented from gaining citizenship in their respective Arab host countries.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Schiff, History of the Israeli Army, Straight Arrow Books (1974), pp. 220–22&lt;/ref&gt; Arab governments, in particular Egypt, sensing the refugees’ discontent, capitalized on the opportunity to recruit embittered Palestinian Arabs for terrorist actions against Israel. At first, the infiltrations and border transgressions took the form of petty banditry and thievery.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff, pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1954, Egyptian military intelligence was taking an active role in providing various forms of support for Palestinian Arab ([[fedayeen]]) terrorist activity.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff pp. 224–25&lt;/ref&gt; After one such atrocity, Israel decided to take decisive action against Egypt for its sponsorship of terror and initiated [[Operation Black Arrow]]. Despite its success, [[Operation Black Arrow]] did not put a halt to Egyptian sponsorship of [[fedayeen]] terror raids and border transgressions. In late August 1955, attacks by Egyptian sponsored fedayeen near the Israeli towns of [[Rishon LeZion]] and [[Rechovot]] resulted in the deaths of eleven Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Kumaraswamy, The A to Z of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Scarecrow Press (2006), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore decided that an operation, larger in scope and size than anything previously embarked upon, was warranted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==The battle==
On the night of August 31, 1955, paratroops of Israel’s vaunted [[Paratroopers Brigade|890th Battalion]] assembled to attack Egyptian military installations in [[Khan Yunis]]. Among their objectives was a [[Tegart fort]] which housed a company of infantry as well as headquarters personnel. A second objective was the taking of an Egyptian emplacement, code-named Position 132, which dominated the Khan Yunis road and was deemed vital to securing the safe withdrawal of the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Ze’evi Derori, Israel's reprisal policy, 1953-1956: the dynamics of military retaliation, Frank Cass (2005), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The raid was codenamed Operation Elkayam, in tribute to Saadya Elkayam, a company commander who died in the Black Arrow operation.&lt;ref&gt;Derori, 140&lt;/ref&gt; During the late evening, a mechanized force led by commander [[Motta Gur|Mordechai "Motta" Gur]] set out for the fort and surrounding installations while forces led by [[Rafael Eitan|Rafael "Raful" Eitan]] secured Position 132. Another force set up an ambush site in case the Egyptians decided to send a relief column. By 22:45 hours, the fort and surrounding emplacements had been secured. Position 132 had been abandoned by the Egyptians and the Israelis destroyed the Egyptian emplacements there. Explosive charges were set and the Tergart fort along with other nearby Egyptian emplacements were dynamited and reduced to rubble. The Egyptians suffered seventy-two killed.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Kumaraswamy, 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derori, 142&lt;/ref&gt; There was one Israeli fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Derori, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Operation Elkayam was the first time that the Israelis employed mounted armor in their reprisal raids. The raid itself was a resounding success clearly reflected by the lopsided casualty count in Israel’s favor. The operation prompted the Egyptians to reassess their sponsorship of fedayeen terrorism and led to a U.N. mediated ceasefire on September 4.&lt;ref&gt;Derori, 142&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Nasser]] halted fedayeen infiltration from the Egyptian border resulting in a temporary lull in fedayeen attacks.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Kumaraswamy, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, other Egyptian provocations, including the blockade of the [[Gulf of Eilat]] and a major arms deal with a Soviet client state, were factors that led to Israel’s [[Operation Kadesh]] and the decisive defeat of the Egyptian army in the Sinai Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff p 63-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Outstation movement''' refers to the relocation of [[Indigenous Australians]] from towns to remote outposts on traditional tribal land.

As described in the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/rciadic/national/vol3/1.html Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a range of problems faced Aboriginal people living in towns.

During the 1970s and 1980s several groups moved from towns, missions and government settlements to smaller settlements on their traditional lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/no-movement-on-the-outstations-20090525-bkq5.html|title=No movement on the outstations|last=Altman|first=Jon|date=2009-05-26|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some outpost communities include:

== Name ==
Previously the series was called '''''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century''''' ('''SVEC'''). In 2013, the name was changed to reflect the publication's global and interdisciplinary scope, which includes the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the long Eighteenth Century and growing scholarly move to see the Enlightenment as a movement with worldwide impact and implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dow|first1=Gillian|title=Translation, Cross-Channel Exchanges and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century|journal=Literature Compass|date=November 2014|volume=11|issue=11|pages=691–702|doi=10.1111/lic3.12183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voltairefoundation.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/oxford-university-studies-in-the-enlightenment-whats-in-a-name/ |title=Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment – what’s in a name? |publisher=Voltaire Foundation  |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is published by the [[Voltaire Foundation]], an academic department in the Division of Humanities of the University of Oxford. Volumes prior to 1970 were published by the [[Institut et Musée Voltaire]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=worldcat /&gt;. In September 2017, the Voltaire Foundation announced a partnership with [[Liverpool University Press]], which will take on responsibility for printing, warehousing, marketing and distribution of the series in 2018.

== Topics ==
The series publishes one book per month. Topics include history, literature and comparative studies, cultural studies, philosophy, the history of the book, theatre, arts and visual studies, and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://163.1.91.91/_svec_index/soi_IdxPage.lasso|title=SVEC Online Index|website=163.1.91.91|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of its books have won awards, such as the Society for the History of Natural History's [[Society for the History of Natural History#Medals and prizes|Thackray Medal]] for ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau and botany: the salutary science'' (Alexandra Cook),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shnh.org.uk/awards-honours-medals/john-thackray-medal/|title=The John Thackray Medal - Society for the History of Natural History|website=Society for the History of Natural History|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/people/collaborators.shtml |title=Australian and international collaborators|publisher=The University of Sydney|work=Sydney.edu.au |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Prix Marianne Roland Michel for ''The Profession of sculpture in the Paris 'Académie''' (Tomas Macsotay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariannerolandmichel.fr/prix.html#livres |title=Le Prix Marianne Roland Michel |work=Mariannerolandmichel.fr | publisher=Fondation Marianne &amp; Roland Michel|date= |accessdate=2014-04-27|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannáin''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1627–1636), also styled '''Peregrine O'Duignan''', was an Irish historian and chronicler.

Born Cú Coigriche mac Tuathal Ó Duibhgeannáin, about or after 1590, his name was Latinized to Pereginus (anglicized Peregrine) when he took holy orders in the Franciscan Order based at [[Leuven]], now in [[Belgium]]. Cú Coigriche (also Cuchogry) means ''"hound [or hero] of the neighbouring [or foreign] land."'' His family, the [[Clan Ó Duibhgeannáin|Clan Uí Dhuibhgeannáin]], were professional historians from [[Annaly]], many of whom had crossed the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] and practised their art in [[Connacht]]. Here the Ó Duibhgeannains set up a bardic college at Kilronan, near [[Lough Key]] in northern [[County Roscommon]].

Nothing is known of his life and activities until he began working with [[Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh]] and Fearfeasa Ó Maoilchonaire under the direction of Brother [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] about 1627. In that year Ó Cléirigh was sent from his mother house at Leuven to Ireland to collect Irish literary, historical and chronological material in danger of being lost. These materials were assembled into a number of compilations, the most famous being the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Nothing is known of Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannáin's life after 1636, the year the annals was completed. It is entirely likely that he returned to Leuven with Brother Mícheál. A slight possibility exists that he remained in Ireland, as a copy of the annals was being used in the town of [[Galway]] by [[Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh]] in the late 1640s. It may not be coincidental that a kinsman of Ó Duibhgeannáin, [[Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin]] was living and working in [[Connemara]] at least as early as 1651. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Scientific [[essentialism]]''', a view espoused by [[Saul Kripke]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanna | first1 = R. | title = A Kantian Critique of Scientific Essentialism | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 497–528 | doi = 10.2307/2653754 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that there exist essential properties that objects possess (or instantiate) necessarily. In other words, having such and such essential properties is a necessary condition for membership in a given natural kind. For example, tigers are tigers in virtue of possessing a particular set of genetic properties, but identifying (or appearance-based) properties are nonessential properties. If a tiger lost a leg, or didn't possess stripes, we would still call it a tiger. They are not necessary for being a member of the class of tigers.

It is important, however, that the set of essential properties of an object not be used to identify or be identified with that object because they are not ''necessary and sufficient'', but only necessary. Having such and such a genetic code does not suffice for being a tiger. We wouldn't call a piece of tiger tail a tiger, even though a piece of tiger tail contains the genetic information essential to being a tiger.

The '''Second Great Rectification Movement''' refers to a 1992 ideological campaign initiated by the leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) wherein an effort was made to "identify, repudiate and rectify the errors of [[Urban area|urban]] [[Rebellion|insurrectionism]], premature big [[Military organization#formations|formations]] of the [[New People's Army]] and anti-[[Double agent|infiltration]] hysteria".&lt;ref name=luis&gt;{{cite web | last =Jalandoni | first =Luis G. | title = The Revolutionary Struggle of the Filipino People | url=https://josemariasison.org/the-revolutionary-struggle-of-the-filipino-people/ | date = 8 February 2016 | accessdate = 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectification movement resulted in the once monolithic [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[communist party]] fragmenting into at least eight warring factions during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=pabs&gt;{{cite news | last =Pabico | first =Alecks P. | title =The Great Left Divide | publisher = [[GMA News]] | date = 31 August 2007 | url =http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/58588/pcij-flashback-the-great-left-divide/story/ | accessdate = 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Luis Jalandoni, formerly a negotiator for the [[National Democratic Front of the Philippines]], has stated that from 1985 until 1991, a renegade group within the party leadership of the CPP was responsible for major errors that caused serious losses in the revolution's mass base.&lt;ref name=luis/&gt; These errors included the implementation of a program to root out infiltrators called ''Kampanyang Ahos'' ("Kahos")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Escandor | first =Juan Jr. | title =NDF's Jalandoni Speaks on 'Kampanyang Ahos' | url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/2-14/2-14-ahos.html | date = 12 May 2002 | accessdate = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the adoption of an erroneous political line brought about by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|modern revisionism]]. The loss in mass base was estimated to be 50%-60% in [[Mindanao]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Arguillas | first =Carolyn O. | title =Q and A with Jorge Madlos: "We were wrong in our political line" | publisher =MindaNews | date = 8 January 2011 | url =http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2011/01/q-and-a-with-jorge-madlos-%E2%80%9Cwe-were-wrong-in-our-political-line%E2%80%9D/ | accessdate = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Second Great Rectification Movement" was meant to correct these errors.&lt;ref name=luis/&gt;

==Background==
The [[Revolutions of 1989]], punctuated by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the collapse of the [[Eastern bloc|communist states in Eastern Europe]] the following year and the subsequent [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself on December 26, 1991 was the state of world affairs at the time when Armando Liwanag ([[Pseudonym|cadre name]] adopted by [[Jose Maria Sison]], though never admitted by Sison himself)&lt;ref name=abinales&gt;{{cite book | last =Abinales | first =Patricio N. | title =The Revolution Falters: The Left in Philippine Politics After 1986 | publisher =[[Cornell University|Cornell SEAP]] | year =1996 | pages =30 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=iRzntZTyOrsC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Reaffirm+our+Basic+Principles+and+Rectify+Errors#v=onepage&amp;q=Reaffirm%20our%20Basic%20Principles%20and%20Rectify%20Errors&amp;f=false | isbn =978-0-87727-132-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] [[Central Committee]] published a document entitled "Reaffirm our Basic Principles and Rectify Errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author =Liwanag, Armando | title =Reaffirm our Basic Principles and Rectify Errors | publisher =[[Communist Party of the Philippines]] | date =26 December 1991 | url = http://ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/kasarinlan/article/view/302/288 | format =[[Portable Document Format]] | accessdate = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical reference to a similar document that gave rise to the [[First Great Rectification Movement]] was recognizable, implying that the party needed evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and make decisions regarding its future. The tone set suggested that the party's situation was critical, so much so that "extraordinary measures were required to rectify it".&lt;ref name=abinales/&gt; 

===Reaffirmation of basic principles===
Liwanag states that the party needed to reaffirm the basic principles laid down in its 1968 congress; these included, among others:
*repudiation of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|modern revisionism]],
*adherence to theory of [[Marxism-Leninism]],
*the view that Philippine society is semi-[[Feudalism|feudal]] and semi-[[Colonialism|colonial]],
*pursuing the general line of [[New Democracy|New Democratic revolution]],
*the leading role of the working class through the Party,
*the theory of [[People's war]] and encircling cities from the countryside,
*[[democratic centralism]], [[socialism]] and [[proletarian internationalism]]

===Rectification of errors===
Liwanag then states that the wrong directions taken by various elements in the revolutionary movement were due to modern revisionism at that time; "adulating [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on a simplistic notion of [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinism]]" was mentioned. On the whole, the document identified trends in thinking that led to certain "errors", so that those who were responsible for those errors would be pressured into admitting their mistakes; anyone who had been in error but refused to admit it were either to leave or be thrown out.&lt;ref name=abinales/&gt;

==Consequences==
"Reaffirm our Basic Principles and Rectify Errors" was dated December 26, 1991, to coincide with the CPP's 23rd founding anniversary, but was not approved as official party policy by the [[Central Committee]] until approximately six months later, when the committee met in its 10th Plenum in mid-1992.&lt;ref name="Gershman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gershman|first1=John|title=Debates on the Philippine Left|url=https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2963|website=SOLIDARITY|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the document sparked the "Second Great Rectification Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | title = Communist Party of the Philippines–New People's Army | url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149 | accessdate = 7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused a divide among the communist party; those who agreed with the views expressed in "Reaffirm our Basic Principles and Rectify Errors", thereafter referred to as "reaffirmists", and those who disagreed with these views, who were labelled "rejectionists". The "rejectionists" were then considered "[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]".&lt;ref name=pabs/&gt;

===Split===
Among those labelled "counter-revolutionaries" by Sison were Romulo Kintanar, former chief of the [[New People's Army]], Arturo Tabara, a former head of the Visayas Commission, [[Filemon Lagman]], who would later form the [[Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino]] (Solidarity of Filipino Workers), Ricardo Reyes, former editor of [[Ang Bayan]], the news organ of the CPP and highly-placed in the Mindanao Commission, and Benjamin de Vera, a former member of the Central Committee. "Rejectionist" regional party committees included those of Metro Manila-Rizal, Central Mindanao, Western Mindanao, the Visayas Commission (VisCom), National United Front Commission (NUFC), Home Bureau of the International Liaison Department and the National Peasant Secretariat (NPS).

Notable among the "rejectionist" bloc was the [[Revolutionary Workers' Party (Philippines)|Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawà ng Pilipinas]] formally established in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =RPM-P: Brief profile | url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/198.html | accessdate = 8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its armed wing is known as the [[Revolutionary Proletarian Army]] - [[Alex Boncayao Brigade]].

===Assassinations===
Romulo Kintanar was charged before a "People's Court" in 1993 for various crimes including illegal [[abuse of authority]], criminal activities such as [[kidnapping]] for [[ransom]], stashing away Party funds and instigating Tabara and Lagman to go against the policies of the revolutionary movement. Ricardo Reyes was accused of culpability for "Kampanyang Ahos" by Jose Maria Sison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sison | first =Jose Maria | title =Ricardo Reyes is criminally culpable for Kampanyang Ahos  | url=https://www.ndfp.org/ricardo-reyes-is-criminally-culpable-for-kampanyang-ahos/ | date=29 January 2005 | accessdate = 8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kintanar, Reyes, Filemon Lagman and Arturo Tabara were reportedly handed [[Capital punishment|death sentences]] by their former comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lane | first =Max | title =Assassination threat to Filipino left | publisher =[[Green Left Weekly]] | date = 27 April 1994 | url =https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/assassination-threat-filipino-left | accessdate = 7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bueltmann argues that amid the uproar about migrant populations trying to seek refuge within the UK, it is easy to forget the historic outward migration of Brits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/the-british-diaspora-is-a-story-of-migrants-who-changed-the-world-49840|title=The British diaspora is a story of migrants who changed the world|last=Bueltmann|first=Tanja|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bueltmann is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society ([[FRHistS]]) and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy ([[FHEA]]).

'''William Comyns Beaumont''', also known as '''Comyns Beaumont''', (1873–1956)&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;[http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc101797.html Cambridge Conference Correspondence: ''WILLIAM COMYNS BEAUMONT (1873 - 1956) BRITAIN'S MOST ECCENTRIC AND LEAST KNOWN COSMIC HERETIC''], Benny J Peiser, October 17, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[journalist]], [[author]], and [[lecturer]]. Beaumont was a staff [[writer]] for the ''[[Daily Mail]]''&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; and eventually became editor of the ''[[Bystander (magazine)|Bystander]]'' in 1903&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/node?a=a;reference=CHAR%202%2F580 Churchill College Archives: The Churchill Papers: May 1930 - Jan 1931 correspondence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data055.html#BYSTANDER Galactic Central Publications: Magazine Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; and then ''[[The Graphic]]'' in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744210,00.html Time Magazine: ''Eight Less One''], August 15, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaumont's astronomical speculations were later mirrored by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s works.

==Theories==

In ''Facts and Fallacies'' (1988) published by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', Beaumont's views are summarized:

{{Quote|"In a series of books published between 1946 and 1949, British journalist William Comyns Beaumont astonished the world with the following extraordinary revelations: Jesus of Nazareth had been crucified just outside Edinburgh, Scotland — the site of the ancient city of Jerusalem. Satan was a comet that collided with the earth and caused Noah's Flood. The ancient Egyptians were in fact Irishmen. Hell is to be found in western Scotland. The Greek hero Achilles spent his childhood on the Isle of Skye. Galilee, birthplace of Jesus, was Wales. Ancient Athens was in reality Bath, England... Comyns Beaumont started his radical revision of history with the belief, innocuous enough, that the lost island of Atlantis might be Britain."}}

Beaumont was also a proponent of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]], arguing [[Shakespeare]]'s plays were written by [[Francis Bacon]]. 

He accepted the existence of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] based on British folklore, and argued other mythological creatures were actually real.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yehuda Bauer''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: יהודה באואר; born April 6, 1926) is an Israeli historian and scholar of the [[Holocaust]]. He is a professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Avraham Harman]] Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
As a native citizen of [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], Bauer was fluent at an early age in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[German language|German]], later learning [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. His father had strong [[Zionism|Zionist]] convictions and during the 1930s tried to raise money to get his family to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. On the day Nazi Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, March 15, 1939, the family [[aliyah|migrated to Palestine]], managing to get past Nazi officials on a train which slipped them over the border into Poland, from which they moved, via Romania, to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Dalia Karpel [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/history-professor-yehuda-bauer-netanyahu-doesn-t-know-history.premium-1.504937 'History professor Yehuda Bauer: 'Netanyahu doesn't know history'] at [[Haaretz]] 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauer attended high school in Haifa and at sixteen, inspired by his history teacher, Rachel Krulik, decided to dedicate himself to studying history. Upon completing high school, he joined the [[Palmach]]. He attended [[Cardiff University]] in [[Wales]] on a British scholarship, interrupting his studies to fight in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], after which he completed his degree.

Bauer returned to Israel to join [[Kibbutz]] [[Shoval]] and began his graduate work in history at [[Hebrew University]]. He received his doctorate in 1960 for a thesis on the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]]. The following year, he began teaching at the Institute for Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University.

He served on the central committee of [[Mapam]], then the junior partner party of Israel's ruling [[Mapai]] (Israel Labour Party), and was a visiting professor at [[Brandeis University]], [[Yale University]], [[Richard Stockton College]], and [[Clark University]]. He was the founding editor of the journal ''[[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]]'', and served on the editorial board of the ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Holocaust]]'', published by [[Yad Vashem]] in 1990.

==Awards and honours==
[[File:International Dimensions of Holocaust Education - Yehuda Bauer, Hebrew University.webm|thumb|International Dimensions of Holocaust Education, UNESCO 31 January 2012.]]
In recent years, Bauer has received recognition for his work in the field of Holocaust studies and the prevention of [[genocide]].

==Views==

===Holocaust===
Bauer is a respected authority on the subjects of the Holocaust, [[antisemitism]]—a word he insists be written [[Hyphen|unhyphenated]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanities.ucsc.edu/JewishStudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |accessdate=2003-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705131522/http://humanities.ucsc.edu/JewishStudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2003 |df= }}. Lecture by Yehuda Bauer, 2003. Jewish Studies at [[UC Santa Cruz]]&lt;/ref&gt;—and the Jewish [[resistance movement]] during the Holocaust, and has argued for a wider definition of the term. In Bauer's view, resistance to the Nazis comprised not only physical opposition, but any activity that gave the Jewish people dignity and humanity in the most humiliating and inhumane conditions. Furthermore, Bauer has disputed the popular view that most Jews went to their deaths passively—''"like sheep to the slaughter''."&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. Interview with Amos Goldberg. 18 January 1998. 22 July 2007 [http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203667.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that, given the conditions in which the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] had to live under and endure, what is surprising is not how little resistance there was, but rather how much.

Bauer is also known for defending [[Rudolf Kastner]] and the [[Aid and Rescue Committee]], who have been criticized for allegedly not publicizing the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]] to the Hungarian Jews being deported to [[Auschwitz]]. According to Bauer, conditions prevented Kastner and other Jewish leaders from publicizing what they knew, and Jews from escaping.&lt;ref name=Bauer72&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. ''Jews for Sale? Nazi–Jewish Negotiations 1933–1945''. Yale University Press, 1994, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vbra406&gt;Vrba, Rudolf. ''I Escaped from Auschwitz'', Barricade Books, 2002, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The initiation of the Holocaust====
With regard to the [[functionalism versus intentionalism]] question, Bauer started out as an Intentionalist, but is now the leading proponent of a synthesis of the two schools. Bauer argues that on the basis of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s memorandum of May 25, 1940 to [[Adolf Hitler]] regarding the "[[Final Solution of the Jewish Question]]"—in which Himmler states his rejection of "the Bolshevik method of physical annihilation of a people out of inner conviction as un-German and impossible," and goes on to recommend the [[Madagascar Plan]] as the desired "territorial solution" of the "Jewish Question"—proves that there was no master plan for [[genocide]] going back to the days when Hitler wrote ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. However, Bauer takes issue with Functionalist historians, such as [[Hans Mommsen]], who argue that the lead in the Holocaust was taken entirely by lower level officials with little involvement by the leadership in [[Berlin]].

Bauer believes that Hitler was the key figure in causing [[the Holocaust]], and that at some point in the later half of 1941, he gave a series of orders for the genocide of the entire Jewish people. Bauer has pointed to the discovery of an entry in Himmler's notebook from December 18, 1941 where Himmler wrote down the question "What to do with the Jews of Russia?". According to the same notebook, Hitler's response to the question was "Exterminate them as partisans."&lt;ref name="Bauer, Yehuda 2000, page 5"&gt;Bauer, Yehuda ''Rethinking the Holocaust'' Yale University Press, 2000, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Bauer's view, this is as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Bauer, Yehuda 2000, page 5"/&gt; Bauer believes that, at about the same time, Hitler gave further verbal orders for the Holocaust, but that unfortunately for historians, nobody bothered to write them down. What the Nazis called the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question" was formalized at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942.

====The Holocaust was not just another genocide====
Bauer has often criticized what he considers to be deleterious trends in writing about the Holocaust. He has often taken exception to those who argue that the Holocaust was just another genocide. Though he agrees that there have been other genocides in history that have targeted groups other than Jews, he argues that the Holocaust was the worst single case of genocide in history, in which every member of a nation was selected for annihilation, and that it therefore holds a special place in human history. These views have caused clashes between Bauer and the American historian [[Henry Friedlander]] who argues that [[Romani people|Romani]] and the disabled were just as much victims of the Holocaust as Jews were.  However, Bauer has said that the Romani were subject to genocide (just not "the Holocaust") and has supported the demands of Romani for reparations from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203856.pdf, pp.45-46, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Holocaust as a mystical experience====
Another trend Bauer has denounced is the representation of the Holocaust as a mystical experience outside the normal range of human understanding. He has argued against the work of some [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and theologians who say that the Holocaust was the work of God and part of a mysterious master plan for the Jewish people. In Bauer's view, those who seek to promote this line of thinking argue that God is just and good, while simultaneously bringing down the Holocaust on the Jewish people. Bauer has argued that a God who inflicts the [[Shoah]] on his Chosen People is neither good nor just. Moreover, Bauer has argued that this line of reasoning robs [[Adolf Hitler]] of his [[evil]]: if Hitler was just fulfilling God's will regarding the Jews, then he was merely an instrument of divine wrath and did not choose to be evil. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====Criticizing Goldhagen's "eliminationist" antisemitism====
Bauer has criticized the work of the American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]], who writes that the Holocaust was the result of the allegedly unique "eliminationist" antisemitic culture of the Germans. He has accused Goldhagen of Germanophobic racism, and of selecting only evidence favorable to his thesis. For example, Bauer has written that, according to the 1931 German census, about 50,000 German Jews were living in [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]] with Christians, giving Germany one of the highest rates of mixed marriages in the world at the time. In Bauer's opinion, if the average German had been full of murderous "eliminationist" antisemitism, as Goldhagen argues, there would have been fewer mixed marriages. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Goldhagen in his turn has accused Bauer of not understanding his arguments properly and of being jealous of what Goldhagen considers to be his discovery of the "key" that explains the entire Holocaust. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Conquest of Canaan===
In reference to the conquest of [[Canaan]] by the ancient [[Israelites]], which resulted in the massacre of the [[Amalekites]] and [[Midianites]], genocide historian Adam Jones has quoted Bauer: "As a Jew, I must live with the fact that the civilization I inherited ... encompasses the call for genocide in its canon."&lt;ref name=Jones-4.6&gt;Adam Jones [[#References|References]] p. 4, note 6, citing Bauer, ''Rethinking the Holocaust'', (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purim===
Professor Bauer was a featured speaker at the 2013 Global Forum to Combat Antisemitism, now a major international event in Jerusalem organized by Israel's Foreign Ministry. He stated that many nations have myths similar to Purim.

===Possibility of genocide in Palestine-Israel===

While speaking to a group of visitors to Israel in 2003, Bauer stated that "What we have here between the Israelis and the Palestinians is an armed conflict - if one side becomes stronger there is a chance of genocide." When one of the visitors asked, "Am I to understand that you think Israel could commit genocide on the Palestinian people?," Bauer answered "Yes," and added, "Just two days ago, extremist settlers passed out flyers to rid Arabs from this land. Ethnic cleansing results in mass killing." Bauer also noted opinion polls showing a high percentage of Palestinians want to get rid of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=266805 Halpern, Orly, "Bauer: It could happen here," Haaretz, 26 February 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Could any Jews have been rescued by America?===
In January 2012, Bauer's article in the ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'' entitled "The Holocaust, America and American Jewry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelcfr.com/documents/6-1/6-1-6-Bauer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325191332/http://israelcfr.com/documents/6-1/6-1-6-Bauer.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; precipitated a bitter debate between himself, Rafael Medoff (Wyman Institute) and Alexander J. Groth (University of California, Davis), on what the US Government and the Jews of America could and could not have done to rescue the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/the-makings-of-history/maybe-roosevelt-couldn-t-have-saved-the-jews-from-the-nazis-after-all.premium-1.473978 Maybe Roosevelt couldn't have saved the Jews from the Nazis, Haaretz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelcfr.com/documents/7-3/7-3-7-YehudaBauer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825162208/http://www.israelcfr.com/documents/7-3/7-3-7-YehudaBauer.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-25 |df= }}. Holocaust Rescue Revisited, ''Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs''  VII:3, 127-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Bauer stated at Yad Vashem that [[Hillel Kook]] ([[Peter Bergson]]), founder and director of the New York based [[Emergency Committee for the Rescue of European Jewry]] (a.k.a. [[Bergson Group]]), did not save anyone.

===Christian-Jewish relations===
Concerning [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s pilgrimage to Israel and Jordan, Bauer argued that the Pope meant well and tried to walk the tightrope between Arab-Palestinian-Muslim and Palestinian-Christian enmity to Israel and the Jews on the one hand, and the [[collective trauma]] of Jews in Israel and elsewhere regarding the Holocaust on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212366393&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull The Pope meant well]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
