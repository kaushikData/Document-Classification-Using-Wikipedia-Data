'''Saint Abdecalas''' (or '''Abdelas''') was a [[Persia]]n priest of advanced age who, together with another priest, [[Ananias (Persian)|Saint Ananias]], and about a hundred other Christians, was killed under the Persian ruler [[Shapur II]] on [[Good Friday]], 345.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author =((Benedictine Monks of St.Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate, England))|year=1921|chapter=Saint Abdecelas |chapter-url=http://saints.sqpn.com/book-of-saints-saint-abdecalas/|title=The Book of Saints: A dictionary of servants of God canonized by the Catholic church: extracted from the Roman &amp; other martyrologies |location=|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|oclc=2111254}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these others was also named Abdecalas.

[[Shemon Bar Sabbae|St. Simeon]], bishop of Seleucia, had been arrested by order of [[Shapur II|Sapor]], king of Persia. He refused to adore the sun and was thrown in a narrow prison and remained there for a long time together with other 100 Christians, such as bishops, priests and clerks. The following day, which was a Good Friday, all his companions were strangled in his presence and he was beheaded. Abdecalas and Ananias, his priests, were martyred with him. They were the persons of distinguished merits.

The Greek historian [[Sozomen]] estimates the number of Christians [[martyred]] during the forty-year reign of Shapur as close to 16,000. The feast day for Saint Abdecalas is 21 April.

'''Absurd''' is a  German [[black metal]] band,&lt;ref&gt;Thilo Thielke: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-17376256.html?name=T%26ouml%3Bten+f%26uuml%3Br+Wotan Töten für Wotan]''. In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', no. 38, 2000, 18 September 2000, p 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been classified as a "right-wing extremist" group by the [[Thuringia]]n [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|Landesbehörde für Verfassungsschutz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Verfassungsschutzbericht des Freistaats Thüringen - 1999'' ([http://www.verfassungsschutz.thueringen.de/vsberichte/1999/vsbericht1999.pdf PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093726/http://www.verfassungsschutz.thueringen.de/vsberichte/1999/vsbericht1999.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}) Punkt 4.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The band was founded in [[Sondershausen]] by Hendrik Möbus (also known as - on the circuit and later on official [[Compact Cassette]] and later [[CD]] liner notes - as Randall Flagg / Jarl Flagg Nidhögg / JFN) and Sebastian Schauseil in 1992, with a third member, Andreas Kirchner, joining at a later stage.

Their lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik Möbus is the founder of the [[Deutsche Heidnische Front]]), pro-heathen [[Germanic Neopaganism|revivalist Germanic]], and anti-[[Judeo-Christian]] themes.

The band achieved infamy because its original members (now no longer in the band since 1999) murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], Didrik Søderlind: ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]]''. [[Feral House]] 1998, p. 256f.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members Möbus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner, in a now infamous quotation, was reported as saying: “Oh shit—now I’ve completely ruined my life.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground''. Feral House 1998, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Schauseil claimed to have heard a voice in his head saying ''“Kuster Maier”'', which made no sense but was interpreted by him as ''“töte Beyer”'' (‘kill Beyer’).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground''. Feral House 1998, p. 247f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hendrik Möbus ==
In prison, Möbus (b. January 20, 1976&lt;ref name="diplomar"&gt;{{Citation|author=Robert Nowotny|title=Satanismus – Gefahr für die Innere Sicherheit ?|publisher=Fachhochschule Villingen-Schwenningen|location=Villingen-Schwenningen|year=2001|page=18|url=http://www.aufklaerungsgruppe-krokodil.de/Diplomar.pdf|accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was able to carry on with the band under the temporary name "In Ketten" (German for "In Chains").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} After the murder, this became a cult band with [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} A live album was recorded in prison and had since been released on vinyl. The tape ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'' shows on its cover the grave of the murdered Sandro Beyer, and inside says: "The cover shows the grave of Sandro B. murdered by horde ABSURD on 29.04.93 AB".&lt;ref&gt;Absurd: ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', Capricornus Prod. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band members were released on parole in 1998, because they had been under eighteen when they had committed their crime. Shortly after release, Möbus violated the terms of his parole when at a concert he performed the [[Hitler salute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAQdQ0Juml0|title=Absurd-Bericht Spiegel tv|first=|last=Fick Dich|date=16 April 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is illegal in Germany. Hendrik and his brother Ronald "Wolf" Möbus also posed together in a series of photographs at [[Auschwitz]] death camp, holding up nazi banners inside a gas chamber and outside barracks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-17376256.html&lt;/ref&gt; His parole was consequently revoked. He managed to flee to the United States, where he met [[William Luther Pierce]], but was captured there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natvan.com/free-speech/fs0010a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808001524/http://www.natvan.com/free-speech/fs0010a.html |archivedate=8 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in America he also got in a conflict about money with some of his contacts who he stayed with for some time, one of them being the then neo-Nazi pagan occultist Nathan Pett, who later left the far right scene, and was apparently beaten with a hammer and threatened with a pistol by two persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2001/summer/neo-nazis|title=German Extremist Loses Bid for U.S. Asylum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first this was just a rumour but Möbus later admitted in an interview for a neonazi site that the incident had taken place. He was arrested by U.S. marshals. In 2001, after his request for asylum was denied, he was sent back to prison for the remaining three years for murder. For mocking his victim and for the Hitler salute he was sentenced to a further twenty-six months. On 15 May 2003 he was again sentenced to four years in prison.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Möbus is today free and runs his own music label, called Darker Than Black, which distributes NSBM albums and merchandise on an organized scale since 2007. Antifascist Action in Germany has organized at least one demonstration in late 2014 to protest against the racist music shop Möbus owns together with one other person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.demotix.com/news/6155717/anti-fascists-rally-against-shop-neonazi-hendrik-m-bus-berlin |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702223929/http://www.demotix.com/news/6155717/anti-fascists-rally-against-shop-neonazi-hendrik-m-bus-berlin#media-6155622 |archive-date=2 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cars belonging to Möbus were damaged in an arson which the Antifascist Action Germany claimed responsibility for, during a campaign in Berlin where there was also posters with Möbus face and personal information on put up, and graffiti with messages against him and the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blightofplebians.com/jfninterview/|title=Loading...|website=blightofplebians.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linksunten.indymedia.org/de/node/120937 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227010723/https://linksunten.indymedia.org/de/node/120937 |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When released from the last prison sentence Möbus appeared on stage during a neonazi live gig, but did not play anything.

Schauseil is still involved with the underground metal scene; he performed between 1999 and 2004 with the folk-influenced nationalist band [[Halgadom]], the black metal project [[Wolfsmond]] (also featuring bassplayer Unhold, who currently plays drums in Absurd), and the [[neofolk]] band [[In Acht und Bann]]. He has distanced himself from National Socialism and politics in general,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} as evidenced by the current direction of Wolfsmond and as stated in an interview he conducted with ''Vampire Magazine''.

In 2002 Pantheon (USA) released a tribute album to Möbus, called ''Jarl die Freiheit'' (‘Jarl of Freedom’).

== Band history since 1999 ==

The band Absurd has continued in existence since 1999, going through many changes of personnel, and losing all of its original members. The leader is Wolf, Hendrik's brother, with Sebastian Schauseil performing the occasional clean vocal part on releases such as ''Asgardsrei'' (1999), ''Werwolfthron'' (2001), and ''Totenlieder'' (2002).

== Music style ==
The demos and the first album “[[Facta Loquuntur]]” have strong [[Oi!]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) influences.&lt;ref name=loc250f&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground''. Feral House 1998, p. 250f.&lt;/ref&gt; Musical idols were bands like [[Mercyful Fate]]/[[King Diamond]],&lt;ref name=loc250f/&gt; [[Manowar]],&lt;ref name=loc250f/&gt;&lt;ref name="derfünfzehnjährigekrieg"&gt;„Mit den größten und nachhaltigsten Einfluß auf uns, sowohl musikalisch als auch lyrisch, haben nicht etwa skandinavische Black Metal-Bands ausgeübt. Neben Manowar und Danzig war es vielmehr eine deutsche [[Horror punk|Horrorpunk]]-Band, welche zum Zeitpunkt unserer Bandgründung bisher nur zwei Veröffentlichungen in den frühen 1980er-Jahren herausgebracht hatte. Diese Inspiration wirkt bis heute fort.“ Absurd: ''Der fünfzehnjährige Krieg'', W.T.C. Productions/Nebelfee Klangwerke/Darker Than Black Records 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]&lt;ref name=loc250f/&gt;&lt;ref name="derfünfzehnjährigekrieg"/&gt; and especially [[Der Fluch]],&lt;ref name=loc250f/&gt;&lt;ref name="derfünfzehnjährigekrieg"/&gt; a band covered by Absurd on both ''Der fünfzehnjährige Krieg'' and the split release ''Weltenfeind'', whereas the Scandinavian bands were no significant musical or lyrical influence.&lt;ref name=loc250f/&gt;&lt;ref name="derfünfzehnjährigekrieg"/&gt; On the other hand, the band called itself a black metal band from the very beginning; in an interview with the pupil magazine of his school, Hendrik Möbus said Absurd would play the hardest, rawest and most ingenious black metal in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Billerbeck, Liane von; Nordhausen, Frank: ''Satanskinder. Der Mordfall von Sondershausen und die rechte Szene''. 3. revised edition, Berlin 2001, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] and Didrik Søderlind classified the band’s early recordings “more akin to ’60s garage punk than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries”,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground''. Feral House 1998, p. 260f.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, the second demo ''Death from the Forest'' had no similarities to black metal neither of the first nor the second wave, but was rather a mixture of primitive [[hard rock]] and [[punk rock]] elements. Due to its musical dilettantism, the band was not taken seriously by black metallers for a long time.&lt;ref name="unheilig"&gt;Christian Dornbusch, Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Unheilige Allianzen''. ''Black Metal zwischen Satanismus, Heidentum und Neonazismus'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In an ad in ''Sub Line'' magazine, the same demo was praised as “unholy, hard guitar rock, wild and boisterous; for all the dark souls out there” (“unheiliger, harter Gitarrenrock, wild und ungestüm; für all die schwarzen Seelen dort draußen”).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sub Line]]'', no. 3, march 1993, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mansion of Metal'' site classified it as “essentially crappy punk rock/RAC” and claims the “Thuringian Pagan Madness” demo to have black metal influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansionofmetal.com/Reviews/?mode=alpha|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120224719/http://www.mansionofmetal.com/Reviews/?mode=alpha|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 January 2008|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Möbus called the ''[[Asgardsrei]]'' EP the band’s first holistic piece of work, adjusted in concept and layout as well, and the band’s step away from its former musical dilettantism; however,he still described some of it as dilettante, and Ronald Möbus criticised the final mixing.&lt;ref name="sheolmag"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview by Sheol-Mag |url=http://de.geocities.com/damned_child_666/Interviews/absurd.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5klXE64ev?url=http://de.geocities.com/damned_child_666/Interviews/absurd.htm |archivedate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logistic-curve.svg|thumb|Logistic activation function]]

In [[artificial neural network]]s, the '''activation function''' of a node defines the output of that node, or "neuron," given an input or set of inputs. This output is then used as input for the next node and so on until a desired solution to the original problem is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/activation-function|title=What is an Activation Function?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It maps the resulting values into the desired range such as between 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 etc. (depending upon the choice of activation function). For example, the use of the logistic activation function would map all inputs in the real number domain into the range of 0 to 1.

A standard [[Integrated circuit|computer chip circuit]] can be seen as a [[Digital electronics|digital network]] of activation functions that can be "ON" (1) or "OFF" (0), depending on input. This is similar to the behavior of the [[linear perceptron]] in [[neural networks]]. However, only ''nonlinear'' activation functions allow such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://didattica.cs.unicam.it/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=didattica:magistrale:kebi:ay_1718:ke-11_neural_networks.pdf|title=Neural Networks, p. 7|last=Hinkelmann|first=Knut|date=|website=University of Applied Science Northwestern Switzerland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[artificial neural network]]s, this function is also called the [[transfer function]].

== Functions ==
In [[Biological neural network|biologically inspired neural networks]], the activation function is usually an abstraction representing the rate of [[action potential]] firing in the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgkin|first=A. L.|last2=Huxley|first2=A. F.|date=1952-08-28|title=A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve |journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=117|issue=4|pages=500–544 |pmc=1392413|pmid=12991237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, this function is [[Binary function|binary]]—that is, either the [[neuron]] is firing or not. The function looks like &lt;math&gt;\phi(v_i)=U(v_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heaviside step function]]. In this case many neurons must be used in computation beyond linear separation of categories.

A line of positive [[slope]] may be used to reflect the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. Such a function would be of the form &lt;math&gt;\phi(v_i)=\mu v_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the slope. This activation function is linear, and therefore has the same problems as the binary function. In addition, networks constructed using this model have [[BIBO stability|unstable convergence]] because neuron inputs along favored paths tend to increase without bound, as this function is not [[Normalizing constant|normalizable]].

All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases quickly at first, but gradually approaches an [[asymptote]] at 100% firing rate. Mathematically, this looks like &lt;math&gt;\phi(v_i)=U(v_i)\tanh(v_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[hyperbolic tangent]] function can be replaced by any [[sigmoid function]]. This behavior is realistically reflected in the neuron, as neurons cannot physically fire faster than a certain rate. This model runs into problems, however, in computational networks as it is not [[wikt:differentiation|differentiable]], a requirement to calculate [[backpropagation]].

The final model, then, that is used in [[multilayer perceptron]]s is a sigmoidal activation function in the form of a hyperbolic tangent. Two forms of this function are commonly used: &lt;math&gt;\phi(v_i)=\tanh(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; whose range is normalized from -1 to 1, and &lt;math&gt;\phi(v_i) = (1+\exp(-v_i))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is vertically translated to normalize from 0 to 1. The latter model is often considered more biologically realistic, but it runs into theoretical and experimental difficulties with certain types of computational problems.

===Alternative structures===

A special class of activation functions known as [[radial basis function]]s (RBFs) are used in [[Radial basis function network|RBF networks]], which are extremely efficient as universal function approximators. These activation functions can take many forms, but they are usually found as one of three functions:
*Gaussian: &lt;math&gt;\,\phi(v_i)=\exp\left(-\frac{\|v_i-c_i\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
*Multiquadratics: &lt;math&gt;\,\phi(v_i)=\sqrt{\|v_i-c_i\|^2 + a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Inverse multiquadratics: &lt;math&gt;\,\phi(v_i)=(\|v_i-c_i\|^2 + a^2)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the vector representing the function ''center'' and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are parameters affecting the spread of the radius.

[[Support vector machines]] (SVMs) can effectively utilize a class of activation functions that includes both sigmoids and RBFs. In this case, the input is transformed to reflect a decision boundary hyperplane based on a few training inputs called ''support vectors'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The activation function for the hidden layer of these machines is referred to as the ''inner product kernel'', &lt;math&gt;K(v_i,x)=\phi(v_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The support vectors are represented as the centers in RBFs with the kernel equal to the activation function, but they take a unique form in the perceptron as 
:&lt;math&gt;\,\phi(v_i)=\tanh\left(\beta_1 + \beta_0 \sum_j v_{i,j} x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy certain conditions for convergence. These machines can also accept arbitrary-order polynomial activation functions where
:&lt;math&gt;\,\phi(v_i)=\left(1+\sum_j v_{i,j} x_j \right)^p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bX4pAQAAMAAJ}}|title=Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation|last=Haykin|first=Simon S.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn=978-0-13-273350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of activation functions===
Some desirable properties in an activation function include:

* Nonlinear – When the activation function is non-linear, then a two-layer neural network can be proven to be a universal function approximator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems|last=Cybenko|first=G.V.|publisher=Springer International|year=2006|editor-last=van Schuppen|editor-first=Jan H.|pp=303–314|chapter=Approximation by Superpositions of a Sigmoidal function|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4RtVAAAAMAAJ|page=303}}|title-link=Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity activation function does not satisfy this property. When multiple layers use the identity activation function, the entire network is equivalent to a single-layer model.
* Range – When the range of the activation function is finite, gradient-based training methods tend to be more stable, because pattern presentations significantly affect only limited weights. When the range is infinite, training is generally more efficient because pattern presentations significantly affect most of the weights. In the latter case, smaller learning rates are typically necessary.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Continuously differentiable – This property is desirable (RELU is not continuously differentiable and has some issues with gradient-based optimization, but it is still possible) for enabling gradient-based optimization methods. The binary step activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it differentiates to 0 for all other values, so gradient-based methods can make no progress with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0tFmf_UKl7oC}}|title=Practical Mathematical Optimization: An Introduction to Basic Optimization Theory and Classical and New Gradient-Based Algorithms|last=Snyman|first=Jan|date=3 March 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-24348-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monotonic – When the activation function is monotonic, the error surface associated with a single-layer model is guaranteed to be convex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Huaiqin|title=Global stability analysis of a general class of discontinuous neural networks with linear growth activation functions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025509002539|journal=Information Sciences|volume=179|issue=19|pages=3432–3441|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2009.06.006|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Smooth Functions with a Monotonic derivative – These have been shown to generalize better in some cases.
* Approximates identity near the origin – When activation functions have this property, the neural network will learn efficiently when its weights are initialized with small random values. When the activation function does not approximate identity near the origin, special care must be used when initializing the weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Sussillo|first=David|last2=Abbott|first2=L. F.|date=2014-12-19|title=Random Walk Initialization for Training Very Deep Feedforward Networks|eprint=1412.6558 |class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the table below, activation functions where &lt;math&gt;f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at 0 are indicated as having this property.

'''Alois J. Hitler Sr.''' (born '''Alois Johann Schicklgruber'''; 7 June 1837&amp;nbsp;– 3 January 1903) was an Austrian [[civil servant]] and the father of German dictator and leader of the [[Nazi Party]], [[Adolf Hitler]].

Alois Hitler was born illegitimately, and his paternity was never established. This led to claims that his wife Klara (Adolf’s mother) may have been his cousin. It also meant that Adolf could not prove pure Aryan blood. When Alois was promoted in the Customs service, he applied to be legitimised in the name of his stepfather Hiedler, which was entered in the register as ‘Hitler’, for unknown reasons. Alois had a poor relationship with Adolf, who rebelled against him.

==Early life==
Alois Hitler was born '''Alois Schicklgruber''' in the hamlet of Strones, parish of [[Döllersheim]], in the [[Waldviertel]], an area in northwest [[Lower Austria]], to a 42-year-old unmarried peasant, [[Maria Schicklgruber]], whose family had lived in the area for generations. At his [[baptism]] in Döllersheim, the space for his father's name on the baptismal certificate was left blank and the priest wrote "illegitimate".&lt;ref&gt;Toland, John ''Adolf Hitler'', Doubleday &amp; Company, 1976, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, William L ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1960, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler, 1889–1936: Hubris'', WW Norton &amp; Co, 2000, pp. 3–9&lt;/ref&gt; His mother cared for Alois in a house she shared with her elderly father, Johannes Schicklgruber.

[[File:House 36 in Spital, Lower Austria.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The home of Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (1807–1888)]]

Sometime later, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]] moved in with the Schicklgrubers; he married Maria when Alois was five. By the age of 10, Alois had been sent to live with Hiedler's brother, [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]], who owned a farm in the nearby village of [[Weitra#Geography|Spital]] (part of [[Weitra]]). Alois attended elementary school, and took lessons in shoemaking from a local [[shoemaking|cobbler]]. At the age of 13 he left the farm in Spital and went to Vienna as an apprentice cobbler, working there for about five years. In response to a recruitment drive by the Austrian government offering employment in the civil service to people from rural areas, Alois joined the frontier guards ([[Customs (tax)|customs]] service) of the Austrian Finance Ministry in 1855 at the age of 18.

===Biological father===
Historians have proposed various candidates as Alois's biological father: [[Johann Georg Hiedler]], his brother [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]] (or ''Hüttler''), and Leopold Frankenberger (whose existence has never been documented).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank McDonough]], ''Hitler and the rise of the Nazi Party'', Pearson Education, 2003, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, Johann Georg Hiedler was the stepfather and posthumously legally declared birth father of Alois.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler, 1889–1936: Hubris'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Frank McDonough]], the most plausible theory is that Johann Georg Hiedler was the real father of Alois. An explanation for Alois being sent to live on his uncle's farm as a child is that Hiedler and Maria were simply too poor to raise him, or could not raise him as well as his uncle, or perhaps Maria's health was in decline.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

Werner Maser suggests that Alois's father was Johann Nepomuk, Georg's brother and Hitler's step-uncle, who raised Alois through adolescence and later willed him a considerable portion of his life savings, but never admitted publicly to being his real father. According to Maser, Nepomuk was a married farmer who had an affair and then arranged to have his single brother Hiedler marry Alois's mother Maria to provide a cover for Nepomuk's desire to assist and care for Alois without upsetting his wife.&lt;ref name= maser /&gt; This assumes Hiedler was willing to marry Maria in this situation, and Adolf Hitler biographer [[Joachim Fest]] thinks this is too contrived and unlikely to be true.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

Alois's son Adolf, following the rumours that his paternal grandfather was a Jew, in 1931 ordered the SS (''[[Schutzstaffel]]'') to investigate the alleged rumours regarding his ancestry; they found no evidence of any Jewish ancestors.&lt;ref name= "Fischel1998"&gt;{{cite book | first =Jack | last = Fischel| title= The Holocaust| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HrW-b3Q-3ewC&amp;pg=PA137 |year = 1998 | publisher = Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-29879-0|pages= 137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Nuremberg Laws]] came into effect within the [[Third Reich]], Hitler then ordered the genealogist Rudolf Koppensteiner to publish a large illustrated genealogical tree showing his ancestry; this was published in the book ''Die Ahnentafel des Fuehrers'' (''The Pedigree of the Leader'') in 1937, which concluded that Hitler's family were all [[Austria]]n [[Germans]] with no Jewish ancestry and that Hitler had an unblemished "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" pedigree.&lt;ref name="wargs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/hitler.html |title=Ancestry of Adolf Hitler |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFEZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Die Ahnentafel des Führers - Rudolf Koppensteiner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Alois himself legitimised Johann Georg Hiedler as his father and the priest changed this on his birth certificate in 1876, this was considered certified proof for Hitler's ancestry; thus Hitler was considered a "pure" Aryan.&lt;ref name="wargs1"/&gt;

Although Johann Georg Hiedler was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by the [[Third Reich]], the question of who his grandfather was has caused much speculation and has remained unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46251821.html |title=Lineage of Adolf Hitler - Density inbreeding |publisher=Der Spiegel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41757713.html |title= Hitler - No proof of Aryan descent |publisher=Der Spiegel. |quote=It is clear that Adolf Hitler proof of Aryan ancestry, he demanded to most Germans, for his own person could hardly have been able to provide. His paternal grandfather is unknown.}}&lt;/ref&gt; German historian Joachim Fest wrote that:

{{quote|The indulgence normally accorded to a man's origins is out of place in the case of Adolf Hitler, who made [[Ahnenpass|documentary proof]] of Aryan ancestry a matter of life and death for millions of people but himself possessed no such document. He did not know who his grandfather was. Intensive research into his origins, accounts of which have been distorted by propagandist legends and which are in any case confused and murky, has failed so far to produce a clear picture. National Socialist versions skimmed over the facts and emphasized, for example, that the population of the so-called ''[[Waldviertel]]'', from which Hitler came, had been 'tribally German since the [[Migration Period|Migration of the Peoples']], or more generally, that Hitler had 'absorbed the powerful forces of this German granite landscape into his blood through his father'.&lt;ref name="Fest1999"&gt;{{cite book | author = Joachim C. Fest | title = The Face of the Third Reich | ISBN = 978-0-306-80915-6 | pages = 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war, Hitler's former lawyer, [[Hans Frank]], claimed that Hitler told him in 1930 that one of his relatives was trying to blackmail him by threatening to reveal his alleged Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'', New York: Random House 1998, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler asked Frank to find out the facts. Frank says he determined that at the time Maria Schicklgruber gave birth to Alois she was working as a household cook in the town of [[Graz]], that her employers were a Jewish family named Frankenberger, and that her child might have been conceived out of wedlock with the family's 19-year-old son, Leopold Frankenberger.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'', New York: Random House 1998, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, all Jews had been expelled from the province of [[Styria]] (which includes Graz) in the 15th century; they were not allowed to return until the 1860s, when Alois was around 30. Also, there is no evidence of a Frankenberger family living in Graz at that time. Scholars such as [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Brigitte Hamann]] dismiss the Frankenberger hypothesis (which had only Frank's speculation to support it) as baseless.&lt;ref name="HamannMommsen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Hamann|author2=Hans Mommsen|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUBhhKDkn1sC&amp;pg=PA50|date=3 August 2010|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84885-277-8|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-ref.de/personen/hitler-adolf/vorfahren/hitlers-abstammung.php |title=Hatte Hitler jüdische Vorfahren? |publisher=Holocaust-Referenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/797/was-hitler-part-jewish |title=Was Hitler part Jewish? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=April 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/hitlerjew.html |title=Was Hitler Jewish? |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kershaw cites several stories circulating in the 1920s about Hitler's alleged Jewish ancestry, including one about a "Baron Rothschild" in Vienna in whose household Maria Schicklgruber had worked for some time as a servant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/kershaw-hitler.html |title=Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kershaw discusses and also lists Hitler's family tree in his biography of Adolf Hitler and gives no validity as to the Frankenberger tale.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian.

Norton &amp; Company, 2008, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Frank's story contains several inaccuracies and contradictions, such as he said "The fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood in his veins, seems, from what has been his whole manner, so blatant to me that it needs no further word",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-ref.de/personen/hitler-adolf/vorfahren/hitlers-abstammung.php |title=Holocaust-Referenz : Hatte Hitler jüdische Vorfahren? |publisher=H-ref.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; also the statement Frank had made that Maria Schicklgruber came from "[[Leonding]] near [[Linz]]", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of [[Döllersheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'', New York: Random House 1998 p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Rosenbaum]] suggests that Frank, who had turned against [[Nazism]] after 1945, but remained an [[anti-Semitic]] fanatic, made the claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry as a way of proving that Hitler was a [[Jews|Jew]] and ''not'' an [[Aryan]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'', New York: Random House 1998 pp. 21, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Alois Hitler.jpeg|thumb|upright|Alois Hitler always wore his uniform, and insisted on being addressed as ''Herr Oberoffizial Hitler''.&lt;ref name="mind115"&gt;"The Mind of Adolf Hitler", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p.115&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Alois Schicklgruber made steady progress in the semi-[[military]] profession of customs official. The work involved frequent reassignments and he served in a variety of places across Austria. By 1860, after five years of service, he reached the rank of ''Finanzwach-Oberaufseher'' (Revenue guard superintendent). By 1864, after special training and examinations, he had advanced further and was serving in [[Linz, Austria]]. He later became an inspector of customs posted at [[Braunau am Inn]] in 1875. He eventually rose to full inspector of customs and could go no higher because he lacked the necessary school degrees.

===Change of surname===
As a rising young junior customs official, he used his birth name of Schicklgruber, but in mid-1876, 39 years old and well established in his career, he asked permission to use his stepfather's family name. He appeared before the parish priest in [[Döllersheim]] and asserted that his father was [[Johann Georg Hiedler]], who had married his mother and now wished to legitimize him. Three relatives appeared with him as witnesses, one of whom was Johann Nepomuk, Hiedler's brother. The priest agreed to amend the birth certificate, the civil authorities automatically processed the church's decision and Alois Schicklgruber had a new name. The official change, registered at the government office in [[Mistelbach]] in 1877, transformed him into "Alois Hitler". It is not known who decided on the spelling of ''Hitler'' instead of ''Hiedler''. Johann Georg's brother was sometimes known by the surname ''Hüttler''.

Bradley Smith states that Alois Schicklgruber openly admitted having been born out of wedlock before and after the name change.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bradley F. ''Adolf Hitler: His Family, Childhood and Youth.'' Hoover Institute, 1967 {{ISBN|0-8179-1622-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alois may have been influenced to change his name for the sake of legal expediency. Historian Werner Maser claims that in 1876, Franz Schicklgruber, the administrator of Alois's mother's estate, transferred a large sum of money (230 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]) to him.&lt;ref name=maser&gt;Werner Maser – Hitler: Legend, Myth and Reality (in German, 1971; Penguin Books Ltd 1973 {{ISBN|0-06-012831-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly, Johann Georg Hiedler, who died in 1857, relented on his deathbed and left an inheritance to his illegitimate stepson (Alois) together with his name.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mind of Adolf Hitler", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Schicklgrubers remain in the ''Waldviertel''.

==Personal life==
===Illegitimate daughter===
In early 1869, Hitler had an affair with Thekla Penz (born September 24, 1844) of Leopoldstein, Arbesbach in the district of Zwettel, Lower Austria. This led to the birth of Theresia Penz on October 31, 1869. Thekla later married a man by the name of Horner, while Theresia married Johan Ramer and gave birth to at least six children, while living in the town of Schwertberg.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Early married life===
Hitler was 36 years old when he married for the first time. Anna Glasl-Hörer was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when they married and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwards.

Not long after marrying his first wife, Anna, Alois Hitler began an affair with Franziska "Fanni" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house number 219, in the city of Braunau am Inn, where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. The 19-year-old Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend.

In 1876, three years after Hitler married Anna, he had hired [[Klara Pölzl]] as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of Hitler's step-uncle (and possible father or biological uncle) Nepomuk. If Nepomuk was Hitler's father, Klara was Hitler's half-niece. If his father was Johann Georg, she was his [[first cousin once removed]]. Matzelsberger demanded that the "servant girl" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent Pölzl away.

On 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child's last name was Matzelsberger, making him "Alois Matzelsberger". Hitler kept Matzelsberger as his wife while his lawful wife (Anna) grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow custom officials as witnesses, Hitler, 45, married Matzelsberger, 21. He then legitimized his son as Alois Hitler Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/h/hitler-adolf/oss-papers/text/oss-profile-04-01.html |title="Hitler As He Knows Himself", report by Walter Langer for the OSS |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alois's second child, [[Angela Hitler|Angela]], was born on 28 July 1883.

Hitler was secure in his profession and no longer an ambitious climber. Historian [[Alan Bullock]] described Alois as "hard, unsympathetic and short-tempered".&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'', Harper&amp;Row Publishers, 1962, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Matzelsberger, still only 23, acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was moved to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara Pölzl returned to Alois's home to look after the invalid and the two children (Alois Jr. and Angela).&lt;ref name="mind114"&gt;"The Mind of Adolf Hitler", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After the death of his second wife, Pölzl remained in his home as housekeeper.&lt;ref name="mind114"/&gt;

===Marriage to Klara Pölzl and family life===
[[File:Haus Wiesinger.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Gasthaus Wiesinger in February 2009]]

Pölzl was soon to be pregnant by Hitler. Smith writes that if Hitler had been free to do as he wished, he would have married Pölzl immediately but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally Pölzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.&lt;ref&gt;Alois petitioned the church for an episcopal dispensation citing "bilateral affinity in the third degree touching the second" to describe his rather complicated family relationship to Klara. The local bishop apparently believed this relationship was too close to approve on his own authority, so he forwarded the petition to Rome on behalf of Alois, seeking instead a papal dispensation, which was approved before the birth of the couple's first child. ''See'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rosenbaum-hitler.html Rosenblum article].&lt;/ref&gt; Permission came, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was held at Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Payne | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Payne (author) |coauthors= | title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler | year=1973 | publisher=Praeger | location=New York | isbn= | page=12}}''The marriage took place early in the morning, and Klara is said to have complained: "We were married at six o'clock in the morning, and my husband was already at work at seven."''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. In 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. In 1887 Otto was born, but died days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-393-06757-6 | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 1887–1888, diphtheria struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January).

On 20 April 1889, she gave birth to another son, future leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf]]. He was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois was 51 when he was born. Hitler had little interest in child-rearing, and left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby, [[apiculture|keeping bees]]. Hitler was transferred from Braunau to [[Passau]]. He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf was three years old.

Beginning on 1 August, the family lived at Theresienstr. 23. One month after Hitler accepted a better paying position in Linz, on 1 April 1893, his wife and the children moved to a second floor room on Kapuzinerstr. 31.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, p. 20f&lt;/ref&gt; Klara had just given birth to Edmund, so it was decided she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, Robert Payne, 1973, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 1896, [[Paula Hitler|Paula]], Adolf's younger sister, was born. She was the last child of Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl. Hitler was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14. Edmund (the youngest of the boys) died of [[measles]] on 2 February 1900.

Hitler wanted his son Adolf to seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Hitler wanted. Adolf sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Hitler tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hamann | first=Brigitte | authorlink=Brigitte Hamann |coauthors= | title=Hitler's Vienna | year=2010 | publisher=[[Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] | location=New York | isbn=978-1-84885-277-8 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G. L. Waite]] noted, "Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife [Klara] and 'hardly ever spoke a word to her at home'." If Hitler was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of them. [[William Patrick Hitler]] says that he had heard from his father, Alois Jr., that Alois Hitler Sr. used to beat his children.&lt;ref name="mind115"/&gt; After Hitler and his eldest son Alois Jr. had a climactic and violent argument, Alois Jr. left home, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy a penny of inheritance beyond what the law required. According to reports, Alois Hitler liked to lord it over his neighbors.&lt;ref name="mind115"/&gt;

==Retirement and death==
In February 1895, Hitler purchased a house on a nine-acre (36,000&amp;nbsp;m²) plot in Hafeld near [[Lambach]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} southwest of [[Linz]]. The farm was called the ''Rauscher Gut''. He moved his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58, after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property declined.

On the morning of [[3 January]] 1903, Hitler went to the Gasthaus Wiesinger (no. 1 Michaelsbergstrasse, Leonding) as usual to drink his morning glass of wine. He was offered the newspaper and promptly collapsed. He was taken to an adjoining room and a doctor was summoned, but Alois Hitler died at the inn, probably from a [[pleural hemorrhage]]. Adolf Hitler, who was 13 when his father died, says in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that he died of a "stroke of [[apoplexy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler, 4%&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''The Young Hitler I Knew'', Hitler's childhood friend [[August Kubizek]] recalled, "When the fourteen-year-old [sic] son saw his dead father he burst out into uncontrollable weeping."

===Removal of tombstone===
On 28 March 2012, by the account of Kurt Pittertschatscher, the pastor of the parish, the tombstone marking Alois Hitler's grave and that of his wife Klara, in Town Cemetery in [[Leonding]], was removed by a descendant. The descendant is said to be an elderly female relative of Alois Hitler's first wife, Anna, who has also given up any rights to the rented burial plot. The plot was covered in white gravel and a tree which has since been removed. It is not known whether the remains of Adolf Hitler's parents are still interred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17562615 |title=Adolf Hitler parents' tombstone in Austria removed |publisher=BBC News |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11646 |title= Alois Hitler |publisher=Find A Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On screen, Alois has been portrayed by:

*[[Helmut Griem]] in the ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' episode "Genesis and Catastrophe" (1980)
*[[James Remar]] in ''[[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "Cradle of Darkness" (2002)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Andrea Morisco''' (in {{lang-el|Ἀνδρέας Μουρίσκος}}, ''Andreas Mouriskos'') was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] pirate active in the [[Aegean Sea]] in the late 13th century, who in 1304 entered the service of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As an admiral and corsair, he was active under Byzantine colours until 1308, when he was captured and executed in [[Cyprus]].

==Life==
Morisco was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] pirate, active at least since 1279, who had had a successful career fighting against both the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turks]] and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].&lt;ref name="PLP"&gt;PLP 19516. Mουρίσκος Ἀνδρέας&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laiou151"&gt;Laiou (1972), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1304, Morisco with his two ships entered the service of the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], who gave him the rank of ''[[vestiarios]]''. The Venetians in retaliation attacked him and burned one of his ships, but in 1305, he attacked the island of [[Tenedos]], and with the aid of some passing Genoese ships recovered it for the Empire.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laiou151"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicol (1993), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; 

At this time, the Byzantines became involved in open war against the mercenaries of the [[Catalan Company]], whom they had invited to fight against the Turks, but who now had turned against Byzantium. In this war, Morisco supplied the town of [[Madyta]], which was besieged by the Catalans, with food, and intercepted the passage of some Turkish allies of the Catalans from crossing over the [[Hellespont]] back into [[Anatolia]]—the latter a dubious success, as they proceeded to raid the Byzantine province of [[Thrace]] instead. For his service, Andronikos II made Morisco an admiral and gave him and his brother [[Lodovico Morisco|Lodovico]] the islands of [[Rhodes]], [[Karpathos]] and [[Kasos]] as fiefs.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laiou (1972), p. 156 note 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicol (1993), pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

During one of his fights with the Catalans in the [[Sea of Marmara]], he was defeated and captured by the Catalans, but was able to buy his freedom and returned to Tenedos. In 1306, he was back in action, and along with the Byzantines' Genoese allies participated in the unsuccessful siege of [[Gallipoli]], which was held by the Catalans.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; In 1307 and 1308, along with other Byzantine-sponsored pirates, Morisco was active in the Aegean, attacking Venetian shipping off the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Laiou (1972), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1308, Morisco was captured by King [[Henry II of Cyprus]], and executed by hanging in [[Famagusta]].&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt;

'''Anna of Bohemia and Hungary''' ([[Buda]], [[Hungary]], 23 July 1503 &amp;ndash; [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]], 27 January 1547), sometimes known as '''Anna Jagellonica''', was Queen of the Romans (Germany), Bohemia and Hungary as the wife of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand I]], later [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
She was the elder child and only daughter of King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] (1456–1516) and his third wife [[Anne of Foix-Candale]]. She was an older sister of [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]]. Her paternal grandparents were King [[Casimir IV of Poland]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], and [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], one of the heiresses of Bohemia, [[duchy of Luxembourg]] and [[duchy of Kujavia]]. Her maternal grandparents were [[Gaston de Foix, Count of Candale]] and [[Infanta Catherine of Navarre|Catherine de Foix]], Infanta of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Life==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
She was born in [[Buda]] (now [[Budapest]]). The death of Vladislaus II on 13 March 1516 left both siblings in the care of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was arranged that Anna marry his grandson, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]], second son of [[Queen regnant]] [[Joanna of Castile]] and her late husband and co-ruler, [[Philip I of Castile]]. Anna married Ferdinand on 26 May 1521 in [[Linz]], Austria. At the time Ferdinand was governing the [[Habsburg]] hereditary lands on behalf of his older brother [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was stipulated that Ferdinand should succeed Anne's brother in case he died without male heirs.

Her brother Louis was killed in the [[Battle of Mohács]] against [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 29 August 1526. This left the thrones of both Bohemia and Hungary vacant. Ferdinand claimed both kingdoms and was elected King of Bohemia on 24 October of the same year, making Anna Queen of Bohemia.

Hungary was a more difficult case. Suleiman had annexed much of its lands. Ferdinand was proclaimed King of Hungary by a group of nobles, but another faction of Hungarian nobles refused to allow a foreign ruler to hold that title and elected [[John Zápolya]] as an alternative king. The resulting conflict between the two rivals and their successors lasted until 1571. In 1531, Ferdinand's older brother Charles V recognised Ferdinand as his successor as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and Ferdinand was elevated to the title [[King of the Romans]].

Anna and Ferdinand had fifteen children, all of whom were born in Bohemia or Hungary. Both of these kingdoms had suffered for centuries from premature deaths among heirs and a shortage of succession prospects. Meanwhile, Anna served as [[Royal Consorts of Bohemia|queen consort of Bohemia]] and as one of three living [[queens consort|queens]] of [[Hungary]] until her death. She died in [[Prague]], days after giving birth to her last daughter [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Joanna]]. In 1556, Charles V abdicated and Ferdinand succeeded as emperor, nine years after Anna's death.

'''Bonnie Bryant''' (born October 5, 1943) is an American [[professional golfer]] who played on the [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]]. She is the only player in LPGA Tour history to win a tournament [[left-handed]].

Bryant was born in [[Tulare, California]]. She did not take up golf until age 20, learning from [[Vic Lombardi]], a [[National League]] [[pitcher]] for Brooklyn and Pittsburgh. Prior to taking up golf, she played five years of AAA-[[softball#Types of softball|fast pitch softball]].

Bryant joined the LPGA Tour in 1971. She won once on the LPGA Tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpga.com/content/All-timeWinnersList.pdf LPGA All-Time Winners List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229053926/http://www.lpga.com/content/All-timeWinnersList.pdf |date=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her win came at the 1974 [[Bill Branch LPGA Classic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpga.com/content/Chronology70-79.pdf LPGA Tournament Chronology 1970-79] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102105959/http://www.lpga.com/content/Chronology70-79.pdf |date=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fort Myers, Florida]]. She shot a 7-under-[[Par (score)|par]], 209 to claim the $5,700 first prize. She also lost to [[Nancy Lopez]] in a five-way [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden death]] playoff at the 1979 [[Chrysler-Plymouth Classic|Coca-Cola Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ggxgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lekFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4582,771899&amp;dq=nancy+lopez+coca+cola+classic&amp;hl=en Lopez does Wright]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) ('''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found within the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773" /&gt; These sequences are derived from DNA fragments from viruses that have previously infected the prokaryote and are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar viruses during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral defense system of prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid25574773"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = The roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 36–41 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25574773 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2014.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cas9]] (or "CRISPR-associated 9") is an [[enzyme]] that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as '''CRISPR/Cas9''' that can be used to edit genes within organisms.&lt;ref name="pmid24651067"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang F, Wen Y, Guo X | title = CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing: progress, implications and challenges | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = R1 | pages = R40–6 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24651067 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddu125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of gene editing process has a wide variety of applications including use as a basic biology research tool, development of [[biotechnology]] products, and potentially to treat diseases.&lt;ref&gt;CRISPR-CAS9, TALENS and ZFNS - the battle in gene editing https://www.ptglab.com/news/blog/crispr-cas9-talens-and-zfns-the-battle-in-gene-editing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR together with the ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|iap]]'' gene, the target of interest. The organization of the repeats was unusual because repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively along DNA.&lt;ref name="Ishino1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–33 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They studied the relation of "iap" to the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]''. The function of the interrupted clustered repeats was not known at the time.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in this bacterium. These researchers recognized the diversity of the DR-intervening sequences among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–95 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''spoligotyping'', which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–65 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–20 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function was studied by [[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–9 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself.

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1 - 4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–75 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication the acronym CRISPR was coined as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–63 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–82 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name=Makarova2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt; A CRISPR region in ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'' acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage.

By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer indeed confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'' targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]]. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]''.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt; A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in ''S. thermophilus''.&lt;ref name=Garneau2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | display-authors = 6 | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | bibcode = 2010Natur.468...67G | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas9 ===
Researchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' that relies on the protein [[Cas9]]. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Barrangou2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a "single-guide RNA" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid22745249" /&gt; Another group of collaborators comprising [[Virginijus Šikšnys]] together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the ''S. thermophilus'' CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016"/&gt;

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human [[tripronuclear zygotes]] first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant [[HBB|Beta-Hemoglobin]] (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 | pmid=25894090 | pmc=4417674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cpf1 ===
In 2015, the nuclease Cpf1 was characterized in the [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] system of the bacterium ''[[Francisella novicida]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid26422227"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zetsche B, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Slaymaker IM, Makarova KS, Essletzbichler P, Volz SE, Joung J, van der Oost J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 759–71 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26422227 | pmc = 4638220 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27096362"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonfara I, Richter H, Bratovič M, Le Rhun A, Charpentier E | title = The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7600 | pages = 517–21 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27096362 | doi = 10.1038/nature17945 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..517F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, from a [[TIGRFAMs]] [[protein family]] definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cpf1 showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cpf1 some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cpf1's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5' overhangs left by Cpf1 can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cpf1 cleaves DNA 18-23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cpf1 enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|accessdate = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===

Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;ref name="Makarova2015" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westra | first1 = Edze R. | last2 = Dowling | first2 = Andrea J. | last3 = Broniewski | first 3 = Jenny M. | last4 = van Houte | first4 = Stineke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|left|upright=2|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea.

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[virus]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–88 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–22 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–76 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.&lt;ref name="pmid23403393" /&gt; It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops&lt;ref name="pmid21572444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gesner EM, Schellenberg MJ, Garside EL, George MM, Macmillan AM | title = Recognition and maturation of effector RNAs in a CRISPR interference pathway | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 688–92 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572444 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21572442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sashital DG, Jinek M, Doudna JA | title = An RNA-induced conformational change required for CRISPR RNA cleavage by the endoribonuclease Cse3 | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 680–7 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572442 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20829488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haurwitz RE, Jinek M, Wiedenheft B, Zhou K, Doudna JA | title = Sequence- and structure-specific RNA processing by a CRISPR endonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1355–8 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20829488 | pmc = 3133607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192272 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1355H }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V, Sorek R, Hugenholtz P | title = Evolutionary conservation of sequence and secondary structures in CRISPR repeats | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R61 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17442114 | pmc = 1896005 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.

Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the longer transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage just upstream of the repeat sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid19141480"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carte J, Wang R, Li H, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = Cas6 is an endoribonuclease that generates guide RNAs for invader defense in prokaryotes | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 22 | issue = 24 | pages = 3489–96 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19141480 | pmc = 2607076 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1742908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21300293"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang R, Preamplume G, Terns MP, Terns RM, Li H | title = Interaction of the Cas6 riboendonuclease with CRISPR RNAs: recognition and cleavage | journal = Structure | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–64 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21300293 | pmc = 3154685 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2010.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24150936"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niewoehner O, Jinek M, Doudna JA | title = Evolution of CRISPR RNA recognition and processing by Cas6 endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 1341–53 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24150936 | pmc = 3902920 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="pmid23696746" /&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.&lt;ref name="pmid19095942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garneau2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19120484" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21646539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semenova E, Jore MM, Datsenko KA, Semenova A, Westra ER, Wanner B, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ, Severinov K | display-authors = 6 | title = Interference by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA is governed by a seed sequence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 25 | pages = 10098–103 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21646539 | pmc = 3121866 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104144108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810098S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21166892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gudbergsdottir S, Deng L, Chen Z, Jensen JV, Jensen LR, She Q, Garrett RA | title = Dynamic properties of the Sulfolobus CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Cmr systems when challenged with vector-borne viral and plasmid genes and protospacers | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21166892 | pmc = 3025118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21385233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manica A, Zebec Z, Teichmann D, Schleper C | title = In vivo activity of CRISPR-mediated virus defence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 481–91 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21385233 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jore MM, Lundgren M, van Duijn E, Bultema JB, Westra ER, Waghmare SP, Wiedenheft B, Pul U, Wurm R, Wagner R, Beijer MR, Barendregt A, Zhou K, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Doudna JA, Boekema EJ, Heck AJ, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis for CRISPR RNA-guided DNA recognition by Cascade | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–36 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21460843 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21938068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Lander GC, Zhou K, Jore MM, Brouns SJ, van der Oost J, Doudna JA, Nogales E | title = Structures of the RNA-guided surveillance complex from a bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 486–9 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21938068 | doi = 10.1038/nature10402 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477..486W | pmc=4165517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–13 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–56 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–71 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission.

Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A | title = Lamarckian Illusions | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 566–568 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26411613 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are a from of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Just how Lamarckian is CRISPR-Cas immunity: the continuum of evolvability mechanisms | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26912144 | pmc = 4765028 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-016-0111-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the evolution of the car gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed [[coevolution]] of host and viral genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Schoenfeld T, Bhaya D | title = Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4169 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19132092 | pmc = 2612747 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004169 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4169H | editor1-last = Ahmed | editor1-first = Niyaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in [[pathogen]]ic and [[commensal]] bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''S. enterica'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | editor1-last = Randau | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | editor1-first = Lennart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid mine drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–70 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–16 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==

CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sorek R, Kunin V, Hugenholtz P | title = CRISPR--a widespread system that provides acquired resistance against phages in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22583485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pride DT, Salzman J, Relman DA | title = Comparisons of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and viromes in human saliva reveal bacterial adaptations to salivary viruses | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2564–76 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22583485 | pmc = 3424356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02775.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23701169"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Whitaker RJ | title = Reassortment of CRISPR repeat-spacer loci in Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 3065–76 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23701169 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20927396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Cadillo-Quiroz H, Whitaker RJ | title = CRISPR associated diversity within a population of Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12988 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20927396 | pmc = 2946923 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012988 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...512988H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) primers.

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely ''de novo'' identification&lt;ref name="pmid23511966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skennerton CT, Imelfort M, Tyson GW | title = Crass: identification and reconstruction of CRISPR from unassembled metagenomic data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = e105 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23511966 | pmc = 3664793 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from [[contig]]s (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt; and direct repeat sequences from published genomes&lt;ref name="pmid22732228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern A, Mick E, Tirosh I, Sagy O, Sorek R | title = CRISPR targeting reveals a reservoir of common phages associated with the human gut microbiome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1985–94 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22732228 | pmc = 3460193 | doi = 10.1101/gr.138297.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.

== Use by phages ==

Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–51 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and pahage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–5|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–91 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predecessors ===

In the early 2000s, researchers developed [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Susan|date=11 February 2014|title=CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|accessdate=2014-04-13|name-list-format=vanc|journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[RNA interference|RNA interference (RNAi)]] does not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]] and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] provide full irreversible [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref name="Heidenreich_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidenreich M, Zhang F | title = Applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in neuroscience | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Genome engineering ===
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).

CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases |last=Ly |first=Joseph |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

==== Structure ====
CRISPR/Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However this is not too limiting as it is a short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt;

Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |title=CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: check three times, cut once | first = Robert | last = Sanders | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 November 2015 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226231842/http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Optimized CRISPR Design|url = http://crispr.mit.edu/|website = crispr.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Delivery ====
{{See also|Transfection}}

Delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems.

Using "dead" versions of Cas9 ([[Cas9#Interference of transcription by dCas9|dCas9]]) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"&gt;{{cite web | title = And Science's Breakthrough of the Year is …|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/12/and-science-s-breakthrough-year|website = news.sciencemag.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21|date = December 17, 2015|last = Science News Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated, [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA. Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = CRISPR: gene editing is just the beginning | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7593 | pages = 156–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26961639 | doi = 10.1038/531156a | url = https://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-is-just-the-beginning-1.19510 | bibcode = 2016Natur.531..156L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26670017 | pmc = 4922510 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2015.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.&lt;ref name="pmid24336571"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelsen TS, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–7 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | pmc = 4089965 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] that immediately precede the target gene.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes. They considered the [[fusobacteria]] ''Leptotrichia shahii''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of Crispr Gene Editing With New Capabilities|last=Zimmer|first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc | date=2016-06-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of [[MicroRNA|micro-RNA]] and [[Long non-coding RNA|long-noncoding RNA]] genes in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basak J, Nithin C | title = Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 1001 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26635829 | pmc = 4652605 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.01001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease models ===

CRISPR simplifies creation of [[Genetically modified organism#Mammals|animals for research]] that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the [[germline]] level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be targeted at non-germline cells.&lt;ref name="pmid25914022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Erp PB, Bloomer G, Wilkinson R, Wiedenheft B | title = The history and market impact of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 85–90 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25914022 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.03.011 | pmc = 4470805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25819765"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maggio I, Gonçalves MA | title = Genome editing at the crossroads of delivery, specificity, and fidelity | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–91 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25819765 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25868999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rath D, Amlinger L, Rath A, Lundgren M | title = The CRISPR-Cas immune system: biology, mechanisms and applications | journal = Biochimie | volume = 117 | issue =  | pages = 119–28 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25868999 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR can be utilized to create human cellular models of disease.

CRISPR/Cas-based "RNA-guided nucleases" can be used to target [[virulence factors]], genes encoding [[antibiotic resistance]] and other medically relevant sequences of interest. This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations.&lt;ref name="Gomaaetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomaa AA, Klumpe HE, Luo ML, Selle K, Barrangou R, Beisel CL| title = Programmable removal of bacterial strains by use of genome-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = MBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e00928–13 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473129 | pmc = 3903277 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00928-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CitorikMimee2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Citorik RJ, Mimee M, Lu TK | title = Sequence-specific antimicrobials using efficiently delivered RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 1141–5 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25240928 | pmc = 4237163 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3011 | hdl = 1721.1/100834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR/Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance&lt;ref name="Gholizadeh2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gholizadeh P, Aghazadeh M, Asgharzadeh M, Kafil HS,| title = Suppressing the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system in bacterial infections | journal = European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2043–2051 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28601970  | doi = 10.1007/s10096-017-3036-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as transposons, bacteriophages and plasmids.

Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple [[herpesviruses]]. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). Anti-herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for [[immunocompromised]] patients of viral invaders, or preventing [[Herpes labialis|cold sore]] outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking [[HSV-1]] reactivation. {{as of|2016|August}}, these were awaiting testing.&lt;ref name="pmid27362483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diemen FR, Kruse EM, Hooykaas MJ, Bruggeling CE, Schürch AC, van Ham PM, Imhof SM, Nijhuis M, Wiertz EJ, Lebbink RJ | title = CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of Herpesviruses Limits Productive and Latent Infections | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e1005701 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362483 | pmc = 4928872 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005701 | laysummary = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWh8VLkiU | laysource = PLOS Media YouTube Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRISPR is being applied to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27595406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhan Y, Chen Z, He A, Li J, Wu H, Liu L, Zhuang C, Lin J, Guo X, Zhang Q, Huang W, Cai Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Directing cellular information flow via CRISPR signal conductors | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  13| issue =  11| date = September 2016 | pmid = 27595406 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3994 | pages=938–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may revive the concept of [[Xenotransplantation|transplanting]] animal organs into people. [[Retroviruses]] present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirus's DNA from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608579/crispr-opens-up-new-possibilities-for-transplants-using-pig-organs/|title=Using CRISPR on pigs could make their organs safer for human transplant|last=Mullin|first=Emily | name-list-format = vanc |work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may have applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, such as by creating human blood vessels that lack expression of [[MHC class II]] proteins, which often cause transplant rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrahimi P, Chang WG, Kluger MS, Qyang Y, Tellides G, Saltzman WM, Pober JS | title = Efficient gene disruption in cultured primary human endothelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–8 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25940550 | pmc = 4490936 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR in cancer ====
{{as of|2016}} CRISPR had been studied in animal models and cancer cell lines, to learn if it can be used to repair or thwart mutated genes that cause [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan FA, Pandupuspitasari NS, Chun-Jie H, Ao Z, Jamal M, Zohaib A, Khan FA, Hakim MR, ShuJun Z | title = CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics: a cure for cancer and other genetic diseases | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 32 | pages = 52541–52552 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27250031 | pmc = 5239572 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.9646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016. It involved removing immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. 20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Le Page | name-list-format = vanc | title=Boom in human gene editing as 20 CRISPR trials gear up|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133095-boom-in-human-gene-editing-as-20-crispr-trials-gear-up/|work=New Scientist|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20137 |title=First CRISPR clinical trial gets green light from US panel |journal=Nature |year=2016 |last1=Reardon |first1=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the company CRISPR Therapeutics received approval to start a clinical trial with a CRISPR-based treatment for the blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which is scheduled to start in late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/medical/crispr-therapeutics-clinical-trials/|title=CRISPR Therapeutics Plans First CRISPR Clinical Trial in Europe for 2018|date=2017-12-13|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://genomemag.com/2018/05/crispr-beta-thalassemia-treatment-approved-for-clinical-trial-in-europe/|title=CRISPR Beta-Thalassemia Treatment Approved for Clinical Trial in Europe|work=Genome Magazine|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene function ===
In 2015, multiple studies attempted to systematically disable each individual human gene, in an attempt to identify which genes were essential to human biology. Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known human genes. Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They are more likely to have indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also cataloged the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Revolutionary Gene-Editing Technique That Reveals Cancer's Weaknesses|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/a-revolutionary-gene-editing-technique-reveals-cancers-weaknesses/417495/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-21 | first = Ed | last = Yong | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific functions of some 18 percent of the essential genes are unidentified. In one 2015 targeting experiment, disabling individual genes in groups of cells attempted to identify those involved in resistance to a [[melanoma]] drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate "drug", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' genetic depletion ===
Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] as seen with [[restriction enzyme]]s. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref name="pmid26944702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vivo'' applications ===
CRISPR/Cas-9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and entire chromosomes can be eliminated from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been deleted ''in vivo'' are the Y chromosomes and X chromosomes of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic aneuploid diseases such as [[Down Syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29178945"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | year = 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4 | lay-summary = https://www.genomeweb.com/gene-silencinggene-editing/crispr-used-eliminate-targeted-chromosomes-new-study | lay-source= Genome Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may obscure the results of a CRISRP gene editing experiment (the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).  Modifications to CRISRP have been made to minimize the possibility of off-target effects.

{{as of|2014|December}}, [[patent rights]] to CRISPR were contested.

As of November 2018, All the CRISPR patent holders and institutes associated with them have set up companies to commercialize the patents by sub-licensing them for therapeutic, agriculture and many other application areas to biotech firms, pharmaceuticals, agri-businesses etc. Caribou Biosciences, ERS Genomics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and CRISPR Therapeutics are the spin offs associated with CRISPR landscape. Not many large scale commercial assignees have actively participated in the early phases of the CRISPR–Cas patent landscape. The only large establishments making it to the top ten are Dow AgroSciences and DuPont Nutrition Science (now merged as DowDuPont), together holding 20 inventions in CRISPR-Cas9 applications in agriculture and animal biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/11/prweb15924785.htm|title=CRISPR Cas9 Genome Editing Market Worth $5.3 Billion by 2025|work=PRWeb|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Human germline modification ===

As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research to learn how they one day might apply CRISPR to human embryos, including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company [[OvaScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Antonio | last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc | journal = MIT Technology Review | date = March 5, 2015 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ | title = Engineering the Perfect Baby }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said "scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans" until the full implications "are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations".&lt;ref name="SCI-20150319"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D, Berg P, Botchan M, Carroll D, Charo RA, Church G, Corn JE, Daley GQ, Doudna JA, Fenner M, Greely HT, Jinek M, Martin GS, Penhoet E, Puck J, Sternberg SH, Weissman JS, Yamamoto KR | title = Biotechnology.

In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the [[DNA]] of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR to correct a [[mutation]] that causes [[beta thalassemia]], a lethal heritable disorder.&lt;ref name="LiangXu2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–72 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina  | name-list-format = vanc | title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had previously been rejected by both ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in part because of ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378 |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos |journal=Nature |year=2015 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=David |last2=Reardon |first2=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in [[reproductive medicine]].&lt;ref name=NatureNews/&gt; In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the [[CCR5]] gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601235/chinese-researchers-experiment-with-making-hiv-proof-embryos/|title=Chinese Researchers Experiment with Making HIV-Proof Embryos|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cells]], where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[Social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.&lt;ref name="National Academy of Science"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | accessdate = 3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui]] announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier.  He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV.  The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies - STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===

Policy regulations for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryos]] by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom. Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated by the USDA under Section 340.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/downloads/reg_loi/15-321-01_air_response_signed.pdf|title=Re: Request to confirm &lt;!-- too lazy to type --&gt;|author=USDA|authorlink=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation.&lt;ref name="Waltz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waltz E | title = Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7599 | pages = 293 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27111611 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19754 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..293W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–9 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the [[FDA]] has begun issuing new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ "The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers"], Kristen V. Brown. Gizmodo. February 1, 2017. Retrieved 5 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carjacking'''  is a [[robbery]] in which the item taken over is a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"&gt;Michael Cherbonneau, "Carjacking," in ''Encyclopedia of Social Problems'', Vol. 1 (SAGE, 2008: ed. Vincent N. Parrillo), pp. 110-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is a [[portmanteau]] of [[automobile|car]] and hijacking. The term was coined by EJ Mitchell, an editor with ''[[The Detroit News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pulitzer, Lisa Beth. Crime On Deadline. New York, New York: Boulevard Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ''The News'' first used the term in a 1991 report on the murder of Ruth Wahl, a 22-year-old Detroit drugstore cashier who was killed when she would not surrender her [[Suzuki Sidekick]], and in an investigative report examining the rash of what Detroit Police call "robbery armed unlawful driving away an automobile" [in dispatch slang shortened to R.A.-YOU-Da] plaguing Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detroit News'', August 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''[[British Journal of Criminology]]'' in 2003 found that "for all of the media attention it has received in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, carjacking remains an under-researched and poorly understood crime."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs, Volkan Topalli &amp; Richard Wright, "Carjacking, Streetlife and Offender Motivation" in ''The British Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 43, Issue 4 (October 2003), pp. 673–688.&lt;/ref&gt; The study authors conducted [[semi-structured interview]]s with 28 active carjackers in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and based on these interviews concluded that "the decision to commit a carjacking stems most directly from a situated interaction between particular sorts of perceived opportunities and particular sorts of perceived needs and desires, this decision is activated, mediated, and shaped by participation in urban street culture."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'' in 2013 noted that "carjacking requires offenders to neutralize victims who are inherently mobile and who can use their vehicles as both weapons and shields." The study noted that carjackers use fear to compel compliance from victims.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2013"&gt;Bruce Jacobs, "The Manipulation of Fear in Carjacking" in ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'', Vol. 42, Issue 5 (February 2013), pp. 523-544.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] conceptualized carjackings as falling into four types based on method and motive: organized and instrumental, organized and acquisitive, opportunistic and instrumental, and opportunistic and acquisitive. An example of an ''organized and instrumental'' carjacking is a planned carjacking with a weapon to use the vehicle for [[ram-raiding|ram an ATM to steal cash]]. An example of an ''organized and acquisitive'' carjacking is a planned carjacking to sell the vehicle in a known market. An example of an ''opportunistic and instrumental'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to sell "vehicle/parts with no market in mind." An example of an ''opportunistic and acquisitive'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]].&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"&gt;Lisa Jane Young and Maria Borzycki, [http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/341-360/tandi351.html Carjacking in Australia: recording issues and future directions], ''Trends &amp; Issues in Crime &amp; Criminal Justice'', No. 351, [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 qualitative study published in ''[[Justice Quarterly]]'' examined auto theft and carjacking in the context of "sanction threats" that promoted fear and influenced "crime preferences" among criminals, thereby redirecting ("channeling") criminal activity. The study showed that "auto thieves are reluctant to embrace the violence of carjacking due to concerns over sanction threat severity they attributed to carjacking—both formal (higher sentences) and informal (victim resistance and retaliation). Meanwhile, the carjackers are reticent to enact auto theft because of the more uncertain and putatively greater risk of being surprised by victims, a fear that appears to overcome the enhanced long-term formal penalty of taking a vehicle by force."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs &amp; Michael Cherbonneau, "Perceived Sanction Threats and Projective Risk Sensitivity: Auto Theft, Carjacking, and the Channeling Effect," ''Justice Quarterly'' (March 2017), pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and response==
Common carjacking ruses include: (1) [[Traffic collision|bumping the victim's vehicle]] from behind, and taking the car when the victim gets out of the vehicle to assess damage and exchange information; (2) staging a fake car accident, sometimes with injuries, and stealing the vehicle of a passerby who stops to assist; (3) flashing lights or waving to get the victim's attention, indicating that there is a problem with the victim's car, and then taking the car once the victim pulls over; and (4) following a victim home, blocking the victim's car in a driveway or in front of a gate.&lt;ref name="Diplo"&gt;''[https://www.state.gov/m/ds/rls/rpt/19782.htm Carjacking&amp;mdash;Don't be a Victim]'', U.S. Department of State, [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]] (August 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police department]]s, security agencies, and [[Auto insurance|auto insurers]] have published lists of strategies for preventing and responding to carjackings.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"&gt;[http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/06/nopd_crime_prevention_how_to_a.html NOPD crime prevention: How to avoid being carjacked], [[New Orleans Police Department]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="III"&gt;[http://www.iii.org/article/preventing-carjacking-theft Preventing Carjacking / Theft], [[Insurance Information Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common recommendations include:
* Staying alert and being aware of one's surroundings&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Parking in well-lighted areas&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt;
* Keeping [[vehicle door]]s locked and [[car windows|windows]] up&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Avoiding unfamiliar or high-crime areas&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Alerting police as soon as safely possible following a carjacking&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Avoid isolated and less-well-trafficked parking lots, ATMs, pay phones, etc.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt;
* When stopped in traffic, keeping some distance between the vehicle in front, so one can pull away easily if necessary.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* If confronted, it is often safer to give up the vehicle and avoid resisting&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;

==Incidents by country==

===South Africa===
[[File:Hi-jacking hot spot.JPG|thumb|right|A sign in South Africa warning drivers]]
Carjacking is a significant problem in [[South Africa]], where it is called ''hijacking''.&lt;ref name="Caroll"&gt;Rory Caroll, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/02/film.oscars2006 Carjacking: the everyday ordeal testing South Africa], ''Guardian'' (March 2, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa is thought to have the highest carjacking rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Davis, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1375/acri.36.2.173 Carjacking — Insights from South Africa to a New Crime Problem], '' Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 35, Issue 2, 2003, pp. 173-191.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 16,000 reported carjackings in 1998.&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; The figures dropped to 12,434 reported carjackings in 2005,&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; and continued to drop until the 2011-12, when the number of carjackings was 9,475, a record low.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"&gt;Erin Conway-Smith, [https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-27/carjackings-are-rise-again-south-africa Carjackings are on the rise again in South Africa], ''GlobalPost'' (May 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, however, carjackings increased as part of an overall increase in violent organized crime, which the [[Institute for Security Studies]] attributed to poor police leadership. There were 11,221 reported carjackings in 2014. More than half of all carjackings in South Africa occurred in [[Gauteng]] province, which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

The carjacking issue in South Africa was depicted in the film ''[[Tsotsi]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several new, unconventional [[anti-hijack system|anti-carjacking systems]] designed to harm the attacker were developed and marketed in South Africa, where carjacking had become endemic. Among these was the now defunct [[Blaster (flamethrower)|Blaster]], a small [[flame-thrower]] that could be mounted to the underside of a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/|publisher=CNN|title=Flamethrower now an option on S. African cars|date=December 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 ====

{{See also|Murder of Pam Basu}}

In 1992, Congress, in the aftermath of a spate of violent carjackings (including some in which the victims were murdered), passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA), the first federal carjacking law, making it a [[federal crime]] (punishable by 15 years to [[life imprisonment]]) to use a firearm to steal "through force or violence or intimidation" a motor vehicle that had been shipped through [[interstate commerce]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt; The 1992 Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992.&lt;ref name="Folks"&gt;Mike Folks, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-01-17/news/9401170203_1_federal-carjacking-law-carjacking-cases-pamela-basu Carjacking Law Getting Little Use: Few Prosecutions Occur Despite Increase in Number of Cases], ''Sun-Sentinel'' (January 17, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2119 18 U.S.C. § 2119].&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small number of federal prosecutions were imposed for carjacking the year after the act was enacted, in part because many federal carjacking cases were turned over to state prosecutions because they do not meet [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] criteria.&lt;ref name="Folks"/&gt; The Federal Death Penalty Act, part of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], an omnibus crime bill, made sixty new federal crimes punishable by the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]]; among these were the killing of a victim in the commission of carjacking.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy D'Olivio, "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act" in ''Encyclopedia of Law Enforcement'' (Sage, 2004: eds. Larry E. Sullivan et al.), p. 896.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1993, articles about carjackings appeared at the rate of more than one a week in newspapers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Carjacking Reports Increase In Area -- Police Told Of Five Incidents Over Thanksgiving Holiday." ''Seattle Times'', Saturday, November 26, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The November 29, 1992, killing of two [[Osceola County, Florida]] men by carjackers using a stolen [[9×19mm Parabellum|9 mm]] pistol resulted in the first federal prosecution of a fatal carjacking.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pierson Curtis, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-01-30/news/9401300447_1_polk-county-bigger-gun-carjacking Youths Steal Guns To Steal Youths' Lives; The Gun Used In The Nation's First Federal Carjacking Case Was Bought Legally, Then Stolen], ''Orlando Sentinel'', January 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence and statistical analysis====
According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice's [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1993 to 2002, some 38,000 carjackings occurred annually.&lt;ref name="Klaus"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/c02.pdf National Crime Victimization Survey, Carjacking, 1993-2002], U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survey, over this time period men were more often victims than women, blacks more than whites, and Hispanics more than non-Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; 56% of carjackers were identified by victims as black, 21% white, 16% Asian or Native American, and 7% mixed race or unknown.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; Some 93% of carjackings occurred in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin S. Wright, Motor Vehicle Theft, in ''Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America'' (Sage 2010: ed. Jeffrey Ian Ross), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. A weapon was used in 74% of carjacking victimization: firearms in 45%, knives in 11%, and other weapons in 18%. Victims were injured in about 32% of completed carjackings and about 17% of attempted carjackings. Serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, or internal injuries occurred in about 9% of incidents. About 14 murders a year involved car theft, but not all of these were carjackings. There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. Some 68% of carjackings occurred at nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Some 98% of completed carjackings and 77% of attempted carjackings were reported to police. About 44% of carjacking incidents occurred in an open area (e.g., on the street or near public transportation) while 24% occurred in parking lots or garages or near commercial places (e.g., stores, gas stations, office buildings, restaurants/bars).&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;

According to the NCVS, from 1992 and 1996, about 49,000 completed or attempted nonfatal carjackings took place each year in the United States. The carjacking was successful in about half of incidents. Data on fatal carjackings are not available; "about 27 homicides by strangers each year involved automobile theft," but not all of these were carjackings.&lt;ref name="Klaus2"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cus96.pdf Carjackings in the United States, 1992-96], .S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In particular cities====
Carjackings were common in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the 1990s, and a wave of carjackings took place again in 2010.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/nyregion/22carjack.html After Dozens of Arrests, Newark Carjackings Decline Sharply], March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 288 carjackings in the city in 2010 (a 70% increase from the previous year), and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] (which includes Newark) had 69 in December 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The Associated Press reported that "unlike previous carjackings, in which thieves would strip vehicles for parts or sell them in other states, the recent wave perplexed law enforcement officials because almost all appeared to be done by thrill-seeking young men who would steal the cars for a few hours, drive them around and then abandon them."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; After federal, state, and law enforcement agencies formed a task force, 42 suspects were charged, and carjackings dropped dramatically.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; However, national media attention on carjackings in Essex County returned in December 2013, when a [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] lawyer was murdered at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]], while defending his wife from four assailants,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Santora &amp; Annie Correaldec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/nyregion/carjacking-victim-at-new-jersey-mall-dies.html Man Dies in Carjacking at Short Hills Mall; 2 Suspects Are Sought], ''New York Times'', December 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwirtzdec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/nyregion/4-suspects-held-in-deadly-carjacking-at-new-jersey-mall.html 4 Suspects Held in Fatal Carjacking at Mall], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/22/us/ap-us-shooting-nj-mall.html 4 Men Plead Not Guilty in Deadly Mall Carjacking], October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who were all later convicted of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Jongsma, [http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/crime/2017/10/10/two-men-plead-guilty-roles-fatal-short-hills-mall-carjacking/751683001/ Two men plead guilty to roles in fatal Short Hills mall carjacking], ''NorthJersey.com'' (October 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The major U.S. city with the highest rates of carjacking is [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"&gt;Tresa Baldas, [http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2014/11/30/detroit-police-fight-carjacking-crime/19671313/ Carjackers losing grip on Detroit, but strike daily], ''Detroit Free Press'' (November 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Detroit had 1,231 carjackings, more than three a day.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; By 2013, that number had fallen to 701, but this was still the highest known number of carjackings for any major city in the country.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  The significant decrease in carjackings was credited to a coordinated effort by the [[Detroit Police Department]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan|local federal prosecutor's office]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  Serial carjackers were targeted for federal prosecutions and longer sentences, and in 2009 the Detroit Police Department centralized all carjacking investigations and developed a suspect profiling system.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Through mid-November 2014, Detroit had 486 carjackings, down 31% from the year before, but this was still three times more than the carjackings experienced by [[New York City]] (which has ten times Detroit's population) in all of 2013.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Even James Craig, [[chief of police]] of the [[Detroit Police Department]], was the victim of an attempted carjacking while he was in his [[police cruiser]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;

A 2017 study used "Risk Terrain Modeling" analysis to identify spatial indicators of carjacking risk in Detroit. The analysis identified six factors that "were influential in the best fitting model: proximity to service stations; convenience/grocery/[[liquor store]]s; bus stops; residential and commercial demolitions; and areas with high concentrations of drug arrests and restaurants." The study found that certain locations in Detroit "had an expected rate of carjacking that was 278 times higher than other locations."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Michelle Lersch, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235217302891 Risky places: An analysis of carjackings in Detroit], ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', Vol. 52 (September 2017), pp. 34-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====State law====
Some states have a specific carjacking statute. Other states do not have a specific carjacking law, and prosecute carjackers under the general robbery statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/print/cj/fslautotheftpptchart.pdf Auto Theft &amp; Carjacking State Statutes], National Conference of State Legislators (last accessed November 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of some states, such as [[Louisiana]], explicitly lists a killing in the course of defending oneself against forcible entry of an occupied motor vehicle as a [[justifiable homicide]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/14/news/mn-22319 Louisiana Drivers Given License to Kill] (August 14, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Michelle Gerlin, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=law_urbanlaw Louisiana's New "Kill the Carjacker" Statute: Self-Defense or Instant Injustice?], 55 Wash. U. J. Urb. &amp; Contemp. L. 10, (January 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Carjacking is an uncommon crime in Britain, making up about 1% of all vehicle thefts.&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

===Australia===
Australia does not specifically record the number of carjackings; such crimes are variously recorded as assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and some combination. However, a 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], analyzing police and insurance records, suggested that fewer than 300 carjackings occur annually in Australia (about 0.5% of all theft incidents in the country).&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper noted that the low incidence of carjacking compared to the United States is attributable to the low overall of firearm-related crime overall in Australia and  the fact that the "broader socioeconomic picture of Australian society is one of relative good health in terms of wealth distribution and social cohesion" providing little motivation for victimization that is "both personal and violent."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper notes that although carjacking was rare, isolated hot spots do arise occasionally, and that since the late 1990s, "[Sydney]] has experienced a number of carjacking clusters ... each lasting around three to six months and occurring in different locations including the eastern suburbs, the inner city and the south-west."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Coin-operated-locker babies''' or coin locker babies are infants left in public lockers, occurring primarily in [[Japan]] and [[China]]. The presumption is that such lockers are regularly checked by attendants and the infant will be found quickly; however, many children are found dead.  Between 1980 and 1990, there were 191 reported cases of infants that died in coin-operated lockers, which represents about six percent of all [[infanticide]]s during that period. In recent years, [[Osaka]]'s government organized a group specifically designed to deal with the detection and protection of abused and neglected children. In 1993, they published a manual on how to deal with child abuse, but the Japanese judicial administration still uses old laws for abuse cases. The development of new laws is occurring in parts of the country now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Kouno | first = Akihisa |author2=Charles F.

==Circumstances==
Barbara Precht was originally from the wealthy Hess family in Cincinnati; her father was the head of the local bar association and her uncle was a judge.&lt;ref name=mm/&gt; She married her husband, James Precht, who was employed as a school supervisor, and had two daughters while living in [[Indian Hill, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixon|first1=Deb|title=New Clues about 'Pearl Lady's' Husband|url=http://www.local12.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/new-clues-pearl-ladys-husband-20609.shtml|accessdate=20 November 2014|work=WKRC Cincinnati|agency=CBS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141119034054/http://www.local12.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/new-clues-pearl-ladys-husband-20609.shtml|archivedate=19 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james/&gt; One of her daughters recalled hearing individuals, presumably intruders, arguing with her parents one night and believed that they possibly were armed.&lt;ref name=mm/&gt; This recollection was later confirmed by James after his arrest.&lt;ref name=what&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molski|first1=Henry|title=What happened to the 'Pearl Lady'?|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2014/11/14/husband-of-pearl-lady-arrested/19014933/|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=Cincinnati.com|publisher=Gannett|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair decided to flee Ohio in 1983 to California, where they lived under aliases.&lt;ref name=what/&gt; They eventually put their children up for adoption, likely for their protection and so that they would have "better lives".&lt;ref name=hb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

==Discovery==
Barbara Precht's body was pulled from the [[Ohio River]] on 29 November 2006. She was found wearing makeup and jewelry, including two necklaces of [[pearl]]-like beads that led to her nickname.&lt;ref name=mm/&gt;&lt;ref name=network/&gt; She wore a black blouse and skirt, white socks, gray shoes, and [[pantyhose|tan nylon pantyhose]].&lt;ref name=network/&gt; After an [[autopsy]], it was concluded that she had been deceased for approximately two days; no suspicious signs were noted.&lt;ref name=network/&gt; The then-unidentified woman had suffered from [[arthritis]] in various parts of her body and had a fair [[complexion]] with [[hazel eyes]].

{{Dormancy}}
'''Diapause''', when referencing animal dormancy, is the delay in development in response to regularly and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, p 403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tauber"&gt;Tauber, M.J., Tauber, C.A., Masaki, S. (1986) ''Seasonal Adaptations of Insects''. Oxford University Press, 414 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a [[physiological]] state of [[dormancy]] with very specific initiating and inhibiting conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought, or reduced food availability. Diapause is most often observed in [[arthropod]]s, especially [[insect]]s, and in the [[embryo]]s of many of the [[oviparity|oviparous]] [[species]] of fish in the order [[Cyprinodontiformes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9254916 |title=A molecular phylogeny for aplocheiloid fishes (Atherinomorpha, Cyprinodontiformes): the role of vicariance and the origins of annualism |author=Glen E. Collier |author2=William J. Murphy |date= August 1997 |quote=Annual aplocheiloid killifish embryos possess a rare ability among vertebrates to enter stages of developmental arrest (diapause) when subjected to adverse environmental conditions. |volume=14 |issue=8 |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |pages=790–9 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the [[pupae]] and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult [[monarch butterfly]], ''Danaus plexippus''. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

==Phases of insect diapause==
Diapause in insects is a dynamic process consisting of several distinct phases. While diapause varies considerably from one [[taxon]] of insects to another, these phases can be characterized by particular sets of metabolic processes and responsiveness of the insect to certain environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V |year= 2006 |title= Eco-physiological phases of insect diapause |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 52 |issue= |pages= 113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.09.008 |pmid=16332347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diapause can occur during any stage of development in arthropods, but each species exhibits diapause in specific phases of development. Reduced oxygen consumption is typical as is reduced movement and feeding.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Polistes exclamans]]'' only the queen is said to be able to undergo diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bohm |first1= |year= 1972 |title= Effects of environment and juvenile hormone on ovaries of the wasp, Polistes metricus |url= |journal= Insect Physiology |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |pages= 1875–1883 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1910(72)90158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of diapause periods===
The sensitive stage is the period when stimulus must occur to trigger diapause in the organism. Examples of sensitive stage/diapause periods in various insects:&lt;ref name=Chapman404&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, p 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induction===
The induction phase occurs at a genetically predetermined stage of life, and occurs well in advance of the environmental stress.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This sensitive stage may occur within the lifetime of the diapausing individual, or in preceding generations, particularly in egg diapause.&lt;ref name="Huffaker"&gt;Huffaker, C.B. and Gutierrez, A.P., Eds. 1999. Ecological Entomology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, insects are responsive to external cues called token stimuli, which trigger the switch from direct development pathways to diapause pathways. Token stimuli can consist of changes in [[photoperiod]], [[thermoperiod]], or [[allelochemicals]] from food plants. These stimuli are not in themselves favourable or unfavourable to development, but they herald an impending change in environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt;

===Preparation===
The preparation phase usually follows the induction phase, though insects may go directly from induction to initiation without a preparation phase.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; During this phase, insects accumulate and store molecules such as [[lipids]], [[proteins]], and [[carbohydrates]]. These molecules are used to maintain the insect throughout diapause and to provide fuel for development following diapause termination. Composition of the [[cuticle]] may be altered by changing [[hydrocarbon]] composition and by adding [[lipids]] to reduce water loss, making the organism resistant to desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= HEGDEKAR |first1= B. M. |year= 1979 |title= Epicuticular Wax Secretion in Diapause and Non-diapause Pupae of the Bertha Army worm |url= |journal= Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume= 72 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diapausing [[pupa]]ria of the [[flesh fly]], ''Sarcophaga crassipalpis'', increase the amount of cuticular [[hydrocarbons]] lining the puparium, effectively reducing the ability of water to cross the cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Dennis |first3= M.W. |last4= Kolattukudey |first4= P.E. |year= 1992 |title= Enhancement of diapausing flesh fly puparia with additional hydrocarbons and evidence for alkane biosynthesis by a decarbonylation mechanism |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume= 22 |issue= 3 |pages= 237–243 |doi=10.1016/0965-1748(92)90060-r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation===
[[Photoperiod]] is the most important stimulus initiating diapause.&lt;ref name=Chapman404/&gt; The initiation phase begins when morphological development ceases.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In some cases, this change may be very distinct and can involve [[ecdysis|moulting]] into a specific diapause stage, or be accompanied by color change. [[Enzyme|Enzymatic]] changes may take place in preparation for [[cold hardening]]. For example, only diapausing adults of the fire bug, ''Pyrrhocoris apterus'', have the enzymatic complement that allows them to accumulate [[polyol|polyhydric alcohols]], molecules that help to lower their freezing points and thus avoid freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V. |last2= Tollarova |first2= M. |last3= Sula |first3= J. |year= 2004 |title= Adjustments of the enzymatic complement for polyol biosynthesis and accumulation in diapausing cold-acclimated adults of [[Pyrrhocoris apterus]] |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 50 |issue= |pages= 303–313 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects may also undergo behavioural changes and begin to aggregate, [[insect migration|migrate]], or search for suitable [[overwinter]]ing sites.[[File:Angangueo monarchs.jpg|thumb|Overwintering [[monarch butterflies]] in diapause clustering on [[oyamel]] trees. One tree is completely covered in butterflies. These butterflies were located on a preserve outside of [[Angangueo]], [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]]]]

===Maintenance===
During the maintenance phase, insects experience lowered [[metabolism]] and developmental arrest is maintained.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; Sensitivity to certain stimuli which act to prevent termination of diapause, such as [[photoperiod]] and [[temperature]], is increased. At this stage, insects are unresponsive to changes in the [[natural environment|environment]] that will eventually trigger the end of diapause, but they grow more sensitive to these stimuli as time progresses.

===Termination===
In insects that undergo obligate diapause, termination may occur spontaneously, without any external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In facultative diapausers, token [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] must occur to terminate diapause. These [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] may include chilling, freezing, or contact with [[water]], depending on the environmental conditions being avoided. These stimuli are important in preventing the insect from terminating diapause too soon, for instance in response to warm [[weather]] in late [[fall]]. In the [[Edith's checkerspot]] butterfly, individuals must receive enough sunlight in order to terminate the diapause stage and become a fully grown butterfly.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Stuart B. |last2=White |first2=Raymond R. |last3=Murphy |first3=Dennis D. |last4=Ehrlich |first4=Paul R. |title=Growth and Dispersal of Larvae of Checkerspot Butterfly Euphydryas editha |journal=Oikos |date=October 1987 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=161–166 |doi=10.2307/3565996 |jstor=3565996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termination may occur at the height of unfavourable conditions, such as in the middle of winter. Over time, depth of diapause slowly decreases until direct development can resume, if conditions are favourable.

===Post-diapause quiescence===
Diapause frequently ends prior to the end of unfavourable conditions and is followed by a state of [[wikt:quiescence|quiescence]] from which the insect can arouse and begin direct development, should conditions change to become more favourable.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This allows the insect to continue to withstand harsh conditions while being ready to take advantage of good conditions as rapidly as possible.

==Regulation==
Diapause in insects is regulated at several levels. Environmental stimuli interact with genetic pre-programming to affect [[neuron]]al signalling, [[endocrine]] pathways, and, eventually, metabolic and enzymatic changes.

===Environmental===
Environmental regulators of diapause generally display a characteristic [[season|seasonal pattern]]. In [[temperate]] regions, photoperiod is the most reliable cues of seasonal change.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Depending on the season in which diapause occurs, either short or long days can act as token stimuli. Insects may also respond to changing day length as well as relative day length. Temperature may also act as a regulating factor, either by inducing diapause or, more commonly, by modifying the response of the insect to photoperiod.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Insects may respond to thermoperiod, the daily fluctuations of warm and cold that correspond with night and day, as well as to absolute or cumulative temperature. This is has been observed in many moth species including the [[indian mealmoth]], where individuals diapause in different developmental stages due to environmental temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tzanakakis|first=M. E.|date=1959-11-01|title=An ecological study of the Indian-meal mothPlodia interpunctella(Hübner) with emphasis on diapause|url=http://hilgardia.ucanr.edu/Abstract/?a=hilg.v29n05p205|journal=Hilgardia|language=English|volume=29|issue=5|pages=205–246|doi=10.3733/hilg.v29n05p205|issn=0073-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food availability and quality may also help regulate diapause. In the [[desert locust]], ''Schistocerca gregaria'', a plant [[hormone]] called [[gibberellin]] stimulates [[reproduction|reproductive]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ellis |first1= P.E. |last2= Carlisle |first2= D.B. |last3= Osborne |first3= D.J. |year= 1965 |title= Desert locusts: sexual maturation delayed by feeding on senescent vegetation |url= |journal= Science |volume= 149 |issue= 3683 |pages= 546–547 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.546 |pmid=17843190}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dry season, when their food plants are in [[senescence]] and lacking gibberellin, the locusts remain immature and their reproductive tracts do not develop.

===Neuroendocrine===
The [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] system of insects consists primarily of neurosecretory cells in the [[brain]], the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata and the prothoracic glands.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt; There are several key [[hormone]]s involved in the regulation of diapause: [[juvenile hormone]] (JH), diapause hormone (DH), and [[prothoracicotropic hormone|prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)]].&lt;ref name="Denlinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 2002 |title= Regulation of diapause |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 47 |issue= |pages= 93–122 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce [[ecdysteroids]] that are required to promote development.&lt;ref name="Denlinger" /&gt; Larval and pupal diapauses are often regulated by an interruption of this connection, either by preventing release of prothoracicotropic hormone from the brain or by failure of the prothoracic glands to respond to prothoracicotropic hormone.

The corpora allata is responsible for the production of [[juvenile hormone]] (JH). In the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'', clusters of [[neurons]] on the [[protocerebrum]] called the [[pars lateralis]] maintain reproductive diapause by inhibiting JH production by the [[corpora allata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shimokawa |first1= K. |last2= Numata |first2= H. |last3= Shiga |first3= S. |year= 2008 |title= [[Neurons]] important for the [[photoperiod]]ic control of diapause in the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'' |url= |journal= Journal of Comparative Physiology |volume= 194 |issue= |pages= 751–762 |doi=10.1007/s00359-008-0346-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult diapause is often associated with the absence of JH, while larval diapause is often associated with its presence.

In adults, absence of JH causes degeneration of flight [[muscles]] and [[atrophy]] or cessation of development of reproductive tissues, and halts mating behaviour. The presence of JH in larvae may prevent moulting to the next larval [[instar]], though successive stationary moults may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yin |first1= C.M. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1979 |title= Diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'': further evidence showing juvenile hormone to be the regulator |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 25 |issue= |pages= 513–523 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(79)80010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the corn borer, ''Diatraea gradiosella'', JH is required for the accumulation by the fat body of a storage [[protein]] that is associated with diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brown |first1= J.J. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1978 |title= Juvenile hormone and a protein associated with the larval diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'' |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry |volume= 8 |issue= |pages= 359–397 |doi=10.1016/0020-1790(78)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diapause hormone regulates [[embryo]]nic diapause in the eggs of the [[silkworm]] moth, ''Bombyx mori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Horie |first1= Y. |last2= Kanda |first2= T. |last3= Mochida |first3= Y. |year= 2000 |title= Sorbitol as an arrester of embryonic development in diapausing eggs of the silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 46 |issue= |pages= 1009–1016 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(99)00212-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH is released from the [[subesophageal ganglion]] of the mother and triggers [[trehalase]] production by the [[ovaries]]. This generates high levels of [[glycogen]] in the [[egg (biology)|eggs]], which is converted into the polyhydric alcohols [[glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]]. [[Sorbitol]] directly inhibits the development of the embryos. [[Glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]] are reconverted into [[glycogen]] at the termination of diapause.

==Tropical diapause==
Diapause in the [[tropics]] is often initiated in response to [[biotic component|biotic]] rather than [[abiotic component]]s.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 1986 |title= Dormancy in tropical insects |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 31 |issue= |pages= 239–264 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.31.010186.001323 |pmid=3510585}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, food in the form of [[vertebrate]] carcasses may be more abundant following dry seasons, or [[oviposition]] sites in the form of fallen [[trees]] may be more available following rainy seasons. Also, diapause may serve to synchronize mating seasons or reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.

Diapause in the tropics poses several challenges to insects that are not faced in [[temperate]] zones.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Insects must reduce their metabolism without the aid of cold temperatures and may be faced with increased water loss due to high temperatures. While cold temperatures inhibit the growth of [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]], diapausing tropical insects still have to deal with these [[pathogens]]. Also, [[predation|predator]]s and [[parasitism|parasites]] may still be abundant during the diapause period.

Aggregations are common among diapausing tropical insects, especially in the orders [[Coleoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], and [[Hemiptera]].&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Aggregations may be used as protection against [[predation]], since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus [[beetle]], ''Stenotarsus rotundus'', which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. [[Relative humidity]] is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Wolda |first3= H. |year= 1992 |title= Aggregation promotes water conservation during diapause in the tropical fungus beetle, ''Stenotarsus rotundus'' |url= |journal= Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume= 63 |issue= |pages= 203–205 |doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''draugr''' or '''draug''' ({{lang-non|draugr}}, plural {{lang|non|'''draugar'''}}; modern {{lang-is|draugur}}, {{lang-fo|dreygur}} and [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and {{lang-no|draug}}) is an undead creature from Norse mythology, also called  {{lang|non|'''aptrganga''' or '''aptrgangr'''}}, literally "again-walker" ({{lang-is|afturganga}}).

The word ''draugr'' can be traced to a [[Proto-Indo European]] stem ''*{{PIE|dʰrowgʰos}}'' "phantom", from ''*{{PIE|dʰrewgʰ-}}'' "deceive".&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first1=Edgar C. |last1=Polomé |first2=Douglas Q. |last2=Adams |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Spirit |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old Norse meaning of the word is a revenant. In Swedish, ''draug'' is a modern loan word from West Norse, as the native Swedish form ''drög'' has acquired the meaning of "a pale, ineffectual, and slow-minded person that drags himself along".&lt;ref name="JER102"&gt;Rietz, J. E. ''Svenskt dialektlexikon'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The will appears to be strong, strong enough to draw the ''hugr'' [animate will] back to one's body. These reanimated individuals were known as ''draugar''. However, though the dead might live again, they could also die again. ''Draugar'' die a "second death" as Chester Gould calls it, when their bodies decay, are burned, dismembered or otherwise destroyed.&lt;ref name=Remley&gt;{{cite book|last=Remley|first=Gregg A. Smith ; with a foreword by Paul G.|title=The function of the living dead in medieval Norse and Celtic literature : death and desire|date=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=9780773453531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draugar live in their graves, often guarding treasure buried with them in their burial mound. They are animated corpses with a corporeal body, unlike ghosts, with similar physical abilities as in life. Older literature makes clear distinctions between sea-draugar and land-draugar.

== Traits ==
Draugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. According to Gregg Smith, "The appearance of a ''draugr'' was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at."&lt;ref name=Remley /&gt; They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic mythology which appear to retain some semblance of intelligence. They exist to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who wronged them in life. The draugr's ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf of [[Eyrbyggja saga]] was "uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about him… swollen to the size of an ox," and his body was so heavy that it could not be raised without levers.&lt;ref name="PE187"&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GS115"&gt;''Grettirs Saga'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also noted for the ability to rise from the grave as wisps of smoke and "swim" through solid rock.&lt;ref name="MP103"&gt;Magnussen and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

In folklore, draugar slay their victims through various methods including crushing them with their enlarged forms, devouring their flesh, devouring them whole in their enlarged forms, indirectly killing them by driving them mad, and by drinking their blood. Animals feeding near the grave of a draugr might be driven mad by the creature's influence.&lt;ref name="BC81-93"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curran |first=Bob |authorlink= |title=Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures that Stalk the Night |publisher=Career Press |year=2005 |pages=81–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lK0iQcCUZqkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-56414-807-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also die from being driven mad. Thorolf, for example, caused birds to drop dead when they flew over his bowl barrow.

The draugr's victims were not limited to trespassers in its home. The roaming undead decimated livestock by running the animals to death either by riding them or pursuing them in some hideous, half-flayed form. Shepherds' duties kept them outdoors at night, and they were particular targets for the hunger and hatred of the undead:
{{quote|text=The oxen which had been used to haul Thorolf's body were ridden to death by demons, and every single beast that came near his grave went raving mad and howled itself to death. The shepherd at Hvamm often came racing home with Thorolf after him. One day that Fall neither sheep nor shepherd came back to the farm.&lt;ref name="PE115"&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Draugar are noted for having numerous magical abilities (referred to as ''trollskap'') resembling those of living witches and wizards, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future. &lt;ref name="HR163"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Hilda Roderick Ellis |authorlink=Hilda Ellis Davidson |title=The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1943 |page=163 |url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A draugr can change into a seal,&lt;ref name="PE165"&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LS80"&gt;''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; a great flayed bull, a grey horse with a broken back but no ears or tail, and a cat that would sit upon a sleeper's chest and grow steadily heavier until the victim suffocated.&lt;ref name="JS166"&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Jacqueline |authorlink= |title=Icelandic Folktales and Legends |publisher=University of California Press |year=1972 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HY-DCKd6UgUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-520-02116-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draugr Þráinn (Thrain) shape-shifted into a cat-like creature (''kattakyn'') in ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]'':
{{quote|text=Then Thrain turned himself into a [[troll]], and the barrow was filled with a horrible stench; and he stuck his claws into the back of Hromund's neck, tearing the flesh from his bones.&lt;ref name="KP68"&gt;Kershaw, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Draugar have the ability to enter into the dreams of the living,&lt;ref name="HR163"/&gt; and they will frequently leave a gift behind so that "the living person may be assured of the tangible nature of the visit".{{sfnp|Chadwick|1946|p=53}}  Draugar also have the ability to curse a victim, as shown in the [[Grettis saga]], where Grettir is cursed to be unable to become any stronger. Draugar also brought disease to a village and could create temporary darkness in daylight hours. They preferred to be active during the night, although it did not appear to be vulnerable to sunlight like some other revenants. Draugr can also kill people with bad luck.

A draugr's presence might be shown by a great light that glowed from the mound like [[foxfire]].&lt;ref name="FP36"&gt;Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This fire would form a barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead.&lt;ref name="HR161"&gt;Davidson, ''The Road to Hel'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The draugr could also move magically through the earth, swimming through solid stone as does Killer-Hrapp:

{{quote|text=Then Olaf tried to rush Hrapp, but Hrapp sank into the ground where he had been standing and that was the end of their encounter.&lt;ref name="MP103"/&gt;}}

Some draugar are immune to weapons, and only a hero has the strength and courage needed to stand up to so formidable an opponent. In legends, the hero would often have to wrestle the draugr back to his grave, thereby defeating him, since weapons would do no good. A good example of this is found in ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''. Iron could injure a draugr, as is the case with many supernatural creatures, although it would not be sufficient to stop it.&lt;ref name="JS107"&gt;Simpson, ''Icelandic Folktales and Legends'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the hero is required to dispose of the body in unconventional ways. The preferred method is to cut off the draugr's head, burn the body, and dump the ashes in the sea—the emphasis being on making absolutely sure that the draugr was dead and gone.&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ghosts.shtml |title=Viking Answer Lady Webpage - The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draugar were said to be either ''hel-blár'' ("death-blue") or ''nár-fölr'' ("corpse-pale").&lt;ref name="BC81-93"/&gt; The death-blue color was not actually grey but was a dark blue or maroon hue which covered the entire body. Glámr, the undead shepherd of ''Grettis saga'', was reported to be dark blue,&lt;ref name="FP72"&gt;Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laxdæla saga]] describes how bones were dug up belonging to a dead sorceress who had appeared in dreams, and they were "blue and evil looking."&lt;ref name="MP235"&gt;Magnusson and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resting place of the draugr was a tomb which they were able to leave during the night to visit the living. Such visits are supposed to be horrible events that often end in death for one or more of the living, which would then warrant the exhumation of the draugr by a hero.

The draugr's motivation was primarily jealousy and greed. Greed causes it to viciously attack any would-be grave robbers, but the draugr also expresses an innate jealousy of the living stemming from a longing for the things of life which it once had. They also exhibit an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, as shown in the encounter of Aran and Asmund, sword brothers who made an oath that, if one should die, the other would sit vigil with him for three days inside the burial mound. When Aran died, Asmund brought his own possessions into the barrow—banners, armor, hawk, hound, and horse—then set himself to wait the three days:

{{quote|text=During the first night, Aran got up from his chair and killed the hawk and hound and ate them. On the second night he got up again from his chair, and killed the horse and tore it into pieces; then he took great bites at the horse-flesh with his teeth, the blood streaming down from his mouth all the while he was eating…. The third night Asmund became very drowsy, and the first thing he knew, Aran had got him by the ears and torn them off.&lt;ref name="GSOMT99-101"&gt;''Gautrek's Saga and Other Medieval Tales'', pp. 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Creation of draugar ==
The main indication that a deceased person will become a draugr is that the corpse is not in a horizontal position but is found in an upright or sitting position, indicating that the dead might return.{{sfnp|Jakobsson|2011|p=296}} Any mean, nasty, or greedy person can become a draugr. As Ármann notes, "most medieval Icelandic ghosts are evil or marginal people. If not dissatisfied or evil, they are unpopular".{{sfnp|Jakobsson|2011|p=295}}

== Means of prevention ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Noerre Naeraa Kirke Runesten.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The Nørre Nærå Runestone is interpreted as having a "grave binding inscription" used to keep the deceased in its grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Stephen A. |authorlink = |title=Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2011 |pages=22–23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=shCXJLB6mDAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8122-4290-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally,{{where|date=October 2018}} a pair of open iron scissors was placed on the chest of the recently deceased, and straws or twigs might be hidden among their clothes. The big toes were tied together or needles were driven through the soles of the feet in order to keep the dead from being able to walk. Tradition also held that the coffin should be lifted and lowered in three different directions as it was carried from the house to confuse a possible draugr's sense of direction.

The most effective means of preventing the return of the dead was believed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a corpse door, a special door through which the corpse was carried feet-first with people surrounding it so that the corpse couldn't see where it was going. The door was then bricked up to prevent a return. It is speculated{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that this belief began in Denmark and spread throughout the Norse culture, founded on the idea that the dead could only leave through the way they entered.

In ''Eyrbyggja saga'', draugar are driven off by holding a "door-doom". One by one, they are summoned to the door-doom and given judgment and forced out of the home by this legal method. The home was then purified with holy water to ensure that they never came back.

== Similar creatures ==
A variation of the draugr is the ''[[haugbui]]'' (from Old Norse ''haugr''' "howe, barrow, tumulus") which was a mound-dweller, the dead body living on within its tomb. The notable difference between the two was that the haugbui is unable to leave its grave site and only attacks those who trespass upon their territory.&lt;ref name="BC81-93"/&gt;

The haugbui was rarely found far from its burial place and is a type of undead commonly found in Norse sagas. The creature is said to either swim alongside boats or sail around them in a partially submerged vessel, always on their own. In some accounts, witnesses portray them as shapeshifters who take on the appearance of seaweed or moss-covered stones on the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-76010.html The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==

===Icelandic Sagas===
One of the best-known draugar is '''Glámr''', who is defeated by the hero in ''[[Grettis saga]]''. After Glámr dies on Christmas Eve, "people became aware that Glámr was not resting in peace. He wrought such havoc that some people fainted at the sight of him, while others went out of their minds".{{sfnp|Scudder|2005}} After a mundane battle, Grettir eventually gets Glámr on his back. Just before Grettir kills him, Glámr curses Grettir because "Glámr was endowed with more evil force than most other ghosts",{{sfnp|Scudder|2005}} and thus he was able to speak and leave Grettir with his curse after his death.

A somewhat ambivalent, alternative view of the draugr is presented by the example of [[Gunnar Hámundarson]] in ''[[Njáls saga]]'': "It seemed as though the howe was agape, and that Gunnar had turned within the howe to look upwards at the moon. They thought that they saw four lights within the howe, but not a shadow to be seen. Then they saw that Gunnar was merry, with a joyful face."{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'', a shepherd is assaulted by a blue-black draugr. The shepherd's neck is broken during the ensuing scuffle. The shepherd rises the next night as a draugr.&lt;ref name="BC81-93"/&gt;

[[Image:Draug.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A "draug" from modern Scandinavian folklore&lt;ref name="JL2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13508/13508-h/13508-h.htm |title=Weird Tales from the Northern Seas |author=Housman, Laurence (illustrations); R. Nisbet Bain (1893 translation); Jonas Lie (original Danish) |year=1893 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard a ship, in sub-human form, wearing oilskins]]

In more recent [[Scandinavian folklore]], the draug (the modern spelling used in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) is often identified with the spirits of [[Sailor|mariner]]s [[Drowning|drowned]] at sea. The creature is said to possess a distinctly human form, with the exception that its head is composed entirely of [[seaweed]]. In other tellings, the draug is described as being a headless fisherman, dressed in [[oilskin]] and sailing in half a boat (the Norwegian municipality of [[Bø, Nordland]] has the half-boat in its coat-of-arms). This trait is common in the northernmost part of Norway, where life and culture was based on fishing more than anywhere else. The reason for this may be that the fishermen often drowned in great numbers, and the stories of restless dead coming in from sea were more common up north than anywhere else in the country.

A recorded legend from [[Trøndelag]] tells how a [[cadaver]] lying on a beach became the object of a quarrel between the two types of draug (headless and seaweed-headed). A similar source even tells of a third type, the ''gleip'', known to hitch themselves to sailors walking ashore and make them slip on the wet rocks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

But, though the draug usually presages death, there is an amusing account in [[Northern Norway]] of a northerner who managed to outwit him:

{{quote|text=It was [[Christmas Eve]], and Ola went down to his boathouse to get the [[keg]] of [[brandy]] he had bought for the holidays. When he got in, he noticed a draugr sitting on the keg, staring out to sea. Ola, with great presence of mind and great bravery (it might not be amiss to state that he already had done some drinking), tiptoed up behind the draugr and struck him sharply in the small of the back, so that he went flying out through the window, with sparks hissing around him as he hit the water. Ola knew he had no time to lose, so he set off at a great rate, running through the churchyard which lay between his home and the boathouse. As he ran, he cried, "Up, all you [[Christian]] [[Spirit|souls]], and help me!" Then he heard the sound of fighting between the ghosts and the draugr, who were battling each other with [[Coffin|coffin boards]] and bunches of seaweed. The next morning, when people came to church, the whole yard was strewn with coffin covers, boat boards, and seaweed. After the fight, which the ghosts won, the draugr never came back to that district.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}

===Literature===

The modern and popular connection between the draug and the sea can be traced back to authors like [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]] and Regine Nordmann, whose works include several books of fairy tales, as well as the drawings of [[Theodor Kittelsen]], who spent some years living in [[Svolvær]]. Up north, the tradition of sea-draugs is especially vivid.

[[Arne Garborg]] describes land-draugs coming [[Haugtussa|fresh from the graveyards]], and the term ''draug'' is even used of [[vampires]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The notion of draugs who live in the mountains is present in the poetic works of [[Henrik Ibsen]] (''[[Peer Gynt]]''), and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]]. The [[Nynorsk]] translation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' used the term for both [[Nazgûl]] and the dead men of [[Dunharrow]]. Tolkien's [[Barrow-Wights]] bear obvious similarity to, and were inspired by the haugbui.

The term ''draug'' has come to be used to describe any type{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} of [[revenant]] in Nordic folklore.

[[Image:NewtonsLawOfUniversalGravitation.svg|thumb|right|200px|The theory of ''entropic gravity'' abides by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] on Earth and at interplanetary distances but diverges from this classic nature at interstellar distances.]]

'''Entropic gravity''', also known as '''emergent gravity''', is a theory in modern physics that describes [[gravity]] as an ''[[entropic force]]''—a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to [[Quantum fluctuation|quantum-level]] disorder—and not a [[fundamental interaction]]. The theory, based on [[string theory]], [[black hole]] physics, and [[quantum information theory]], describes gravity as an ''emergent'' phenomenon that springs from the [[quantum entanglement]] of small bits of [[spacetime]] information. As such, entropic gravity is said to abide by the [[second law of thermodynamics]] under which the [[entropy]] of a physical system tends to increase over time.

At its simplest, the theory holds that when gravity becomes vanishingly weak—levels seen only at interstellar distances—it diverges from its classically understood nature and its strength begins to decay ''linearly with distance'' from a mass.

Entropic gravity provides the underlying framework to explain [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]], or MOND, which holds that at a [[gravitational acceleration]] threshold of approximately {{val|1.2e-10}} m/s², gravitational strength begins to vary ''inversely'' (linearly) with distance from a mass rather than the normal [[inverse-square law]] of the distance. This is an exceedingly low threshold, measuring only 12&amp;nbsp;trillionths [[Standard gravity|gravity’s strength at earth’s surface]]; an object dropped from a height of one meter would fall for 36 hours were earth’s gravity this weak. It is also 3,000 times less than exists at the point where {{nowrap|''[[Voyager 1]]''}} crossed our solar system’s [[Heliosphere#Heliopause|heliopause]] and entered interstellar space.

The theory claims to be consistent with both the macro-level observations of [[Newtonian gravity]] as well as Einstein's [[general relativity|theory of general relativity]] and its gravitational distortion of spacetime. Importantly, the theory also explains (without invoking the existence of [[dark matter]] and its accompanying math featuring new [[free parameter]]s that are tweaked to obtain the desired outcome) why [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation curves]] differ from the profile expected with visible matter.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The theory of entropic gravity posits that what has been interpreted as unobserved dark matter is the product of quantum effects that can be regarded as a form of ''positive [[dark energy]]'' that lifts the [[vacuum energy]] of space from its ground state value. A central tenet of the theory is that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal-volume law contribution to entropy that overtakes the area law of [[anti-de Sitter space]] precisely at
the [[Hubble volume|cosmological horizon]].

The theory has been controversial within the physics community but has sparked research and experiments to test its validity.

==Origin==
The thermodynamic description of gravity has a history that goes back at least to research on [[black hole thermodynamics]] by [[Jacob Bekenstein|Bekenstein]] and [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] in the mid-1970s. These studies suggest a deep connection between [[gravity]] and thermodynamics, which describes the behavior of heat. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] demonstrated that the [[Einstein field equations]] describing relativistic gravitation can be derived by combining general thermodynamic considerations with the [[equivalence principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobson |first=Theodore|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|date=4 April 1995|pages=1260–1263|issue=7|volume=75|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|pmid=10060248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other physicists, most notably [[Thanu Padmanabhan]], began to explore links between gravity and [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padmanabhan|first=Thanu|title=Thermodynamical Aspects of Gravity: New insights|year=2010|pages=6901|issue=4|volume=73|journal=Rep.

Phys. |arxiv=0911.5004|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/73/4/046901|bibcode=2010RPPh...73d6901P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Mok|first=H.M.|title=Further Explanation to the Cosmological Constant Problem by Discrete Space-time Through Modified Holographic Principle|eprint=physics/0408060|date=13 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erik Verlinde's theory==
In 2009, [[Erik Verlinde]] proposed a conceptual model that describes gravity as an entropic force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=van Calmthout|first=Martijn|title=Is Einstein een beetje achterhaald?|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article1326775.ece/Is_Einstein_een_beetje_achterhaald|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=de Volkskrant|date=12 December 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the "information associated with the positions of material bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.P. Verlinde |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2011)029 |journal=JHEP |title=On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton |bibcode = 2011JHEP...04..029V |arxiv = 1001.0785 |volume=2011|issue=4 |pages=29 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[holographic principle]]. It implies that gravity is not a [[fundamental interaction]], but an [[emergent phenomenon]] which arises from the statistical behavior of microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] encoded on a holographic screen.  The paper drew a variety of responses from the scientific community. [[Andrew Strominger]], a string theorist at Harvard said "Some people have said it can't be right, others that it's right and we already knew it — that it’s right and profound, right and trivial."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A Scientist Takes On Gravity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13gravity.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Verlinde presented the further development of his ideas in a contribution to the Strings 2011 conference, including an explanation for the origin of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.physics.uu.se/external/strings2011/presentations/5%20Friday/1220_Verlinde.pdf E. Verlinde, The Hidden Phase Space of our Universe], Strings 2011, Uppsala, 1 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verlinde's article also attracted a large amount of media exposure,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527443.800-the-entropy-force-a-new-direction-for-gravity.html?page=1 The entropy force: a new direction for gravity], [[New Scientist]], 20 January 2010, issue 2744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/01/gravity-is-an-entropic-form-of-holographic-information/ Gravity is an entropic form of holographic information], ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and led to immediate follow-up work in cosmology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1001.3237 |author1=Fu-Wen Shu |author2=Yungui Gong |title=Equipartition of energy and the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon |year=2011 |doi=10.1142/S0218271811018883 |volume=20 |issue=4 |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |pages=553–559|bibcode = 2011IJMPD..20..553S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rong-Gen Cai |author2=Li-Ming Cao |author3=Nobuyoshi Ohta |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.061501 |journal=Phys.

==Derivation of the law of gravitation==
The law of gravitation is derived from classical statistical mechanics applied to the [[holographic principle]], that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bits of binary information, encoded on a boundary to that region, a closed surface of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The information is evenly distributed on the surface with each bit requiring an area equal to &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called ''Planck area'', from which &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can thus be computed:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A}{\ell_\text{P}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck length]]. The Planck length is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P} = \sqrt\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. When substituted in the equation for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we find:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A c^3}{\hbar G}&lt;/math&gt;

The statistical [[equipartition theorem]] defines the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a system with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom in terms of its energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} N k_\text{B} T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. This is the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalent energy]] for a mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;E = Mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The effective temperature experienced due to a uniform acceleration in a [[vacuum state|vacuum field]] according to the [[Unruh effect]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is that acceleration, which for a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; would be attributed to a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; according to [[Newton's second law]] of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the holographic screen to be a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the surface area would be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

From algebraic substitution of these into the above relations,  one derives from first principles [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{2\pi c k_\text{B} T}{\hbar} = m \frac{4\pi c}{\hbar} \frac{E}{N} = m \frac{4\pi c^3}{\hbar} \frac{M}{N} = m 4\pi \frac{GM}{A} = G \frac{m M}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Criticism and experimental tests==

Entropic gravity, as proposed by Verlinde in his original article, reproduces the [[Einstein field equations]] and, in a Newtonian approximation, a 1/r potential for gravitational forces. Since its results do not differ from Newtonian gravity except in regions of extremely small gravitational fields, testing the theory with earth-based laboratory experiments doesn’t appear feasible. Spacecraft-based experiments performed at [[Lagrangian point]]s within our solar system would be expensive and challenging.

Even so, entropic gravity in its current form has been severely challenged on formal grounds. [[Matt Visser]] has shown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Conservative entropic forces|journal=JHEP|volume=1110|issue=10|pages=140|arxiv=1108.5240|year=2011|doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2011)140}}, to appear in JHEP&lt;/ref&gt; that the attempt to model conservative forces in the general Newtonian case (i.e. for arbitrary potentials and an unlimited number of discrete masses) leads to unphysical requirements for the required entropy and involves an unnatural number of temperature baths of differing temperatures. Visser concludes:
{{quote|There is no reasonable doubt concerning the physical reality of entropic forces, and no reasonable doubt that classical (and semi-classical) general relativity is closely related to thermodynamics [52–55]. Based on the work of Jacobson [1–6], [[Thanu Padmanabhan]] [7– 12], and others, there are also good reasons to suspect a thermodynamic interpretation of the fully relativistic Einstein equations might be possible. Whether the specific proposals of Verlinde [26] are anywhere near as fundamental is yet to be seen — the rather baroque construction needed to accurately reproduce n-body Newtonian gravity in a Verlinde-like setting certainly gives one pause.}}

For the derivation of Einstein's equations from an entropic gravity perspective, Tower Wang shows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Wang |first=Tower |title=Modified entropic gravity revisited |eprint=1211.5722|class=hep-th |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the inclusion of energy-momentum conservation and cosmological homogeneity and isotropy requirements severely restrict a wide class of potential modifications of entropic gravity, some of which have been used to generalize entropic gravity beyond the singular case of an entropic model of Einstein's equations. Wang asserts that:
{{quote|As indicated by our results, the modified entropic gravity models of form (2), if not killed, should live in a very narrow room to assure the energy-momentum conservation and to accommodate a homogeneous isotropic universe.}}

Cosmological observations using available technology can be used to test the theory. On the basis of lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, Nieuwenhuizen concludes that EG is strongly ruled out unless additional (dark) matter like eV neutrinos is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Zwicky already ruled out modified gravity theories without dark matter|first=Theodorus M.|last=Nieuwenhuizen |journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=65|issue=6–8|page=1600050|doi=10.1002/prop.201600050|arxiv=1610.01543|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from [[Leiden Observatory]] statistically observing the [[Gravitational lens|lensing effect of gravitational fields]] at large distances from the centers of more than 33,000 galaxies, found that those gravitational fields were consistent with Verlinde's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein’s gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using conventional gravitational theory, the fields implied by these observations (as well as from measured [[galaxy rotation curves]]) could only be ascribed to a particular distribution of [[dark matter]].

In June 2017, a study by [[Princeton University]] researcher Kris Pardo asserted that Verlinde's theory is inconsistent with the observed rotation velocities of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].&lt;ref name="QuantaMagazine2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Researchers Check Space-Time to See if It's Made of Quantum Bits | website=Quanta Magazine | date=2017-06-21 | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-check-space-time-to-see-if-its-made-of-quantum-bits-20170621/ | access-date=2017-08-11 | quote=Emergent gravity successfully predicts the rotation velocities of the smallest galaxies in the sample. But it predicts velocities far too low for the more massive galaxies, especially the ones full of gas clouds.

[[Sabine Hossenfelder]] argues that "one should interpret these studies with caution" because "approximations must be made to arrive at [the tested] equation[s]" and it's not yet clear that the approximations are themselves correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/02/28/is-dark-matter-about-to-be-killed-by-emergent-gravity/ |title=Recent Claims Invalid: Emergent Gravity Might Deliver A Universe Without Dark Matter |last1=Hossenfelder |first1=Sabine |date=28 February 2017 |website=forbes.com |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entropic gravity and quantum coherence===
Another criticism of entropic gravity is that entropic processes should, as critics argue, break [[quantum coherence]]. Experiments with ultra-cold neutrons in the gravitational field of Earth are claimed to show that neutrons lie on discrete levels exactly as predicted by the [[Schrödinger equation]] considering the gravitation to be a conservative potential field without any decoherent factors. Archil Kobakhidze argues that this result disproves entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobakhidze |first=Archil |title= Gravity is not an entropic force |eprint=1009.5414 |journal= Physical Review D |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luboš Motl]] gives explanations of this position in his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Why gravity can't be entropic|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2010/01/erik-verlinde-why-gravity-cant-be.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Once more: gravity is not an entropic force|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2011/08/once-more-gravity-is-not-entropic-force.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chaichian et al. suggest a potential loophole in the argument in weak gravitational fields such as those affecting Earth-bound experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4650.pdf On Gravity as an Entropic Force ArXiv 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumgartner is also renowned for the particularly dangerous nature of the stunts he has performed during his career. Baumgartner spent time in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian military]] where he practiced parachute jumping, including training to land on small target zones.

[[File:Felix Baumgartner-001.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Baumgartner in Straße der Sieger, Mariahilfer Street, [[Vienna]], Austria]]

Baumgartner also set the world record for the lowest [[BASE jumping|BASE]] jump ever, when he jumped {{convert|29|m}} from the hand of the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=esquire20100714&gt;

He became the first person to BASE jump from the completed [[Millau Viaduct]] in France on 27 June 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0406/S00225.htm Millau Viaduct]&lt;/ref&gt; and the first person to [[skydive]] onto, then BASE jump from, the [[Turning Torso]] building in [[Malmö]], Sweden, on 18 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/pr-jippo-kan-sluta-med-atal-1.682661 |title=Pr-jippo kan sluta med åtal |date=18 August 2006 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CsgEHKcv?url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/pr-jippo-kan-sluta-med-atal |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2007, he became the first person to jump from the 91st floor observation deck of the then-tallest completed building in the world, [[Taipei 101]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8U-z-SnbJU&amp;feature=related |title=Extreme Felix Baumgartner jumping off Taipei 101 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Bull Stratos===
{{Main|Red Bull Stratos}}
In January 2010, it was reported that Baumgartner was working with a team of scientists and sponsor Red Bull to attempt the highest sky-dive on record.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Choi |first= Charles Q |date= 22 January 2010 |title= 'Space diver' to attempt first supersonic freefall |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18427-space-diver-to-attempt-first-supersonic-freefall.html |work= [[New Scientist]] |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Test jumps====
On 15 March 2012, Baumgartner completed the first of 2 test jumps from {{convert|21818|m|ft}}. During the jump, he spent approximately 3 minutes and 43 seconds in free fall, reaching speeds of more than {{convert|580|km/h|mph|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="FAI_Vertical_Record"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The World Air Sports Federation (FAI)|title=Baumgartner breaks the Maximum Vertical Speed World Record|url=http://www.fai.org/news-of-records/36072-baumgartner-breaks-the-maximum-vertical-speed-world-record|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230092725/http://www.fai.org/news-of-records/36072-baumgartner-breaks-the-maximum-vertical-speed-world-record|archivedate=30 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; before opening his parachute. In total, the jump lasted approximately eight minutes and eight seconds and Baumgartner became the third person to safely parachute from a height of over {{convert|21.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0315/Skydiver-jumps-13.6-miles-on-path-to-world-s-highest-jump |title=Skydiver jumps 13.6 miles on path to world's highest jump |first=Marcia |last=Dunn |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/felix-baumgartner-s-jump-from-space-s-edge-watched-by-millions-1.4115479|title=Felix Baumgartner's jump from space's edge watched by millions|publisher=The Associated Press|date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2012, Baumgartner completed the second of two planned test jumps from {{convert|96640|ft|m|order=flip}}. It took Baumgartner about 90 minutes to reach the target altitude and his free fall was estimated to have lasted three minutes and 48 seconds before his parachutes were deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Marcia | last = Dunn | title = Skydiver Fearless Felix jumps from 19 miles up | date = 25 July 2012 |agency=Associated Press | url = http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCI_SUPERSONIC_SKYDIVER | accessdate =25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch was originally scheduled for 9 October 2012 but was aborted due to adverse weather conditions.

In 2014, Baumgartner decided to join Audi Motorsport to drive an [[Audi R8 LMS]] for the [[2014 24 Hours of Nurburgring|2014]] [[24 Hours of Nurburgring]] after racing [[Volkswagen Polo]]s in 2013. He underwent another intense physical and driver training session to prepare him for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/en/motorsports/stories/1331637560479/felix-baumgartner-to-race-at-n%C3%BCrburgring-24-hours|title=Felix Baumgartner to race at Nürburgring 24 Hours|work=redbull.com|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the team to a 9th place overall finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.audi-motorsport.info/v2/public/en/2014/press-release/single/id/9613 |title=Audi teams aim for third victory at Bathurst |date=2 December 2014 |publisher=Audi MotorsportInfo |accessdate=2 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003103227/https://www.audi-motorsport.info/v2/public/en/2014/press-release/single/id/9613 |archive-date=3 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In October 2012, when Baumgartner was asked in an interview with the Austrian newspaper ''[[Kleine Zeitung]]'' whether a political career was an option for his future life, he stated that the "example of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]" showed, that "you can't move anything in a democracy" and that he would opt for a "moderate dictatorship [...] led by experienced personalities coming from the private (sector of the) economy". He finally stated he "didn't want to get involved in politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Höfler |first= Klaus |date= 27 October 2012 |title= Baumgartner: "Wir würden eine gemäßigte Diktatur brauchen" |url= http://www.kleinezeitung.at/sport/extremsport/3995710/INTERVIEW_Baumgartner_Wir-wuerden-eine-gemaessigte-Diktatur-brauchen |work=Kleine Zeitung |accessdate=28 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 28 October 2012 |title= Daredevil skydiver Felix Baumgartner opts for 'moderate dictatorship' |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hedqNtFafT6OoZM2DlNAbg-loKyw?docId=CNG.f1b69071a71b5a3c203360758bd240fe.261 |work=AFP |accessdate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petridis 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Petridis |first=Alexis |date= 1 November 2012 |title= Space jumper Felix Baumgartner parachutes into politics |url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lostinshowbiz/2012/nov/01/space-jumper-felix-baumgartner-politics |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2012, Baumgartner was convicted of [[Battery (crime)|battery]] and was fined €1500 after slapping the face of a Greek truck driver, following a petty argument between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/bildung/erziehung/1433977/Felix-Baumgartner-und-die-gesunde-Ohrfeige Felix Baumgartner: Ohrfeige ist "angemessene Erziehungsmethode"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://salzburg.orf.at/news/stories/2557681/ Körperverletzung: Felix Baumgartner schuldig] orf.at, German. 6 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Baumgartner provoked a stir of critical news coverage in his home country after posting several critical remarks against refugees and recommending the Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000029853661/Jan-Boehmermann-will-Til-Schweiger-auf-Felix-Baumgartner-hetzen|title=Jan Böhmermann will Til Schweiger auf Felix Baumgartner hetzen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Baumgartner endorsed the presidential candidate of the right-wing populist [[Freedom Party of Austria]], [[Norbert Hofer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Stars-Society/Felix_Baumgartner_ruft_zur_Wahl_von_Hofer_auf-Eigentlich_klar-Story-506738|title=Felix Baumgartner ruft zur Wahl von Hofer auf|website=krone.at|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2016, Facebook deleted his fan page of 1.5 million fans. Baumgartner subsequently claimed that he must have become "too uncomfortable" for "political elites".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000041098486/Facebook-Seite-geloeschtFelix-Baumgartner-vermut-politische-Eliten-dahinter|title=Facebook-Seite gelöscht: Felix Baumgartner ortet "politische Eliten" dahinter|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Austrian authorities refused to grant sports tax breaks to Baumgartner, he moved to [[Arbon]], Switzerland, whereupon his house in Salzburg and his helicopter were seized.&lt;ref name=zeit/&gt;

Baumgartner dated ''Playboy'' German playmate of the century Gitta Saxx. Later he was engaged to Nicole Öttl, a model and former beauty queen (''Miss [[Lower Austria]] 2006''). They broke up in 2013.&lt;ref name=zeit&gt;{{cite news |title=Sein tiefster Fall |author= |url=http://www.zeit.de/2013/47/felix-baumgartner-steuerflucht-schweiz/komplettansicht |newspaper=Die Zeit |work= |date=14 November 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission conducted the first docking of two spacecraft in orbit, but suffered the first critical in-space system failure of a U.S. spacecraft which threatened the lives of the astronauts and required immediate abort of the mission. The crew was returned to Earth safely. The only other time this happened was on the flight of [[Apollo 13]].

It was the twelfth manned American flight and the twenty-second manned spaceflight of all time [including two [[X-15]] flights over {{convert|100|km|nmi|abbr=off|sp=us}}].  Command pilot [[Neil Armstrong]]'s flight marked the second time a U.S. [[civilian]] flew into space ([[Joseph Albert Walker]] became the first U.S. civilian on [[X-15 Flight 90]]&lt;ref name="Civilians in Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com Joseph A Walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Armstrong had resigned his commission in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] in 1960. The [[Soviet Union]] had launched the first civilian, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] (also the first woman), aboard [[Vostok 6]] on June 16, 1963.&lt;ref name="Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |title=Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423074712/http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |archivedate=2011-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Gemini VIII was planned to be a three-day mission. After being launched into an {{convert|87|by|146|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit, on the fourth revolution it was to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with an [[Agena target vehicle]], which had been earlier launched into a {{convert|161|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit. This was to be the first space docking in history.  Four separate dockings were planned.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}

During the first docking, Pilot David Scott was planned to perform an ambitious, two-hour-and-10-minute [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), which would have been the first since [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]'s June 1965 spacewalk on [[Gemini 4|Gemini IV]]. On a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tether for one and a half revolutions around the Earth, Scott would have retrieved a nuclear emulsion radiation experiment from the front of the Gemini's spacecraft adapter, then activate a [[micrometeoroid]] experiment on the Agena.  Then he was to move back to the Gemini and test a minimum-reaction power tool by loosening and tightening bolts on a work panel.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}

During the EVA, after Armstrong undocked from the Agena, Scott was to don and test an Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP) stored at the back of the spacecraft adapter. This was a backpack with a self-contained oxygen supply, extra [[Freon]] propellant for his Hand Held Maneuvering Unit, and a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} extension to his tether. He would practice several maneuvers in formation with the Gemini and Agena vehicles (separated at distances up to {{convert|60|ft|m}}, in concert with Armstrong in the Gemini.{{sfn|NASA|1966|pp=3, 18–19, 40–43}} Scott never got to perform this EVA, due to the aborting of the flight because of a critical in-flight emergency which occurred shortly after docking.

The flight also carried an additional three scientific, four technological, and one medical experiment.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=3}}

==Flight==

===Agena Target Vehicle===
Five months earlier, NASA had launched an [[Agena target vehicle|Agena Target Vehicle]] for [[Gemini 6]], but the [[Atlas-Agena]] launch failed when the Agena's engine exploded during orbital injection and the mission had to be rescheduled. This time, everything worked perfectly; the Agena put itself into a 298 kilometer circular [[orbit]] and oriented itself to the correct attitude for the docking. The Gemini spacecraft itself was launched into a 160 by 272 kilometer orbit by a modified [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] on March 16, 1966 (coincidentally the 40th anniversary of the launch of the world's first liquid-fueled rocket by Dr. [[Robert H. Goddard]]), at 10:41:02&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST. Gemini 8's launch was nominal and no significant anomalies occurred with either the Titan II or the spacecraft.[[File:Gemini 8 Atlas-Agena launch.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle is launched into space on an Atlas rocket in preparation for Gemini 8]]

===Rendezvous and docking===
[[File:The First Docking in Space - GPN-2000-001344.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle as seen from Gemini 8 during rendezvous.]]

Their first course adjustment was made at one hour and 34 minutes into the mission, when the astronauts lowered their apogee slightly with a five-second [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS) thruster burn. The second adjustment was made near apogee of the second orbit, and raised both the apogee and perigee by adding {{convert|49|ft/s|m/s}} to their speed. The third adjustment was made over the Pacific Ocean, a southward orbital plane change, made with a {{convert|59|ft/s|m/s}} sideways thruster burn. When they were over Mexico, [[Jim Lovell]], the Houston [[capsule communicator]], told them they needed one last correction, a {{convert|2.6|ft/s|m/s}} speed addition.

The rendezvous radar acquired the Agena Target Vehicle at a distance of {{convert|179|nmi|km}}. At 3 hours, 48 minutes and 10 seconds into the mission they performed another burn that put them in a circular orbit {{convert|15|nmi|km}} below the Agena. They first sighted it when they were {{convert|76|nmi|km}} away, and at {{convert|55|nmi|km}} they gave the computer automatic control.

After several small burns they were {{convert|151|ft|m}} away and with no relative velocity. After 30 minutes of visually inspecting the Agena to make sure that it had not been damaged by the launch, they were given the go for docking. Armstrong started to move towards the Agena at 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) per second. In a matter of minutes, the Agena's docking latches clicked and a green light indicated that the docking had been successfully completed. "Flight, we are docked! Yes, it's really a smoothie," Scott radioed to the ground.

===Emergency===
There was some suspicion on the ground that the Agena's [[attitude control]] system was acting up and might not have the correct program stored in it. This suspicion was found to be incorrect. Shortly before radio blackout, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] cautioned the astronauts to immediately abort the docking if any abnormalities occurred with the Agena.

After the Agena began execution of its stored command program, which instructed the Agena to turn the combined spacecraft 90° to the right, Scott noticed that they were rolling. Armstrong used the Gemini's OAMS thrusters to stop the roll, but after it stopped, it immediately started again. Gemini 8 was out of range of ground communications at this time.

Armstrong reported that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high yaw rate might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided to undock from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough to permit undocking. Scott then hit the undock button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters to back away from the Agena. Without the added mass of the Agena, Gemini started rotating more rapidly.

The astronauts realized that the problem was on the Gemini. By now the tumble rate had reached 296 degrees per second and Armstrong decided to shut down the OAMS and use the Re-entry Control System (RCS) thrusters to stop the tumble.  Scott later praised Armstrong's actions as their spacecraft spun: "The guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well. He found the solution, he activated the solution, under extreme circumstances ... it was my lucky day to be flying with him."&lt;ref name="nova20141203"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=First Man on the Moon |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/first-man-on-moon.html |series=Nova |series-link=Nova (TV series) |network=PBS |date=2014-12-03 |season=41 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft came in range of the ground communications ship ''[[Coastal Sentry Quebec]]''. After steadying the spacecraft, the crew tested each OAMS thruster in turn and found that Number 8 had stuck on. Almost 75% of the reentry maneuvering fuel had been used to stop the tumble,{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=176}} and mission rules dictated that the flight be aborted once the Re-entry Control System was fired for any reason. Gemini 8 immediately prepared for an emergency landing.

===Landing and recovery===
[[Image:Armstrong and Scott with Hatches Open - GPN-2000-001413.jpg|thumb|Scott (L) and Armstrong (R) await USS ''Leonard F. Mason'']]

It was decided to let the spacecraft reenter one orbit later so that it could land in a place that could be reached by the secondary recovery forces. The original plan was for Gemini 8 to land in the Atlantic, but that was supposed to be three days later. {{USS|Leonard F. Mason|DD-852|6}} started to steam towards the new landing site {{convert|800|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} east of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] and {{convert|1,000|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} south of [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]].

Reentry took place over China, out of range of NASA tracking stations.

Planes were also dispatched, and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot [[Les Schneider]] spotted the spacecraft as it descended precisely on time and on target. Three pararescuers jumped from his [[C-54]] and attached a flotation collar to the capsule.  The three pararescuers ([[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force PJs]]) were A/2C Glenn M. Moore; A/1C Eldridge M. Neal; and S/Sgt Larry D. Huyett.&lt;ref name="Gemini 8 Crew and PJs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538:Gemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |title=Gemini8 Crew and PJs |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727151042/http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538%3AGemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the pararescuers and astronauts suffered from seasickness.  Three hours after splashdown, ''Leonard F. Mason'' which had been outfitted with quarantine equipment, had both the men and the spacecraft on board. The astronauts were exhausted, but had otherwise survived the flight and their time on the water in good condition. They were briefly checked and slept for nine hours.

The next morning, the ship docked at the port of [[Naha]].  Fellow Astronaut [[Walter Schirra]] and other NASA officials flew in to greet them before the astronauts were summoned back to the ship for medical tests and debriefing.  After release, they were brought by limousine to waiting helicopters where they flew to [[Kadena Air Base]] and then on to Florida on a [[C-135]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/news/astronauts-arrive-on-okinawa-1.28085 Astronauts arrive on Okinawa] (March 19, 1966);  AP, ''Stars and Stripes'', Retrieved: December 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the return, the spacecraft was covered with a tarp. As part of the investigation into the mishap, ground controllers tested the Agena stage for the next several days by ordering it to perform various in-orbit maneuvers until exhausting its propellant and electrical power.

Four months later, the crew of [[Gemini 10]] rendezvoused with the inert Agena and astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] retrieved its micrometeorite collector.

==Cause and outcome==
No conclusive reason for the thruster malfunction was found. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short, most likely due to a [[static electricity]] discharge. Power still flowed to the thruster, even when it was switched off. To prevent recurrence of this problem, spacecraft designs were changed so each thruster would have an isolated circuit.

The Deputy Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans|Dr. Robert Seamans]], was attending a celebratory dinner sponsored by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], at which Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the guest speaker, when the problem arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; The incident inspired Seamans to review NASA's problem investigation procedures, modeled after military crash investigations, and on April 14, 1966, to formalize a new procedure in '''Management Instruction 8621.1, Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures'''. This gave the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures, beyond those failure investigations for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared: "It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Seamans first invoked this new procedure immediately following the fatal [[Apollo 1]] spacecraft fire on January 27, 1967. It was also invoked after the next critical in-flight failure, which occurred on the [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission in April 1970.

[[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]], the Gemini spacecraft prime contractor, also changed its procedures. Prior to the accident, McDonnell's top engineers would be at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]] for the launch, then fly to [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in [[Houston, Texas]] for the rest of the mission. The problem occurred while they were en route, so it was decided to keep McDonnell engineers in Houston for the entire mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch13-6.htm|title=On The Shoulders of Titans - Ch13-6|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight patch for the mission shows the whole spectrum of objectives that were hoped to have been accomplished on Gemini 8. The text at the bottom is composed of the zodiacal symbol for [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Image:Gemini.svg|12px]], and the [[Roman numeral]] for eight, VIII.  The two stars are [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], which are in the constellation of Gemini, and are refracted through a prism to provide the spectrum. Armstrong and Scott both designed the flight patch.

Trained in Cambridge and [[London Hospital]]. he saw service in the RAF before taking up academic appointments first in Cambridge and then at the [[University of London]], authoring more than 100 scientific papers in a variety of subjects. He was doctoral advisor to [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]] who later developed computational theories of vision that had great impact in the neuroscience of vision and [[computer vision]], and post-doctoral adviser to Duco Hamasaki, a professor at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine.

He was, for a while, a member of the [[Ratio Club]] with [[Alan Turing]], [[Horace Barlow]], [[John Westcott]] and others from various fields, who met between 1949 and 1952 to discuss brain mechanisms, new technology and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03684921111117951 The origins of British cybernetics: the Ratio Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave the 1986 [[Ferrier Lecture]], a [[triennial]] [[Royal Society]] prize lectureship.

Brindley invented a musical instrument in the 1960s, the 'logical [[bassoon]]', an electronically controlled version of the bassoon. It was easier to play than a normal bassoon, but was never marketed.

He has also composed music for wind instruments, including ''Variations on a Theme by Schoenberg'' and ''The Watermans Daughter'' .

The '''Heath High School shooting''' occurred at [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in [[West Paducah]],  [[Kentucky]], United States, on December 1, 1997. Fourteen-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on a group of praying students, killing three and injuring five more.

==Shooting==
On December 1, 1997 Carneal wrapped a shotgun and a rifle in a blanket and took them to school, passing them off as an art project he was working on. He also carried a loaded [[Ruger MK II]] [[.22 LR|.22-caliber]] [[pistol]] in his backpack. Carneal rode to school with his sister and arrived at approximately 7:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. When he arrived, he inserted [[earplug]]s and took the pistol out of his bag. He fired eight rounds in fast succession at a youth prayer group of mostly female students. Three girls later died and five other students were wounded.

Brittney Thomas, a survivor, claimed that when she turned around during the shooting, she was "kind of facing down the barrel of the gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Remembering-a-deadly-Kentucky-high-school-shooting-20-years-later-461092173.html|title=Remembering a deadly Kentucky high school shooting 20 years later|last=Philpott|first=Amber|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the prayer group, Benjamin Strong, testified that Carneal dropped the gun of his own accord after the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/25/us/when-grief-wanted-a-hero-truth-didn-t-get-in-the-way.html|title=When Grief Wanted a Hero, Truth Didn't Get in the Way|last=Glaberson|first=William|date=2000-07-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carneal placed his pistol on the ground and surrendered to the school principal, Bill Bond. After dropping the gun, Carneal said to Strong: "Kill me, please. I can't believe I did that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,137027,00.html | work=Time | title=When The Silence Fell | date=2001-06-24 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==

===Killed===
*Nicole Hadley was a fourteen-year-old [[freshman]] who played in the school band and on the freshman basketball team. She was kept alive until 10:00 pm the evening of the shooting. Her family had moved to Paducah from Nebraska the year before. Her parents were praised for donating her organs. President [[Bill Clinton]] cited this "courageous decision" in his Proclamation 7083 on National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=55804|title=Proclamation 7083 on National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jessica James was a seventeen-year-old student and member of the marching band. She died in surgery at Western Baptist Hospital the afternoon of the shooting.
*Kayce Steger was a fifteen-year-old [[Tenth grade#United_States|sophomore]], a clarinetist in the school band and a member of the Agape Club and softball team. She died at Lourdes Hospital in Paducah about 45 minutes after the shooting. She was an honor student and member of [[Law Enforcement Exploring|Law Enforcement Explorers]] Post 111 who hoped to be a police officer.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309084121/html/139.html|title= Deadly Lessons: Understanding Lethal School Violence|author=National Research Council|accessdate=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wounded===
*Shelley Schaberg, 17, was described by the principal as the school's best female athlete. Voted Miss Heath High School by the senior class, Shelley was [[homecoming]] queen. Though her injuries from the shooting prevented her from playing basketball, her college honored her basketball scholarship and she went on to play college soccer.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2002"/&gt;
*Melissa "Missy" Jenkins, 15, was president of the [[FCCLA|Future Homemakers of America]]. She was paralyzed after being shot in the chest. Missy has appeared on numerous national and local television shows, talked to newspaper reporters and is appearing in two TV commercials for [[Channel One News]], an educational channel that reaches schools throughout the country. A video interview of her was featured on the homepage of YouTube.com on April 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="Joseph Gerth 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.rutgers.edu/forum/showthread.php?t=31462|title=Victims of the attack find different ways to move on with lives|author=Joseph Gerth|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator==
Michael Carneal was a 14-year old freshman at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/us/school-shooting-kentucky-west-paducah/index.html|title=20 years ago, another Kentucky school was attacked.

He also stated that he didn't know who he was aiming at until he read the names in the paper.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/24/sister-paducah-shooting-victim-couldnt-believe-could-happen-again/1060899001/|title=Sister of Paducah, Ky., shooting victim: 'I couldn't believe this could happen again'|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks before the incident, Carneal stole a [[.38 Special|.38&amp;nbsp;caliber]] [[handgun]] from his parents' room and attempted to sell it. A student took the gun, threatening to tell police if Carneal did not give it to him. Additionally, Carneal had told students that "something big is going to happen on Monday" but no one took him seriously.

In the weeks before the shooting, Carneal stole several firearms from both his own home and a neighbor's home.

On the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day, Carneal went to his neighbor's home and broke into the garage, taking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/03/us/forgiveness-after-3-die-in-shootings-in-kentucky.html|title=Forgiveness, after 3&amp;nbsp;die in shootings in Kentucky|last=Bragg|first=Rick|date=3 December 1997|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=6 April 2018|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York, NY|authorlink=Rick Bragg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he also stole:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1997/12/12/UPI-Focus-Boy-indicted-in-Ky-school-shooting/1067881902800/|title=UPI Focus: Boy indicted in Ky. school shooting|date=12 December 1997|publisher=News World Communications|location=Boca Raton, Florida|access-date=5 April 2018|agency=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A Ruger .22 pistol 
*Several .22 magazines

Presumably sometime after Thanksgiving Day, Carneal stole two shotguns from his father's closet and hid them under his bed. 

=== Mental Illness ===
According to reports, Carneal had been [[bullying|bullied]] by other students and suffered from anxiety, depression, and severe paranoia. His paranoia was manifested in habits such as covering up vents and windows while in bathrooms, because he believed he was being watched.&lt;ref name="NY Times, 2000"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/04/us/finding-futility-in-trying-to-lay-blame-in-killings.html?ref=michaelcarneal&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Finding futility in trying to lay blame in killings |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=2000-08-04}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shooting, Carneal was diagnosed with [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[dysthymia]]. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Kathleen O'Connor, who treated Carneal while he was incarcerated at the Northern Kentucky Youth Development Center, initially agreed with this diagnosis but later determined that Carneal actually had [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Dewey Cornell and Diane Schetky, who evaluated Carneal after the shooting, later changed their diagnosis to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://casetext.com/case/carneal-v-crews-3 |title=Carneal v.

=== Stephen King ===
Carneal had in his locker at the time a copy of [[Stephen King]]'s novel [[Rage (Stephen King novel)|''Rage'']] (first published in 1977 under the pseudonym [[Richard Bachman]]).  After this shooting King requested his publisher to allow it to go out of print, fearing that it might inspire similar tragedies.  ''Rage'' for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in ''[[The Bachman Books]]'' collection, although the collection now no longer contains ''Rage''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hodder.co.uk/book_details.asp?book=110665&lt;/ref&gt; King's other Bachman novels are available in the US in separate volumes.

== Trial ==
In October 1998, Judge Jeff Hines accepted a plea of guilty from Michael Carneal, due to his mental illness. Under a plea arrangement, the judge agreed to accept the pleas on condition that Carneal would receive a life sentence with the possibility of parole in 25 years (2023). According to prosecutor Tim Kaltenbach, the plea allows Carneal to receive mental health treatment during imprisonment as long as this is necessary for him or until he is released.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/2017/11/28/20-years-later-michael-carneal/|title=Heath 20 Years Later: Michael Carneal|date=2017-11-28|work=WPSD Local 6 - Your News, Weather, &amp; Sports Authority|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carneal was transported to the [[Kentucky State Reformatory]] in [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]] when he turned 18 where he remains. Prior to that he was held in at Northern Kentucky Youth Development Center, a [[Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice]] facility in [[Crittenden, Kentucky|Crittenden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/05/paducah.shooting/|title=Kentucky school shooter - guilty but mentally ill|date=1998-10-05|accessdate=2007-11-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913115713/http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/05/paducah.shooting/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2007-09-13|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carneal's [[Kentucky Department of Corrections]] (KDOC) ID is 151127.

Retrieved on December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Carneal filed an appeal claiming that he was too mentally ill to plead guilty in 1998 to the shooting at Heath High School and asked the Kentucky Supreme Court for a re-trial. Prosecutors appealed and the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected his request and Carneal will continue to serve out his sentence.{{Citation Needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2012, he attempted to withdraw his plea claiming he was mentally ill at the time he made it, later in the year the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals]] denied the request stating he should have acted sooner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Settlement for families ===
The families of the deceased have agreed to a $42 million settlement from Carneal, however at the time of settlement Carneal had no assets and his family’s insurance company, [[Kentucky Farm Bureau]], has insisted repeatedly through court motions that it is not liable for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96287&amp;page=1|title=Paducah Families Accept Shooting Settlement|last=News|first=A.

==Lawsuit==
In early 1999, the parents of three victims represented by [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] filed a $33&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against two Internet [[pornography]] sites, several computer game companies and makers and distributors of the 1994 film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]''. They claimed that media violence inspired Carneal and therefore should be held responsible for the deaths that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/13/us/media-companies-are-sued-in-kentucky-shooting.html |title= Media companies are sued in Kentucky shooting |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company |date=13 April 1999 |access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed in 2002. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it was "simply too far a leap from shooting characters on a video screen to shooting people in a classroom."  The same year, an identical case was brought against the same companies by the family of the teacher killed in the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. It was dismissed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[James v. Meow Media|James v.

==Memorials==
Family of victims organized a 20th anniversary service to commemorate the victims, and open a memorial for the victims placed across the street from the school. The memorial was built in a circle to symbolize the prayer circle that was targeted, with five benches representing the five surviving victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''inherent chirality''' is a property of asymmetry in molecules arising, not from a stereogenic or chiral center, but from a twisting of the molecule in 3-D space.   The term was first coined by Volker Boehmer in a 1994 review, to describe the chirality of [[calixarenes]] arising from their non-planar structure in 3-D space.

This phenomena was described as resulting from “the absence of a place of symmetry or an inversion center in the molecule as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalla Cort|first=Antonella|last2=Mandolini|first2=Luigi|last3=Pasquini|first3=Chiara|last4=Schiaffino|first4=Luca|date=2004-10-01|title="Inherent chirality" and curvature|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=B404388J|journal=New J.

== History ==

=== Calixarenes ===
After creating a series of traditionally chiral calixarenes (through the addition of a chiral substituent group on the top or bottom rim of the macrocycle,) the first inherently chiral calixarenes were synthesized in 1982, though the molecules were not yet described as such.  The inherently chiral calixarenes featured an XXYZ or WXYZ substitution pattern, such that the planar representation of the molecule does not show any chirality, and if the macrocycle were to be broken open, this would produce an achiral linear molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shao-Yong|last2=Xu|first2=Yao-Wei|last3=Liu|first3=Jun-Min|last4=Su|first4=Cheng-Yong|date=2011-01-17|title=Inherently Chiral Calixarenes: Synthesis, Optical Resolution, Chiral Recognition and Asymmetric Catalysis|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/12/1/429|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=429–455|doi=10.3390/ijms12010429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chirality in these calixarenes is instead derived from the curvature of the molecule in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7|title=Calixarenes and Beyond {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2corannulene.png|thumb|a) 2D representation of corannulene, b) 3D representation of corannulene bowl flip with C5 symmetry.]]

=== Definition ===
Due to the initial lack of a formal definition after the initial conception, the term inherent chirality was utilized to describe a variety of chiral molecules that don’t fall into other defined chirality types.  The first fully formulated definition of inherent chirality was published in 2004 by Mandolini and Schiaffino, (and later modified by Szumna):

''“inherent chirality arises from the introduction of a curvature in an ideal planar structure that is devoid of perpendicular symmetry planes in its bidimensional representation'''."'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inherent chirality has been known by a variety of names in the literature including bowl chirality (in fullerene fragments), intrinsic chirality, helicity (see section 3a) residual enantiomers (as applied to sterically hindered molecular propellers,) and cyclochirality (though this is often considered to be a more specific example and cannot be applied to all inherently chiral molecules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A simple example of inherent chirality is that of corannulene commonly referred to as “bowl chirality” in the literature.  The chirality of an unsubstituted corranulene (containing no classic stereogenic centers) cannot be seen in a 2D representation, but becomes clear when a 3D representation is evoked, as the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry of corranulenes provides the molecules with a source of chirality (figure 2.)  Racemization of these molecules is possible through an inversion of curvature, though some inherently chiral molecules have inversion barriers comparable to a classic chiral center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Molecular Symmetry ==
[[File:3paracyclophane.png|thumb|150x150px|Inherently chiral paracyclophane, rendered chiral by the bromide substituent hindering rotation of the phenylene.]]

=== Chiral Plane ===
Some inherently chiral molecules contain [[Planar chirality|chirality planes]], or planes within a given molecules across which the molecule is dissymmetric.  Paracyclophanes often contain chiral planes if the bridge across the phenylene unit is short enough, or if the phenylene contains another substituent, not in the bridge, that hinders rotation of the phenylene unit.

=== Chiral axis ===
Similar to chirality planes, [[Axial chirality|chirality axes]] arise from an axis about which the spatial arrangement of substituents creates chirality.  This can be seen in helical molecules (see section 3a) as well as some alkenes.

== Other examples ==
[[File:10helicene.png|thumb|133x133px|Helicene molecule with inherent chirality.]]
Helical molecules are considered to have inherent chirality, but this is sometimes referred to as helical chirality or ''helicity''.  The IUPAC definition of helicity is: ''chirality of a helical, propeller or screw-shaped molecular entity.''  [[Helicene]]s (figure 4) are chiral polycyclic aromatic compounds that lack conventional chiral centers, but are chiral due to the helical shape of the 3D molecules.

[[Spiro compound#Chirality|Spiro compounds]] (compounds with a twisted structure of two or more rings) can have inherent chirality at the spiroatom, due to the twisting of the achiral ring system.

Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of a “buckle” where in an achiral, linear alkene is forced into a chiral conformation.  Alkenes have no classical chirality, so generally, an external stereogenic center must be introduced.  However, by locking the alkene into a conformation through the use of an achiral buckle allows for the creation of an inherently chiral alkene.  Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of dialkoxysilanes, with a large enough racemization barrier that enantiomers have been isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomooka|first=Katsuhiko|last2=Miyasaka|first2=Shouji|last3=Motomura|first3=Shougo|last4=Igawa|first4=Kazunobu|date=2014-06-16|title=Planar Chiral Dialkoxysilane: Introduction of Inherent Chirality and High Reactivity in Conventional Achiral Alkene|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201402434/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=25|pages=7598–7602|doi=10.1002/chem.201402434|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1525-1403 ''Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface''] is the official publication of the INS. The peer-reviewed journal aims to advance the basic and clinical science of the field of neuromodulation. Published 8 times per year, the journal is MEDLINE-indexed.

==History==
In 1989, after the first International Congress on Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation was held in the [[Netherlands]], a group of physicians founded the INS in [[Paris]], [[France]].  Their incentive was to bridge the gap between [[neurologist]]s, [[neurosurgeon]]s, [[vascular surgeon]]s and [[cardiologist]]s to build a multidisciplinary and international society dedicated to the advancement of neuromodulation.

'''Isabella of France''' (9 November 1389 – 13 September 1409) was [[Queen consort of England]] as the second spouse of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Her parents were [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI of France]] and [[Isabeau of Bavaria]]. She married the king at the age of seven and was widowed three years later. She later married [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]], dying in childbirth at the age of nineteen.

Isabella's younger sister, [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], was Queen of England from 1420 until 1422, married to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and mother of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].

==Life==
[[File:Isabela richard2.jpg|thumb|left|Richard and Isabella on their wedding day]]
Isabella lived during a period of political tension between France and England known as the [[Hundred Years War]], the situation made worse by the mental instability of her father.

On 31 October 1396, almost the age of seven, Isabella married the widower King [[Richard II of England]] in a move for peace with France.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=205}} The fact that she was a child was discussed during the negotiations, but Richard replied that each day would rectify that problem, that it was an advantage as he would then be able to shape her in accordance with his ideal, and that he was young enough to wait. Isabella herself told the English envoys that she was happy to be Queen of England, because she had been told that this would make her a great lady. She is described as pretty, and reportedly practiced in order to be able to perform her role as queen. King Richard traveled to Paris to fetch her, where the wedding was celebrated with grand festivities at the French royal court, before they continued to the English enclave of Calais, where the formal wedding ceremony was performed on 31 October.

===Queen of England===
After the wedding, Queen Isabella followed Richard to England, where she was placed in Windsor Castle with her own court under the supervision of her appointed governess and chief lady-in-waiting Lady de Coucy (later replaced by Lady Mortimer). She was formally crowned Queen of England in Westminster in London the following year, 1397.

Although the union was political and an arranged marriage, Richard II and the child Isabella developed a mutually respectful relationship: Richard regularly visited her in Windsor, where he treated her with respect and entertained her and her ladies-in-waiting with humorous conversation, and Isabella reportedly enjoyed and looked forward to his visits.

By May 1399, the Queen had been moved to [[Portchester Castle]] for protection while Richard went on a military campaign in Ireland. During the following rebellion against Richard, Isabella was moved by the Duke of York first to Wallingford Castle and then to Leeds Castle. When on his return to England Richard II was imprisoned and died in custody, Queen Isabella was ordered by the new King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] to move out of [[Windsor Castle]] and to settle in the [[Bishop of Salisbury]]'s Thamesside [[Sonning Bishop's Palace|palace]] at [[Sonning]] in formal house arrest.

===Later life===
In 1400, the deposed king was killed, and the French court requested that Isabella return to France. King Henry IV initially refused, deciding Queen Isabella should marry his son, the future [[Henry V of England]], but she refused. Knowing her spouse was dead, she went into mourning, ignoring Henry IV's demands. In August 1401, he let her go back to France, but kept her [[dowry]].{{sfn|Stratford|2012|p=14, 118}}

In 1406, Henry IV repeated his suggestion that Isabella marry his son, but it was refused by the French court.

On 29 June 1406, Queen Isabella, aged 16, married her cousin, [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]], aged 11.{{sfn|Knecht|2007|p=51}} She died in childbirth at the age of 19. Her surviving daughter, [[Jeanne of Valois (1409-1432)|Joan]], married [[John II of Alençon]] in 1424. Isabella's body was interred in Blois, in the abbey of [[St. Laumer]], where it was later discovered in 1624, curiously wrapped in bands of linen plated over with [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]]. It was then transferred to the church of the [[Celestines]] in Paris.

==In literature==
In Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' Richard's queen appears in two significant scenes at the time of his deposition, but she is portrayed as an adult. She is forced by the new king Henry IV to leave for France after the deposition.

Two children's novels about Isabella's life appeared in the late 1950s, [[Hilda Lewis]]' ''[[The Gentle Falcon]]'' and [[Gladys Malvern]]'s ''My Lady, My Love.''

Isabella appears in the historical novel ''[[In a Dark Wood Wandering]]'' (original Dutch title ''Het woud der verwachting'') by [[Hella Haasse]], which centers on the life of her second husband Charles, Duke of Orléans.

'''James Gallier''' (July 24, 1798 – October 3, 1866) was a prominent 19th-century New Orleans architect.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born '''James Gallagher''' in Ravensdale, [[County Louth]], [[Ireland]] in 1798.&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-19484799.html
|title=The Galliers, New Orleans architects. |date=1997-04-01 |  author=Banks, William Nathaniel |accessdate=2008-01-30|work=|publisher=The Magazine Antiques, republished in HighBeam Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his last name to a French surname when he moved to New Orleans (1834).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nola.com/175years/index.ssf/2012/01/the_galliers_the_times-picayun.html "The Galliers," ''Times-Picayune, 29 January 2012''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
He worked in England during his early career, designing the [[Godmanchester Chinese Bridge]] which crosses a mill stream of the [[River Great Ouse]] in 1827, and then working on the redevelopment of the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair. He became bankrupt, and emigrated to America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41847 ''The Architecture of the Estate: The Reign of the Cundys'', Survey of London: volume 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), pp. 127-140.]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1832.

He was one of a group of architects who created the idea of Architectural Practice, with the architect working for the clients, and managing those who actually build the structures that have been designed.&lt;ref&gt;''From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America'', (1999), Mary N. Woods, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-21494-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
His significant works that are [[National Historic Landmarks]] include:
* [[Gallier Hall]] on St. Charles Avenue (1851), at Lafayette Square in the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]], which was New Orleans' City Hall for nearly a century.  It is a National Historic Landmark.
* [[Pontalba Buildings]], with [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]], a National Historic Landmark.
* [[St. Charles Hotel, New Orleans|St. Charles Hotel]]
* [[Government Street Presbyterian Church]] (1836), a National Historic Landmark in [[Mobile, Alabama]].

His other significant works include:
* [[Christ Church Cathedral, New Orleans|The Second Christ Church Cathedral]] on [[St. Charles Avenue]] (1837), an [[Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana|Episcopalian Church]] and later a [[synagogue]].  No longer exists.
* [[Barton Academy]] (1836) in Mobile, Alabama.
* [[Belle Helene]] (1850) in [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana]].
* [[The Boston Club]] (1844) for Dr William Newton Mercer

===Personal life and death===
In 1823, while in England, he met and married Elizabeth Tyler. Their only surviving child was [[James Gallier Jr.]], who also became an architect. Elizabeth died in July 1844, in her mid-forties.

On June 23, 1850, in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], he married Catherine Maria Robinson of [[Mobile, Alabama]], who was born November 18, 1822, in [[Hardwick, Massachusetts]], to Colonel Joseph Robinson and Ann Maria Ruggles Walton. She was 24 years his junior.

On October 3, 1866, Mr. and Mrs. Gallier were passengers on board the ''Evening Star'', a paddle-wheel [[Steamboat|steamer]] en route from [[New York City]] to New Orleans, when it sank in a [[hurricane]] about 175 miles east of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. There were only a half-dozen survivors out of approximately 250 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neworleansbar.org/documents/ENews08Nostalgia0528N.O.in1867.pdf ''New Orleans in 1867'', (2008), Ned Hemard, New Orleans Bar Association], accessed 2009-10-31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John III Palaeologus''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1362 &amp;ndash; 25 August 1381) was the [[Margrave of Montferrat]]&lt;ref&gt;cit: ''[[Secondotto, Marquess of Montferrat]], John III, Marquess of Montferrat, [[Theodore II, Marquess of Montferrat]] and Guglielmo, who were the sons of [[Isabella of Majorca|Elisabeth]], daughter of [[James III of Majorca]], and of [[John II, Marquess of Montferrat]], have been called [[Duke]]s.'' Historiae et Urbium Regionum Italiae rariores, Volume 114, Cronica del Montferrato, Benvenuto Sangiorgio, Arnaldo Forni Editore 1780.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1378 to his death. He was the second son of [[John II of Montferrat]] and [[Isabella of Majorca]] and brother and successor of [[Otto III of Montferrat|Secondotto]]. On 3 January 1379, John III was installed as margrave under the [[Regent|regency]] of his uncle [[Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen]]. 

Desirous of avenging his brother's death and recuperating the territory lost in the aftermath of Secondotto's retreat, John declared war on the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] of [[Milan]], but was forced to sign a peace before fighting had begun, under the pressure of the [[Antipope Clement VII]] of [[Avignonese Papacy|Avignon]], who wished to have Otto of Brunswick at his court. Otto consequently signed the treaty and confirmed the borders of the margraviate during his absence. In order to guarantee the survival of the margraviate, Otto placed it under the protection of the [[Kingdom of France]]. 

Later, John followed Otto to the court of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], but during his absence troubles arose. When [[Charles III of Naples|Charles III]] was declared King of Naples and [[Joan I of Naples|Joan I]] successively fled, John and Otto found themselves fully immersed in the war over the Neapolitan succession and unable to return to Montferrat. On 25 August 1381, they were involved in a battle in which Otto was captured and the young John slain. He succeeded by his younger brother [[Theodore II, Marquess of Montferrat]].

==Baseball career==
===Early life in professional baseball===
Roseboro was born in [[Ashland, Ohio]] and enrolled at [[Central State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet A Dodger |agency= |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |page=17 |date=1 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19390301&amp;id=7pkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D2UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5997,102077&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent prior to the [[1952 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1952]] season and, began his [[professional baseball]] career with the [[Sheboygan Indians]] of the [[Wisconsin State League]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Roseboro minor league statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=rosebo001joh |title=John Roseboro minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted a .365 [[batting average]] with Sheboygan in 1952 to finish second in the league batting championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/leader.cgi?type=bat&amp;id=8c53a924 |title=1952 Wisconsin State League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro missed the 1954 season due to military service but, after five years in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], he was promoted to the major leagues in June 1957 at the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Johnny_Roseboro |title=Johnny Roseboro |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campanella's heir apparent===
During his first season, Roseboro served as backup catcher for the Dodgers' perennial All-Star catcher, [[Roy Campanella]], and was being groomed to be Campanella's replacement. However, he was promoted to the starting catcher's position ahead of schedule when Campanella had a tragic car accident in January 1958 that ended his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scouts Rave Over New Campy In Praising John Roseboro |agency=ANP |work=Washington Afro-American |page=13 |date=5 February 1957 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19570205&amp;id=EuElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430,1091082&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Is Learning Fast As Replacement For Roy Campanella |agency= |work=The Day |page=16 |date=17 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19590317&amp;id=9qs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=911,1829623&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full season, with the team having moved to Los Angeles, Roseboro hit for a .271 batting average along with 14 [[home run]]s and 43 [[runs batted in]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He was also named as a reserve player for the [[National League]] in the [[1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1958 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS195807080.shtml |title=1958 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1959]], Roseboro led the league's catchers in [[putout]]s and in baserunners [[caught stealing]], helping the Dodgers win the [[List of National League pennant winners|National League Pennant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1959 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959.shtml |title=1959 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers went on to win the [[1959 World Series]], defeating the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1959_WS.shtml |title=1959 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roseboro helped guide the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league leading 2.85 [[earned run average]] in [[1963 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1963]] as the Dodgers clinched the National League Pennant by 6 games over the [[1963 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml |title=1963 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7 |title=1963 National League Team Pitching Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro made his presence felt in the [[1963 World Series]] against the [[1963 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] when he hit a three-run home run off [[Whitey Ford]] to win the first game of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA196310020.shtml |title=1963 World Series Game 1 box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers went on to win the series by defeating the Yankees in four straight games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1963_WS.shtml |title=1963 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers dropped to seventh place in the [[1964 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1964]] season,  however Roseboro hit for a career high .287 batting average and led the league's catchers with a 60.4% caught stealing percentage.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1964-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1964 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marichal incident===
Roseboro was involved in a major altercation with [[Juan Marichal]] during a game between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants and the Dodgers had nurtured a heated [[Dodgers–Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with each other dating back to their days together in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game leading the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] by half a game and the Giants by one and a half games.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The incident occurred in the aftermath of the [[Watts riots]] near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the [[Dominican Civil War]] raged in Marichal's home country, so emotions were raw.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal, and eventually scored a [[Run (baseball)|run]] when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[Inning (baseball)|inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident, but eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal after the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro, but Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Dodger fans remained angry with Marichal for several years after the altercation, and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]].  By then, however, Roseboro had forgiven Marichal, and personally appealed to fans to do the same.&lt;ref name = "boiling"/&gt;

===Later career===
The Dodgers went on to win the [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1965]] National League Pennant by two games over the Giants. Even though the Giants won the two games against the Dodgers during which Marichal had been suspended, the outcome of the season may have been different without the Giants' pitcher's suspension, as he finished the season with a 22-13 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win-loss]] record.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro once again guided the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league-leading 2.81 earned run average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965.shtml |title=1965 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caught for two twenty game winners in 1965 with Koufax winning 26 games, while [[Don Drysdale]] won 23 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/1965.shtml |title=1965 Los Angeles Dodgers Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]]'', baseball historian [[Bill James]] said the decision to give [[Joe Torre]]  a {{Baseball year|1965}} National League Gold Glove Award was absurd, stating that he was given the award because of his offensive statistics and that either Roseboro or [[Tom Haller]] was more deserving of the award.&lt;ref name="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract"/&gt; In the [[1965 World Series]] against the [[1965 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], Roseboro contributed a two-run [[Single (baseball)|single]] to win Game 3 of the series as, the Dodgers went on to win the world championship in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN196510090.shtml |title=1965 World Series Game 3 box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1965_WS.shtml |title=1965 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers' pitching staff continued to lead the league in earned run average in [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1966]] as they battled with the [[1966 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and the [[1966 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a tight pennant race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7 |title=1966 National League Team Pitching Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers eventually prevailed to win the National League Pennant for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml |title=1966 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro led the league with a career-high 903 putouts and finished second to Joe Torre in fielding percentage to win his second Gold Glove Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1964-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1966 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1966 |title=1966 National League Gold Glove Award winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers would eventually lose the [[1966 World Series]], getting swept in four games by the [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1966_WS.shtml |title=1966 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers would fall to 8th place in the [[1967 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1967]] season and Roseboro would be traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] after the season with [[Bob Miller (baseball, born 1939)|Bob Miller]] and [[Ron Perranoski]] for [[Mudcat Grant]] and [[Zoilo Versalles]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; While with the Twins, he would be named to his fourth and final All-Star team when he was named as a reserve for the [[American League]] team in the [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1969 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196907230.shtml |title=1969 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Roseboro was released by the Twins.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] on December 31, 1969 but appeared in only 46 games for the last place Senators.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in his final major league game on August 11, [[1970 Washington Senators season|1970]] at the age of 37.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

==Career statistics==
In an fourteen-year major league career, Roseboro played in 1,585 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 1,206 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 4,847 [[at bats]] for a .249 career batting average along with 104 home runs, 548 runs batted in and an [[on-base percentage]] of .326.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He had a .989 career fielding percentage as a catcher. Roseboro caught 112 [[shutouts in baseball|shutouts]] during his career, ranking him 19th all-time among major league catchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bb_catchers.tripod.com/catchers/tmonth1.htm |title=The Encyclopedia of Catchers - Trivia December 2010 - Career Shutouts Caught |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the catcher for two of Sandy Koufax's four [[no-hitter]]s and caught more than 100 games in 11 of his 14 major league seasons.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Dies"/&gt; Baseball historian Bill James ranked Roseboro 27th all-time among major league catchers.&lt;ref name="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract"/&gt;

==Later life==
After completing his playing career with Washington, Roseboro coached for the Senators (1971) and [[California Angels]] (1972–74). Later, he served as a [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] batting instructor (1977) and catching instructor (1987) for the Dodgers. Roseboro and his wife, Barbara Fouch Roseboro, also owned a [[Beverly Hills]] [[public relations]] firm.

Roseboro appeared as a [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officer in the 1966 ''[[Dragnet (series)#1966 television series|Dragnet]]'' TV movie. He also appeared as himself in the 1962 film ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'' along with [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Wally Moon]], and as himself in the 1963 ''[[Mister Ed]]'' episode "Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Roseboro|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741771/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|website=imdb|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevrolet]] was one of the sponsors of the Dodgers' radio coverage in the mid-1960s. The song "See the USA in Your Chevrolet", made famous by [[Dinah Shore]] in the '50s, was sung in Chevrolet commercials by Roseboro and other Dodger players. Dodger announcer [[Jerry Doggett]] once joked that Roseboro was a singer "whose singing career was destined to go absolutely nowhere."

After several years of bitterness over their famous altercation, Roseboro and Marichal became friends in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "boiling"&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball Boiling Over: 25 Years After Juan Marichal Clubbed John Roseboro |agency=Associated Press |work=Gettysburg Times |page=B1 |date=21 August 1990 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19900821&amp;id=oVwlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1637,2098490&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro personally appealed to the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] not to hold the incident against Marichal after he was passed over for election to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in his first two years of eligibility.  Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro during his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were no hard feelings on my part," Roseboro said, "and I thought if that was made public, people would believe that this was really over with. So I saw him at a Dodger old-timers' game, and we posed for pictures together, and I actually visited him in the Dominican. The next year, he was in the Hall of Fame. Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things."&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;

Roseboro died of heart disease on August 16, 2002 in [[Los Angeles]] at age 69.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Dies"/&gt; Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral.  "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life," he said, at the service. "I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virions have been labelled with [[fluorescent]] (FSL-FLRO4) and [[Iodine 125|radioactive iodine]]  (FSL-125I). FSL-FLRO4 could be shown to label virions in a dose dependent manner and could be visualized by [[flow cytometry]] either directly, or indirectly if the virion had bound to the cell or fused with the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; FSLs do not appear to significantly affect the virions [[infectivity]] or their ability to bind target cells, probably because they integrate into the membrane without exposing the virion to chemical agents or covalent modification{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4599">A '''liquid state machine''' ('''LSM''') is a particular kind of [[spiking neural network]]. An LSM consists of a large collection of units (called ''nodes'', or ''neurons''). Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the '''inputs''') as well as from other nodes. Nodes are [[random network|randomly connected]] to each other. The [[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a [[spatio-temporal pattern]] of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by [[Linear discriminant analysis|linear discriminant]] units.

The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of [[nonlinear function]]s on the input. Given a [[Typewriting monkeys|large enough variety]] of such nonlinear functions, it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the read out units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task, such as [[speech recognition]] or [[computer vision]].

The word [[liquid state|liquid]] in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid. The falling stone will generate [[Capillary wave|ripples]] in the liquid. The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement (ripples).

LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of [[brain]]s. LSMs are argued to be an improvement over the theory of artificial neural networks because:

#Circuits are not hard coded to perform a specific task.
#Continuous time inputs are handled "naturally".
#Computations on various time scales can be done using the same network.
#The same network can perform multiple computations.

Criticisms of LSMs as used in [[computational neuroscience]] are that
#LSMs don't actually explain how the brain functions. At best they can replicate some parts of brain functionality.
#There is no guaranteed way to dissect a working network and figure out how or what computations are being performed.
#Very little control over the process.

== Universal function approximation ==
If a reservoir has '''fading memory''' and '''input separability''', with help of a readout,
it can be proven the liquid state machine is a universal function approximator using [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Little Salt Spring''' is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Paleontology|paleontological]] site in [[North Port, Florida|North Port]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It is located directly off Price Boulevard between [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] and [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] adjacent to Heron Creek Middle School in the city of North Port. On July 10, 1979, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="sht"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19801124&amp;id=sUk1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=62cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5335,5446439|work=Sarasota Herald Tribune|title=Dial Hotline|date=November 24, 1980|page=54|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Little Salt Spring is a feature of the [[karst topography]] of Florida, specifically an example of a [[sinkhole]]. It is classified as a third [[Spring (hydrology)#Classification|magnitude]] spring.&lt;ref name=RRR10222&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Ee, NJ |author2=Riera-Gomez, E Rick |title=Oxygen and Hydrogen Isotopes Suggest Two Sources for Little Salt Spring |year=2009 |journal=In: Pollock NW, ed.

Originally it was thought that Little Salt Spring was a shallow freshwater pond, but in the 1950s [[Scuba diving|SCUBA divers]] discovered that it was a true sinkhole extending downward over {{convert|200|ft|m|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=RRR10222/&gt; similar to the [[cenote]]s of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] (another karst region). The actual depth of the surface pond is {{convert|40|ft|1|spell=in}} with a central shaft dropping vertically to an inverted cone with a maximum determined depth at the outer edges of {{convert|245|ft|m}}. There are ledges around the wall of the cenote at {{convert|16|and|27|m|ft|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} below the present water level.

==Prehistoric human use==
The water level in the spring has varied over time. Twelve to thirteen thousand years ago the ocean level was about 100 meters (more than 300 feet) lower than at present, drawing down the water table in Florida, and the water level in Little Salt Spring was {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} lower than at present. The basin around the spring and a [[Swamp|slough]] extending away from it are filled with moist, soft [[peat]]. Hundreds of burials dating from 5,200 to 6,800 years ago have been found in the slough. As has happened in other wetland burials in Florida, such as at the [[Windover Archaeological Site]], brain matter survived in many of the skulls. In the 1970s the overturned shell of an extinct giant land tortoise was found on the {{convert|27|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} ledge. A wooden stake had been driven between the [[carapace]] and the [[plastron]], and there is evidence of a fire under the tortoise. It appears that the tortoise had been cooked in its shell. The [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] date for the wooden stake was 12,030 years ago; a bone from the tortoise was dated to 13,450 years ago. Large numbers of human bones have been recovered from the spring itself, but were not collected under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy:84-90&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long Beach Jane Doe''' (known locally as '''Jane Doe 40''') is an unidentified murder victim whose body was found in May 1974. Her suspected murderer was arrested but she has never been identified, despite extensive investigation.

==Discovery of the body==

The [[Strangling|strangled]] body of a young woman was found on May 28, 1974, on the [[jetty]] of [[Alamitos Beach, Long Beach, California|Alamitos Beach]] in [[Long Beach, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Doe -- 40|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/technology/20120602/jane-doe-40|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Press Telegram|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was estimated to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been [[rape]]d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Make Arrest In 1974 Homicide Case, Seek Assistance Identifying Victim|url=http://www.everythinglongbeach.com/police-make-arrest-in-1974-homicide-case-seek/|website=Everything Long Beach|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible [[Hispanic]] ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and brown eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 4460|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/4460|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a unique [[scar]] on the back of her left hand, which was shaped like the letter '''T'''. She also had an inch-long scar on the back of her left [[thigh]].

She was wearing a [[white gold]], 14-karat [[engagement ring]] with a small [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Arrest Man For 1974 Murder — Now Just Have To Figure Out Who Victim Was|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/06/05/police-arrest-man-for-1974-murder-now-just-have-to-figure-out-who-victim-was/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Los Angeles Local|agency=CBS Los Angeles|publisher=CBS|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was clothed in a pinkish-orange suit with a [[wikt:faux|faux]] black fur coat and calf-high [[suede]] boots.

The only items the Jane Doe carried were a house key and padlock key. The padlock key was attached to a broken chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 700UFCA|date=2 June 2012|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/700ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

===Arrest of Gary Stamp===

Police received a confession from a [[Texas]] man who claimed he had assisted with [[Dump job|dumping]] the victim's body. He led authorities to another suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruiz|first1=Jason|title=Arrest Made in 1974 Cold Case; Victim's Identity Still Unknown|url=http://lbpost.com/news/2000002425-a|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Long Beach Post|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2013, a man named Gary Stamp (some sources state "Stump"), aged 61, was arrested. He confessed to the girl's murder but was not certain of her name, which may have been Anna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Case: Gary Stamp arrested Gary Stamp for the murder of "Jane Doe #40" – Do you recognize her?|url=http://mylifeofcrime.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/cold-case-gary-stamp-arrested-gary-stamp-for-the-murder-of-jane-doe-40-do-you-recognize-her/|website=mylifeofcrime.wordpress.com|publisher=[[WordPress]]|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp was arraigned on June 12, 2013, in Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=39-year-old cold case murder solved…halfway|url=http://www.crimevoice.com/39-year-old-cold-case-murder-solved-halfway/|website=Crime Voice|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim may have been seen at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] earlier.

== Biography ==

=== Background ===

====Vastra====
Vastra is a female [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]] warrior from prehistoric Earth who was awakened from hibernation in the 19th century when her lair was disturbed during the construction of the [[London Underground]].&lt;ref name="vastra bio"/&gt; Initially enraged, she slaughtered five commuters before being pacified by the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. She eventually overcame her race's hatred of humans and joined London society. She became a consulting detective to [[Scotland Yard]], and a possible inspiration for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.&lt;ref name="vastra bio"/&gt; Amongst her unseen adventures is her capture of [[Jack the Ripper]], whom she eats (she mentions in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" that she found him "stringy, but tasty all the same").&lt;ref name="a good man"/&gt; She hired a maid, Jenny Flint, who assists her in her investigations and who is also married to her.

====Jenny Flint====
Jenny's backstory in "The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later" (2013) shows she was turned away from her family because of her "preferences in companionship",&lt;ref name="demons run"/&gt; and saved from attackers by Vastra, who took her on as an employee. The Doctor was present at their initial meeting, during which Vastra recounts in "[[The Name of the Doctor]]" (2013) that he saved Jenny's life.&lt;ref name="name of the doctor"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Name of the Doctor |episode-link=The Name of the Doctor |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Saul (director) |last2=Metzstein |author-link2=Saul Metzstein |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=18 May 2013 |season= |series-no=7 |number=13 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shows herself to have acquired extremely formidable skills as a hand-to-hand combatant and a swordswoman. She is shown in all of her appearances to be entirely comfortable with post-19th century technologies, time travel, and the [[TARDIS]]; she is repeatedly seen using technology devices, and in the episode "[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]", she is seen wearing and using the Sonic Gauntlet designed for that episode.&lt;ref name="deep breath"/&gt;&lt;ref name=child_designs&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Peter viewers make Dr Who gadgets|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/25403565|website=[[Ariel (newspaper)|ariel]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 August 2015|ref=child_designs_anchor|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strax====
Strax is a member of the warrior [[Sontaran]] alien race. Strax was forced to serve as a nurse, healing the injured as a punishment&lt;ref name="a good man"/&gt; for being defeated by the Doctor during the Sontaran invasion of Earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This is contrary to the Sontaran's warrior instincts and mentality and as such, Strax has been known to occasionally slip back to his Sontaran ways and mannerisms. In "A Good Man Goes to War", he states that he is nearly 12, suggesting that this is quite old for a Sontaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/doctor-who-a-good-man-goes-to-war-review/ |title=Doctor Who "A Good Man Goes To War" - TV Review |first=Dave |last=Golder |work=GamesRadar |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A running gag is Strax's inability to tell the difference between genders and his obsession with using violent tactics.

==== Storylines ====
In their first appearance in "A Good Man Goes to War", the three, along with others who owe him favours, are chosen by the [[Eleventh Doctor]] to help him save [[Amy Pond]] from [[Madame Kovarian]] and the [[Headless Monks|Order of the Headless Monks]] at Demons Run.&lt;ref name="vastra bio"/&gt; At the time, Strax is a Sontaran "nurse" taking care of the wounded soldiers on a battlefield as part of a penance imposed on him. Before he can answer Captain Harcourt who came up with this penance, the Doctor arrives in his [[TARDIS]] to take him to Demons Run. They fight together against their enemies and succeed in saving Amy, but Strax is mortally wounded and appears to die after saying his last words to [[Rory Williams]].&lt;ref name="a good man"/&gt;

In "The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later", a webcast set two days after the events of "A Good Man Goes to War", Strax is awakened by Vastra and Jenny, after they heal his wounds, and accepts their proposition to join them in London in 1888.&lt;ref name="doctorwhotv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demons run"/&gt; He subsequently becomes their butler.

They then appear in "[[The Snowmen]]" (2012), trying to convince the Eleventh Doctor to come out of retirement (into which he has retreated after losing Amy and Rory in "[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]"). They help the Doctor's future new companion [[Clara Oswald]] to find him and support them in their fight against the [[Great Intelligence]]. A high fall kills Clara, whose death indirectly lets the Doctor defeat the Great Intelligence.&lt;ref name="the snowmen"/&gt;

The trio — and more particularly Jenny — have a central role in the first half of "[[The Crimson Horror]]" (2013), set in 1893, in which they investigate a series of strange deaths. They travel to [[Yorkshire]], where Jenny infiltrates a suspect community called Sweetville, led by Mrs Gillyflower. She finds the Eleventh Doctor, kept prisoner in Sweetville, and the trio reunites to help him defeat Mrs Gillyflower, by sabotaging the rocket she was planning to use to poison the skies. They discover that Clara appears to be alive (the Doctor's companion being another version of the one seen in "The Snowmen", coming from another era), but the Doctor does not explain why to Jenny, as he himself does not know the answer at this time.&lt;ref name="the crimson horror"/&gt;

The three characters reappear in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]] finale "[[The Name of the Doctor]]", where they organise a meeting in a dream with Clara and [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]]. During the "conference call", the three are captured by the Whisper Men, minions of the Great Intelligence, who uses them as bait to bring the Eleventh Doctor to his tomb on the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#T|Trenzalore]]. The Doctor unhesitatingly goes to rescue them, recalling their caring and concern for him in "The Snowmen" and feeling a duty towards them. After the Doctor arrives on Trenzalore with Clara, the Great Intelligence scatters itself across the Doctor's timeline to destroy him. As history changes, Jenny disappears and Strax forgets his friendship with Vastra and attacks her, forcing her to defend herself.  She points a weapon at him and it glows, but Strax disappears suddenly, leaving Vastra bewildered and calling his name.  After Clara enters the timestream to save the Doctor and undo the Great Intelligence's changes to history, Jenny and Strax are restored.&lt;ref name="name of the doctor"/&gt;

In "[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]", the first episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth series]], Vastra, Jenny and Strax arrive in central London to witness a dinosaur marching through the city and proceeding to cough up the TARDIS. Upon finding the TARDIS, they find emerging from it a recently [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerated]] [[Twelfth Doctor]], who falls unconscious. The three, along with Clara, take him back to their home to rest, while they attempt to solve the problem of the dinosaur. However, the Doctor soon wakes up and tries to solve it himself, only to witness the dinosaur [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]], and Vastra informs the Doctor that there have been similar murders recently. The Doctor vanishes thereafter and Clara becomes a temporary member of the Paternoster Gang, working with them in an effort to locate the Doctor and investigate the dinosaur's death. Together, they find a message in a newspaper directed at Clara, leading to her reunion with the Doctor. The Doctor and Clara go searching for the culprit; when they are about to be killed by robots, the Paternoster Gang rescue them, fighting along with Clara until the Doctor defeats their leader, leading all robots to be deactivated and saving his friends. After the Doctor takes off, leaving Clara in Victorian London, Clara asks Vastra if she can stay with them. Vastra states that she is of course welcome, but she should have no doubt of the Doctor's return. The Doctor then indeed comes back to pick her up, and they leave the house to bring Clara back home.&lt;ref name="deep breath"/&gt;

In November 2013, the long-running children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'' announced a competition for fans aged 6–15 to design 'sonic devices' for the characters, with the three winning designs appearing in Series 8.

[[Image:Manitoo.svg|150px|right|thumb|The word "manitou" (in both [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]) written in [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]].]]

'''Manitou''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|ɪ|t|uː}}), akin to the [[Iroquois]] ''[[orenda]]'', is the spiritual and fundamental life force among [[Algonquian people|Algonquian groups]] in the [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American mythology]]. It is omnipresent and manifests everywhere: [[organism]]s, the environment, events, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bragdon|first1=Kathleen J.|title=The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aashaa monetoo'' means "good [[spirit]]", while ''otshee monetoo'' means "bad spirit." When the world was created, the [[Great Spirit]], ''Aasha Monetoo'', gave the land to the [[indigenous peoples]], the [[Shawnee]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of Tecumseh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''manitou'' was already in widespread use at the time of early European contact. In 1585, when [[Thomas Harriot]] recorded the first glossary of an Algonquian language, [[Carolina Algonquian language|Roanoke (Pamlico)]], he included the word ''mantóac'', meaning "gods" (plural). Similar terms are found in nearly all of the Algonquian [[language]]s.

In some Algonquian [[tradition]]s, ''[[Gitche Manitou]]'' refers to a "[[Great Spirit|great spirit]]" or supreme being. The term has analogues dating to before European contact, and the word uses of ''gitche'' and ''manitou'' themselves existed prior to contact. After contact, however, ''[[Gitche Manitou]]'' was adopted by some [[Anishinaabe]] [[Christian]] groups, such as the [[Ojibwe]], to refer to the [[monotheistic]] [[God]] of Abrahamic tradition, often due to [[missionary]] [[syncretism]].

Algonquian [[religion]] acknowledges shamans, or [[Medicine man|medicine men]], who used manitou to see the future, change the weather, and heal illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenik|first1=Edward J.|title=Making Pictures in Stone: American Indian Rock Art of the Northeast|date=2009|publisher=University of Alabama Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojibwe shamans were primarily healers who used their spiritual connection to cure patients, since illness was believed to be caused by magic and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Christina|title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism, Volume 2|date=2007|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To communicate with spirits and manipulate manitou, a shaman would enter a [[trance]], induced by singing, dancing, drum beats, or the use of [[hallucinogen]]s. Non-shamans could also interact with spirits by embarking upon a "vision quest," by means of [[prayer]], [[fasting]], hallucinogens, and/or removing themselves from the society of others. A person who underwent vision quests would be visited by an "animal, voice, or object," which would become his (or her) guardian spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenik|first1=Edward J.|title=Making Pictures in Stone: American Indian Rock Art of the Northeast|date=2009|publisher=University of Alabama Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shamanistic]] tradition, manitous (or ''manidoog'', or ''manidoowag'') are connected to achieve a desired effect; plant manitous may be connected for healing, or buffalo manitous for a good hunt.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]&lt;/sup&gt; In the [[Anishinaabe]]g tradition, ''manidoowag'' are one aspect of the Great Connection. The Anishinaabeg use the term ''manidoowish'' to speak of small animal ''manidoowag'', and ''manidoons'' to speak of insect ''manidoowag''.  Both ''manidoowish'' and ''manidoons'' mean "little spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastcree.org/cree/en/dictionary/|title=East Cree Dictionaries}}{{full citation|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Manitou has made its way into the names of several places in [[North America]].  The name of [[Lake Manitoba]] (for which the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]] is named) derives from the area called ''manitou-wapow'', or "strait of the Manitou" in [[Cree language|Cree]] or [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]], referring to the strange sound of waves crashing against rocks near the Narrows of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/events/origins.html The Origin of the Name Manitoba]. Province of Manitoba. Retrieved on 15 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184444/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/events/origins.html |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manitoba is also home to [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]]’s [[petroforms]], symbols made from rocks, which serve as reminders of the instructions given to the Anishinaabe by the Creator. The Anishinaabe [[Midewiwin]], or Grand Medicine Society, considers the area containing the petroforms to be Manito Ahbee, the place where God sits. It is the site where the original Anishinaabe was lowered from the sky to the ground by the Creator.
[[File:Manitoulin Island.jpg|thumb|Manitoulin Island]]
[[Manitoulin Island]], called ''mnidoo mnis'', or "[[island]] of the Great Spirit," by the [[Odawa]], is very important to the [[Ojibwe]], or Anishinaabe, because of its many sacred sites and sounding rocks. Native peoples continue to dwell on the island, which is host to several reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manitoulin Island|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/manitoulin-island/|website=Historica Canada|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meskwaki|Fox Indians]], or [[Meskwaki]], believed that the manitou dwelt in the stones of the [[sweat lodge]]. When the lodge stove was lit and water was sprinkled on the stones, manitou left those stones in the steam from the [[Evaporation|evaporating]] water and entered the body of the person in the lodge. Manitou then migrated throughout the person’s body, driving out everything that inflicted pain. Before the manitou returned to the stone, it imparted some of its nature to the body, which, according to the [[Meskwaki|Fox Indians]], was why one felt so well after having been in the sweat lodge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/hotrock.htm Native American Sweat Lodge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214152651/http://cyberbohemia.com/Pages/hotrock.htm |date=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]], the Manitou Islands and the water body between them and the mainland, the Maintou Passage; are named for Manitou.

'''Paul Quinn''' (c. 1986 – 20 October 2007) was a young man from [[County Armagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]] who was murdered in 2007. His family subsequently accused the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] of his murder, though no-one has ever been convicted in relation to his death.

==Attack, torture, and murder in Tullycoora==
On 20 October 2007, a native of [[Cullyhanna]], [[County Armagh]], Paul Quinn, then 21 years old, was lured to a farm at Tullycoora, near Oram in [[County Monaghan]], where three of his friends were held hostage. When he arrived at the farm, a group of some ten or more men beat him with iron and nail-studded bars for upwards of half an hour, breaking every major bone in his body. Quinn was taken at around 18:00 to [[Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (Drogheda)|Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital]], [[Drogheda]], where he died two hours later.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/debateni/provos-still-getting-away-with-murder-and-with-a-barrage-of-shamfaced-lies-31478095.html|title=Provos still getting away with murder and with a barrage of shamfaced lies|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of Quinn family==
Quinn's parents, Breege and Stephen, have said that members of the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade]] were responsible. Their son had had "run-ins with the Cullyhanna ASU on a number of occasions", and had "floored" the son of one of the [[active service unit]] (ASU) leaders in a pub row.

Following the incident, the mother of the young man appeared at Quinn's family home with a hammer in her hand and told the family their son would have to leave Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/loss-of-face-led-to-brutal-ira-killing-1222397.html|title=Loss of face led to brutal IRA killing|newspaper=Irish Independent|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sf-denials-on-savage-killing-fall-on-deaf-ears-26327907.html|title=SF denials on savage killing fall on deaf ears|newspaper=Irish Independent|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' slur on our murdered boy|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/sinn-fein-leader-gerry-adams-slur-on-our-murdered-boy-30693492.html|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder is believed to have arisen as a result of a dispute between Quinn and the local IRA.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Quinn's mother tells Haass post-Good Friday Agreement victims must be remembered|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25096432|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMC report==
In November 2007, the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]'s John Grieve, stated that "We do believe that those involved ... included people who are members or former members, or have associations with members or former members, of the Provisional IRA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence - Draft List of Deaths Related to the Conflict in 2007|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/deaths2007draft.htm|publisher=CAIN|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reports==
An ''[[Irish Independent]]'' report of September 2007 stated:&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph.co.uk"/&gt; {{quote|The people believed locally to have been responsible for directing the murder of Paul Quinn, who had every major bone in his body broken in a prolonged beating with iron bars and pickaxe handles by nine men, are brothers, both long-serving IRA men who are heavily involved in fuel smuggling. They are also closely associated with Thomas Murphy, the local IRA boss who holds sway over what is now a crime empire in the border area.}}

In October 2011, his parents were featured in an [[RTÉ]] news report, stating they still believe people living locally "know all about" the murder and have called on them to go to [[An Garda Síochána]] or the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) to "get it off their chest'."{{cn|date=February 2016}}

==Reactions==
[[His Eminence]] [[Seán Cardinal Brady]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]], spoke out against the murder and appealed for the arrest of those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicbishops.ie/2007/10/23/archbishop-sean-brady’s-statement-murder-paul-quinn|title=Archbishop Seán Brady's statement on the murder of Paul Quinn|date=23 October 2007|work=catholicbishops.ie|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] peer, [[John Laird, Baron Laird|Lord Laird of Artigarvan]], invoked [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]] in the [[House of Lords]] to name the alleged killers, stating that the killing arose from a dispute between Quinn and the son of Vincent Traynor, whom he described as "a local IRA chief". He also raised at Westminster allegations by the Quinn family and other locals that one of the men used as 'bait' in the Quinn death is under threat from the South Armagh Provisionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Henry McDonald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/27/northernireland.henrymcdonald |title=Update on Quinn murder |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 January 2008 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-493341/Peer-names-IRA-executioners-beat-man-death.html|title=Peer names IRA 'executioners' who beat man to death|date=13 November 2007|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ATWadmin |date=13 November 2008 |url=http://www.atangledweb.org/?p=7106 |title=Read This – The Look of Peace |publisher=atangledweb.org |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of body of Gerard Evans==
The murder of Paul Quinn led indirectly to the discovery of the body of another victim of the Provisional IRA, [[Gerard Evans]], a 24 year old from [[Crossmaglen]], who had gone missing after being kidnapped by the organisation in 1979. In 2009 the ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' newspaper received information from an Irish republican and former IRA volunteer about the location of Evans' body, who stated that he had been influenced in coming forward by the circumstances of Paul Quinn's death. The information provided led to the location of Evans' body in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;'Masked IRA man's map leads to a body in Louth', 'Sunday Tribune, 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenNN''' (Open Neural Networks Library) is a [[software library]] written in the [[C++]] [[programming language]] which implements [[neural networks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/06/opennn-open-source-library-neural-networks.html|title=OpenNN, An Open Source Library For Neural Networks | publisher=KDNuggets | date= June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a main area of [[deep learning]] research. The library is [[open-source software|open-source]], licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].

==Characteristics==

The software implements any number of layers of non-linear processing units for [[supervised learning]]. This deep architecture allows the design of neural networks with [[Universal approximation theorem|universal approximation]] properties. Additionally, it allows [[multiprocessing]] programming by means of [[OpenMP]], in order to increase [[computer performance]].

OpenNN contains [[data mining]] algorithms as a bundle of functions. These can be embedded in other software tools, using an [[application programming interface]], for the integration of the [[predictive analytics]] tasks. In this regard, a graphical user interface is missing but some functions can be supported by specific visualization tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/6491835/Categorization_of_Data_Mining_Tools_Based_on_Their_Types_ | title=Categorization of Data Mining Tools Based on Their Types | author=J. Mary Dallfin Bruxella| journal = International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 445–452 | year = 2014 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The development started in 2003 at the [[International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering | International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE)]], within the research project funded by the [[European Union]] called RAMFLOOD (Risk Assessment and Management of FLOODs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/67049_en.html |title=CORDIS - EU Research Project RAMFLOOD |publisher=European Commission | date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it continued as part of similar projects.
At present, OpenNN is being developed by the [[startup company]] Artelnics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artelnics.com |title=Artelnics home page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

OpenNN is a general purpose [[artificial intelligence]] software package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=142005|title=Here Are 7 Thought-Provoking AI Software Packages For Your Info|publisher=Saurabh Singh|accessdate=25 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627090333/http://efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=142005|archive-date=2014-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[machine learning]] techniques for solving [[data mining]] and [[predictive analytics]] tasks in different fields. For instance, the library has been applied in the engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.2304/abstract|title= Neural Networks for Variational Problems in Engineering | author = R.

"'''Osama bin Laden as the Crucified Christ'''" is a single from [[Against Me!]], released on 7" coloured vinyl on April 18, 2015, on Total Treble Music, as a limited edition for Record Store Day 2015. The track, which originally appeared on the 2014 album ''[[Transgender Dysphoria Blues]]'', appears in two versions: a live version, from ''[[23 Live Sex Acts]]'', and an exclusive alternate version referred to as the "extra dysphoric version" performed solely by frontwoman [[Laura Jane Grace]].

==Background==
The single was released as a limited-edition 7" single for [[Record Store Day]]. The song, before its album was released in 2014, was first played in January 2012 at [[Slamdance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.punknews.org/article/45937/against-me-premiere-new-songs-at-slamdance&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests, the song refers to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[death of Osama bin Laden|death]] of [[Osama bin Laden]] in 2011. The lyrics also refer to [[Death of Benito Mussolini|executions]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] and his mistress [[Clara Petacci|Claretta "Clara" Petacci]], as well as the public display of their corpses in [[Piazzale Loreto]], in 1945.

'''Prenatal care''', also known as '''antenatal care''', is a type of [[preventive healthcare]]. Its goal is to provide regular check-ups that allow doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and to promote healthy lifestyles that benefit both mother and child.&lt;ref name="Prenatal Care (nlm.nih.gov)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prenatal Care (MedicineNet)" /&gt; During check-ups, pregnant women receive medical information over [[maternal physiological changes in pregnancy]], biological changes, and [[prenatal nutrition]] including [[prenatal vitamins]]. Recommendations on management and healthy lifestyle changes are also made during regular check-ups. The availability of routine prenatal care, including [[prenatal diagnosis|prenatal screening and diagnosis]], has played a part in reducing the frequency of [[maternal death]], [[miscarriage]]s, [[birth defects]], [[low birth weight]], [[neonatal infection]]s and other preventable health problems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2015 around 830 women died every day from problems in pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/maternal_health/mortality/maternal_mortality_text/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=WHO|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5 lived in high-income countries. The rest lived in low-income countries.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. The study, between 1997 and 2008, looked at 21,708 women giving birth in a region of Spain. The results indicated that very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) were much more common for immigrants than locals (Castelló et al., 2012). The study showed the importance of prenatal care and how universal prenatal care would help people of all origins get proper care before pregnancy/birth (Castelló et al., 2012).

The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive four antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive four visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/early-anc-estimates/en/|title=Early antenatal care visit: a systematic analysis of regional and global levels and trends of coverage from 1990 to 2013|website=WHO|publisher=World Health Organisation|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways of changing health systems to help women access antenatal care, such as new health policies, educating health workers and health service reorganisation. Community interventions to help people change their behavior can also play a part. Examples of interventions are media campaigns reaching many people, enabling communities to take control of their own health, informative-education-communication interventions and financial incentives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mbuagbaw|first1=L|last2=Medley|first2=N|last3=Darzi|first3=AJ|last4=Richardson|first4=M|last5=Habiba Garga|first5=K|last6=Ongolo-Zogo|first6=P|title=Health system and community level interventions for improving antenatal care coverage and health outcomes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=1 December 2015|volume=12|pages=CD010994|pmid=26621223|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010994.pub2|pmc=4676908}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review looking at these interventions found that one intervention helps improve the number of women receiving antenatal care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life, lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Traditional prenatal care in high-income countries generally consists of:
* monthly visits during the first two [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimesters]] (from the 1st week to the 28th week)
* fortnightly visits from the 28th week to the 36th week of pregnancy
* weekly visits after 36th week to the delivery, from the 38th week to the 42nd week
* Assessment of parental needs and family dynamics

The traditional form of antenatal care has developed from the early 1900s and there is very little research to suggest that it is the best way of giving antenatal care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dowswell|first1=T|last2=Carroli|first2=G|last3=Duley|first3=L|last4=Gates|first4=S|last5=Gülmezoglu|first5=AM|last6=Khan-Neelofur|first6=D|last7=Piaggio|first7=G|title=Alternative versus standard packages of antenatal care for low-risk pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000934|pmid=26184394|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000934.pub3|pmc=4164448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antenatal care can be costly and uses a lot of staff. The following paragraphs describe research on other forms of antenatal care, which may reduce the burden on maternity services in all countries.

==Visits numbers==

There is not a lot of evidence behind the number of antenatal visits, pregnant women receive and what care and information is given at each visit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It has been suggested that women who have low-risk pregnancies should have a less antenatal visits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, when this was tested, women with less visits had babies who were much more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care and stay there for longer (though this could down to chance results).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 14% more babies died compared with those whose mothers had a standard number of visits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women who had less antenatal visits were not as satisfied with the care they received compared with women who had the standard number of visits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A new alternative for some of the routine prenatal care visits is [[Telemedicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronichealthreporter.com/health-it-startup-doxy-me/|title=Health IT Startup: Doxy.me - Electronic Health Reporter|website=electronichealthreporter.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group versus individual care==

Group antenatal care has a couple of obvious benefits: it costs less than one-to-one visits and the women have more hours of care as a group than on their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Catling|first1=CJ|last2=Medley|first2=N|last3=Foureur|first3=M|last4=Ryan|first4=C|last5=Leap|first5=N|last6=Teate|first6=A|last7=Homer|first7=CS|title=Group versus conventional antenatal care for women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=4 February 2015|volume=2|pages=CD007622|pmid=25922865|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007622.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only small studies have been conducted looking at group care but they have found that mothers’ knew more about pregnancy, birth and parenting in the group setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The mothers reported liking the group care and the review found no difference between how the pregnancies developed between the group and individual setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Midwife-led care==

Midwife-led care for low-risk women is where a midwife team (and GP if needed) is leading the care a woman receives and she does not usually see a specialist doctor in her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathways.nice.org.uk/#path=view%3A/pathways/antenatal-care/routine-care-for-all-pregnant-women.xml&amp;content=view-node%3Anodes-basic-principles-of-antenatal-care|title=Everything NICE says on a topic in an interactive flowchart|website=NICE|publisher=National Institute for Health Care and Excellemce|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with midwife-led pregnancies are more likely to give birth without being induced but have natural labours. However they are less likely to have their waters broken, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or preterm birth.&lt;ref name=Soltani2016&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Soltani|first2=H|last3=Gates|first3=S|last4=Shennan|first4=A|last5=Devane|first5=D|date=28 April 2016|title=Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women.|url=http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3352/1/JPHCCochraneCornerDec2013.pdf|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD004667|doi=10.1002/14651858|pmid=27121907|via=|last1=Sandall|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same number of women in each group had a caesarean section.&lt;ref name=Soltani2016 /&gt;

==Prenatal examinations==
{{main article|Prenatal diagnosis}}
At the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk.

In many countries, women are given a summary of their case notes including important background information about their pregnancy for example their medical history, growth charts and any scan reports.&lt;ref name="pmid26465209"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=HC|last2=Smith|first2=HJ|last3=Mori|first3=R|last4=Noma|first4=H|title=Giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 October 2015|volume=10|pages=CD002856|pmid=26465209|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002856.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive.&lt;ref name="pmid26465209"/&gt;

A review looking into women keeping their own case notes shows they have more risk of having a caesarean section.&lt;ref name="pmid26465209"/&gt; However the women reported feeling more in control having their notes and would like to have them again in future pregnancies.&lt;ref name="pmid26465209"/&gt; 25% of women reported their hospital notes were lost in hospital though none of the women forgot to take their own notes to any appointments.&lt;ref name="pmid26465209"/&gt;

Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that "Prenatal Diagnosis" and "Prenatal Screening" refer to two different types of tests) is [[Experiment|testing]] for diseases or conditions in a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] before it is born. [[Obstetricians]] and [[midwives]] have the ability to monitor mother's health and [[prenatal development]] during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups.

Physical examinations generally consist of:
* Collection of (mother's) [[medical history]]
* Checking (mother's) [[blood pressure]]
* (Mother's) height and weight
* [[Pelvic exam]]
* [[Doppler fetal heart rate monitor]]ing
* (Mother's) [[blood test|blood]] and [[urine test]]s
* Discussion with caregiver

In some countries, such as the UK, the symphysial fundal height (SFH) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg62/chapter/appendix-d-antenatal-appointments-schedule-and-content|title=Antenatal care for uncomplicated pregnancies|website=NICE|publisher=National Institute for Health Care and Excellemce|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The SFH is measured from the woman’s pubic bone to the top of the uterus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perinatal.org.uk/fetalgrowth/FundalHeight.aspx|title=Fetal Growth - Fundal Height Measurements|website=Perinatal Institute|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A review into this practice found only one piece of research so there is not enough evidence to say whether measuring the SFH helps to detect small or large babies.&lt;ref name="pmid26346107"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robert Peter|first1=J|last2=Ho|first2=JJ|last3=Valliapan|first3=J|last4=Sivasangari|first4=S|title=Symphysial fundal height (SFH) measurement in pregnancy for detecting abnormal fetal growth.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 September 2015|volume=9|pages=CD008136|pmid=26346107|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008136.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As measuring the SFH is not costly and is used in many places, the review recommends carrying on this practice.&lt;ref name="pmid26346107"/&gt;

Growth charts are a way of detecting small babies by the measuring the SFH.&lt;ref name="pmid24830409"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carberry|first1=AE|last2=Gordon|first2=A|last3=Bond|first3=DM|last4=Hyett|first4=J|last5=Raynes-Greenow|first5=CH|last6=Jeffery|first6=HE|title=Customised versus population-based growth charts as a screening tool for detecting small for gestational age infants in low-risk pregnant women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 May 2014|volume=5|pages=CD008549|pmid=24830409|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008549.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of growth chart: 
#Population based chart which shows a standard growth and size for each baby 
#Customized growth chart which is worked out by looking at the mother’s height and weight, and the weights of their previous babies.&lt;ref name="pmid24830409"/&gt; 
A review looking into which of these charts detected small babies found that there is no good quality research to show which is best.&lt;ref name="pmid24830409"/&gt; More research is needed before the customized growth charts are recommended because they cost more money and take more time for the health care workers to make.&lt;ref name="pmid24830409"/&gt;

Ultrasound
[[Obstetric ultrasonography|Obstetric ultrasound]]s are most commonly performed during the second trimester at approximately week 20. Ultrasounds are considered relatively safe and have been used for over 35 years for monitoring pregnancy.
Among other things, ultrasounds are used to:
* Diagnose pregnancy (uncommon)
* Check for multiple fetuses
* Assess possible risks to the mother (e.g., [[miscarriage]], [[blighted ovum]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], or a [[molar pregnancy]] condition)
* Check for fetal malformation (e.g., [[club foot]], [[spina bifida]], [[cleft palate]], clenched fists)
* Determine if an [[intrauterine growth retardation]] condition exists
* Note the development of fetal body parts (e.g., [[heart]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[stomach]], [[human skull|skull]], other [[bone]]s)
* Check the [[amniotic fluid]] and [[umbilical cord]] for possible problems
* Determine due date (based on measurements and relative developmental progress)

Generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following:
* 7 weeks — confirm pregnancy, ensure that it's neither molar or ectopic, determine due date

A review looking at routine ultrasounds past 24 weeks found that there is no evidence to show any benefits to the mother or the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bricker|first1=L|last2=Medley|first2=N|last3=Pratt|first3=JJ|title=Routine ultrasound in late pregnancy (after 24 weeks' gestation).|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 June 2015|volume=6|pages=CD001451|pmid=26121659|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001451.pub4|pmc=4160656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early scans mean that multiple pregnancies can be detected at an early stage of pregnancy&lt;ref name="pmid26171896"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitworth|first1=M|last2=Bricker|first2=L|last3=Mullan|first3=C|title=Ultrasound for fetal assessment in early pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD007058|pmid=26171896|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007058.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also gives more accurate due dates so that less women are induced who do not need to be.&lt;ref name="pmid26171896"/&gt;

Levels of feedback from the ultrasound can differ. High feedback is when the parents can see the screen and are given a detailed description of what they can see.&lt;ref name="pmid26241793"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabhan|first1=AF|last2=Aflaifel|first2=N|title=High feedback versus low feedback of prenatal ultrasound for reducing maternal anxiety and improving maternal health behaviour in pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=4 August 2015|volume=8|pages=CD007208|pmid=26241793|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007208.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low feedback is when the findings are discussed at the end and the parents are given a picture of the ultrasound.&lt;ref name="pmid26241793"/&gt; The different ways of giving feedback affect how much the parents worry and the mother’s health behaviour although there is not enough evidence to make clear conclusions.&lt;ref name="pmid26241793"/&gt; In a small study, mothers receiving high feedback were more likely to stop smoking and drinking alcohol however the quality of the study is low and more research is needed to say for certain which type of feedback is better.&lt;ref name="pmid26241793"/&gt;

Women experiencing a complicated pregnancy may have a test called a Doppler ultrasound to look at the blood flow to their unborn baby.&lt;ref name="pmid25874722"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfirevic|first1=Z|last2=Stampalija|first2=T|last3=Medley|first3=N|title=Fetal and umbilical Doppler ultrasound in normal pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=15 April 2015|volume=4|pages=CD001450|pmid=25874722|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001450.pub4|pmc=4171458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is performed to detect signs that the baby is not getting a normal blood flow and therefore is ‘at risk’. A review looked at performing Doppler ultrasounds on all women even if they were at ‘low-risk’ of having complications.&lt;ref name="pmid25874722"/&gt; The review found that routine Doppler ultrasounds may have reduced preventable numbers of baby deaths but the evidence was not strong enough to recommend that they should be made routine for all pregnant women.&lt;ref name="pmid25874722"/&gt;

==United States==
{{main article|Prenatal care in the United States}}

Proper prenatal care affects all women of various social backgrounds. While availability of such services have considerable personal health and social benefits, socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in both developing and developed nations, such as the US. Although women can benefit by utilizing prenatal care services, there exists various levels of health care accessibility between different demographics throughout the United States.

'''Roger Williamson''' (2 February 1948 – 29 July 1973) was a British [[Auto racing|racing driver]] who died during the [[1973 Dutch Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort Circuit]] in the Netherlands.

==Biography==
Williamson was born in [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], Leicestershire. He won the 1971 and 1972 [[British Formula 3 Championship]] titles. In 1973, he was offered a drive in the [[March Engineering]] works [[Formula One]] team.
This was after testing for the [[BRM]] team and being advised not to take the drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pitlane.gr/index.php/en/afieromata/drivers/item/186-roger-williamson-02-02-48-29-07-73 pitlane.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://silodrome.com/roger-williamson/ silodrome.com - Roger Williamson]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fatal accident at 1973 Dutch Grand Prix (3).jpg|thumb|The scene of Williamson's fatal accident as [[Gijs van Lennep]] passes.]]
After his Formula One debut at the [[1973 British Grand Prix]], Williamson's second Formula One appearance was at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort Circuit]]. On his eighth lap, a suspected tyre failure caused his car to flip upside down and catch fire. Williamson had not been seriously injured by the impact, but was trapped under the car which was swiftly engulfed in flame. The track marshals were both poorly trained and badly equipped, and did not assist him. Another driver, [[David Purley]], upon witnessing the crash of his friend, abandoned his own race and pulled over in a desperate and valiant attempt to rescue Williamson. He ran across the track to Williamson's car and tried to turn it upright, before grabbing a fire extinguisher from a marshal and returning to the engulfed car. He emptied it on the car and signalled for others to help. Purley's efforts to turn the car upright and extinguish the flames were in vain, and the marshals were unable to handle the vehicle without flame retardant overalls. Purley later stated he could hear Williamson's screams from underneath the car, but by the time the first fire engine arrived and the fire was extinguished, Williamson had died of [[asphyxiation]]. As most racers mistakenly identified Purley as the driver of the crashed car, and therefore thought the burning car to be empty, none of them stopped to help and the race continued, even as Purley stood on the circuit and gestured with his hands for them to stop.&lt;ref name="Accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eedXKxk_erI |title=Roger Williamson Formula One Fatal Crash }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the track marshals were wearing normal blazers and not the fire-resistant overalls which the drivers wore, and thus were not able to go near the large flames. Purley was later awarded the [[George Medal]] for the bravery he displayed in attempting to rescue Williamson. A series of photos of the incident, showing a clearly desperate and ultimately dejected Purley, won that year's [[World Press Photo]] award for Photo Sequences. Williamson's incinerated remains would later be cremated with his ashes being sent to an undisclosed area. In the years following the accident, fire-resistant clothing would become mandatory for all trackside marshals so that they would be able to assist in the event of a fire. The next few years also saw a noticeable increase in drivers stopping at accident sites to assist in rescue efforts, notably at the [[1976 German Grand Prix]].

In 2003, on the thirtieth anniversary of his fatal crash, a bronze statue of Williamson was unveiled at the [[Donington Park]] circuit in his native Leicestershire. Then-owner [[Tom Wheatcroft]] had provided financial backing to Williamson, and described the day Williamson died as "the saddest day of my life".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asag.sk/bio/williamson.htm |accessdate=10 August 2011 |title=Roger Williamson biography |publisher=Anton Sukup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SS ''Benjamin Noble''''' was a [[lake freighter]] that operated on the [[Great Lakes]].  Built in 1909 by the [[Dry Dock Complex (Detroit, Michigan)|Detroit Shipbuilding Company]], she was {{convert|239|ft|m}} in length and had a beam of {{convert|40|ft|m}}.  She was built as a "[[canaller]]," a vessel designed for use in what were then the dimensions of the [[Welland Canal]], but was converted by her owners for services in the open Great Lakes.  Heavily laden and top-heavy with a cargo of railroad rails, she sank in [[Lake Superior]] near [[Knife River, Minnesota]], in April 1914 with the loss of all hands&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite book |first= Dwight |last= [[Dwight Boyer|Boyer]] |title= Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes |year= 1968 |publisher= [[Dodd, Mead and Company]] |location= New York  |pages= 28–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a storm. Of the estimated 16 crew members, only about the names of 10 are known.&lt;ref name=Noble1&gt;[http://www3.gendisasters.com/ship-wrecks/20767/update-on-quotbenjamin-noble-quot-lost-1914-partial-crew-list GenDisasters Website]&lt;/ref&gt; On  April 29, 1914 it was reported several crewmembers' remains were found on a sand reef near Minnesota Reef.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89074404/1914-04-29/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1914&amp;index=2&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Benjamin+Noble+steamer&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;sort=relevance&amp;state=&amp;date2=1914&amp;proxtext=Steamer+Benjamin+Noble&amp;y=17&amp;x=4&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=3 Grand Forks daily herald and the evening times., April 29, 1914, Image 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than 90 years as a [[ghost ship]], the hulk of the ''Benjamin Noble'' was rediscovered in the autumn of 2004.&lt;ref name="Benj.Noble"/&gt; The wreck was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007 as NRHP site #07000984.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/07000984 |title=''Benjamin Noble'' (shipwreck) |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=March 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The ''Benjamin Noble'' was unique among [[Lake freighter]]s because her stern cabins were elevated on a [[poop deck]]. Her bow cabins were also elevated on a [[forecastle]] deck. This also meant that she sat quite low in the water meaning that her [[spar deck]] often got wet.  Maritime historian [[Dwight Boyer]] attributes the 1914 loss of the vessel to a combination of deliberate cargo overloading and the ship's unusual design.  On her last voyage the low-riding vessel had very little [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and was vulnerable to swamping.&lt;ref name="Boyer"/&gt;

==Discovery==
In the Autumn of 2004 a shipwreck research team consisting of Jerry Eliason, Kraig Smith, Ken Merryman and Randy Beebe were searching for the [[SS Robert Wallace|''Robert Wallace'']] when their side scan sonar picked up the outlines of a shipwreck.&lt;ref name="Benj.Noble"/&gt; Randy Beebe describes the event:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the last pass of the day, which was going to be the last day of the search season. We were just going to pull up the side-scan sonar and head in, and we noticed a target on the screen. So right away we headed over there and investigated it more with the side-scan sonar, and sure enough we had a shipwreck.&lt;ref name="Benj.Noble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/07/20_hemphills_superiorwreck/ |title=Mystery Ship Found |work=Minnesota Public Radio |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The team was expecting to see the ''Wallace'', but the ship they found was made of steel. They were able to lower a camera into the cargo hold of the mystery ship. They saw railroad cars full of railroad tracks, this confirmed that the wreck was that of the long lost ''Benjamin Noble''.&lt;ref name="Benj.Noble"/&gt;

'''Shooting incident reconstruction''' is the examination of the [[Real evidence|physical evidence]] recovered or documented at the scene of a [[shooting]]. Shooting reconstruction may also include the laboratory analysis of the evidence recovered at the scene. The goal is an attempt to gain an understanding of what may or may not have happened during the incident. Once all reasonable explanations have been considered, one can evaluate the significance of witness or suspect accounts of the incident.

In many cases valuable evidence necessary for reconstruction analysis exists at the crime scene. Should this evidence go undocumented or unrecovered during the initial processing of the shooting scene, the information it can give investigators may be lost forever. Poor shooting incident processing can not be compensated for by excellent laboratory work.

There are many questions that can be answered from the proper reconstruction of a shooting incident. Some of the questions typically answered by a shooting reconstruction investigation include (but not limited to) the distance of the shooter from the target, The path of the bullet(s), The number of shots fired and possibly the sequence of multiple discharges at a shooting incident.

The [[Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners]] is an international [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the advancement of [[firearm]] and [[tool mark]] identification, including shooting reconstruction.

{{cquote|The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past—a recent past—delusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three ... nonentities—the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.&lt;ref name="JamesW" /&gt;}}

The concept was further developed by [[philosopher]] [[William James]].&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  James defined the specious present to be "the prototype of all conceived times... the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible". [[C. D. Broad]] in "Scientific Thought" (1930) further elaborated on the concept of the specious present, and considered that the Specious Present may be considered as the temporal equivalent of a sensory datum.

Finally, the claim of what precisely is being affirmed, in affirming the 'existence' of the specious present, is difficult to clarify. Philosophical theories of time do not usually interpret time to be in any unique way a production of human phenomenology, and the claim that we have some faculty by which we are aware of successive states of consciousness is trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience|title=The Experience and Perception of Time|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mammals]], it manifests as the formation of an embryo from a different [[estrous cycle]] while another embryo or fetus is already present in the [[uterus]]. When two separate instances of [[fertilisation]] occur during the same [[menstrual cycle]], it is known as [[superfecundation]].

Superfetation is claimed to be common in some species of animals. In [[mammals]], it can occur only where there are two uteri, or where the estrous cycle continues through [[pregnancy]].{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

==Other animals==
Animals that have been claimed to be subject to superfetation include [[rodent]]s ([[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s), rabbits, [[horse]], [[sheep]], [[marsupials]] ([[kangaroo]]s and [[sugar glider]]s), felines, and [[primate]]s ([[humans]]). Superfetation has also been clearly demonstrated and is normal for some species of [[poeciliid]] [[fish]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=superfetation FishBase's glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans==
While proposed cases of superfetation have been reported in humans, the existence of this phenomenon in humans is deemed unlikely.&lt;ref name=Mc2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=HC|last2=Kane|first2=SC|last3=Craig|first3=JM|last4=Short|first4=RV|last5=Umstad|first5=MP|title=A review of the mechanisms and evidence for typical and atypical twinning.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 2016|volume=214|issue=2|pages=172–191|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.10.930|pmid=26548710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better explanations include differential growth between twins due to various reasons such as [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Mc2016/&gt; Artificially induced superfetation has been demonstrated, although only up to a short period after insemination.&lt;ref name=Mc2016/&gt;

In 2017, it was reported that an American woman who had agreed to act as a surrogate for a Chinese couple birthed two babies initially believed to be twins. Before the adoptive parents could return home to China, however, it was discovered that one of the babies was in fact the biological son of the surrogate. Doctors confirmed that the birth-mother had become pregnant with her and her partner's child roughly three weeks after becoming pregnant with the Chinese couple's child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insideedition.com/surrogate-mom-gets-pregnant-while-carrying-another-couples-baby-37644&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple cases reported to local US doctors with a week or less difference in age of twins and women who report two surges of ovulation occurring within a few days of each other. Though rare, this condition is believe to effect as many as .3% of women but often one twin is lost so the true numbers are not known.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Research has found 10% of women ovulate twice per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3927-women-can-ovulate-more-than-once-a-month/|title=Women can ovulate more than once a month|last=Vince|first=Gaia|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward "Teddy" Sheean''' (28 December 1923 – 1 December 1942) was a sailor in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]]. Born in [[Tasmania]], Sheean was employed as a farm labourer when he enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve]] in April 1941. Following training at HMAS ''Derwent'' and the [[HMAS Cerberus, Victoria|Flinders Naval Depot]], he was posted to Sydney, where he joined the newly commissioned corvette [[HMAS Armidale (J240)|HMAS ''Armidale'']] in June 1942. Sheean served aboard ''Armidale'' as she initially took part in escort duties along the eastern Australian coast and in [[New Guinea]] waters, before he transferred with the ship to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in October, where ''Armidale'' was given the task of assisting Australian operations in [[Timor]].

On 29 November 1942, ''Armidale'' set out for an operation to Betano, Timor, along with [[HMAS Castlemaine|HMAS ''Castlemaine'']]. The two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination, missing a planned rendezvous with [[HMAS Kuru|HMAS ''Kuru'']]. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered ''Kuru'' south of Betano and it was decided by ''Castlemaine''{{'}}s commanding officer—as the senior officer—that ''Armidale'' and ''Kuru'' should make for Betano. The two ships took different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.

During a subsequent confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, ''Armidale'' was struck by two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He made his way to the aft [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon]] and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers, but was killed when ''Armidale'' sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously [[mentioned in despatches]]. In 1999, the submarine [[HMAS Sheean (SSG 77)|HMAS ''Sheean'']] was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean awarded the [[Victoria Cross for Australia]].

==Early life==
Sheean was born in Lower Barrington, Tasmania, on 28 December 1923, the youngest of fourteen children to James Sheean, a labourer, and his wife Mary Jane (née Broomhall).&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Watson |first=N. |year=2002 |id=A160265b |title=Sheean, Edward (1923–1942) |accessdate=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McKernan|p=155}} Soon after his birth, the Sheean family moved to [[Latrobe, Tasmania|Latrobe]], where he was educated at the local Catholic school. Following the completion of his schooling, Sheean gained casual employment working on several farms in the vicinity of Latrobe and Merseylea.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/8605.asp |title=Ordinary Seaman Edward (Teddy) Sheean |accessdate=26 March 2009 |work=Who’s who in Australian Military History |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
On 21 April 1941, Sheean enlisted in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=N&amp;veteranId=1163162|title=Sheean, Edward |accessdate=26 March 2009 |work=World War II Nominal Roll |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had followed in the steps of five of his brothers who had already joined the armed forces—four in the [[Australian Army]] and one in the Royal Australian Navy—for service in the Second World War.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;{{sfn|McKernan|p=155}} Sheean was initially posted to the [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]] naval base HMAS ''Derwent'' for training, where he gained a period of seafaring experience aboard HMAS ''Coombar'', an auxiliary [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], from 17–31 December.&lt;ref name="RAN bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/biography/seaman-edward-teddy-sheean |title=Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean |accessdate=26 March 2009 |author=J.H.

[[File:Sheean family 044155.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Members of the Sheean family c.1941. L to R, back row: Edward (Teddy); Frederick. Front row: James (father); Mary (mother); William.]]

Completing his course at the Flinders Naval Depot, Sheean was posted to the [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] naval base [[HMAS Kuttabul (naval base)|HMAS ''Penguin'']] in [[Sydney Harbour]] on 11 May.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; During his time with ''Penguin'', he was [[billet]]ed on the requisitioned ferry [[HMAS Kuttabul (ship)|HMAS ''Kuttabul'']]. Granted a period of leave later that month, he returned home to Tasmania. While he was on leave, Japanese midget submarines [[Attack on Sydney Harbour|attacked Sydney Harbour]] and sank ''Kuttabul'' on 31 May. Returning to Sydney eleven days after the raid, Sheean joined the newly commissioned {{sclass-|Bathurst|corvette|2}} HMAS ''Armidale'' as an [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun]] loader.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

Leaving Sydney Harbour in late August 1942, Sheean served aboard ''Armidale'' as she carried out "relatively uneventful" escort duties along the [[North Queensland]], [[Port Moresby]] and [[Milne Bay]] coasts over the subsequent two months.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RAN bio"/&gt; During October, ''Armidale'' was ordered to Darwin. Setting sail, she arrived on 7 November and was detailed to assist in the Australian operations in Timor.&lt;ref name="RAN bio"/&gt;{{sfn|Gill|p=214}}

===Sinking of ''Armidale''===
On 24 November 1942, the evacuation of the [[2/2nd Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/2nd Australian Independent Company]] from Timor along with 150 Portuguese people was approved by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Land Forces Headquarters. In response to this, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Cuthbert Pope, the Naval Officer-in-Charge Darwin, organised an operation utilizing HMA Ships [[HMAS Kuru|''Kuru'']], [[HMAS Castlemaine|''Castlemaine'']] and ''Armidale''. The operation was to involve the three ships undertaking two voyages each, the first to take place on the night of 30 November/1 December and involve a trip to Betano, Timor, in which the ships were to land 50 fresh Dutch guerrillas in the area along with supplies, and simultaneously withdraw 190 Dutch soldiers as well as the 150 Portuguese refugees. The second excursion was to be carried out on the night of 4/5 December, and entail the extraction of the 2/2nd Independent Company.{{sfn|Gill|pp=215–216}}

At 22:30 on 28 November 1942, ''Kuru'' set sail for Betano. ''Kuru'' was scheduled to arrive at approximately 20:30 on 30 November, where she was to unload the supplies on board and embark the Portuguese refugees, which were to transfer to ''Castlemaine'' once she arrived along with ''Armidale'' two hours later. However, ''Kuru'' hit bad weather during her voyage and arrived at Betano three hours late. ''Armidale''—with two Dutch Army officers, 61 [[Netherlands East Indies]] troops and three Australian Army soldiers aboard—and ''Castlemaine'' set sail from Darwin at 01:42 on 29 November. At approximately 09:15 on 30 November, while {{convert|190|km|nmi}} from their destination, the two ships were attacked by a single Japanese aircraft. Having missed with several bombs, the aircraft flew off in the direction of Timor an hour later. Fearing that their discovery by this aircraft would jeopardise the mission, ''Castlemaine''{{'}}s Commanding Officer, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Philip Sullivan, ordered evasive action and signalled Darwin for further orders. A signal returned decreeing that the operation must proceed and a party of fighter aircraft were to be dispatched as protective cover.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;{{sfn|Gill|pp=215–216}}

Continuing in their voyage, ''Armidale'' and ''Castlemaine'' were attacked twice more by air, each time by a formation of bombers that bombed and machine-gunned the ships. Despite this, neither ship suffered damage or casualties and both arrived at Betano at 03:30 on 1 December, however there was no sign of ''Kuru''. Having made sure that ''Kuru'' was not in the bay, the two corvettes decided to abandon the mission and sailed south in order to return to Darwin. ''Kuru''{{'}}s commanding officer, Lieutenant John Grant, had loaded 77 of the Portuguese refugees as well as one critically injured Australian soldier on board the ship and set sail at around 02:00 on 1 December from Betano, fearing he had missed the rendezvous with the other two ships. While approximately {{convert|110|km|nmi}} south of Betano, ''Armidale'' and ''Castlemaine'' sighted ''Kuru'', and the three ships closed by dawn.{{sfn|Gill|pp=215–216}}{{sfn|Macklin|p=246}}

Following the transfer of passengers from ''Kuru'' to ''Castlemaine'', the former received orders that she was to return to Betano that evening "and do the job tonight".{{sfn|Gill|pp=215–216}} At this time, a formation of Japanese aircraft was spotted and ''Kuru'' sailed for cover. Assessing the situation, Sullivan—as senior officer—decided that ''Armidale'' would accompany ''Kuru'' in order to unload the former's passengers at Betano while ''Castlemaine'' returned to Darwin. ''Armidale'' and ''Kuru'' assumed separate routes to Betano, and at approximately 13:00 ''Armidale'' was attacked by a party of five Japanese bombers; the explosives, however, fell wide of their target. At 13:58, ''Armidale'' reported that she was under attack from "nine bombers, four fighters" over the [[Arafura Sea]].{{sfn|Macklin|p=246}}{{sfn|Gill|pp=216–217}}

''Armidale'' undertook evasive action, manoeuvring frantically to avoid the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two [[air-launched torpedo]]es, one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; ''Armidale'' listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship.{{sfn|Macklin|p=247}} As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft.

With ''Armidale'' rapidly sinking, Sheean continued to fire and managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers.

===Valour Inquiry===
In 2011, at the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator [[David Feeney]], the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition at the time of their actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Medal]] or the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|author=Rose, Alan|authorlink=Alan Rose (public servant)|date=21 January 2013|title=Report of the Inquiry into unresolved recognition for past acts of naval and military gallantry and valour (Valour Inquiry)|url=http://defence-honours-tribunal.gov.au/publications/archive/?c=reports&amp;y=2013|publisher=Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Charge of the Light Brigade'''" is an [[1854 in poetry|1854]] [[narrative poem]] by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] about the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]]. He wrote it on December 2, 1854, and it was published on December 9, 1854 in ''The Examiner''. He was the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]] at the time.

==History==

===Composition===
During the 1850s, when Great Britain was engaged in the [[Crimean War]], Tennyson wrote several patriotic poems under various pseudonyms. Scholars speculate that Tennyson created his pen names because these verses used a traditional structure Tennyson employed in his earlier career but suppressed during the 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;Francis 113&lt;/ref&gt; worrying that poems like "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (which he initially signed only A.T.) "might prove not to be decorous for a poet laureate".&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was written after the [[Light cavalry|Light Cavalry Brigade]] suffered great casualties in the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. Tennyson wrote the poem based on two articles published in ''[[The Times]]'': the first, published in November, 1854, provided the phrase "Some one has blunder'd" and thus the meter of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 1&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was written in a few minutes on December 2 of the same year, based on a recollection of that account;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 2&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson wrote other similar poems, like "Riflemen, form in town and in Shrine" in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;Francis 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later versions===
Tennyson made revisions to the poem due to criticisms by the American poet [[Frederick Goddard Tuckerman]] and others;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 7&lt;/ref&gt; these were published in Tennyson's volume ''[[Maud and other poems|Maud and Other Poems]]''. These changes were criticized by several, including both Tennyson and Tuckerman.

Tennyson sent a version of the poem, after correcting the revisions in ''Maud'', at the soldiers' request.&lt;ref name="Shannon and Ricks 10"&gt;Shannon and Ricks 10&lt;/ref&gt; There, it was distributed in pamphlet form at the behest of [[Jane Griffin (Lady Franklin)|Jane, Lady Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lord Tennyson, ''Poems'', ed. Hallam Lord Tennyson and annotated by Alfred Lord Tennyson (London: Macmillan, 1908), II, 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The same version was used for the second printing of ''Maud''.&lt;ref name="Shannon and Ricks 10"/&gt;

Tennyson recited this poem onto a [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]] in 1890.

===Kipling's postscript===
[[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote "[[The Last of the Light Brigade]]" (1891) some 40 years after the appearance of "The Charge of the Light Brigade". His poem focuses on the terrible hardships faced in old age by veterans of the [[Crimean War]], as exemplified by the cavalry men of the Light Brigade. Its purpose was to shame the British public into offering financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Hell Riders"&gt;{{Citation|last=Brighton|first=Terry|title=Hell Riders: The True Story of the Charge of the Light Brigade|url=http://www.terrybrighton.com/HR.htm|year=2005|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Walter Cook''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (18 June 1834 – c. 1864) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

He was about 25 years old, and a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Regiment]] (later [[The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders)]], [[British Army]] during the [[Indian Mutiny]] when the following deed took place on 15 January 1859 at [[Maylah Ghat]], [[India]] for which he and Private [[Duncan Millar]] were awarded the VC:
{{quote|text=In the action at Maylah Ghaut, on the 15th January, 1859, Brigadier-General Walpole reports that the conduct of Privates Cook and Millar deserves to be particularly pointed out. At the time the fight was the severest, and the few men of the 42nd Regiment were skirmishing so close to the enemy (who were in great numbers), that some of the men were wounded by sword cuts, and the only officer with the 42nd was carried to the rear, severely wounded, and the Color-Serjeant was killed, these soldiers went to the front, took a prominent part in directing the Company, and displayed a courage, coolness, and discipline, which was the admiration of all who witnessed it.|sign=War-Office|source={{London Gazette|issue=22278|page=2420|date=21 June 1859}}}}

The pipe tune ''Lawson's Men'' was written about the incident.

The '''Ådalen shootings''' ({{lang-sv|skotten i Ådalen}}) was a series of events in and around the sawmill district of [[Ådalen]], [[Kramfors Municipality]], [[Ångermanland]], [[Sweden]], in May 1931. During a protest on 14 May, five people were killed by bullets fired by [[Swedish military|troops]] called in as reinforcements by the police.

==Background==
As a response to a drawn-out industrial conflict over pay reductions at the [[Wood pulp|pulp]] factory at Långrör, workers at other plants went on a [[sympathy strike]].&lt;ref name="dn.se"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/75-ar-sedan-skotten-i-adalen/ |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=75 år sedan skotten i Ådalen |trans-title=75 years ago since the shooting in Ådalen |first=Tove |last=Nandorf |date=2006-05-13 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the [[Graninge]] company, [[Gerhard Versteegh]], hired around 60 [[Strikebreaker|strike-breakers]], who arrived in the village of [[Lunde, Sweden|Lunde]] in Ådalen on 12 May. The workers held a protest rally in [[Kramfors]] and marched to the Sandviken plant north of the town, where they approached and attacked some of the strike-breakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arbetetsmarknad.se/material/material-om-strejkbrytarna-i-adalen-1931/ |publisher=Arbetetsmarknad.se |title=Om strejkbrytarna i Ådalen 1931 |trans-title=About the strikebreakers in Ådalen 1931 |first=Roger |last=Johansson |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the police had not been able to stop the attack, the [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] asked for the deployment of members of the military from [[Sollefteå]] to protect the strike-breakers. When the troops arrived in the late evening of 13 May, they were met by protesters, allegedly throwing stones.&lt;ref name="dn.se"/&gt;

==Confrontation==
On 14 May the [[trade union|union]]s held another rally, during which the attending workers decided to stop all work in the timber and pulp industries in Ådalen—a [[general strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/ipadoriginal/article13025428.ab |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |title=Massakern i Ådalen har tonats ner |trans-title=The massacre in Ådalen has been toned down |first=Svante |last=Lidén |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the meeting, several thousand participants marched to the strike-breakers' quarters in Lunde, where the troops had been ordered to defend the strike-breakers. When they arrived in the village, a patrol of mounted troops tried unsuccessfully to stop them.&lt;ref name="dn.se"/&gt; In the confusion that followed, at least one man fell off his horse and another drew his pistol and fired warning shots while the patrol withdrew. The military commander, Capt. [[Nils Mesterton]], said later that he believed the demonstrators carried weapons since he heard shots as well as seeing some of the mounted patrol bleeding.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/54030?programid=2519|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |title=Skotten i Ådalen −31 |trans-title=Ådalen shootings −31 |first=Sara |last=Lundin |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a distance of less than 100&amp;nbsp;metres he, in accordance with orders from the present policeman in charge, ordered his troops to fire, which they did, aiming as planned at the ground halfway between the line and the demonstrators. However, ricochets hit the gathered demonstrators, who scattered, and the captain ordered the machine gun fired. Five people were shot to death: Oskar Berggren, Erik Bergström, Evert Nygren, Sture Larsson and Eira Söderberg, a 20-year-old bystander. Five people were injured. An inquiry later concluded that there was no evidence that the workers were in fact armed.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"/&gt;

On that same day the County Administrative Board had decided to prohibit the strike-breakers from working. Their decision did not reach the demonstrators until after the shooting. It is widely believed that the confrontation could have been avoided if the news had reached the marchers earlier. The [[Confederation of Swedish Enterprise|Swedish Employers' Association]] later asked the [[Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsmen]] to review the decision.&lt;ref name="dn.se"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The events spawned a raging national debate, deeply divided along political lines. The political left called the shootings "murder", while the right claimed that the military had been forced to open fire to defend themselves and the "willing workers" from the rage of the demonstrators.&lt;ref name="dn.se"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socialisterna.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialisterna.org/sv/2/1/6772/ |publisher=[[Socialist Justice Party]] |title=Dödsskotten i Ådalen den 14 maj 1931 ekar ännu |trans-title=The shootings in Ådalen on May 14, 1931 still echoes |first=Per |last=Olsson |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers of several left-wing newspapers were convicted for violations against the limitations in the [[Constitution of Sweden#Freedom of the press and freedom of expression|Freedom of the Press Act]].&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"/&gt; Major demonstrations took place in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="socialisterna.org"/&gt;

The County Governor was tried in court but acquitted. Capt. Mesterton and Capt. Beckman were initially convicted in a [[court martial]], but were acquitted on appeal and that verdict was confirmed by the [[Swedish Supreme Court|supreme court]]. Sgt. Rask and Sgt. Tapper, who were manning the machine gun, were also put on trial since repositioning had been performed with a loaded weapon, which was against army regulations.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3993&amp;artikel=4503640 |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |title=Skotten i Ådalen förändrade Sverige för alltid |trans-title=Ådalen shootings changed Sweden forever |first=Jonas |last=Hultström |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rask was acquitted while Tapper was found guilty and sentenced to three days' confined arrest with loss of pay. On the other hand, several demonstrators had to face severe sentences: Axel Nordström, considered to be the leader, was sentenced to two and half years' imprisonment with [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. No [[damages]] were awarded to the wounded demonstrators or to the families of the five dead.&lt;ref name="socialisterna.org"/&gt;

The government, under the liberal [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Carl Gustaf Ekman]], replaced the County Governor and launched an investigation into the event.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio1"/&gt; The investigation, with representatives from both employers and trade unions, later concluded that the military was highly unfit to uphold public order in similar situations.&lt;ref name="Prop"/&gt; The use of the military against civilians was more strictly regulated, but the legislation was on the books until it was repealed by the 1969 [[Riksdag]]. However, there was broad political agreement not to use military force against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adalen1931.se/ Ådalen 1931] Retrieved 9 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Ådalen shootings were still a concern in the discussions after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 events]] in the US, when military support to the police was considered. Therefore, the subsequent legislation that allowed the military to take part in anti-terrorism actions contained several safeguards. The military must be under command of the police, as they were in Ådalen in 1931, and legislation specifically says that the military cannot be used against demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Prop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/Webbnav/index.aspx?nid=37&amp;dok_id=GT03111|title=Regeringens proposition 2005/06:111 – Försvarsmaktens stöd till polisen vid terrorismbekämpning |trans-title=Government Bill 2005/06: 111 – The Armed Forces support to police in counter-terrorism |publisher=Riksdagsförvaltningen |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lagen.nu/2006:343 |publisher=Lagen.nu |title=Lag (2006:343) om Försvarsmaktens stöd till polisen vid terrorismbekämpning |trans-title=Act (2006: 343) of the Armed Forces support to police in counter-terrorism |accessdate=13 November 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was still concern that these safeguards would not be enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/7163 |newspaper=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]] |title=Lagen kan användas mot allt som inte passar sig |trans-title=The law can be used against anything that does not fit in |last=Andersen |first=Ivar |date=13 May 2006 |accessdate=13 November 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/7182  |newspaper=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]] |title=Militären föreslås få bruka tvång och våld mot civila |trans-title=The military proposes to use force and violence against civilians |last=Svanebro |first=Karin |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=13 November 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="svd.se"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/skotten-som-formade-sverige_6163885.svd |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |title=Skotten som formade Sverige |trans-title=The shots that shaped Sweden |first=Karin |last=Thurfjell |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the 1931 events, it was not possible to call in police reinforcements from outside the county.&lt;ref name="svd.se"/&gt; Thus, army assistance was the only recourse available to a county governor when the county's police force would be insufficient to deal with large-scale events. The shootings highlighted the inadequacy of this state of affairs. One effect of the Ådalen shootings was the formation of a national police force in 1933.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio1"/&gt;

The leadership of the Social Democratic banned members to attend the funerals of the killed protesters as they were regarded as collaborators with the revolutionary communist party.

==Coverage in film==
In 1969 well-known Swedish [[Film director|filmmaker]] [[Bo Widerberg]] told the story of the events in his film ''[[Ådalen 31]]'' (released as ''Adalen Riots'' in the US). Partly thanks to the film and partly through the persistent use of the events in political debate, the Ådalen shootings are still well known in Sweden, and are sometimes referred to in connection with violent clashes between demonstrators and police such as the 2001 [[protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001|EU summit protests in Gothenburg]].&lt;ref name="sverigesradio1"/&gt;

The incident is also mentioned several times in the 1979 Swedish comedy film ''[[Repmånad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?itemid=5033&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Comments |publisher=[[Swedish Film Database]] |title=Repmånad eller Hur man gör pojkar av män (1979) |access-date=9 May 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
