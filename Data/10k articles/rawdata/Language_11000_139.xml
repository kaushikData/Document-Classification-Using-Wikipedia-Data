'''Angolan Portuguese''' ({{lang-pt|Português de Angola}}) is a group of dialects and accents of the [[Portuguese language]] used mostly in [[Angola]], where it is an official language. In 2005 it was used there by 60% of the population, including by 20% as their first language.&lt;ref name=ELL&gt;{{ELL2|Angola: Language Situation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 CIA ''World Fact Book'' reports that 12.3 million, or 47% of the population, speaks Portuguese as their first language.&lt;ref name=Ethn/&gt;
However, many parents raise their children to speak only Portuguese, and t.The 2014 census found that 71% speak Portuguese at home, many of them alongside a Bantu language, breaking down to 85% in urban areas and 49% in rural areas.&lt;ref name=observa&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observalinguaportuguesa.org/angola-portugues-e-falado-por-7115-de-angolanos/|title=Angola: português é falado por 71,15% de angolanos|accessdate=2016-03-30|work=Observatório da Língua Portuguesa}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are different stages of Portuguese language in Angola in a similar manner to other Portuguese-speaking African countries. Some closely approximate Standard Portuguese pronunciation and are associated with upper class and younger generations of urban background.

== Phonology ==
Vernacular accents share similarities with [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and these similar features have historical reasons. The contemporary Standard [[European Portuguese]] is the [[prestige language|preferred pronunciation]], as such it has become a [[Post-creole continuum|transitional dialect]] somewhat midway between the European and Brazilian varieties. In its phonology, Angolan Portuguese is not significantly influenced by the local languages. The standard phonology in Angola is the European standard, like in Portugal and the rest of Africa. But there are some phonological features similar to Brazilian dialect, such as that {{angbr|nh}} is pronounced as a nasal [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j̃]}}, which nasalizes the vowel that precedes it, and dropping of word-final {{IPA|/r/}} ({{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|[ʁ]}}), especially for people who speak Portuguese as their second language. It is also commonly seen as the [[Portuguese in Africa|African accent of Portuguese]], and when dubbing an African character in cartoons and TV and film productions, Portuguese usually mimic an Angolan accent. Many Angolan Portuguese speakers grew up as, or had parents who were, speakers of African languages such as [[Umbundu]], so the phonological influence of these local African languages on this form of Portuguese would be strong.

== Lexicon ==

Although most of the vocabulary is the same as in Portugal or Brazil, there are some differences, many due to the influence of several languages spoken in Angola. Each area has different lexicon originating from the distinctive languages. In the capital, Luanda, a very standard Portuguese is spoken, and tribal culture and languages are practically nonexistent. Still, there are several [[Kimbundu]] influences. This [[lexicon]] is not used in documents or business, for example, as it is mostly seen as [[slang]], but there are exceptions. Most of this lexicon is mostly used by younger Angolans and Portuguese, similarly to younger African-Americans in the US.

Younger Luandese, who speak primarily Portuguese, have even a wider lexicon of slang. It does not correspond to a dialect, but a sociolect. Because of immigration and because of the slang's novelty, the younger generations in Portugal often adopt its use. Angolans in [[Lisbon]] also have a tendency to create new words for use socially and as group expressions, and often even newcomers from Angola cannot understand them. The newcomers are known as ''exportados'' ("exported ones").
The following list has Luandese followed by Standard Portuguese:
* ''não tem maka'' – ''não tem problema'' ("no problem")
* ''está anduta'' – ''está fácil'' ("it is easy")
* ''apanhar uma tona'' – ''apanhar uma bebedeira'' ("to get drunk")
* ''kota'' – ''velho'' ("older person"; originally a respectful word and still so between Angolans, but younger Portuguese use it as a slang for older people, sometimes kindly, but often [[pejorative]]ly, e.g. for "[[old geezer]]").
* ''iofé'' – ''feio'' ("ugly"; maybe a Portuguese inverted slang; see [[verlan]]).
* ''nboa'' – ''mulher'' ("woman").
* ''piô, candengue'' – ''criança'' ("child")
* ''pitéu'' – ''comida'' ("food"; Between Portuguese, it indicates "tasty food").
* ''latona'' – ''mulata'' ("mulatto woman").
* ''mboio'' – ''comboio'' (abbreviation for "train").
* ''tape'' – ''televisão'' ("television").
* ''bila, bilau'' – ''camisa'' ("shirt").
* ''bóter'' – ''carro'' ("car").

Examples of words borrowed from [[Kimbundu]], for instance, into Angolan Portuguese include:
*''cubata'' 'house'
*''muamba'' 'chicken stew'
*''quinda'' 'basket'
*''giumbo'' 'machete'
*''[[umbanda]]'', ''milongo'' 'medicine'
*''quituxe'' 'crime'

== The impact of Angolan Portuguese ==
[[File:Avenidalenin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sign in Portuguese at the Avenida de Lenin (''[[Lenin]] avenue'') in Luanda]]
Many words of Angolan origin have reached other countries or regions where Portuguese is used. Among these words are ''bunda'' (backside or "bottom"); ''fubá'' (a maize flour); ''moleque'' ("kid"); and several others. Also included are words not native to other regions, such as ''[[kizomba]]'', ''kilapanda'', ''kilapanga'', ''ngoma'', and ''[[kuduro]]''. But regardless of the loanwords from [[Bantu languages]] in the lexicon, it must not be considered a [[Portuguese creole]] because the grammar and lexicon are truly Portuguese-based. 
In Brazilian Portuguese, there are a large number of words, whose origin lie in Angolan languages. Various aspects of Brazilian culture – ''[[samba]]'', ''[[candomblé]]'' and ''[[capoeira]]'' – all bear linguistic traces of this contact. 
 
In Portugal, Angolan Portuguese has had a large influence on the vernacular of the younger population, contributing significant amounts of lexicon. Examples include:
*''bazar'' ("to go away/home"; in Brazil spelt as ''vazar'')
*''garina'' ("girl")
*''bumbar'' ("to work" in Angola, "to party" in Portugal; sometimes spelt as ''bombar'')
*''bué'' ("many", "a lot")
*''iá'' ("yes")
and numerous other examples. Many of these words and expression made their way to Portugal during the period of decolonisation in the 1970s, with the arrival of so-called ''retornados'', [[Portuguese Angolans|white Angolans]] who left the newly independent nation. This influence was reinforced by more recent immigration of black Angolans as a result of the Angolan civil war. These words were even brought to [[Brazil]] by white Angolan refugees during and after independence.

==Early and personal life==
[[File:Balachandran Chullikkad1.jpg|thumb|Balachandran Chullikkad]]
Balachandran was born in Paravur, [[Ernakulam]], Kerala, India.&lt;ref name="ബാലചന്ദ്രന് അറുപത്"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/books/special/balachandran-chullikkadu-60/balachandranchullikkadu-60-1.2127355 |title=ബാലചന്ദ്രന് അറുപത് |date=July 30, 2017 |website=Mathrubhumi |access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his graduation in English literature from  [[Maharaja's College, Ernakulam|Maharajas College]], [[Ernakulam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manorama Online : Breaking News, Kerala news, latest news, India, Kerala politics, sports, movies, celebrities, lifestyle, E-paper, Photos &amp; Videos|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=14615995&amp;programId=1073752204&amp;channelId=-1073750705&amp;BV_ID=@@@&amp;tabId=3|publisher=[[Malayala Manorama]]|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he took Buddhism as his religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.rediff.com/news/2000/jan/24hindu.htm Malayalam poet embraces Buddhism] Rediff – 24 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He says that this cannot be called a conversion from [[Hinduism]] because he was never a follower of that religion. "I have not converted because I have not been a believer though I was a Hindu. I have now embraced Buddhism, not converted to Buddhism. The problem with Hinduism is that it is a religion of social status and set-ups. Your value in Hinduism depends on the family in which you were born," he says.&lt;ref&gt;George Iype (4 April 2000). [http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/apr/04faith1.htm "Hindu gods never forgive. They only punish"]. [[Rediff.com]]. Retrieved 10 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Bourgeois revolution''' is a term used in [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory to refer to a [[Social revolution|social revolution]] that aims to destroy a [[feudal system]] or its vestiges, establish the rule of the [[bourgeoisie]], and create a bourgeois state.&lt;ref name="ada2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bourgeois+Revolution |title=Bourgeois Revolution |website=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonised or subjugated countries, bourgeois revolutions often take the form of a war of national [[independence]]. The [[English Revolution#Marxist theory|English]], [[French Revolution|French]], and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions are considered the archetypal bourgeois revolutions, in that they attempted to clear away the remnants of the medieval feudal system, so as to pave the way for the rise of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="ada2" /&gt; The term is usually used in contrast to "[[proletarian revolution]]", and is also sometimes called a "'''bourgeois-democratic revolution'''".

According to one version of the [[two-stage theory]], bourgeois revolution was asserted to be necessary step in the move toward [[socialism]]. In this view, countries that had preserved their feudal structure, like [[Russian Empire|Russia]], would have to establish capitalism via a bourgeois revolution before being able to wage a proletarian revolution. At the time of the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Mensheviks]] asserted this theory, arguing that a revolution led by bourgeoisie was necessary to modernise society, establish basic freedoms, and overcome feudalism, which would establish the conditions necessary for socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: St |website=www.marxists.org |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''byline''' on a [[newspaper]] or [[magazine]] article gives the name of the writer of the article. Bylines are commonly placed between the [[headline]] and the text of the article, although some magazines (notably ''[[Reader's Digest]]'') place bylines at the bottom of the page to leave more room for graphical elements around the headline.

The dictionary defines a byline as "a printed line of text accompanying a news story, article, or the like, giving the author's name."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of byline|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/byline|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
A typical newspaper byline might read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Bob Dylan'''&lt;br&gt;''Enterprise Correspondent''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A byline can also include a brief article summary that introduces the author by name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Penning a concise description of a long piece has never been as easy as often appears, as ''Staff Writer'' '''John Smith''' now explains:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Magazine bylines and bylines on [[opinion piece]]s often include biographical information on their subjects. A typical biographical byline on a piece of [[creative nonfiction]] might read
&lt;blockquote&gt;John Smith is working on a book, ''My Time in Ibiza'', based on this article. He is returning to the region this summer to gather material for a follow-up essay.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Bylines were rare before the late 19th century.  Before then, the most similar practice was the occasional "signed" or "signature" article.&lt;ref name="Shafer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2012/07/06/how-the-byline-beast-was-born/|title=How the byline beast was born|last=Shafer|first=Jack |date=6 July 2012 |website=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''byline'' itself first appeared in print in 1926, in a scene set in a newspaper office in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' by Ernest Hemingway.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;

One of the earliest consistent uses of the idea was for battlefield reporting during the American Civil War.  In 1863, Union General [[Joseph Hooker]] required battlefield reporters to sign their articles so that he would know which journalist to blame for any errors or security violations.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;

The practice became more popular at the end of the 19th century, as journalists became more powerful and popular figures.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;  Bylines were used to promote or create celebrities among some [[yellow journalism|yellow journalists]] during this time.  Proponents of signed articles believed that the signature made the journalist more careful and more honest; publishers thought it made papers sell better.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;

However, the increasing use of bylines was resisted by others, including the publisher–owner of ''The New York Times'', [[Adolph Ochs]], who believed that bylines interfered with the impersonal nature of news and decreased the sense of institutional responsibility for an article's content.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;  Bylines remained rare in that newspaper for several more decades.

The first [[Associated Press]] wire services story with a byline appeared in 1925, and the practice became commonplace shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;

Since the 1970s, most modern newspapers and magazines have attributed almost all but their shortest articles and their own [[editorial]] pieces to individual reporters or to [[wire service]]s.&lt;ref name="Shafer" /&gt;

An exception is the British weekly ''[[The Economist]]'', which publishes nearly all material except blog posts [[anonymity|anonymously]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-1|title=Why are The Economist’s writers anonymous?|date=4 September 2013|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Economist'' explains this practice as being traditional and reflective of the collaborative nature of their reporting.

==False attribution==
Articles that originate from [[press agency]] journalists are sometimes incorrectly attributed to newspaper staff. Dominic Ponsford of the ''Press Gazette'' gives the following examples:
*Ben Ellery's interview with the boyfriend of murdered [[Jo Yeates]] appeared in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]];'' the former newspaper carried four bylines, none of which credited Ellery.
*Andrew Buckwell's exclusive on a paternity issue involving [[Boris Johnson]] appeared in the ''Daily Mail'' without a byline crediting him.&lt;ref name=pressgazette/&gt;

Ponsford also highlights cases in which newspapers byline fictional authors for pieces that attack other newspapers: for example the ''[[Daily Express]]''{{'}}s use of "Brendon Abbott".&lt;ref name=pressgazette&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-press-byline-bandits-when-the-first-line-of-a-story-is-a-lie-how-can-we-trust-the-rest-51250/|title=National press byline bandits: When the first line of a story is a lie, how can we trust the rest?|author=Ponsford, Dominic|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2011-04-18|work=PressGazette|publisher=Wilmington Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central West New Guinea''' languages are a group of [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] families in central New Guinea established by Timothy Usher, though with precedents in earlier studies. 

==Languages==
The languages are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/trans-new-guinea/central-west-new-guinea&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Awyu–Ok
**[[Digul River languages|Digul River]] (Greater Awyu)

**[[Ok languages|Ok]]
*Momuna–Mek (Somahai–Mek)
**[[Mek languages|Mek]]
**[[Momina–Momuna languages|Momina–Momuna]] (Somahai)

Voorhoeve (1975) noted a connection between Somahai and the Ok and Dumut languages, but did not consider Mek. (See [[Central and South New Guinea languages]].)

The [[Oksapmin language]] is sometimes classified as the nearest relative of Ok. However, it's unclear whether the similarities are due to relationship or to contact between Oksapmin and Mountain Ok.

[[File:The Taking of Christ-Caravaggio (c.1602).jpg|thumb|[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] cheek kissing [[Christ]]. Oil on canvas by [[Caravaggio]], 1602]]

'''Cheek kissing''' is a [[ritual]] or social [[kiss]]ing [[gesture]] to indicate [[friendship]], family relationship, perform a [[greeting]], to confer congratulations, to comfort someone, to show respect, or to indicate sexual or romantic interest. 

Cheek kissing is very common in [[Southern Europe|Southern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Latin America]].
In other countries including [[the U.S.]] and [[Japan]], cheek kissing is common as well at an international meeting between [[head of the state|heads of state]] and [[First Lady|First Ladies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=YNzPR1HOlbc#t=10m00s |title=Obama and Japanese prime minister deliver toast at state dinner|format=video |website= [[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=Apr 28, 2015 |accessdate=Oct 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or members of [[royal family|royal]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|the Imperial]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=GK2CVeoBtmE |title=Spain's King visits Japanese Emperor |last= |first= |date=Apr 17, 2017 |website=YouTube |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |format=video |access-date=Oct 19, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=8YdkujMzPFE |title=両陛下がお出迎え デンマーク皇太子夫妻と昼食会 |last= |first= |date=Mar 28, 2015 |website=YouTube |publisher=[[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] |format=video |access-date=Oct 20, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the local culture, cheek kissing may be considered appropriate among family members as well as friends and acquaintances: a man and a woman, two women, or two men. The last is less socially accepted in many cultures,

In Eastern Europe, male–female and female–female cheek kissing is a standard greeting among friends, while male–male cheek kisses are less common. Eastern European [[communist]] leaders often greeted each other with a [[socialist fraternal kiss]] on public and state occasions.

In a cheek kiss, both persons lean forward and either lightly [[touch]] [[cheek]] with cheek or [[lip]] with cheek. Generally the gesture is repeated with the other cheek, or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, the number of kisses is usually one, two, three or four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.

Cheek kissing is used in many cultures with slightly varying meaning and gesture. For example, cheek kissing may or may not be associated with a hug. The appropriate social context for use can vary greatly from one country to the other, though the gesture might look similar.

In cultures and situations where cheek kissing is the social norm, the failure or refusal to give or accept a  kiss is commonly taken as an indicator of [[antipathy]] between the people, and to dispel such an implication and avoid giving offense may require an explanation, such as the person has a contagious disease such as a cold.

==Americas==

===United States and Canada===
[[File:US Navy 080210-N-5292M-001 Lt. Robert O'Connell, assigned to Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), kisses his daughter after returning to the Naval Air Terminal at Naval Station Norfolk.jpg|thumb|A father kissing the cheek of his daughter]]
In the United States and Canada, the cheek kiss may involve one or both cheeks. According to the March 8, 2004 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "a single [kiss] is [an] acceptable [greeting] in the United States, but it's mostly a big-city phenomenon."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,598580,00.html|title=How many Kisses?|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 2004|accessdate=December 4, 2009 | first=Jennifer | last=Billinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, cheek kissing is a romantic gesture.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Cheek kissing of young children by adults of both sexes is perhaps the most common cheek kiss in North America. Typically, it is a short, perfunctory greeting, and is most often done by relatives.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Giving someone a kiss on the cheek is also a common occurrence between loving couples.{{cn|date=June 2017}}
 
Cheek kissing between adults, when it occurs at all, is most often done between a man and woman who know each other well, such as between relatives or close friends. In this case, a short [[hug]] (generally only upper-body contact) or handshake may accompany the kiss. Likewise, hugs are common but not required. A hug alone may also suffice in both of these situations, and is much more common. Particularly in the southeastern United States (Southern), elderly women may be cheek kissed by younger men as a gesture of affection and respect.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In Québec, cheek kissing is referred to in the vernacular ([[Quebec French|Québécois]]) as ''un bec'' ("''donner un bec''") or ''la bise'' ("''faire la bise''"). Whether francophone or other, people of the opposite sex often kiss once on each cheek.  Cheek kissing between women is also very common, although men will often refrain. Two people introduced by a mutual friend may also give each other ''un bec''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Immigrant groups tend to have their own norms for cheek kissing, usually carried over from their native country.{{cn|date=June 2017}} In [[Miami, Florida]], an area heavily influenced by Latin American and European immigrants, kissing hello on the cheek is the social norm.{{cn|date=June 2017}} In parts of [[New England]] influenced by [[Franco-American]] or [[French Canadian]] cultures, cheek kissing is popular.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Latin America===

In Latin America, cheek kissing is a universal form of greeting between a man and a woman or two women.

It is not necessary to know a person well or be intimate with them to kiss them on the cheek. When introduced to someone new by a mutual acquaintance in social settings, it is customary to greet him or her with a cheek kiss if the person being introduced to them is a member of the opposite sex or if a woman is introduced to another woman.  If the person is a complete stranger, i.e. self-introductions, no kissing is done.{{cn|date=September 2016}} A cheek kiss may be accompanied by a hug or another sign of physical affection.  In business settings, the cheek kiss is not always standard upon introduction, but once a relationship is established, it is common practice.

As with other regions, cheek kissing may be lips-to-cheek or cheek-to-cheek with a kiss in the air, the latter being more common.

In the Southern Cone countries of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] it is common (almost standard) between male friends to kiss "a la italiana", i.e. football players kiss each other to congratulate or to greet.

As in [[Southern Europe]], in Argentina and Uruguay men kissing men is common but it varies depending on the region, occasion  and even on the family.

==Europe==

===Southern Europe===
{{no references|section|date=June 2017}}
Cheek kissing is a standard greeting throughout Southern Europe between friends or acquaintances, but less common in professional settings. In general, men and women will kiss the opposite sex, and women will kiss women. Men kissing men varies depending on the country and even on the family, in some countries (or areas like Southern Italy) men will kiss men; in others only men of the same family would consider kissing.

Greece is an example of a country where cheek kissing highly depends on the region and the type of event. For example, in most parts of [[Crete]], it is common between a man and a woman who are friends, but is very uncommon between men unless they are very close relatives. In [[Athens]] it is commonplace for men to kiss women and women to kiss other women on the cheek when meeting or departing. It is uncommon between strangers of any sex, and it may be considered offensive otherwise. It is standard for children and parents, children and grandparents etc., and in its "formal" form it will be two kisses, one on each cheek. It may be a standard formal form of greeting in special events such as weddings.

However, in Portugal and Spain, usually, women kiss both men and women, and men only kiss women (so, 2 men rarely kiss). In Portuguese families men rarely kiss men (except between brothers or father and son) , the handshake is the most common salutation between them. However, men kissing may occur in Spain as well particularly when congratulating close friends or relatives. Cheek to cheek and the kiss in the air are also very popular. Hugging is common between men and men and women and women; when the other is from the opposite sex, a kiss may be added.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
In Italy (especially in the South or the Center) it is common for men to kiss men, especially relatives or friends.

In Spain, it is very common to kiss both cheeks (double kiss), man-woman and woman-woman only.

In most South European countries, kissing is initiated by leaning to the left side and joining the right cheeks and if there's a second kiss, changing to the left cheeks. In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join the left cheeks and then switch to the right cheeks.

=== Southeastern Europe ===

In the former Yugoslavia, cheek kissing is also very commonplace, with your nationality being ascertainable by the number of kisses on each cheek. Typically, Croats and Bosniaks will kiss once on each cheek, for two total kisses, whereas Serbs (be they from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia or Montenegro) will kiss three times, typically starting at the right cheek. In Serbia and Montenegro, it is also not uncommon for men to kiss each other on the cheek three times as a form of greeting, usually for people they have not encountered in a while, while male-female and female-female kissing is also standard.

In [[Bulgaria]] cheek kissing is practiced to a far lesser extent compared to ex-Yugoslavia and is usually seen only between very close relatives or sometimes between close female friends. Kissing is usually performed by people of the opposite sex and between two women. Men kissing is rare even between close friends and is sometimes treated offensive.

In [[Romania]], cheek kissing is commonly used as a greeting between a man and a woman or two women, once on each cheek. Men usually prefer handshakes among themselves, though sometimes close male relatives may also practice cheek kissing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kingofromania.com/2010/09/18/touching-kissing-and-other-physical-contact-in-romania/comment-page-2/ | title=Touching, Kissing and Other Physical Contact in Romania | accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
[[File:Illiadegaulle.jpg|thumb|French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] kisses Argentine president [[Arturo Illia]] in 1964.]]
In France, where the custom is called "faire la bise", the cheek kiss came under scrutiny during the [[H1N1]] epidemic of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6155768/France-facing-la-bise-ban-over-swine-flu-fears.html| title = France facing 'la bise' ban over swine flu fears| publisher = telegraph.co.uk| date = 2009-09-08| accessdate = 2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular French joke states that you may recognize the city you are in by counting the number of cheek kisses, as it varies across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Interactive map of French departments and the number of cheek kisses commonly performed based on a user poll. http://combiendebises.free.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common, in the [[Southern France|southern parts of France]], even between males, be they relatives or friends, whereas in the north ([[Langues d'oïl|Langue-d'oïl France]]), it is less usual for two unrelated males to perform ′''la bise''′.

In [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], cheek kissing is a common greeting between relatives and friends (in the Netherlands slightly more so in the south). Generally speaking, women will kiss both women and men, while men will kiss women but refrain from kissing other men, instead preferring to shake hands with strangers. In the Netherlands and the [[Flanders|Dutch part of Belgium]] usually three kisses are exchanged. The same number of kisses is found in [[Switzerland]]. In [[Wallonia|Francophone Belgium]], the custom is usually one or three kisses, and is also common between men who are friends.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In Northern European countries such as Sweden and Germany, hugs are preferred to kisses. It is customary in many regions to only have kisses between women and women, but not men and women, who only shake hands or hug (more familiar) instead.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Although cheek kissing is not as widely practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as in other parts of Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is commonplace, however a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some dependant on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

==Asia==
[[File:Umm Kulthum and Fairuz, Beirut - 1967.jpg||thumb|[[Fairuz]] and [[Umm Kulthum]] meeting, 1967. ]]
===South Asia===

In Pakistan women may kiss female family and close friends,  while men typically hug and shake hands with  close family and friends when meeting. 

In [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] culture in Pakistan both men and women may kiss close family members on both cheeks. In Gilgit Baltistan - family members may kiss on cheeks followed by a kiss on the hand.

===Southeast Asia===
In the [[Philippines]], cheek kissing or ''beso'' (also ''beso-beso'', from the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] for "kiss") is a common greeting. The Philippine cheek kiss is a cheek-to-cheek kiss, not a lips-to-cheek kiss. The cheek kiss is usually made once (right cheek to right cheek), either between two women, or between a woman and a man. Amongst the upper classes, it is a common greeting among adults who are friends, while for the rest of the population, however, the gesture is generally reserved for relatives. Filipinos who are introduced to each other for the first time do not cheek kiss unless they are related.

In certain communities in [[Indonesia]], notably the [[Manado]] or [[Minahasa]] people, kissing on the cheeks (twice) is normal among relatives, including males.

In parts of Central, South, and East Asia with predominantly [[Buddhist]] or [[Hindu]] cultures, or in cultures heavily influenced by these two religions, cheek kissing is largely uncommon and may be considered offensive, although its instances are now growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/price-of-a-kiss-goodbye-rs-1-200-and-police-harassment-179441?pfrom=home-otherstories | title=Price of a kiss goodbye: Rs. 1,200 and police harassment | work=[[NDTV]] | date=February 24, 2012 | accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheek kissing in Israel is widely common. It is typical for individuals to cheek kiss twice (one time on each cheek) when greeting and when saying goodbye, regardless of gender. It consists of cheek to cheek contact and the sound of a kiss to the air.

Cheek kissing in the [[Arab world]] is relatively common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between a male and female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities in some of the more liberal Arab countries such as [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and [[Tunisia]], where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the [[Arab diaspora]]. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.

Cheek kissing in [[Turkey]] is also widely accepted in greetings. Male to male cheek kissing is considered normal in almost every occasion, but very rarely for men who are introduced for the first time. Some men hit each other's head on the side instead of cheek kissing, possibly as an attempt to masculinize the action. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare for women who are introduced for the first time. A man and a woman could cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.

Cheek kissing in [[Iran]] is relatively common between friends and family. Cheek kissing between individuals of the same sex is considered normal. However, cheek kissing between male and female in public is considered to be a punishable crime by the government, but it is known to occur among some young [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].
In 2014, [[Leila Hatami]], a famous [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] actress, kissed the president of [[Cannes]] [[Gilles Jacob]] on the red carpet. Responses ranged from criticism by the Iranian government to support from Iranian opposition parties.  Former president of Iran [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] kissed the mother of former President of [[Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]] at his funeral.

'''Clairvoyance''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ɛər|ˈ|v|ɔɪ|ə|n|s}}; from [[French language|French]] ''clair'' meaning "clear" and ''voyance'' meaning "vision") is the alleged ability to gain information about an object, person, location, or physical event through [[extrasensory perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance |title=Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 "1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration" |publisher=Mw1.merriam-webster.com |date= |access-date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9364105 Britannica Online Encyclopedia], Retrieved 2007-10-07.

==Usage==
Pertaining to the ability of clear-sightedness, clairvoyance refers to the [[paranormal]] ability to see persons and events that are distant in time or space.  It can be divided into roughly three classes: [[precognition]], the ability to perceive or predict future events, [[retrocognition]], the ability to see past events, and [[remote viewing]], the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, John]]. (2001). ''The Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. p. 297. Gale Group, Detroit. {{ISBN|978-0810385702}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
Throughout history, there have been numerous places and times in which people have claimed themselves or others to be clairvoyant.

A number of Christian saints were said to be able to see or know things that were far removed from their immediate sensory perception as a kind of gift from God, including [[Columba of Iona]], [[Padre Pio]] and [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]]. [[Jesus Christ]] in the Gospels is also recorded as being able to know things that were far removed from his immediate human perception.

In other religions, similar stories of certain individuals being able to see things far removed from their immediate sensory perception are commonplace, especially within pagan religions where [[oracle]]s were used. [[Prophecy]] often involved some degree of clairvoyance, especially when future events were predicted.

In most of these cases, however, the ability to see things was attributed to a higher power and not thought of as an ability that lay within the person himself.

== Jainism ==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
In [[Jainism]], clairvoyance is regarded as one of the five kinds of knowledge. The beings of hell and heaven ([[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]) are said to possess clairvoyance by birth. According to Jain text [[Sarvārthasiddhi]], "this kind of knowledge has been called ''avadhi'' as it ascertains matter in downward range or knows objects within limits".{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=16}}

==Parapsychology==

===Early research===
The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the [[Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur|Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Franz Mesmer]], who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Taves|Taves, Ann]]. (1999). ''Fits, Trances, and Visions: Experiencing Religion and Explaining Experience from Wesley to James''. Princeton University Press. p. 126. {{ISBN|0-691-01024-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hyman|Hyman, Ray]].

Early researchers of clairvoyance included [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Gustav Pagenstecher, and [[Rudolf Tischner]].&lt;ref&gt;Roeckelein, Jon. (2006). ''Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories''. Elsevier Science. p. 450. {{ISBN|0-444-51750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by [[Charles Richet]]. Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them. The subject was reported to have been successful in a series of 133 trials but the results dropped to chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge. J. M. Peirce and [[Edward Charles Pickering|E. C. Pickering]] reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23,384 trials which did not obtain above chance scores.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E.

[[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]] (1911) and [[Joseph McCabe]] (1920) analyzed early cases of clairvoyance and came to the conclusion they were best explained by coincidence or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]].

A significant development in clairvoyance research came when [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], a parapsychologist at [[Duke University]], introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analyzing data, as part of his research into [[extrasensory perception]]. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from [[Princeton University]] with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = W. S. | year = 1936 | title = An experiment in ESP | doi = 10.1037/h0054630 | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = | page = 437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1938). ''ESP, House of Cards''. The American Scholar. Vol. 8, No. 1. pp. 13-22. "Rhine's results fail to be confirmed. At Colgate University (40, 000 tests, 7 subjects), at Chicago (extensive series on 315 students), at Southern Methodist College (75, 000 tests), at Glasgow, Scotland (6, 650 tests), at London University (105, 000 tests), not a single individual was found who under rigidly conducted experiments could score above chance. At Stanford University it has been convincingly shown that the conditions favorable to the intrusion of subtle errors produce above-chance records which come down to chance when sources of error are eliminated."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C.

"Investigating Rhine's methods, we find that his mathematical methods are wrong and that the effect of this error would in some cases be negligible and in others very marked.

Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-309-07309-7}} "In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, ''Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years'' in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester's eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester's facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 122. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}} "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eileen Garrett]] was tested by Rhine at Duke University in 1933 with [[Zener cards]]. Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope, and she was asked to guess their contents. She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a [[Energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]] called "energy stimulus" and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelgrove, Jenny. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. p. 204. {{ISBN|978-0719055591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parapsychologist [[Samuel Soal]] and his colleagues tested Garrett in May, 1937. Most of the experiments were carried out in the Psychological Laboratory at the [[University College London]]. A total of over 12,000 guesses were recorded but Garrett failed to produce above chance level.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, A. S; Benn, John Andrews. (1938). ''Discovery the Popular Journal of Knowledge''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 305-306&lt;/ref&gt; In his report Soal wrote "In the case of Mrs. Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest confirmation of Dr. J. B. Rhine's remarkable claims relating to her alleged powers of extra-sensory perception. Not only did she fail when I took charge of the experiments, but she failed equally when four other carefully trained experimenters took my place."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Soal|Soal, Samuel]].

Watts &amp; Co. pp. 90-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote viewing===

[[Remote viewing]] also known as remote sensing, remote perception, telesthesia and travelling clairvoyance is the alleged paranormal ability to perceive a remote or hidden target without support of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Jan. (2009). ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''. Springer. p. 451. {{ISBN|978-1441912220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known study of remote viewing in recent times has been the US government-funded project at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] during the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In 1972, [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the ''viewers'' or ''percipients'') could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or ''targets''. In the early studies, a human ''sender'' was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term [[remote viewing]] was coined to describe this overall process. The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on remote viewing was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.&lt;ref name=nat251&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |first2=Harold |last2=Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602–607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of these findings, other attempts to replicate the experiments were carried out &lt;ref name=hast1&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |date=October 1976 |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544–1545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |date=October 1976 |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550–1551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with remotely linked groups using computer conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |date=October 1976 |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551–1552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff's remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute. In a series of 35 studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | last2 = Kammann | first2 = Richard | year = 1978 | title = Information transmission in remote viewing experiments | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 274 | issue = 5672| pages = 680–681 | doi=10.1038/274680a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | year = 1981 | title = Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 292 | issue = 5819| page = 177 | doi=10.1038/292177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgstock, Martin. (2009). ''Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal''. Cambridge University Press. p. 106. {{ISBN|978-0521758932}} "The explanation used by Marks and Kammann clearly involves the use of [[Occam's razor]]. Marks and Kammann argued that the 'cues' – clues to the order in which sites had been visited—provided sufficient information for the results, without any recourse to extrasensory perception. Indeed Marks himself was able to achieve 100 percent accuracy in allocating some transcripts to sites without visiting any of the sites himself, purely on the ground basis of the cues. From Occam's razor, it follows that if a straightforward natural explanation exists, there is no need for the spectacular paranormal explanation: Targ and Puthoff's claims are not justified".&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]] has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/remote%20viewing.html |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=Randi.org |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Charles Tart]] claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff's experiments revealed an above-chance result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tart | first1 = Charles | authorlink = Charles Tart | authorlink2 = Harold E.

(2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 136. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote "considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart's failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = David | authorlink = David Marks (psychologist) | last2 = Scott | first2 = Christopher | year = 1986 | title = Remote Viewing Exposed | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 319 | issue = 6053| page = 444 | doi=10.1038/319444a0 | pmid=3945330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 [[Robert G. Jahn|Robert Jahn]], then Dean of the School of Engineering at Princeton University wrote a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective.

==Scientific reception==

According to scientific research, clairvoyance is generally explained as the result of [[confirmation bias]], [[Observer-expectancy effect|expectancy bias]], fraud, [[hallucination]], self-[[delusion]], [[sensory leakage]], [[subjective validation]], [[wishful thinking]] or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences and not as a paranormal power.&lt;ref name=skepdic1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawcliffe, Donovan.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 3-22. {{ISBN|978-0198568773}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Myers (academic)|David G. Myers]] (''Psychology,'' 8th ed.):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem &amp; Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem &amp; others, 2001; Milton &amp; Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One skeptic, magician [[James Randi]], has a longstanding offer—now [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|U.S. $1 million]]—"to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions" (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi's offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  "People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist."

A '''copying pencil''', also '''indelible pencil''' or '''chemical pencil'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO0KAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;ots=AsLTZwxkJv&amp;dq=chemical%20pencil&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=chemical%20pencil&amp;f=false |title=Pharmaceutical journal; A weekly record of pharmacy and allied sciences, Volume 17 |accessdate=2017-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, is [[pencil]] whose [[pencil lead|lead]] contains a [[dye]].  The lead is fabricated by adding a dry water-soluble permanent dye to powdered [[graphite]]&amp;mdash;used in standard graphite pencils&amp;mdash;before binding the mixture with [[clay]].{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}{{Sfn|Owen|2008|pp=40&amp;ndash;42}}

Copying pencils were introduced in the 1870s and were originally marketed for copying documents, especially for making permanent copies of a permanent original.  This was achieved by creating a hand-written document using a copying pencil, laying a moist tissue paper over the document and pressing down with a mechanical press. The water-soluble dye in the writing would be transferred in its mirror image to the tissue paper, which could then be read in [[verso]] by holding it up to a light source.{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}  According to conservationist Liz Dube, "By the 1870's, letter copying books became the ubiquitous copying tool for businesses. These volumes contained hundreds of leaves of thin tissue paper, often high quality Japanese papers, bound together for the purpose of bearing copies of outgoing correspondence and other business documents."{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}

The most commonly used dye was [[aniline]], which produced a stain that was bright [[purple]], [[mauve]], or some color in between, depending upon the manufacturer. Since the aniline dye was poisonous to humans, many injuries and illness related to copying pencils were reported in the medical literature, especially in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.{{Sfn|Owen|2008|pp=40&amp;ndash;42}}

By the end of the 19th century, better copying methods had become available.  Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an indelible pencil, a precursor to the [[ball-point pen]].  When used dry, it left a slightly purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased.{{Sfn|Dube|1998}} When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing.  The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the [[fountain-pen]]: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks.{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}  Furthermore, for producing copies using [[carbon paper]], copying pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and fountain-pens (whose [[Nib (pen)|nibs]] could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}

Copying pencils saw extended use in [[World War I]] in the completion of a wide range of paperwork.  However, with the advent of refined ball-point pen technology in the 1930s, their use gradually died off in much of the world.{{Sfn|Dube|1998}}  They saw longer use in some places.  In countries like India and the Soviet Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://20th.su/2011/12/01/posylki-v-sssr/ |title=Parcels in the USSR (in Russian) |accessdate=2017-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, they were commonly used for writing addresses on [[registered mail]] parcels, which were required by law to be wrapped in cloth&amp;mdash;usually plain white or unbleached [[Calico (textile)|calico]]&amp;mdash;and secured with twine and [[sealing wax]].  For writing an address on cloth, a moistened copying pencil was preferred to a pen, whose nib could easily get caught in the weave. During their heyday, copying pencils were also associated, across the world, with the image of a [[Conductor (transportation)|railway conductor]], who famously carried one tucked behind an ear.

== Modern uses ==
[[File:Matita_copiativa.jpg|thumb|An Italian copy pencil used in elections]]
In [[Italy]] and other countries, their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senato.it/3433?testo_generico=19&amp;voce_sommario=63 |title=L. 6 febbraio 1948 , n. 29 |accessdate=2016-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signs written with copying pencil cannot be tampered without leaving clear traces on the paper.

==Health risks==
Indelible pencils were the cause of significant health risks due to the presence of [[aniline dyes]]. Exposure to aniline dyes could lead to [[eczema]], acne and [[carcinoma]]. Penetration of the dye from the pencil lead into the body commonly leads to severe and debilitating effects such as fever, [[anaemia]], elevated white cell count, gastro-intestinal upset, kidney and liver damage, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[necrosis]] of the tissue surrounding the wound. Such risks are not associated with ordinary graphite pencils. While these symptoms may appear after a couple of days they often develop only after weeks have passed since the injury was sustained. Surgery is required to remove the dye and the infected tissue and "the necrotizing action may be so severe and extensive amputation is necessary".{{sfn|Mason|Allen|1941|p=133}}

{{Blood gas, acid-base, &amp; gas exchange terms}}

In [[physiology]], '''dead space''' is the volume of air which is inhaled that does not take part in the gas exchange, either because it (1) remains in the conducting airways, or (2) reaches alveoli that are [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|not perfused or poorly perfused]]. In other words, not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Mammals [[breath]]e in and out of their lungs, wasting that part of the inhalation which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur.

Benefits do accrue to a seemingly wasteful design for ventilation that includes dead space.&lt;ref name=WestPhysiology&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=John B.|title=Respiratory physiology : the essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-60913-640-6|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
#Carbon dioxide is retained, making a [[Acid–base homeostasis|bicarbonate-buffered]] blood and interstitium possible.
#Inspired air is brought to body temperature, increasing the affinity of [[hemoglobin]] for [[oxygen]], improving O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake.&lt;ref name=Williams1996&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=R|author2=Rankin, N |author3=Smith, T |author4=Galler, D |author5= Seakins, P |title=Relationship between the humidity and temperature of inspired gas and the function of the airway mucosa.|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=November 1996|volume=24|issue=11|pages=1920–9|pmid=8917046|doi=10.1097/00003246-199611000-00025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Particulate matter is trapped on the mucus that lines the conducting airways, allowing its removal by [[Mucociliary clearance|mucociliary transport]].
#Inspired air is humidified, improving the quality of airway mucus.&lt;ref name=Williams1996 /&gt;

In humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. In adults, it is usually in the range of 150 mL.&lt;ref name = wasted&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmtutorials.com/rs/mv/strategy/page16.htm |title=Wasted Ventilation |publisher=Ccmtutorials.com |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead space can be increased (and better envisioned) by breathing through a long tube, such as a [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]]. Even though one end of the snorkel is open to the air, when the wearer breathes in, they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the snorkel from the previous exhalation. Thus, a snorkel increases the person's dead space by adding even more "airway" that doesn't participate in gas exchange.

==Components==

The ''total'' dead space (also known as '''physiological dead space''') is the sum of the anatomical dead space plus the alveolar dead space.

===Anatomic dead space===
Anatomical dead space is that portion of the airways (such as the [[mouth]] and [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the bronchioles) which conducts gas to the [[alveoli]]. No gas exchange is possible in these spaces. In healthy lungs where the alveolar dead space is small, [[Fowler's method]] accurately measures the anatomic dead space by a [[nitrogen]] washout technique.
&lt;ref name=fowler1948&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fowler W.S. | year = 1948 | title = Lung Function studies. II. The respiratory dead space | url = | journal = Am. J. Physiol. | volume = 154 | issue = | pages = 405–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heller H, Könen-Bergmann M, Schuster K | title = An algebraic solution to dead space determination according to Fowler's graphical method | journal = Comput Biomed Res | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–7 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10337497 | doi = 10.1006/cbmr.1998.1504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal value for dead space volume (in mL) is approximately the lean mass of the body (in pounds), and averages about a third of the resting [[tidal volume]] (450-500 mL). In Fowler's original study, the anatomic dead space was 156 ± 28 mL (n=45 males) or 26% of their tidal volume.&lt;ref name=fowler1948 /&gt; Despite the flexibility of the trachea and smaller conducting airways, their overall volume (i.e. the anatomic dead space) changes little with bronchoconstriction or when breathing hard during exercise.&lt;ref name=fowler1948 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke |first=TV |author2=Küng, M |author3=Burki, NK |title=Pulmonary gas exchange during histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects. |journal=Chest |year=1989 |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=752–6 |pmid=2791669 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/96/4/752.long |doi=10.1378/chest.96.4.752 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have a disproportionately large anatomic dead space (they have a longer and wider trachea than mammals the same size), reducing the airway resistance.  This adaptation does not impact gas exchange because birds flow air through their lungs - they do not breathe in and out like mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=JB|title=Comparative physiology of the pulmonary blood-gas barrier: the unique avian solution.|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology|year=2009|volume=297|issue=6|pages=R1625-34|pmid=19793953|pmc=2803621|doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00459.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alveolar dead space===
Alveolar dead space is sum of the volumes of those alveoli which have little or no blood flowing through their adjacent pulmonary [[capillaries]], i.e., alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused, and where, as a result, no gas exchange can occur.&lt;ref name=WestPhysiology /&gt; Alveolar dead space is negligible in healthy individuals, but can increase dramatically in some [[lung disease]]s due to [[ventilation-perfusion mismatch]].

==Calculating the dead space==

Just as dead space ''wastes'' a fraction of the inhaled breath, dead space ''dilutes'' alveolar air during exhalation. By quantifying this dilution it is possible to measure anatomical and alveolar dead space, employing the concept of '''[[mass balance]]''', as expressed by [[Bohr equation]].&lt;ref name=Bohr&gt;

::&lt;math chem&gt;\frac{V_{d}}{V_{t}} = \frac {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}} - P_{e\,\ce{CO2}}}  {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math chem&gt;V_{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the dead space volume and &lt;math chem&gt;V_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the tidal volume;
::&lt;math chem&gt;P_{a\,\ce{CO2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, and 
::&lt;math chem&gt;P_{e\,\ce{CO2}}&lt;/math&gt;  is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the expired (exhaled) air.

===Physiological dead space===

The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in healthy alveoli is known. It is equal to its concentration in arterial blood since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rapidly equilibrates across the alveolar–capillary membrane. The quantity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhaled from the healthy alveoli will be diluted by the air in the conducting airways and by air from alveoli that are poorly perfused. This dilution factor can be calculated once the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the exhaled breath is determined (either by electronically monitoring the exhaled breath or by collecting the exhaled breath in a gas impermeant bag (a Douglas bag) and then measuring the mixed gas in the collection bag). Algebraically, this dilution factor will give us the '''physiological dead space''' as calculated by the Bohr equation:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\frac{V_\ce{physiological\,dead\,space}}{V_t} = \frac {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}} - P_\ce{mixed\,expired\,CO2}}  {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Alveolar dead space===

When the poorly perfused alveoli empty at the same rate as the normal alveoli, it is possible to measure the '''alveolar dead space'''.  In this case, the end-tidal sample of gas (measured by [[capnography]]) contains CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at a concentration that is less than that found in the normal alveoli (i.e. in the blood):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severinghaus|first=JW|author2=Stupfel, MA |author3=Bradley, AF |title=Alveolar dead space and arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide differences during hypothermia in dog and man.|journal=J Appl Physiol|date=May 1957|volume=10|issue=3|pages=349–55|pmid=13438782|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/10/3/349.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math chem&gt;\frac{V_\ce{alveolar\,dead\,space}}{V_t} = \frac {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}} - P_\ce{end\ tidal\,CO2}}  {P_{a\,\ce{CO2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Caution:''' The end tidal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration may not be a well defined number.
::#Poorly ventilated alveoli do not generally empty at the same rate as healthy alveoli.  Particularly in emphysematous lungs, diseased alveoli empty slowly, and so the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of the exhaled air increases progressively throughout the expiration.&lt;ref name=WestPhysiology /&gt;
::#Monitoring alveolar dead space during a surgical operation ''is'' a sensitive and important tool in monitoring airway function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gravenstein|first=J.S. (ed.), Jaffe, M.B. (ed.), Gravenstein, N. (ed.), Paulus, D.A. (ed) |title=Capnography.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521514781|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
::#During strenuous exercise, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will rise throughout the exhalation and may not be easily matched to a blood gas determination, which led to serious errors of interpretation early in the history of dead space determinations.&lt;ref name=Bohr /&gt;
::'''Example''': For a tidal volume of 500 mL, an arterial carbon dioxide of 42 mm Hg, and an end-expired carbon dioxide of 40 mm Hg:
:::&lt;math chem&gt;\frac{V_\ce{alveolar\,dead\,space}}\ce{500\ mL} = \frac {42\ \ce{mm Hg} - 40\ \ce{mm Hg}}  \ce{42\ mm Hg}&lt;/math&gt;
:::and so &lt;math chem&gt; V_\ce{alveolar\,dead\,space}= 24\ \ce{mL}.&lt;/math&gt;

A different maneuver is employed in measuring anatomic dead space: the test subject breathes all the way out, inhales deeply from a 0% nitrogen gas mixture (usually 100% oxygen) and then breathes out into equipment that measures nitrogen and gas volume.  This final exhalation occurs in three phases.  The first phase has no nitrogen, and is the air that entered the lung only as far as the conducting airways. The nitrogen concentration then rapidly increases during the brief second phase and finally reaches a plateau, the third phase. The '''anatomic dead space''' is equal to the volume exhaled during the first phase plus half that exhaled during the second phase. (The Bohr equation is used to justify the inclusion of half the second phase in this calculation.)&lt;ref name=fowler1948 /&gt;

==Dead space and the ventilated patient==

The depth and frequency of our breathing is determined by chemoreceptors and the brainstem, as modified by a number of subjective sensations.  When [[medical ventilator|ventilated]], the patient breathes at a rate and tidal volume that is dictated by the machine.
Because of dead space, taking deep breaths more slowly (e.g. ten 500 ml breaths per minute) is more effective than taking shallow breaths quickly (e.g. twenty 250 ml breaths per minute). Although the amount of gas per minute is the same (5 L/min), a large proportion of the shallow breaths is dead space, and does not allow oxygen to get into the blood.

==Mechanical dead space==
'''Mechanical dead space''' is dead space in an apparatus in which the [[breathing gas]] must flow in both directions as the user breathes in and out, increasing the necessary respiratory effort to get the same amount of usable air or breathing gas, and risking accumulation of [[carbon dioxide]] from shallow breaths. It is in effect an external extension of the physiological dead space.

It can be reduced by:
* Using separate intake and exhaust passages with one-way valves placed in the mouthpiece. This limits the dead space to between the non return valves and the user's mouth and/or nose. The additional dead space can be minimized by keeping the volume of this external dead space as small as possible, but this should not unduly increase work of breathing.
* With a [[full face mask]] or [[Diving helmet#Lightweight demand helmets|demand diving helmet]]:
** Keeping the inside volume small
** Having a small internal [[orinasal mask]] inside the main mask, which separates the external respiratory passage from the rest of the mask interior.
**In a few models of full face mask a mouthpiece like those used on diving regulators is fitted, which has the same function as an orinasal mask, but can further reduce the volume of the external dead space, at the cost of forcing mouth-breathing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Extensional and intensional definitions''' are two key ways in which the [[entity|object(s)]] or [[concept]](s) a [[terminology|term]] refers to can be [[definition|defined]].

==Intensional definition==
{{also|Intension}}
In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], an '''intensional definition''' gives the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a term by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. In the case of [[nouns]], this is equivalent to specifying the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] that an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] needs to have in order to be counted as a [[referent]] of the term.

For example, an intensional definition of the word "bachelor" is "unmarried man". This definition is valid because being an unmarried man is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for being a bachelor: it is necessary because one cannot be a bachelor without being an unmarried man, and it is sufficient because any unmarried man is a bachelor.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;Cook, Roy T. "Intensional Definition". In ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the opposite approach to the [[#Extensional definition|extensional definition]], which defines by listing everything that falls under that definition – an extensional definition of ''bachelor'' would be a listing of all the unmarried men in the world.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

As becomes clear, intensional definitions are best used when something has a clearly defined set of properties, and they work well for terms that have too many referents to list in an extensional definition. It is impossible to give an extensional definition for a term with an [[infinity|infinite]] set of referents, but an intensional one can often be stated concisely – there are infinitely many [[even and odd numbers|even numbers]], impossible to list, but the term "even numbers" can be defined easily by saying that even numbers are [[integer]] multiples of two.

[[Genus–differentia definition|Definition by genus and difference]], in which something is defined by first stating the broad category it belongs to and then distinguished by specific properties, is a type of intensional definition. As the name might suggest, this is the type of definition used in [[Linnaean taxonomy]] to categorize living things, but is by no means restricted to [[biology]]. Suppose one defines a miniskirt as "a skirt with a hemline above the knee". It has been assigned to a ''genus'', or larger class of items: it is a type of skirt. Then, we've described the ''differentia'', the specific properties that make it its own sub-type: it has a hemline above the knee.

Intensional definition also applies to rules or sets of [[axiom]]s that define a [[set (mathematics)|set]] by describing a procedure for generating all of its members. For example, an intensional definition of ''[[square number]]'' can be "any number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself". The rule—"take an integer and multiply it by itself"—always generates members of the set of square numbers, no matter which integer one chooses, and for any square number, there is an integer that was multiplied by itself to get it.

Similarly, an intensional definition of a game, such as [[chess]], would be the rules of the game; any game played by those rules must be a game of chess, and any game properly called a game of chess must have been played by those rules.

==Extensional definition==
An '''extensional definition''' of a concept or term formulates its meaning by specifying its '''extension''', that is, every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that falls under the definition of the concept or term in question.

For example, an extensional definition of the term "nation of the world" might be given by listing all of the nations of the world, or by giving some other means of recognizing the members of the corresponding class.  An explicit listing of the extension, which is only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets, is a type of ''[[enumerative definition]]''.

Extensional definitions are used when listing examples would give more applicable information than other types of definition, and where listing the members of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] tells the questioner enough about the nature of that set. 

This is similar to an [[ostensive definition]], in which one or more members of a set (but not necessarily all) are pointed out as examples. The opposite approach is the [[#Intensional definition|intensional definition]], which defines by listing properties that a thing must have in order to be part of the set captured by the definition.

'''Flagfall''' or '''flag fall''' is a common [[Australia]]n expression for a fixed start fee, especially in the [[taxi]] and [[Logistics|haulage]] and [[railway]] industries. From the Australian [[mobile phone]] industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other [[English language]] countries, as business [[jargon]] for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The logic behind is believed to be a method used by Australian mobile phone companies to recover a component of the carriage charges they incur in completing a call to a subscriber being the [[termination rates]], based on the price terms and conditions for the mobile terminating access service (MTAS). The [[Australian Consumer and Competition Commission]] is reviewing these arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/regulated-infrastructure/communications/mobile-services/mobile-terminating-access-service-fad-inquiry-2014 Mobile terminating access service FAD inquiry 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression is also beginning to find its way into other businesses as a [[synonym]] to "start fee".  The taxi expression is also being used in [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], and some other countries, but hasn't been used there as a general synonym for start fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/flag-fall Collins Dictionary: flagfall]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origin is a [[taxicab|taxi]] expression for the minimum charge for hiring a taxi, to which the rate per kilometre or mile and a rate per minute is usually then added up to a minimum taxicab road speed. 
When the passenger steps inside the taxicab, the flagfall condition is triggered and the taxicab driver can start the taximeter. Even if the passenger has not yet instructed the driver where to take them, the driver is entitled to the flagfall and the rate per minute component (even if the taxi is not moving). 
The term, "Flagfall" dates back to the old mechanical [[taximeter]]s, which were equipped with a [[flag]]-like lever that could be seen from outside the cab.  When the "flag" was up and visible, the cab was not occupied.  When a passenger stepped in, the driver turned the lever down  - the "flag fall" -  and the taximeter started counting. In Australia, once the taximeter is counting, there are orange tariff indicator lights on the taxi head sign which light up to show the taxicab is hired.

'''Gorgotoqui''' is a currently undocumented [[extinct language]] of the [[Chiquitania]] region of the eastern [[Bolivia]]n lowlands. 

During the period of the [[Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos|Jesuit missions to Chiquitos]], Gorgotoqui was the most populous language of the area. It became a [[lingua franca]] and the sole language of the Jesuit mission (ICOMOS 1990:59). A Jesuit priest&lt;ref&gt;Kaspar Rueß (Spanish: Gaspar Ruíz), 11 November 1585, Haunstadt, [[Bavaria]] – 12 April 1624, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], Bolivia (O'Neill &amp; María 2001:3432; Huonder 1899:121)&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a grammar, but no-one has been able to locate it "in recent years" (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004:32), and no other documentation has survived. Thus a language that was regionally important during the colonial era disappeared under pressure from more successful indigenous peoples (Adelaar 2007:326); this appears to have occurred in under half a century (Alarcón 2001:101).

Loukotka (1968) classified Gorgotoqui as a [[language isolate]], but Kaufman (1990) left it [[unclassified language|unclassified]] because of a lack of data. From comments that the several languages of the missions "had nothing in common" (Oliva &amp; Pazos 1895:15), we can only conclude that it was not close to any other local language.

In grammar, an '''intensive word form''' is one which denotes stronger, more forceful, or more concentrated action relative to the root on which the intensive is built.  Intensives are usually lexical formations, but there may be a regular process for forming intensives from a root.  Intensive formations, for example, existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], and in many of the [[Semitic languages]].

== Generally an adverb ==

Intensives are generally used as adverbs.  In general, they are placed before the verb that they modify, usually a form of the "be" verb.  An example in common usage today is ''"the heck"''; as in ''"What the heck is going on here?"''  ''"The heck"'' can be left out of the sentence without changing the meaning; however, the sentence is less intense without it.  There are many varieties that are equivalent to ''"the heck"'' that are generally considered vulgar or otherwise inappropriate in polite conversation.  In modern usage is also ''"the hell"'' or ''"the fuck"''.  In the mid-19th century, ''"in tarnation"'' was in common usage.  In Great Britain, ''"bloody well"'' is an intensive adverb in common usage.  ''"I will bloody well do it."''
 
In [[Classical Arabic]], Form II (''faʿʿal-a'') can form intensives.  [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has a similar distinction between the ''pi`el'' (intensive) and ''hiph`il'' (causative) [[binyan]]s.

[[Latin]] had verbal prefixes ''e-'' and ''per-'' that could be more or less freely added onto any verb and variously added such meanings as ''to put a great deal of effort into doing something'': ''ructa'' (burp), ''eructa'' (belch).  When the same prefixes, especially ''per'', were added to adjectives, the resulting meaning was ''very X'' or ''extremely X''.

'''Joan Alcover i Maspons''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒuˈan əlkuˈve}}; 1854 – 1926) was a Spanish [[Balearic people|Balearic]] writer, poet, essayist and politician.

== Biography ==
The son of an influential family, he studied the Baccalaureate at the Balearic Institute before reading for a degree in Law in [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Once he became a lawyer (1878), he returned to Majorca to take up varying posts in the Island's judiciary. Simultaneously, he was a militant of the liberal party of his friend Antoni Maura when he commenced a political career that would culminate in his appointment as a representative of the '[[Cortes Generales|Corts]]' [Courts] (1893). After a short stay in [[Madrid]], he returned home to the [[Balearic Islands]] and abandoned all political activities.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

From an early age he had combined his studies and, later on, his professional occupation, with his interest in writing. At the age of eighteen he had published his poems in both Catalan and Spanish in magazines like 'El Isleño', 'Museo Balear' or 'Revista Balear'. However, his literary interest would become stronger during the time spent in Barcelona, where he had come into contact with the literary activities of the '[[Renaixença]]' cultural movement (magazines, literary contests, conferences, readings…). At 23 he would win an extraordinary prize at the Barcelona 'Jocs Florals' [Floral Games].&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

Joan Alcover was to gain recognition as a poet, and he would soon become the kind of person who, extremely fond of literature, would use his literary ability in order to gain social prestige. Thus, his house would become the base for reputed talks with the prestigious Majorcan intellectuals. Little by little he ceased to write in Catalan, preferring to write his poetry in Spanish. His first poetry books 'Poesías' [Poetries] (1887), 'Nuevas poesías' [New poetries] (1892), 'Poemas y armonías' [Poetries and harmonies] (1894) and 'Meteoros. Poemas, apólogos y cuentos' [Meteors. Poems, apologues and stories] (1901), reflect this tendency to be monolingual, even though he would include some poems in Catalan in the first two titles. However, the other two titles would be entirely written in Spanish. This is poetry inspired by the Romantic, which imitates other poets', such as Bécquer and Campoamor, having intense expression of the poetical voice, yet straining to avoid rhetorical excesses and pomposity. His books were well received by critics who afforded him a title in circles which supported the official culture.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

However, misfortune played a decisive role in both his life and literary career. In 1887, just six years after he had wed, Alcover lost his wife, Rosa Pujol Guarch, with whom he had had three children, Pere, Teresa and Gaietà. In 1891 he married Maria del Haro Rosselló, with whom he had two more children, Maria and Pau. Of the five children, he would only be outlived by the last one: in 1901 Teresa died from [[tuberculosis]]; in 1905, Pere died from [[typhoid]]; in 1919 both Maria and Gaietà perished on the same day. This sequence of misfortunes drove him to a deep nervous breakdown which would lead him to heighten his intellectual research, deriving of more natural and sincere forms of expression. His poetry would progressively start to change, beginning with its medium, that is the language in which it was written. Between 1899 and 1903 Alcover would hesitate whether to continue writing in Spanish, or return to Catalan: he would eventually decide to fully embrace Catalan.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

In fact his personal circumstances would overlap with other collective conditions: in the Majorca of the time, Romantic literature was in decline, the island was becoming modernised, cultural ties had started to emerge with Catalonia and political Catalanism was starting to gain prominence in the island. All this moved him to broaden his literary horizons, to join a wider movement and to make ties, mainly due to his friendship with Santiago Rusiñol and Josep Carner, with the Principalities’ cultural activity. This move guided him towards a new perception of art and literature, whose sense was no longer ingeniousness and the entertaining easy game, but a social involvement: he believed that poetry must have a resonance and that it must serve a useful purpose in the collective from which it drew its inspiration and whom it served.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

In 1904 he gave a seminar at Barcelona’s Athenaeum entitled ‘Humanització de l’art’ [Humanising of art], which constituted his most important declaration about the art of lyrical composition. In this text he defended the belief that a poet's involvement should be aesthetically exposed in a clear and intelligible poetry, in a well presented form. However, he expressed his dislike for an intellectualised poetry and those so called literary schools and trends that were based upon mere artifice. He therefore positioned himself half way between a spontaneous type of poetry, like that written by Joan Maragall, and a lyricism constructed upon perfect form, but sentimentally arid, like that written by the Parnassian poets. In accordance with the turn of the centuries' views about truth and life, Alcover would pursue a poetry style tied to life's experience which was able to deeply connect with the reader's sense of humanity.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

The book that best exemplifies his lyrical theory is 'Cap al tard' [When it is getting late] (1909), which is written entirely in Catalan: in this collection of unrelated poems we see a lyrical voice split into different people, describing many landscapes which are typically Majorcan, in order to express their anaemic state, feelings and emotions, as well as the poet’s own artistic conception. Alcover did this by using forms and ideas taken from popular imaginary, like those we find in the poem ‘Balanguera’, which would be adapted to music by [[Amadeu Vives]]  and become Majorca’s present-day hymn. The section entitled ‘Elegies’ [Elegies] is, without doubt, one of the high points of the book: here the poet demonstrates, from a slightly detached angle, the fatherly suffering he had experienced, even though, it must be said, he transcends this pain by turning it into an emotion that can be universally felt. In ‘Poemes bíblics’ [Biblical poems] (1918), which would be his final book of poems, he again uses different poetical persons, but this time they are of biblical inspiration, and he does not achieve the same degree of excellence that he had reached in the previous volume.

His status as an intellectual, like that of Miquel Costa Llobera, was recognised and acclaimed by many writers of the time, and especially by those of the 'escola mallorquina' [Majorcan School]. He was a member of the 'Acadèmia de Bones Lletres' [Academy of Good Letters] (1913), President of the Barcelona 'Jocs Florals' [Floral Games] (1916) and a member of the 'Institut d'Estudis Catalans' [Institute of Catalan Studies] (1916).&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=51b8ef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=51b8ef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=6e0eef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;newLang=en_GB |title=Joan Alcover |accessdate={{date|2014-03-23}} |publisher= Generalitat de Catalunya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kendayan''', or '''Salako''' (Selako), is a [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] [[Dayak people|Dayak]] language of Borneo. The exact number of speakers remains unknown, but is estimated to be around 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Joseph, J. B. Mangunsudarsono, Hery Suryatman and Abdussamad. 1985. ''Morfologi kata kerja bahasa Kendayan''. Jakarta: Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa (Departmenen Pedidikan dan Kebudayan)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Kendayan'' is preferred in [[Kalimantan]], and ''Salako'' in [[Sarawak]]. It is sometimes referred to as ''Bahasa Badameà'', particularly in [[Bengkayang Regency]] and the areas near Singkawang City.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Adelaar, K. Alexander. 2005. ''Salako or Badameá: sketch grammar, text and lexicon of a Kanayatn dialect in West Borneo''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dialects of Kendayan include Ahe, Banana and ''Belangin.'' Speakers of any of the dialects can understand speakers of any of the others.

== Language context ==
Salako is spoken in Sarawak and West Kalimantan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are speakers in Sambas and Bengkayang Regencies and in Singkawang. Other dialects are spoken in the Pontianak, Bengkawang and Landak Regencies of West Kalimantan.

It is said that Singkawang in southern Sambas is the place of origin of Salako speakers.

Dialects spoken in West Kalimantan have been influenced by the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], which is the national language of [[Indonesia]]. This is the language used in official contexts, schools, the media and in church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Sarawak, the influence of Malay has been less significant, as it became the national language more recently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kendayan is a vital language that is used in the community and at home. The Ahe variety is also spoken as a [[lingua franca]] among Dayak speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, younger speakers are typically educated through Indonesian away from the villages, which could affect language vitality in the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Kimba language''', '''''Tsikimba''''', is a [[Kainji language]] of [[Nigeria]] spoken by the [[Kambari people]]. As of 2004, the language had 100,000 native speakers. 

Kimba has three dialects: Kimba, Gaushi (Agaushi) and Wənci (Ngwunci). Blench considers Gaushi and Wənci (Ngwunci) to be distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, 2010. [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/BC/Kainji/Kambari/KmbOP.htm The Kambari languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10585">Lactate inflection point (LIP), is the [[exercise]] intensity at which the blood concentration of lactate and/or [[lactic acid]] begins to exponentially increase.&lt;ref name="goodwin2007"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Jul 2007|title=BlLactate Measurements and Analysis during Exercise: A Guide for Clinicians|journal=J Diabetes Sci Technol.|volume=1|issue=4|pages=558–569|doi=10.1177/193229680700100414|pmc=2769631|pmid=19885119|author=Matthew L.

The onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) is often confused with the lactate threshold. With a higher exercise intensity the lactate production exceeds at a rate which it cannot be broken down, the blood lactate concentration will show an increase equal to 4.0mM; it then accumulates at the muscle and then moves to the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nelson Physical Education Studies For WA|last=McPartland|first=Darren|last2=Pree|first2=Adrian|last3=Malpeli|first3=Robert|last4=Telford|first4=Amanda|publisher=Nelson|year=2010|isbn=9780170182027|location=Australia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which prevent lactate levels from rising. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1α which alters the [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236644061_Skeletal_muscle_PGC-1a_controls_whole-body_lactate_homeostasis_through_estrogen-related_receptor_a-_Dependent_activation_of_LDH_B_and_repression_of_LDH_A isoenzyme composition of the LDH complex] and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summermatter|first=Serge|last2=Santos|first2=Gesa|last3=Pérez-Schindler|first3=Joaquín|last4=Handschin|first4=Christoph|date=2013-05-21|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–8743|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363|url=http://edoc.unibas.ch/27589/4/Handschin_PNAS_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training types ==
The lactate threshold is a useful measure for deciding exercise intensity for training and racing in endurance sports (e.g., long distance running, cycling, rowing, long distance swimming and cross country skiing), but varies between individuals and can be increased with training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Interval training ===
[[Interval training]] uses different work and rest periods allowing the body to temporarily exceed the lactate threshold at a high intensity, and then recover (reduce blood-lactate).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This type of training uses the ATP-PC and the lactic acid system whilst exercising, which provides the most energy when there are short bursts of high intensity exercise followed by a recovery period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=M. S|last2=Little|first2=J. P|last3=Tarnopolsky|first3=M. A|last4=Myslik|first4=F|last5=Gibala|first5=M. J|date=2011|title=Low volume interval training improve muscle oxidative capacity in sedentary adults|url=|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|issue=10|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182199834|pmid=21448086|access-date=|volume=43|pages=1849–1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interval training can take the form of many different types of exercise and should closely replicate the movements found in the sport being trained for.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interval training can be adjusted to the individual, however it is important to consider the intensity of each interval, duration or distance of each interval, length of rest/recovery, number of repetitions, frequency of training and recovery type.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fartlek training ===
[[Fartlek]] and interval training are similar, the main difference being the structure of the exercise. Fartlek is a Swedish word, meaning speed play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This type of training is a combination of continuous (generally aerobic) and interval training (generally anaerobic), involving consistent changes of pace/intensity throughout the session.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aerobic and Anaerobic training ===
It is important to understand the difference between lactate threshold and lactic acid. Aerobic training will not help with lactic acid tolerance, however, it will increase the lactate threshold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body will build a better tolerance to the effects of lactic acid over time during training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;!-- This should be obvious, A: Aerobic training will not help with lactic acid tolerance. B: The body will build a better tolerance to the effects of lactic acid over time during [Aerobic?] training. A logical fallacy which should be either removed or someone should check the sources. It can be both true and false, what a gem! --&gt; Anaerobic training improves the muscles’ alkaline reserves, allowing the muscles’ ability to work in the presence of increased lactic acid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Training at or slightly above the intensity where this occurs improves the lactate threshold.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Measuring lactate threshold ==
Your muscles are producing lactate even at rest, usually about 0.8-1.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhinofitness.ca/articles/article_lactate_testing.html|title=Blood lactate testing: what is it, how is it done?|last=LaBossiere|first=Cris|date=2007|website=Rhino Fitness|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lactate threshold is defined as the point when lactic acid starts to accumulate, some testers approximate this by crossing the lactate threshold and using the point at which lactate reaches a [[concentration]] of 4 [[Molar concentration|mmol/]]L of lactate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faude|first=O|last2=Kindermann|first2=W|last3=Meyer|first3=T|date=2009|title=Lactate threshold concepts; how valid are they?|url=|journal=Sports Medicine|issue=6|pages=469–490|doi=10.2165/00007256-200939060-00003|pmid=|access-date=|volume=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to measure lactate levels non-invasively is using [[Near-infrared spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neary|first=Patrick J|date=2004|title=Application of near infrared spectroscopy to exercise sport science|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology|issue=4|pages=488–503|doi=10.1139/h04-032|pmid=|access-date=|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are wearable NIRS sensors for professionals, so they can monitor their lactate levels real-time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accurately measuring the [[Lactic Acid#Blood Testing|lactate blood concentration]] involves taking blood samples (normally a pinprick to the finger, earlobe or thumb) during a ramp test where the exercise intensity is progressively increased.&lt;ref name="moran2012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Feb 2012|title=The influence of blood lactate sample site on exercise prescription|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=26|issue=2|pages=563–567|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e318225f395|pmid=22240552|author=Moran, P, Prichard, JG, Ansley, L, and Howatson, G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Garmin running and cycling devices estimate user lactate threshold non-invasively via a combined analysis of [[heart rate]] and [[heart rate variability]] data provided by Firstbeat Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.garmin.com/en-US/runningdynamics/#lactate-threshold|title=Garmin {{!}} United States {{!}} Running Dynamics and Physiological Measurements|website=www.garmin.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstbeat.com/en/consumer-feature/lactate-threshold/|title=Lactate Threshold - Firstbeat|work=Firstbeat|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Accuracy of blood samples ==
Blood samples are a popular way of measuring the lactate blood concentration, however there are many factors that may affect the sample. Every individual has a different health status, thus the results from the blood lactate response can vary from factors prior to exercise such as the glycogen status of the participant and ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="mann2013" /&gt; “Furthermore, the lactate concentration measured may vary depending on the sampling site sweat contamination, and the accuracy of the lactate analyser.” &lt;ref name="mann2013" /&gt; There are many factors that may give this test a false reading; it is important that an individual takes these into consideration, to receive an accurate test.&lt;ref name="moran2012" /&gt;

== Lactate measurement of aerobic and anaerobic thresholds ==

The aerobic threshold (AeT or AerT) is sometimes defined as the exercise intensity at which blood lactate concentrations rise above resting levels.&lt;ref name="mann2013"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Jul 2013|title=Methods of prescribing relative exercise intensity: physiological and practical considerations|journal=Sports Med|volume=43|issue=7|pages=613–625|doi=10.1007/s40279-013-0045-x|pmid=23620244|vauthors=Mann T, Lamberts RP, Lambert MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anaerobic threshold (AnT) is sometimes defined equivalently to the lactate threshold(LT); as the exercise intensity beyond which blood lactate concentration is no longer linearly related to exercise intensity, but increases with both exercise intensity ''and'' duration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The blood lactate concentration at the anaerobic threshold is called the "maximum steady-state lactate concentration" (MLSS).&lt;ref name="mann2013" /&gt;

AeT is the exercise intensity at which aerobic energy pathways start to operate, considered to be around 65-85% of an individual's maximum heart rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some have suggested this is where [[blood lactate]] reaches a [[concentration]] of 2 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/litre (at rest it is around 1).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The anaerobic energy system increases the ability to produce blood lactate during maximal exercise, resulting from an increased amount of glycogen stores and glycolytic enzymes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Standard Malay==
Malay is specified as the national language of Brunei in the constitution of 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Hussainmiya, B. A. (2001). ''The Brunei constitution of 1959: An inside history'', 2nd ed. Bandar Seri Begawan: Brunei Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its central role in the country is reinforced in the national MIB philosophy (''Melayu Islam Beraja'', 'Malay  Islamic Monarchy').&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. M. (2016). Changing patterns of education in Brunei: How past plans have shaped future trends. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 267-278). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the variety of Malay that functions as the national language is not specified, it is generally assumed to be a variety of Standard Malay that is similar to the standard varieties promoted in Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ClynesDet2011"&gt;Clynes, A., &amp; Deterding, D. (2011). Standard Malay (Brunei). ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', ''41'', 259–268.[http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/research/malay/index.html On-line Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the use of Standard Malay and Brunei Malay can be described under the concept of diglossia,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, C. A. (1959). Diglossia. ''Word'', 15, 325-340.&lt;/ref&gt; with Standard Malay taking the H(igh) role and being used in formal domains such as teaching and official speeches, while Brunei Malay functions in a L(ow) role, being used in informal domains such as between friends and in local shops.&lt;ref name="McNoorDet2016"&gt;McLellan, J., Noor Azam H-O., &amp; Deterding, D. (2016). The language situation in Brunei Darussalam. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 9-16). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of pronunciation, the Standard Malay of Brunei is rhotic, so there is an [r] at the end of words such as ''besar'' ('big'), and it has [a] rather than [ə] at the end of words such as ''saya'' ('I') and ''utara'' ('north').&lt;ref name="ClynesDet2011" /&gt;

==Brunei Malay==
The local dialect, [[Melayu Brunei]] (Brunei Malay), is the most widely spoken language.&lt;ref name="Gallop 2006"/&gt; It is spoken by about 266,000 people.&lt;ref name="kxd"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kxd Ethnologue report for language code: kxd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; About 84% of its words are cognate with Standard Malay, while 94% are reported to be cognate with [[Kedayan language|Kedayan]].&lt;ref name="MartPoed1996" /&gt;

Brunei Malay is also spoken as a lingua franca in some parts of [[East Malaysia]] such as the Federal Territory of Labuan, the districts of Limbang and Lawas (Sarawak) and the districts of Sipitang, Beaufort, Kuala Penyu and Papar (Sabah).&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, A. (2014). Brunei Malay: An overview. In P. Sercombe, M. Boutin &amp; A. Clynes (Eds.), ''Advances in research on linguistic and cultural practices in Borneo'' (pp. 153-200). Phillips, ME: Borneo Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; In Brunei, use of Brunei Malay is expanding at the expense of the other indigenous minority languages in Brunei, most of which are under threat of extinction.&lt;ref name="NoorSiti2016"&gt;Noor-Azam H-O., &amp; Siti Ajeerah, N. (2016). The state of indigenous languages in Brunei. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 17-28). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the phonological features of Brunei Malay are: /h/ cannot occur in initial position, and there are only three vowels, /i,a,u/.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Ishamina Athirah (2017). Brunei Malay. ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 47(1), 99–108. [http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/research/brunei-malay/index.html On-line Version]&lt;/ref&gt; For its syntax, if has been claimed that the verb often occurs in initial position,&lt;ref&gt;Poedjosoedarmo, G., &amp; Hj Rosnah Hj Ramly (1996). Some notes on Brunei Malay syntax. In P. W. Martin, C. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjosoedarmo (Eds), ''Language Use &amp; Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 60-72). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a distinct set of modal verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Aznah, S. (2016). Comprehension of aspect markers by Brunei Malay L1 learners. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 75-94). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English==
{{main|Brunei English}}
[[English Language|English]] is widely used as a business and official language and it is spoken by a majority of the population in Brunei, though some people have only a rudimentary knowledge of the language.&lt;ref name="DetSal2013"&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina, S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; There is one daily English language newspaper, ''Borneo Bulletin''.

The bilingual system of education was introduced in 1985, with the first three years taught in Malay while English was the medium of instruction for most subjects from the fourth year of primary school onward,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. (1996). The Brunei education policy in Brunei Darussalam. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), ''Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (123-132). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; so all school children have had substantial exposure to English since then. In 2008, the new SPN21 education system was introduced, and from then on, maths and science have been taught in English from the start of primary school, so the role of English is even more firmly established.&lt;ref name="DetSal2013" /&gt;

The language of the courts is mainly English,&lt;ref&gt;Hjh Masmahirah Hj Mohd Tali (2016). Courtroom discourse: A case study of the linguistic strategies in Brunei courtooms. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 135-163). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; though, just as in Malaysia, code-switching between English and Malay is common.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, R. (2009). Language alternation in Malaysia courtrooms and comparisons with other common law jurisdictions. In M. K. David, J. McLellan, S. Rafik-Galea &amp; A. N. Abdullah (Eds.), ''Code switching in Malaysi'' (pp. 135-149). Frankfurt: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

One result of the promotion of both English and Malay in Brunei is that minority languages, such as Tutong and Dusun, tend to get squeezed out. Noor Azam has described the situation using the Malay proverb: ''Gajah berperang, pelanduk mati di tengah-tengah''. ('When elephants fight, the mouse-deer between them dies.')&lt;ref&gt;Noor Azam (2012). It's not always English: "Duelling Aunties" in Brunei Darussalam. In V. Rapatahana &amp; P. Bunce (eds.), ''English Language as Hydra''. Bristol: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some features of the pronunciation of English in Brunei are: the TH sound at the start of words such as ''thin'' and ''think'' tends to be pronounced as [t];&lt;ref&gt;Mossop, J. (1996). Some phonological features of Brunei English. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), ''Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (189-208). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; vowel reduction is mostly avoided in function words such as ''of'' and ''that'';&lt;ref name="DetSal2013"/&gt; and there is an increasing incidence of rhoticity.&lt;ref&gt;Salbrina, S., &amp; Deterding, D. (2010). Rhoticity in Brunei English. ''English World-Wide 31'': 121-137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nur Raihan Mohamad (2017). Rhoticity in Brunei English : A diachronic approach.

The Chinese minority in Brunei speak a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brudirect.com/BruneiInfo/info/brudirect__brunei_at_a_glance.htm Brunei at a Glance BruDirect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012141255/http://brudirect.com/BruneiInfo/info/brudirect__brunei_at_a_glance.htm |date=12 October 1999 }} - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt; The main varieties of Chinese spoken include Hokkien, Cantonese and Hakka.&lt;ref name="Xu2016"&gt;Xu, S. (2016). A comparison of the vowels of Brunei Mandarin and Beijing Mandarin. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 57-74). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] is the language of instruction in some Chinese schools, and there are also some radio broadcasts in Mandarin.&lt;ref name="Xu2016" /&gt; Mandarin is also used as the [[lingua franca]] among the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Dunseath, K. (1996). Aspects of language maintenance and language shift among the Chinese community in Brunei. In P. W. Martin, C. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjosoedarmo (Eds), ''Language Use &amp; Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 280-301). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous languages==
Apart from Brunei Malay and Kedayan, the latter which may be considered a dialect of Malay, five indigenous minority ethic groups are officially recognised in Brunei, each with their own language: [[Tutong language|Tutong]], [[Belait language|Belait]], [[Dusun language|Dusun]], [[Bisaya language (Borneo)|Bisaya]], and [[Lun Bawang language|Lun Bawang ('Murut')]].&lt;ref name="McNoorDet2016" /&gt; Each of these five minority languages is threatened with extinction,&lt;ref name="NoorSiti2016" /&gt; though it has been reported that Murut (which is spoken mostly in the enclave of Temburong) is relatively healthy, partly because it receives some support across the Malaysian border in Lawas, where it is known as Lun Bawang.&lt;ref name="Coluzzi2011"&gt;Coluzzi, P. (2011). Endangered languages in Borneo: A survey among the Iban and Murut (Lun Bawang) in Temburong Brunei. ''Oceanic Linguistics'', 49(1), 119-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iban language|Iban]] is also quite widely spoken in Temburong,&lt;ref name="Coluzzi2011"/&gt; and there is a small community of Penan speakers living in a longhouse along the Belait River.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, P. W., &amp; Sercombe, P. (1996). The Penan of Brunei: Patterns of linguistic interaction. In P. W. Martin, C. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjosoedarmo (Eds), ''Language Use &amp; Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 302-311). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic==
[[Arabic]] is the language of the [[Quran]] and is used by [[Islam]]ic scholars in Brunei.  The official religion of [[Brunei]] is [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/nations/Brunei Encyclopædia Britannica] - retrieved 22-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, all adherents of the faith possess some proficiency in reading and speaking Arabic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Arabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools. All Islamic children are required by law to attend an Ugama School ('Religious School') for three hours five days per week from the ages of 7 till 15, and the curriculum of these schools promotes the learning of Arabic as well as skill using Jawi, the Arabic-based script for representing Malay.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Azam H-O. (2016). Bilingual education revisited: The role of Ugama Schools in the spread of bilingualism. In Noor Azam H-O., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of Language in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 253-265). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition to the Ugama Schools, as of 2004, there were six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060131190647/http://www.moe.gov.bn/statistics/index2004.htm Ministry of Education Statistics 2004] - retrieved 22-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian languages==
The [[India]]n minority in [[Brunei]] originates mostly from southern India.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} They are joined by a relatively large expatriate community, estimated at about 7500, from [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brunet.bn/gov/emb/india/indcomm.html Indian Community in Brunei - High Commission of India to Brunei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406131652/http://www.brunet.bn/gov/emb/india/indcomm.html |date=6 April 2007 }} - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is mainly spoken by Indians in Brunei.

==Nepali languages==
There is also a contingent of Nepali soldiers of the Gurkha Reserve Unit in Sungai Akar camp and  1st and 2nd Battalion of the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] stationed in Seria, Brunei.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The language spoken by most of these soldiers is [[Gurkhali]].  There are [[Gurkhali]] languages services provided by [[Radio Television Brunei]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilihanradio.com/ Pilihan Radio, Radio Television Brunei] - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssvc.com/bfbs/map_global.htm BFBS Global Locations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504041216/http://www.ssvc.com/bfbs/map_global.htm |date=4 May 2007 }} - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expatriate languages==
Besides the expatriate Indians, Brunei also has a large expatriate community of [[Filipino language|Filipino]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippineembassybrunei.net/Filcomhead.htm Filipino Organisations in Brunei, Philippines Embassy] - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]]-speaking&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbt.com/workwithus/opportunities/englishlanguageteaching/brunei.aspx Centre for British Teachers in Brunei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715134535/http://www.cfbt.com/workwithus/opportunities/englishlanguageteaching/brunei.aspx |date=15 July 2007 }} - retrieved 20-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt; origins. [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Ambonese language|Ambonese]] and [[Batak language|Batak]] languages are also spoken by immigrants from Indonesia.

The '''live crown''' is the top part of a [[tree]], the part that has green [[leaves]] (as opposed to the bare [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], bare [[branches]], and dead leaves).  The ratio of the size of a tree's live crown to its total height is used in estimating its health and its level of competition with neighboring trees.

'''Malati Vishram Bedekar''' ([[Devanagari]]: मालती विश्राम बेडेकर) (1 October 1905 &amp;ndash; 7 May 2001) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], India. She was the first prominent [[feminist]] writer in [[Marathi literature]].  She also used pseudonym ''Vibhavari Shirurkar'' ( ([[Devanagari]]: विभावरी शिरूरकर).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Biography==
Balutai Khare (बाळुताई खरे) was Bedekar's maiden name. She was the daughter of Anantrao and  Indirabai Khare.

Anantrao was  a progressive thinker and educator, and Indirabai was a capable woman who successfully managed a dairy business for 25 years. Balutai later wrote a [[Biographical novel|semi-biographical novel]] ''Kharemaster'' (खरेमास्तर) after her father.

In her teens, Balutai's parents sent her to stay in the hostel of the school for girls which Maharshi [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] had started a few years earlier in Hingane, then in the outskirts of [[Pune]]. After finishing her education in that school, she graduated before her age 20 from the women's college which Karve had also started. At both of those institutions, progressive ideas of Karve and his teaching colleagues like [[Vaman Malhar Joshi]] highly influenced her thinking.

After college education, Balutai joined the teaching staff of Pune's Kanya Shala, which again was a girls' school being run under Karve's guidance. In 1936, she left that high school in the position of its headmistress to take up a government job as an administrator of a "settlement" for certain tribes identified as "criminal" tribes by the British government ruling over India at that time.

She met and married [[Vishram Bedekar]] in 1938, and took the name Malati Vishram Bedekar.

She left the government job in 1940 to take up writing, voluntary social services, and participation in socialist political activities.

She chaired a "parallel" ''Sahitya Sammelan'' (साहित्य सम्मेलन) which was held around 1980 in protest against excessive government meddling in the main [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] (मराठी साहित्य सम्मेलन).

==Literary work==
Bedekar wrote ''Kalyanche Nishwas'' (कळ्यांचे निःश्वास) --a collection of short stories—and ''Hindolyawar'' (हिंदोळ्यावर) --a novel—both in 1933 under the pen name ''Vibhavari Shirurkar'' (विभावरी शिरूरकर). In the two works, she discussed issues such as extramarital cohabitation, a woman's right to set up her own household alone, and dowry. The works were far too bold for the Indian society of the 1930s, and after their publication, there was a storm of outrage about them, they having been written by an unknown author under a pen name. (A few years later, before her marriage, Bedekar had revealed in a public speech that " 'Vibhavari Shirurkar' was me --Balutai Khare.")

In 1950, Bedekar wrote her effective novel ''Bali'' (बळी) (The Victim) as based on her observations for three years about the extremely harsh daily lives of the so-called "criminal " tribes confined to the "settlement" area behind barbed wires by the British government in pre-independence India. (By the time ''Bali'' got published, the government of independent India had abolished the same year, 1950, the concept of "settlement" area behind barbed wires for "criminal' tribes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loksatta.com/chaturang-news/story-of-malati-bedekar-1146820/|title=कालातीत लेखिका
|author=Madhuvanti Sapre|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=Loksatta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While her novel ''Wiralele Swapna'' (विरलेले स्वप्न) contained a compilation of pages from the imaginary diaries of two lovers, her novel ''Shabari'' (शबरी) was the story of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage.

'''Mpi'''  is a [[Loloish language]] of [[Thailand]]. The number of speakers is in decline. It is spoken in the following two villages in northern [[Thailand]].

*Ban Dong, Tambon Suan Khuean สวนเขื่อน, [[Mueang Phrae District]], [[Phrae Province]] (autonym: ''m̩33 pi53'' in Ban Dong)
*Ban Sakoeng, Tambon Yot ยอด, [[Song Khwae District]], [[Nan Province]] (autonym: ''kɔ53'' Ban Sakoeng)

Since the [[Mpi people|Mpi]] of Thailand migrated from [[Mengla]], [[Xishuangbanna]], Yunnan, China over 300 years ago, there could also possibly be Mpi speakers in China (Nahhas 2007).

==Phonology==
Mpi has six [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] and two [[phonation]]s in its [[vowel]]s, [[modal voice]] and [[stiff voice]]:

{|class="wikitable IPA"

'''Mugom''' (Mugu, Mugum) is a variety of [[Central Tibetan languages|Tibetic]] spoken by over 6,000 people in Nepal and about 500 in India.  

It is spoken primarily in the [[Karneli Zone]], in the [[Muga district]] and in the [[Jumla district]] in [[Nepal]]. Some speakers of this language have migrated to [[Kathmandu]]. It is divided into two dialects, Karani and Mugali, which appear to be about 90% mutually intelligible. However, the Mugalis view themselves as being of a higher class than the Karani and disdain their language and materials written in it.  

There have been attempts to create health-education materials aimed at the Mugom that take into account their culture and levels of literacy specifically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10241">[[File:Frederick Muhlenberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Muhlenberg]], first Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who did not cast a deciding vote in 1794, 1776, or any other year, to prevent German from becoming the official language of the United States.]]  

The '''Muhlenberg legend''' is an [[urban legend]] in the [[United States]] and [[Germany]].  According to the legend, the single vote of [[Frederick Muhlenberg]], the first ever [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]], prevented [[German language|German]] from becoming an [[Languages_of_the_United_States#Official_language_status|official language of the United States]].

==Basis of legend==

The kernel of truth behind this legend is a vote in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1794, after a group of German immigrants asked for the translation of some laws into German.  This petition was debated by the House of Representatives without a decision made  and a vote to adjourn and consider the recommendation at a later date was defeated by one vote, 42 to 41. There was no vote on an actual bill, merely a vote on whether or not to adjourn. Because the motion to adjourn did not pass, the matter was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from this roll call on adjournment that the “German missed becoming the official language of the USA by one vote” legend sprang. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhlenberg (of German descent himself, who had not voted in the roll call) was later quoted as having said "the faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be."&lt;ref name="1983art1"&gt;Heath, Shirley Brice &amp; Frederick Mandabach. ''Language Status Decisions and the Law in the United States'', in Cobarrubias, Juan &amp; Joshua A. Fishman, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9KoAkzfVqIC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Progress in Language Planning], p. 94 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sick"&gt;[[Bastian Sick|Sick, Bastian]] (19 May 2004).

The United States has no statutory official language; English has been used on a ''de facto'' basis, owing to its status as the country's predominant language.  At times various states have passed their own official language laws.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp |date=July 9, 2007 |title= The German Vote |publisher= [[Snopes.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FranzvonLöher.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Löher, whose 1847 German book included an early version of the story.]] 

The legend has a long history, and led to a number of analyses and articles published from the late 1920s into the early 1950s explaining why the story was not true.&lt;ref name="werner1"&gt;(18 February 1943).  [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19430218&amp;id=5wUoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8iIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2550,4435404 A German Language Rumor Traced Down], by W.L.

R. ''German as the Official Language of the United States of America?'', ''Monatshefte'', Vol. 68, No. 2 (Summer, 1976), pp. 129–150 (Arndt's article attempts to trace pre-Loher accounts which may have helped foster the legend, including an 1813 article by [[Justus Christian Henry Helmuth]]; at n. 21, Arndt lists seven accounts published between 1927–52 debunking the myth, starting with the 2nd edition of [[Albert Bernhardt Faust]]'s ''[[The German Element in the United States]]'', at Vol. II, pp. 652–56 (1927))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lohr"&gt;Lohr, Otto. ''Deutsch als 'Landessprache' der Vereinigten Staaten?'', Mitteilungen der Akademie zur wissenschaftlichen Erforschung und zur Pflege des Deutschtums 4 (1931): 283–90 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The story was dubbed the "Muhlenberg legend" by at least the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;Wood, Ralph C. ''The Second Period of the German Society of Pennsylvania and the Muhlenberg Legend'', publication?, cited in ''The German American Review'', 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the legend persists.&lt;ref name="1981article"&gt;(8 August 1981). Zepezauer, Frank S. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19810808&amp;id=OFwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uCkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4509,4232784 When German almost became our language], ''Milwaukee Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watz"&gt;[[Dennis Baron|Baron, Dennis]] (March 1996).

For example, in 1987, a letter from a former election official in Missouri emphasized the importance of voting in an [[Ann Landers]] column.  He included a list of events allegedly decided by one vote from his local election manual, including that “in 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German."  (In fact, versions of this error-filled list long predate the 1987 Ann Landers mention.)&lt;ref name="1968list"&gt;(19 March 1968).

[https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/officialamerican/englishonly/#baron The Legendary English-Only Vote of 1795], pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landers"&gt;(7 April 1987).

[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19961104&amp;id=i9FPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iQcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,3355790 Debate continues on Internet pros and cons], ''Ocala Star-Banner''&lt;/ref&gt;  A chorus of dismayed responses caused Landers to clear up the matter in a subsequent column.  According to one letter writer, who begged Landers to "stomp out that piece of fiction wherever you encounter it," the myth gained traction in the 1930s due to the work of Nazi propagandists. &lt;ref name="annagain"&gt;(30 December 1996).

Another version of the myth, which puts the vote in 1774 by the [[Continental Congress]], appeared in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' as early as 1930.&lt;ref name="wasit"&gt;Zagofsky, Al (5 February 2011).

Ripley's version credits the story to an alleged letter by Heinrich Melchior Muhlenberg published in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="bookofchance"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_v9BwIzTjBUC&amp; Ripley's believe it or not! book of chance] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most accounts credit [[Franz von Löher]] as the source of the legend.  Löher was a German visitor to the [[United States]] who published the book ''Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika'' (''History and Achievements of the Germans in America'') in 1847.&lt;ref name="loher1"&gt;Loher, Franz. [https://archive.org/details/geschichteundzus01lh Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika] (1847) (in German) via archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Löher seemingly placed the crucial vote only in Pennsylvania, to make German the official language of that state, not the United States as a whole.  (Philadelphia was where the U.S. Congress sat at the time, but it was also the capital of Pennsylvania.  To further confuse matters, Muhlenburg did serve as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House before serving in that title for the U.S. Congress.)  According to Löher, the vote was tied, and Muhlenberg cast the tie-breaking vote for English.&lt;ref name="menck"&gt;Mencken, Henry L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n37tIO4KhU8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The American Language: Supplement One], pp. 138–39 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazik al-Malaika''' ({{lang-ar|نازك الملائكة}}; 23 August 1923 – 20 June 2007&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/20/africa/ME-GEN-Iraq-Obit-Al-Malaika.php ''International Herald Tribune'']&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Iraq]]i female poet and is considered by many to be one of the most influential contemporary Iraqi female poets. 
Al-Malaika is famous as the first [[Arabic]] poet to use [[free verse]].&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6724867,00.html AP via ''The Guardian'', "Iraq Poet Nazik Al-Malaika Dies at 85" June 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Al-Malaika was born in [[Baghdad]] to a cultured family. Her mother was also a poet, and her father was a teacher. She wrote her first poem at the age of 10.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Al-Malaika graduated in 1944 from the College of Arts in Baghdad and later completed a master's degree in [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a Degree of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2CD6B305-D0A4-4A13-ADDF-AC5488268C99.htm aljazeera.net  flash]&lt;/ref&gt; She entered the Institute of Fine Arts and graduated from the Department of Music in 1949. In 1959 she earned a Master of Arts in Comparative Literature from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the United States, and she was appointed professor at the [[University of Baghdad]], the [[University of Basrah]], and [[Kuwait University]].

==Career==
Al-Malaika taught at a number of schools and universities, most notably at the [[University of Mosul]].

==Leaving Iraq==
Al-Malaika left Iraq in 1970 with her husband [[Abdel Hadi Mahbooba]] and family, following the rise of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party of Iraq]] to power. She lived in [[Kuwait]] until [[Saddam Hussein]]'s invasion in 1990. Al-Malaika and her family left for [[Cairo]], where she lived for the rest of her life. Towards the end of her life, al-Malaika suffered from a number of health issues, including [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

She died in Cairo in 2007 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt;

==Works==
One of her poems, ''Medinat al Hub,'' inspired the Iraqi artist and scholar, [[Issam al-Said]] to produce an artwork with the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Chorbachi, S., ''Issam El-Said: Artist and Scholar,'' Issam El-Said Foundation, 1989, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Malaika published several books of poems:&lt;ref&gt;Arabic pages at [[:ar:نازك الملائكة|wiki ar]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* her first book of poetry, "The Night's Lover" ({{lang|ar|عشيقات الليل|rtl=yes}}), after her graduation.
* She wrote a poem, "Cholera" ({{lang|ar|الكوليرا|rtl=yes}}), which is considered by critics as a revolution in the Arabic poem in 1947.
* "Sparks and Ashes" ({{lang|ar|الشرر ورماد|rtl=yes}}) followed in 1949.
* She published "Bottom of the Wave" ({{lang|ar|قرارات الموجة|rtl=yes}}) in 1957.
* her final volume "Tree of the Moon" ({{lang|ar|شجرة القمر|rtl=yes}} being published in 1968.
* "And the sea changes its color" ({{lang|ar|"ويغير ألوانه البحر"}}) in 1970&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;''Maquis Who's Who'', 2006 "Nazik Al-Malaika" and Guardian Op Cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation in other languages==
===Nepali===
Some of Al-Malaika's poems are translated into [[Nepali language|Nepali]] by [[Suman Pokhrel]], and are collected along with poems of other poets in an anthology tittled [[Manpareka Kehi Kavita]].&lt;ref name="Manpareka 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akhmatova|first1=Anna|author-link1=Anna Akhmatova|last2=Świrszczyńska|first2=Anna|author-link2=Anna Świrszczyńska|last3=Ginsberg |first3= Allen |author-link3=Allen Ginsberg|last4=Agustini |first4=Delmira |author-link4=Delmira Agustini|last5= Farrokhzad |first5=Forough |author-link5=Forough Farrokhzad|last6= Mistral |first6=Gabriela|author-link6=Gabriela Mistral| last7= Jacques |first7=Jacques |author-link7=Jacques Prévert|last8=Mahmoud |first8= Mahmoud|author-link8=Mahmoud Darwish| last9=Al-Malaika |first9= Nazik|author-link9= Nazik Al-Malaika|last10=Hikmet |first10=Nazim|author-link10=Nazim Hikmet|last11=Qabbani |first11= Nizar|author-link11=Nizar Qabbani| last12=Paz |first12=Octavio |author-link12=Octavio Paz| last13=Neruda |first13= Pablo |author-link13=Pablo Neruda|last14=Plath |first14=Sylvia |author-link14=Sylvia Plath|last15=Amichai |first15=Yehuda|author-link15=Yehuda Amichai|translator-last1=Pokhrel|translator-first1=Suman|translator-link1=Suman Pokhrel|translator-mask1=|date=|year=2018|orig-year=|chapter=|title=Manpareka Kehi Kavita|script-title=मनपरेका केही कविता|trans-title=Some Poems of My Choice|url=|dead-url=|format=Print|type=|series=|language=Nepalese|edition=First|location=Kathmandu|publisher=Shikha Books|publication-date=2018|pages=174|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/4724485-nepali-translation-of-anna-swir-s-poem-myself-and-my-person&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/4724900-nepali-translation-of-anna-swir-s-poem-i-kn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=अनुवादमा 'मनपरेका केही कविता'|trans-title=Manpareka Kehi Kavita in Translation |first=Geeta|last=Tripathi|publisher=Kalashree |pages=358-359|website=|year=2018|issue=7|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandurang Vaman Kane''' (pronounced ''Kaa-nay'') (7 May 1880 – 8 May 1972) was a notable [[Indologist]] and [[Sanskrit]] scholar. He received India's highest civilian award [[Bharat Ratna]] in 1963 for his scholarly work that spanned more than 40 years of active academic research that resulted in 6,500 pages of ''[[History of Dharmaśāstra]]''. The historian [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] says: "Pandurang Vaman Kane, a great Sanskritist wedded to social reform, continued the earlier tradition of scholarship. His monumental work entitled the "History of the Dharmasastra", published in five volumes in the twentieth century, is an encyclopaedia of ancient social laws and customs. This enables us to study the social processes in [[History of India|ancient India]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Famous works==
[[File:Asiatic Town Hall, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|The town hall of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, whose resources Kane researched; Later, the Asiatic Society commemorated him with an institute in his name]]
Dr. Kane is famous for his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] in English, ''History of Dharmaśāstra'', subtitled ''Ancient and Mediaeval Religions and Civil Law in India.'' This work researched the evolution of code of conduct in ancient and mediaeval India by looking into several texts and [[manuscripts]] compiled over the centuries. It was published in five volumes; the 1st volume was published in 1930 and the last, in 1962. It runs to a total of more than 6,500 pages. Dr. Kane used the resources available at prestigious institutes such as [[the Asiatic Society of Mumbai]] and [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], among others. The work is known for its expanse and depth – ranging across diverse subjects such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Puranas]] and [[Chanakya]] – including references to previously obscure sources. The richness in the work is attributed to his in-depth knowledge of [[Sanskrit]]. His success is believed to be an outcome of his objective study of the texts instead of [[wikt:theosis|deifying]] them.

Kane wrote the book ''Vyavaharamayukha'' and was in the process of writing an introductory passage on the ''History of Dharmaśāstra'' for this book so that the reader would get an overall idea apart from the subject of the book. One thing led to another and this project snowballed into the major work that it is. All the same, he was categorical in saying that it is difficult to find an English equivalent of the word "Dharma." His output in the form of writings across the three languages of English, [[Sanskrit]] and Marathi spans nearly 15,000 pages.

‘''History of Poetics’'' was one of his other great books. Apart from Theology and Poetry, he wrote a great deal on other topics too, which included Astrology, Cultural and Geographical history of India-Maharashtra-Konkan- Vidarbha, Marathi language, its grammar, language &amp; handwriting, economics of ''Kautilya'' (Chanakya), Mathematics, Dramatics, etc. There are in all 198 publications by his name. They include 39 texts, 115 articles, 44 books, introductions and reviews. 

==Recognition==
Dr. Kane was rewarded as [[Mahamahopadhyaya]] (Etymology: Maha+Maha+Upadhyay = The greatest among the great teachers), usually shortened to MM as a prefix in the writings that refer to him. He served as the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice-chancellor|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Mumbai]]. His services were requisitioned and enlisted for establishing [[Kurukshetra University]] in [[Indology|Indic studies]]. He was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi]] award in 1956 for ''History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. IV'' for his research under the Sanskrit translation category. He was also an honorary member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

He was nominated to the [[Rajya Sabha]] as a member of Parliament for his distinguished record in the field of academics. The highest accolade bestowed upon him was the [[Bharat Ratna]] in 1963.

==Indian law==
Kane believed that the [[constitution of India]] made a complete break with the traditional ideas prevalent in [[India]] by engendering a false notion among the people that they have rights but no obligations.

Given the encyclopaedic and authoritative nature of his work, it is often used in debates in Polity. One such issue that cropped up during [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] government was whether ancient Indians ate beef and both the groups quoted extensively from Kane's work to support their viewpoint. This issue became important as [[Hindu]]s traditionally [[Cattle in religion#In Hinduism|revere the cow]] as a mother and hence eating of beef is prohibited. Another such issue was whether the girls in the ancient times had the right to wear the yajnopavita (sacred thread), as the [[upanayana]] ceremony was restricted only to the men in the recent past.

==Legacy==
To commemorate him, the Asiatic Society of Mumbai has established the Mm. Dr. P.V. Kane Institute for Post Graduate studies and Research in 1974 to promote, encourage and facilitate research in oriental studies. Also, MM Dr. P.V. Kane Gold Medal is given once every three years to a scholar for outstanding contribution to the study of Vedic, Dharmashastra or Alankara Literature.

First used by Irish-American [[psychoanalytic]] psychiatrist [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] in the 1940s, '''Parataxical Integration''' (a combination of terms) refers to the mutual condition of [[parataxic distortion]]s (another concept of Sullivan’s). Parataxical integration exists when two people, usually intimate with each other (i.e. parents and children, spouses, romantic partners, business associates), are reciprocally reactive to each other’s seductions, judgmental inaccuracies, hostile comments, and manipulations or other "triggering" behaviors. One says or does something causing the other to react, setting off a cyclical "ping-pong", "tit-for-tat", "you-get-me-and-I-get-you-back" oscillation of verbal and/or behavioral reactions.

==Development==
The concept first appeared in Sullivan's ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry'', published in 1953. It was developed further by his protégé, [[Lorna Smith Benjamin]], in her ''Interpersonal Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders'' (1996). Benjamin saw parataxical integration as typical in the interpersonal behavior of couples with unresolved [[autonomy]] (i.e. separation, [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]) and identity issues. [[Erik Erikson]] had himself described the unconscious, reciprocal reactivation (without using Sullivan’s terms) in his essay, “The Problem of Ego Identity,” and in ''Identity and Anxiety'', by Stein ''et al''. (1960).

==Usage==
Though the term itself is not used in much of the professional peer-reviewed literature, the interpersonal manifestation to which it refers appears regularly in the case study literature of the "[[family systems]]" school of psychologists, including [[Don D. Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Virginia Satir]], and [[Salvador Minuchin]]. Parataxical integrations are also presented in similar studies reported by [[Ronald D. Laing]], [[Aaron Esterson]], and anthropologist [[Jules Henry]], largely during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Harold Searles]] and [[Charles McCormack]] describe manifestations of parataxical integration in their works on [[borderline personality disorder]]s in the 1980s and 2000s.

[[Paul Watzlawick]] ''et al''. describes the concept in his book, ''Change'', noting, "... the circularity of their interaction makes it undecidable ... whether a given action is the cause or effect of an action by the other party ... either party sees its actions as determined and provoked by the other's actions ...".

[[Rodger Garrett]] also employs the concept in his millennial-era work on borderline personality disorder and [[family of origin]] etiology, typically using the term “reciprocal reactivity” along with it.

[[Reciprocal reactivity]] was studied by Gary Sperduto ''et al''. in the 1970s, and it is clear from the abstract of his paper (see below) that his definitional terminology equated to that of Sullivan.

Numerous mass-market psychology authors, many writing about the topic of "[[codependence|co-dependence]]," including [[Melody Beattie]], [[Pia Mellody]], [[Anne Wilson Schaef]], and [[Barry &amp; Janae Weinhold]], describe the interpersonal manifestation without using Sullivan’s term ''per se''. Co-dependence expert [[Pia Mellody]] describes the behavioral manifestations of parataxical integration at length in an audio presentation available online.

'''Paulo Coelho de Souza''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|l|.|j|uː|,_|k|u|ˈ|ɛ|l|-|,_|-|j|oʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;J C Wells (2008) Longman Pronunciation Dictionary. Pearson Education Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|ˈpawlu kuˈeʎu|lang}}; born 24 August 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist. He is best known for his novel ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]''. In 2014, he uploaded his personal papers online to create a virtual Paulo Coelho Foundation.

==Biographical details==

Paulo Coelho was born in Brazil and attended a [[Jesuit]] school. As a teenager, Coelho wanted to become a writer. 
Upon telling his mother this, she responded, "My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?" At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=marika&gt;Schaertl, Markia [http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2007/12/19/paulo-coelho-interview-by-marika-schaertl-focus-munich/ The Boy from Ipanema: Interview with Paulo Coelho] reposted on ''Paulo Coelho's Blog''. 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;Doland, Angela [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/12/AR2007051200684.html Brazilian author Coelho thrives on contradictions and extremes] ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' published on ''The Washington Post''. 12 May 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hollowverse.com/paulo-coelho/|title=Paulo Coelho Bio|last=Hollow Verse|first=Dot Com|date=2011-04-12|website=Hollow Verse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coelho later remarked that "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;Day, Elizabeth [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3643720/A-mystery-even-to-himself.html A mystery even to himself] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 14 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a [[hippie]], traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using [[drug culture|drugs]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lifepositive&gt;[http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/traditional-paths/sorcery/coelho.asp An interview with Brazilian writer, Paulo Coelho: Everybody is a Magus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209124452/http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/traditional-paths/sorcery/coelho.asp |date=9 February 2014 }} ''Life Positive''.

Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for [[Elis Regina]], [[Rita Lee]], and Brazilian [[pop icon|icon]] [[Raul Seixas]]. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;[http://www.paulocoelho.com.br/engl/bio.shtml Biography] ''Official Site of Paulo Coelho''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Coelho was arrested for "subversive" activities by the [[Brazilian military government|ruling military government]], who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.&lt;ref name=officialbio/&gt;

In 1980 Coelho married artist [[Christina Oiticica]]. Together they had previously spent half the year in Rio de Janeiro and the other half in a country house in the Pyrenees Mountains of France, but now the pair reside permanently in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agogo.nl/homenews/articles/item/paulo-coelho-i-m-not-going-to-the-world-cup|title=Interview with Paulo Coelho|first=Cultura|last=Brasileira|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612083758/http://agogo.nl/homenews/articles/item/paulo-coelho-i-m-not-going-to-the-world-cup|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Coelho walked the 500-plus mile [[Way of St. James|Road of Santiago de Compostela]] in northwestern Spain, a turning point in his life.&lt;ref name=lifepositive/&gt;&lt;ref name=harpercollins&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/harperimages/ommoverride/teacher_guide_alchemist.pdf Teacher's Guide to The Alchemist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327004639/http://www.harpercollins.com/harperimages/ommoverride/teacher_guide_alchemist.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }} ''Harper Collins Publisher''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the path, Coelho had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in ''[[The Pilgrimage]]''.&lt;ref name=beliefnet&gt;Reiss, Valerie [http://www.beliefnet.com/Holistic-Living/2007/08/Paulo-Coelho-Dances-With-Angels.aspx?p=2 Paulo Coelho Dances with Angels] ''Beliefnet''.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Coelho stated "[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water – to use the metaphor in ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]'', I was working, I had a person whom I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/133_wbc_archive_new/page2.shtml Interview with Paulo Coelho] ''BBC World Service Book Club.'' December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.

In 1996, he founded the Paulo Coelho Institute, which provides support to children and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3643724/When-Paulo-Coelho-was-17-his-parents-sent-him-to-an-asylum-because-they-thought-he-was-psychotic.-Now-hes-the-worlds-biggest-selling-novelist-but-he-says-some-people-still-dont-understand-him-A-mystery-even-to-himself.html|title=When Paulo Coelho was 17 his parents sent him to an asylum because they thought he was psychotic.

Coelho posts up to three times a week at his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paulocoelhoblog.com/ |title=Paulo Coelho's Blog |publisher=Paulocoelhoblog.com |date=2011-10-08 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has millions of fans on both Facebook and Twitter. He discussed his relationship with readers through social media platforms  with ''The Wall Street Journal'' in August 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJ_digital_alchemist"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gamerman | first=Ellen | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/paulo-coelho-digital-juggernaut-1408055080 | title=Paulo Coelho, Fiction's Digital JOURNALISM | work=Wall Street Journal | date=14 August 2014 | accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another development came in November 2014, when he finished uploading around 80,000 documents-manuscripts, diaries, photos, reader letters, press clippings-and created a virtual Paulo Coelho Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcfoundation.wpengine.com/foundation/index-paulo-coelho.php?idioma=ingles|title=Foundation Paulo Coelho &amp; Christina Oiticica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the physical foundation which is based in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.es/maps/place/Chemin%20du%20Velours%2026,%201231%20Conches,%20Suiza/@46.190695,6.1675177,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x478c7ab1420e9b25:0x5738c7e0a08fe749?hl=es|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==

In 1982, Coelho published his first book, ''Hell Archives'', which failed to make a substantial impact.&lt;ref name=officialbio/&gt; In 1986 he contributed to the ''Practical Manual of Vampirism'', although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it "of bad quality."&lt;ref name=officialbio/&gt; After making the pilgrimage to [[Way of St. James|Santiago de Compostela]] in 1986, Coelho wrote ''[[The Pilgrimage]]'' that was published in the year 1987. The following year, Coelho wrote ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]'' and published it through a small Brazilian publishing house who made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint.&lt;ref name=saintjordi&gt;[http://www.santjordi-asociados.com/titles/brief.htm?6#alchemist A Brief History of the Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802224539/http://www.santjordi-asociados.com/titles/brief.htm?6 |date=2 August 2008 }} ''Saint Jordi Asociados''&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book ''[[Brida (novel)|Brida]]'', ''The Alchemist'' took off. [[HarperCollins]]  decided to publish the book in 1994. Later it became an international bestseller.&lt;ref name=saintjordi/&gt;

While trying to overcome his procrastination of launching his writing career, Coelho said, "If I see a white feather today, that is a sign that God is giving me that I have to write a new book." Coelho found a white feather in the window of a shop, and began writing that day.&lt;ref name=beliefnet/&gt; Since the publication of ''The Alchemist'', Coelho has generally written at least one novel every two years. Three of them – ''The Pilgrimage'', ''Hippie'', ''[[The Valkyries (novel)|The Valkyries]]'' and'' [[Aleph (novel)|Aleph]]'' – are autobiographical, while the majority of the rest are broadly fictional.&lt;ref name=lifepositive/&gt; Other books, like ''Maktub'', ''The Manual of the Warrior of Light'' and ''[[Like the Flowing River]]'', are collections of essays, newspaper columns, or selected teachings. His work has been published in more than 170 countries and translated into eighty languages. Together, his books have sold in the hundreds of millions.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Heller, ''Meet the writers who still sell millions of books. Actually, hundreds of millions'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/meet-the-elite-group-of-authors-who-sell-100-million-books-or-350-million/2016/12/20/db3c6a66-bb0f-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?noredirect=on The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 December 2016, Coelho was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 2 in the list of 200 most influential contemporary authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://richtopia.com/inspirational-people/top-200-authors|title=Authors Top 200: From J.K. Rowling to T. Harv Eker, These Are the Most Influential Authors in the World|work=Richtopia|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to his writing has not been without controversy, however. Though he was raised in a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family, and describes himself as of that faith even now, his stance has been described as incompatible with the Catholic faith, because of its [[New Age]], [[Pantheism|pantheist]] and [[Relativism#Catholic_Church_and_relativism|relativist]] contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://es.aleteia.org/2014/07/23/paulo-coelho-alguna-objecion-desde-la-fe-cristiana/ |title=Paulo Coelho: ¿alguna objeción desde la fe cristiana? |last=Santamaría |first=Luis |website=[[Aleteia]] |date=23 July 2014 |access-date=22 May 2017 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Paulo Coelho: any objection from the Christian faith?}}&lt;/ref&gt; And whatever his sales, reviews of Coelho's later work consistently note its superficiality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/19/fiction.paulocoelho "Adam Mars-Jones finds Paulo Coelho hurtling towards stupidity as he reaches for wisdom in The Zahir"], ''The Observer'', 19 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca K.

==''Não Pare na Pista''==

''The Pilgrim – Story of Paulo Coelho'' is the international title for the film ''[[Não Pare na Pista]]'', a movie about Coelho's life. A co-production between Brazil’s Dama Filmes, led by Carolina Kotscho and Iôna de Macedo, Angélica Huete’s Babel Films in Spain and directed by Daniel Augusto. Ravel and Júlio Andrade play the young and old Coelho, and other cast members include international names such as Fabiana Gugli, Nancho Novo and Paz Vega. Those working on the film include Pedro Almodovar’s regular art director Antxón Gómez and Oscar-winning make-up artists Montse Ribé and David Marti.

De Macedo told Screen: "The film tells the story of a man who has a dream. It's a little like Alice in Wonderland – he's someone who is too big for his house." The film, shot in Portuguese, had its premiere in Brazilian Theaters on 2014, was internationally distributed by Picture Tree on 2015, according to Variety.&lt;ref name="Paulo CoelhoBiopic ‘The Pilgrim’"&gt;{{cite news|title=Picture Tree Acquires Paulo Coelho Biopic ‘The Pilgrim’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/picture-tree-acquires-paulo-coelho-biopic-the-pilgrim-exclusive-1201273511/|accessdate=5 August 2014|agency=PMC|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">'''Qutayla ukht al-Nadr''' (or '''Qutayla bint al-Nadr''') was a seventh-century CE Arab woman of the [[Quraysh]] tribe, noted as one of the earliest attested Arabic-language poets on account of her famous elegy for [[Nadr ibn al-Harith]].

==Life==

Qutayla appears in the historical record in connection with her relative [[Nadr ibn al-Harith]], an Arab Pagan doctor from Taif, who used to tell stories of [[Rustam]] and [[Esfandiyār]] to the Arabs and scoffed the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=js30HODt2aYC&amp;pg=PA179 Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, Volume 2, Part 2], p.179, Irfan Shahîd.

Kalda b. ‘Abd Manāf b. ‘Abd al-Dār b. QuṠayy al-Qurashiyya al-‘Abdariyya.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zaynab Fawwāz]], ''Kitāb al-Durr al-Manthūr fī Ṭabaqāt Rabbāt al-Khuduūr'' (Būlāq: ʼal-Maṭbaʻah ʼal-Kubrá ʼal-ʼAmīrīyah, 1312 [1894]), as corrected by Marilyn Booth, ''Classes of Ladies of Cloistered Spaces: Writing Feminist History through Biography in Fin-de-Siècle Egypt'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015), Appendix 2. Booth changes Fawwāz's ''bint'' 'daughter' to ''ukht'' 'sister'.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a tradition, attested in one medieval source, [[al-Jāḥiẓ]] in his ''Kitāb al-Bayān wa ’l-tabyīn'', that she was actually called Laylā.&lt;ref&gt;iv, 44: Ch. Pellat, 'al-Naḍr b. al-Ḥāri&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;', in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1954-2009), VII 873, https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_5730.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

To Qutayla is attributed the following elegy for Nadr, in which she upbraids Muhammad for the execution.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Arabic Poetry'', trans. by Charles Greville Tuety (London: KPI, 1985), p. 121 [no. 20]. For another translation, implying a rather different text, see ''The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Isḥāq's ''Sīrat Rasūl Allāh"", trans. by A. Guillaume (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1955), p. 360, https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some commentaries, Muhammad's response to this was 'Had I heard her verses before I put him to death, I should not have done so'.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary'', trans. by Bn Mac Guckin de Slane, Oriental Translation Fund (Series), 57, 4 vols (Paris: Printed for the Oriental translation fund of Great Britain and Ireland, 1842-71), I 372; ''Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo: Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī's (d. 716/1316) Commentary on the Christian Scriptures'', ed. and trans. by Lejla Demiri (Leiden: Brill, 2013), p. 479 (§522).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: On the fifth night's morning, stranger, with luck
: a tamarisk tree should appear by the way:
: Leave word that travellers never cease
: as they pass to wave a salute from the road;
: that you saw me standing, the tears on my face;
: on other tears, unseen, I choke.
: Will my brother hear my voice when I call?
: If the dead can hear they never speak.
: Weary and worn he was led to his doom,
: a captive dragging his feet in chains,
: torn by the swords of his cousins and kin:
: To God I mourn the divided house.
: Muḥammad, of noble woman born,
: son of equally noble sire!
: It would not have harmed to be generous then;
: a man, incensed, may still forgive.
: Had you taken ransom -- Nothing too much,
: too grand, but we'd gladly have given it up.
: My brother was nearest of those you took,
: the first to be spared -- had you pardoned his youth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Although doubt has been expressed regarding their authenticity ... these verses, frequently cited and highly appreciated, have perpetuated alNadr's memory'.&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Pellat, 'al-Naḍr b. al-Ḥāri&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;', in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1954-2009), VII 873, https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_5730.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever its origin, the poem attributed to Qutayla is among the poems most frequently cited in the medieval Arabic anthologies known as ''ḥamāsāt'',&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Maria El Cheikh, 'The Gendering of "Death" in Kitāb al-‘Iqd al-Farīd', ''Al-Qantara'', 31 (July–December 2010), 411-36 (p. 427), http://al-qantara.revistas.csic.es/index.php/al-qantara/article/viewFile/237/230.&lt;/ref&gt; being noted for their moving quality.&lt;ref&gt;Sahair El Calamawy, 'Narrative Elements in the ''Ḥadīth'' Literature', ''Arabic Literature to the End of the Umayyad Period'', ed. by A. F. L. Beeston, T. M. Johnstone, R. B. Serjeant and G. R. Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), pp. 308-316 (p. 308).&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of Nadia Maria El Cheikh, 'Qutayla’s poem reflects the new Islamic ethos conveying the dramatic tension of a particular moment in Islamic religious history. She does not call for vengeance but for a modification of behavior, a kind retroactive display of restraint and forbearance'.&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Maria El Cheikh, 'The Gendering of "Death" in Kitāb al-‘Iqd al-Farīd', ''Al-Qantara'', 31 (July–December 2010), 411-36 (p. 427), http://al-qantara.revistas.csic.es/index.php/al-qantara/article/viewFile/237/230, citing M. L. Hammond, ''The Poetics of S/Exclusion: Women, Gender and the Classical Arabic Canon'' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 2003), pp. 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Nixon.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an 18th century chapbook.]]
'''Robert Nixon''' was a legendary prophet of [[Cheshire]]. Many accounts about him appear to be in conflict with each other.

At least one account has Robert Nixon being born in c. 1467.  In this account, he is the son of John Nixon during the time of [[Edward IV]], who leased a farm in the parish of [[Over, Cheshire|Over]] from [[Vale Royal Abbey]].  Another account of Nixon states that he was born during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–25) and that he was for some time in the service of Thomas Cholmondeley, master of Vale Royal after 1625.

There are also two claimed homes for Robert Nixon: one says he was an illiterate boy who was born in Bark House on a hill between [[Over, Cheshire|Over]] and [[Whitegate, Cheshire|Whitegate]].  Alternatively, another source claims Robert Nixon lived at Bridge House near the [[Delamere Forest|Forest of Delamere]].

He is the claimed source of various prophecies circulating in the early 18th Century and published in leaflet form.

Some of his prophecies relate to [[Vale Royal Abbey]].

==Prophecies==

* to an abbot of [[Vale Royal Abbey]] "When you the harrow come on high, Soon a raven's nest will be" 
:* The last Abbot was named John Hareware
:* Sir Thomas Holcroft acquired the buildings of Vale Royal Abbey and some of the estates
:* The crest of Sir Thomas was a raven

* "Between a rick and two trees, a famous battle shall be"
:* The [[Second Battle of St Albans|Battle of St Albans]], 1461 took place between Elstree, Edwinstree and Rickmansworth. However, this was probably ''before'' Robert Nixon was born and therefore could hardly be a prophecy.

* "The weary eagle shall to an island in the sun retire, where leaves and herbs grow fresh and green.  There shall he meet a lady fair"
:* Napoleon was sent to St. Helena in 1815
:* The island has plentiful rare flora
:* Helen of Troy was indeed a "lady fair"

* "All sorts will have chimneys in their mouths"
:* Cigarettes

* foretold the result of the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].
* "When an eagle shall sit on top of the house, then an heir shall be born to the Cholmondeley family"
* "When a raven shall build in a stone lion's mouth, On a church top beside the grey forest: Then shall a King of England be drove from his crown".

Summoned to the court of King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], he refused, saying he would be "clemmed death", that is, starved to death.  The King ordered him to be kept in the kitchen, but because he was always picking at food he was locked in the cupboard.  The cook was called away and he starved to death.

==A man for all seasons?==

Many of the prophecies relate to the family living at Vale Royal Abbey mansion at the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1714]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellions.  It seems the prophecies of Robert Nixon were invented or modified to suit the political situation at the time.

The '''Southern Aslian languages''' are a sub-branch of the [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic]] language family. They have also been referred to as the Semelaic languages, but this label is no longer used. The four languages that make up the branch are:

These languages are spoken by no more than 10,000 speakers in total. The languages are considered endangered due to social disruption in the area and the dominance of [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref name="OzUni" /&gt;

'''Southern Pomo''' is one of seven mutually unintelligible [[Pomoan languages]] which were formerly spoken by the [[Pomo people]] in [[Northern California]] along the [[Russian River, California|Russian River]] and [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]]. The Pomo languages have been grouped together with other so-called [[Hokan languages]]. Southern Pomo is unique among the Pomo languages in preserving, perhaps, the greatest number of syllables inherited from Proto-Pomo (the [[proto-language]] from which all seven Pomo languages descend).

==The speakers==

The speakers of Southern Pomo were never a unified political group; rather, they were spread across a number of villages and spoke slightly different dialects. Southern Pomo speakers did not have a name for their language or themselves. As the southernmost of the Pomo, the speakers of the language were the first to suffer the ravages of Spanish and, later, U.S. invasion. Southern Pomo speakers were used by the Spanish to construct the last of the California missions. The damage done during the Spanish colonial period was compounded by the United States control of California. Only the northernmost populations of Southern Pomo speakers, those of the [[Dry Creek (Sonoma County, California)|Dry Creek]] and [[Cloverdale, California|Cloverdale]] dialects, survived to be recorded by the time linguists began to collect data on the language.

At least four modern [[rancheria]]s (the California term for small [[Indian reservation]]s) include members whose ancestral language was Southern Pomo: Dry Creek, Cloverdale, Lytton and [[Graton Rancheria|Graton]]. In 2012 there was one fluent speaker, from Dry Creek, one rememberer, and a handful of people who learned some vocabulary as children.

==Work on the language==

A small amount of data was collected by early researchers such as [[Samuel Barrett]]; however, extensive work was not carried out until [[Abraham M. Halpern]], in the 1940s, collected a number of Southern Pomo words and texts as part of a larger effort to collect data on all the Pomo languages. Halpern published one article, ''Southern Pomo h and ʔ and Their Reflexes'', which dealt with aspects of Southern Pomo [[phonology]]. Halpern's unpublished notes are currently housed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. [[Robert L. Oswalt]], who wrote a grammar of the related [[Kashaya language|Kashaya]] (Southwestern Pomo) language, began to collect Southern Pomo data approximately twenty years after Halpern's fieldwork. Oswalt eventually published one glossed and translated text, ''Retribution for Mate-Stealing: A Southern Pomo Tale'', as well as a number of other articles which included Southern Pomo data together with data from other Pomo languages. Though Oswalt did a large amount of work on a Southern Pomo dictionary, it has never been completed.

==Phonetics and phonology==
Southern Pomo has a rich sound system with aspirated, unaspirated, ejective and voiced stops. It has a total of 28 consonants (plus the pseudo-consonant {{IPA|/ː/}}). The vowel system, in contrast, contains only five qualities: {{IPA|/i u e o a/}}. All phonemes, both consonants and vowels, can occur long. The full consonant inventory is laid out below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10208">'''Species diversity''' is the number of different [[species]] that are represented in a given [[community (ecology)|community]] (a dataset). The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Species diversity consists of three components: [[species richness]], taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity and [[species evenness]]. Species richness is a simple count of species, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity is the genetic relationship between different groups of species,whereas species evenness quantifies how equal the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]] of the species are.&lt;ref name=Hill1973&gt;Hill, M. O. (1973) Diversity and evenness: a unifying notation and its consequences. Ecology, 54, 427–432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010a&gt;Tuomisto, H.

Ecography, 33, 2-22. {{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05880.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010c&gt;Tuomisto, H. 2010. A consistent terminology for quantifying species diversity? Yes, it does exist. Oecologia 4: 853–860. {{doi|10.1007/s00442-010-1812-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of diversity==

Species diversity in a dataset can be calculated by first taking the [[weighted average]] of species proportional abundances in the dataset, and then taking the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of this. The equation is:&lt;ref name=Hill1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010c /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{}^q\!D={1 \over \sqrt[q-1]{{\sum_{i=1}^S p_i p_i^{q-1}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted [[generalized mean]] with exponent ''q'' - 1. In the equation, ''S'' is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the ''i''th species is &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The proportional abundances themselves are used as weights.
The equation is often written in the equivalent form:

:&lt;math&gt;{}^q\!D=\left ( {\sum_{i=1}^S p_i^q} \right )^{1/(1-q)}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''q'' defines which kind of mean is used. ''q'' = 0 corresponds to the weighted [[harmonic mean]], which is 1/S because the &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; values cancel out. ''q'' = 1 is undefined, except that the limit as ''q'' approaches 1 is well defined:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{q \rightarrow 1} {}^q\!D = \exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \ln p_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
''q'' = 2 corresponds to the [[arithmetic mean]]. As ''q'' approaches [[infinity]], the generalized mean approaches the maximum &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; value. In practice, ''q'' modifies species weighting, such that increasing ''q'' increases the weight given to the most abundant species, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance. Consequently, large values of ''q'' lead to smaller species diversity than small values of ''q'' for the same dataset. If all species are equally abundant in the dataset, changing the value of ''q'' has no effect, but species diversity at any value of ''q'' equals species richness.

Negative values of ''q'' are not used, because then the effective number of species (diversity) would exceed the actual number of species (richness). As ''q'' approaches negative infinity, the generalized mean approaches the minimum &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; value. In many real datasets, the least abundant species is represented by a single individual, and then the effective number of species would equal the number of individuals in the dataset.&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010c /&gt; 

The same equation can be used to calculate the diversity in relation to any classification, not only species. If the individuals are classified into genera or functional types, &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; represents the proportional abundance of the ''i''th genus or functional type, and &lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;''D'' equals genus diversity or functional type diversity, respectively.

==Diversity indices==

Often researchers have used the values given by one or more diversity indices to quantify species diversity. Such indices include [[species richness]], the [[Shannon index]], the [[Simpson index]], and the complement of the Simpson index (also known as the Gini-Simpson index).&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, C. J. (1999) Ecological Methodology. Second edition. Addison-Wesley, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magurran, A. E. (2004) Measuring biological diversity. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jost2006&gt;Jost, L. (2006) Entropy and diversity. Oikos, 113, 363–375&lt;/ref&gt;

When interpreted in ecological terms, each one of these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;''D''), and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;''D'' and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;''D'' and quantifies the probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.&lt;ref name=Hill1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuomisto2010c /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jost2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jost, L. (2007) Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Ecology, 88, 2427–2439.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling considerations==

Depending on the purposes of quantifying species diversity, the dataset used for the calculations can be obtained in different ways. Although species diversity can be calculated for any dataset where individuals have been identified to species, meaningful ecological interpretations require that the dataset is appropriate for the questions at hand. In practice, the interest is usually in the species diversity of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species, but a sample of the relevant individuals has to be obtained. Extrapolation from the sample to the underlying population of interest is not straightforward, because the species diversity of the available sample generally gives an underestimation of the species diversity in the entire population. Applying different [[Sample (statistics)|sampling methods]] will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest, and the species diversity of each set may be different. When a new individual is added to a dataset, it may introduce a species that was not yet represented. How much this increases species diversity depends on the value of ''q'': when ''q'' = 0, each new actual species causes species diversity to increase by one effective species, but when ''q'' is large, adding a rare species to a dataset has little effect on its species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomisto, H. (2010) A diversity of beta diversities: straightening up a concept gone awry. Part 2. Quantifying beta diversity and related phenomena. Ecography, 33, 23-45. {{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06148.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, sets with many individuals can be expected to have higher species diversity than sets with fewer individuals. When species diversity values are compared among sets, sampling efforts need to be standardised in an appropriate way for the comparisons to yield ecologically meaningful results. [[Resampling (statistics)|Resampling methods]] can be used to bring samples of different sizes to a common footing.&lt;ref&gt;Colwell, R. K. and Coddington, J. A. (1994) Estimating terrestrial biodiversity through extrapolation. Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, 345, 101-118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Species discovery curve]]s and the number of species only represented by one or a few individuals can be used to help in estimating how representative the available sample is of the population from which it was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Good, I. J. and Toulmin, G. H. (1956) The number of new species, and the increase in population coverage, when a sample is increased. Biometrika, 43, 45-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Chao|Chao, A.]] (2005) Species richness estimation. Pages 7909-7916 in N. Balakrishnan, C. B. Read, and B. Vidakovic, eds. Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences. New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

The observed species diversity is affected not only by the number of individuals but also by the heterogeneity of the sample. If individuals are drawn from different environmental conditions (or different [[habitat]]s), the species diversity of the resulting set can be expected to be higher than if all individuals are drawn from a similar environment. Increasing the area sampled increases observed species diversity both because more individuals get included in the sample and because large areas are environmentally more heterogeneous than small areas.

In printing, '''trap''' expresses the degree to which ink already printed on a substrate accepts another layer printed on top of it compared to how well the substrate (e.g., paper) accepts that ink. 

However, in the era of [[prepress]] software, the term came to refer to compensation for misregistration (when two layers of ink are not perfectly aligned) that was traditionally known as "chokes and spreads". Misregistration causes gaps or white-space on the final printed work. Correcting this involves creating overlaps (spreads) or underlaps (chokes) of objects during the print process.

== Registration ==
Misregistration in the graphical workflow may be caused by human error, inaccuracies in the image setter, the film-to-plate or film-to-film copying steps or instability of the image carrier (e.g., stretch in film or plate), the press or the final media.

These issues can be minimized, but not eliminated - any mechanical process produces some degree of error. The gaps showing up as a result can, however, be hidden by creating overlaps between two adjacent colors.

== Methods ==
In general, prepress software provides some level of trapping, via application default values. Additional trapping may be necessary.

Manual traps can be applied at several stages in the workflow, using vector-based or raster-based adjustments. The choice depends on the type of output (packaging applications including flexo-printing have other requirements than commercial printing on offset systems) and the degree of interactivity or automation.

In-RIP trapping moves the trapping to the [[Raster image processor]] (RIP) trapping at the last moment. The process is automatic, although it is possible to set up ''zones'' to allow different rules for different areas, or to disable trapping for areas already manually trapped.

== Trapping decisions ==

When the two colors in question are [[spot color]]s, trapping is always needed: from the moment the artwork is imaged on film or plate, the colors are handled separately and are printed on two different printing units. The same approach applies if one of the colors is a spot color and the other a [[CMYK color model|process color]].

Trapping becomes more difficult if both colors are process colors and each is to be printed as a combination of the basic printing colors [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]] and [[black]]. In this case, the trapping decision depends on the amount of ‘common’ color.

Another factor that influences the visibility of the traps is the direction of the trap. The decision as to which color should be spread or choked is usually based upon their relative [[luminance]]. The lighter (higher luminance) color is spread into the darker. This responds to the way the human eye perceives color: darker colors define shapes, therefore distortion of the lighter color results in less visible distortion overall. The lightness or darkness of a color is defined as its [[neutral density]].

A major exception to this is the case when opaque (colors that completely obscure colors printed beneath them) spot colors are used. Other colors, regardless of their relative luminance, are always trapped to (spread under) these spot colors. If several of these spot colors are used (a common practice in the packaging market), the order of printing layers rather than luminance is the decisive element: the first color to be printed is spread under the next color.

[[File:Trapping Overprint Stroke.svg|thumb|Example use of a trap.]]

Thinner traps are less visible. Therefore, the trap width is set to a strict minimum, dictated by the maximum amount of misregistration of the entire workflow up to the press. When printing at 150 lpi, traps are usually between 1/150 and 1/300 inch (0.48 pt and 0.24 pt, 0.16&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.08&amp;nbsp;mm). These values are usually multiplied by 1.5 or 2 when one of the colors is black. The trap is not visible since the lighter color is spread underneath the&amp;mdash;almost&amp;mdash;opaque black. For the same reason, in many cases, black ink is set to "overprint" colors in the background, eliminating the more complex process of spreading or choking. Since black is a dark color, white gaps caused by misregistration are more visible. On top of that, in wet-in-wet offset printing, black is the first color to be printed, causing relatively more distortion, thus increasing the risk of visible misregistration.

When a trap between two colors is created, it contains the sum of the two colors in question when at least one of them is a spot color. When the two colors are process colors, the trap contains the highest value of each of the [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] components. This trap color is always darker than the two abutting colors. In some cases, more specifically when the two colors are [[pastel]]-like colors, this might result in a trap that is perceived as too visible. In this case, reducing the amount of color in the trap may help. However, the trap should never be lighter than the darkest color since this would have the same effect as misregistration—creating a light colored ‘gap’ between the two colors. Trap color reduction is not recommended when solid spot colors are used. In that case, reduction would cause the spot color in the trap to be printed, not as a solid, but as a screened tint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Screen printing software|url=https://www.shopworx.com/screen-printing-management-software/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trapping towards a rich black (a black with a support screen of another color added to it to give it a ‘deeper’ look and making it more opaque&amp;mdash;often called "undercolor"), follows the same rules as trapping to a ‘normal’ black.

Blends or ‘vignettes’ offer special challenges to trapping. The lighter part of a blend needs to spread into the background, while the darker part needs to be choked. If a trap over the full length of the blend is needed, this produces a visible ‘staircase’ effect. The solution is to use a sliding trap: a trap that  gradually changes both color and position. The trap can slide all the way. This might unacceptably distort the original artwork. Often, the sliding factor is set to a point where the neutral densities of blend and background reach an appropriate difference.

[[Zimin word]]s are an example of unavoidable patterns.  These are formed by inserting a new letter between two instances of the previous Zimin word, i.e., the first Zimin word '''A''' is used to create the second Zimin word ABA, which in turn creates ABACABA and then ABACABADABACABA and so on.

It is unavoidable that any string, containing two unique characters, that is five or more characters long will contain a pattern of the form ABA (the second Zimin word).  Using three unique characters any string containing 29 or more characters will contain a pattern of the form ABACABA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Joshua | first1=Cooper | first2=Danny | last2= Rorabaugh | title=Bounds on Zimin Word Avoidance | year=2013 | arxiv=1409.3080| bibcode=2014arXiv1409.3080C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''A'' be an alphabet of letters and ''E'' a disjoint alphabet of pattern symbols or "variables".  Elements of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are patterns.  For a pattern ''p'', the pattern language is that subset of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; containing all words ''h''(''p'') where ''h'' is a non-erasing [[semigroup morphism]] from the [[free monoid]] ''E''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  A word ''w'' in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; matches or meets ''p'' if it contains some word in the pattern language as a factor, otherwise ''w'' avoids ''p''.&lt;ref name=LotII112&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS24&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

A pattern ''p'' is '''avoidable''' on ''A'' if there are infinitely many words in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; that avoid ''p''; it is '''unavoidable''' on ''A'' if all sufficiently long words in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; match&amp;nbsp;''p''.   We say that ''p'' is ''k''-unavoidable if it is unavoidable on every alphabet of size ''k'' and correspondingly ''k''-avoidable if it is avoidable on an alphabet of size ''k''.&lt;ref name=LotII113&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS127&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a word ''W''(''k'') over an alphabet of size 4''k'' which avoids every avoidable pattern with less than 2''k'' variables.&lt;ref name=LotII122&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* The [[Thue–Morse sequence]] avoids the patterns ''xxx'' and ''xyxyx''.&lt;ref name=LotII113/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS127/&gt;
* The patterns ''x'' and ''xyx'' are unavoidable on any alphabet.&lt;ref name=AS24/&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII115&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
* The power pattern ''xx'' is 3-avoidable;&lt;ref name=AS24/&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII113/&gt; words avoiding this pattern are ''square-free''.&lt;ref name=BLRS127/&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII114&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;114&lt;/ref&gt;
* The power patterns ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3 are 2-avoidable: the Thue–Morse sequence is an example for ''n''=3.&lt;ref name=LotII113/&gt;
* [[Sesquipower]]s are unavoidable.&lt;ref name=LotII115/&gt;

==Avoidability index==
The '''avoidability index''' of a pattern ''p'' is the smallest ''k'' such that ''p'' is ''k''-avoidable, or ∞ if ''p'' is unavoidable.&lt;ref name=LotII124&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;  For binary patterns (two variables ''x'' and ''y'') we have:&lt;ref name=LotII126&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.126&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Zimin words x, xyx, xyxzxyx, xyxzxyxwxyxzxyx, etc. are unavoidable, as well as any word that can be written as a subword of a Zimin word via a homomorphism.  All other words are avoidable.
* Many patterns have avoidability index 2.
* xx,xxy,xyy,xxyx,xxyy,xyxx,xyxy,xyyx,xxyxx,xxyxy,xyxyy, as well as many doubled words, have avoidability index 3, though this list is not complete.
* abwbaxbcyaczca has avoidability index 4, as well as other locked words. (Baker, McNulty, Taylor 1989)
* abvbawbcxacycdazdcd has avoidability index 5. (Clark 2004)
* no words with index greater than 5 have been found.

==Square-free words==
{{main article|Square-free word}}
A '''square-free word''' is one avoiding the pattern ''xx''.  An example is the word over the alphabet {0,±1} obtained by taking the [[first difference]] of the Thue–Morse sequence.&lt;ref name=PF104&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS97&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yilan Creole Japanese'''&lt;ref&gt;also {{nihongo||寒渓語|Kankei|lead=yes}} or ''Hanxi'' ({{zh|t=寒溪語}})&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-based [[creole language|creole]] of Taiwan. It arose in the 1930s and 1940s, with contact between Japanese colonists and the native [[Atayal people]] of southern [[Yilan County, Taiwan]]. The vocabulary of a speaker born in 1974 was 70% Japanese and 30% [[Atayal language|Atayal]], but the grammar of the creole does not closely resemble either of the source languages.&lt;ref&gt;Chien Yuehchen &amp; Sanada Shinji (2010) "Yilan Creole in Taiwan", ''Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages'' 25:2, pp. 350–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taiwan ROC political division map Yilan County.svg|thumb|Yilan County, Taiwan]]
Atayal features surfaced in the Japanese language spoken in Taiwan, eventually becoming a [[pidgin]] before it fully developed into a [[Creole language|creole]], and the language is now currently the only known Japanese-based creole on the island, and possibly in the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
The [[Creole language|creole]] is spoke in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] in Eastern Taiwan, mainly in Tungyueh Village, Chinyang Village, Aohua Village, and Hanhsi Village, with evidence of differences [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of the creole found in each.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although the exact number of Yilan Creole speakers is unknown, it is likely less than the total population of the four villages, which is 3,000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One estimate is 2,000 to 3,000 speakers of Yilan Creole currently exist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the creole is currently used among all generations,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; younger generations are receiving less exposure to it, causing the language to become [[Endangered language|endangered]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While older speakers may not be fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], younger generations are consistently using Mandarin more.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Japanese language still has some influence in Taiwan society today. Japanese based Internet sites in Japanese are viewed by Taiwanese, with “few other countries [producing] as much information in Japanese as Taiwan”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Evidence of Japanese signboards, particularly with the use of the Japanese [[hiragana]] character の (pronounced “no”) may be seen in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Taiwanese citizens who received Japanese education during the annexation of the nation still speak Japanese fluently today.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are three generations of Yilan Creole speakers, with the older and middle generations using the creole significantly more than the younger generation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Tungyueh Village, younger generations seem to have lost the Yilan Creole, while there are still fluent younger generation speakers of the Creole in Aohua.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After a push for preserving a more traditional and pure sense of [[Atayal people|Atayal heritage]], the Yilan Creole that is imbued with Japanese features was removed from language examinations. This further instilled a tendency toward Mandarin and a push away from Yilan Creole in young speakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While older generations prefer to speak Japanese or Yilan-Creole with people of the same age, they will often use Atayal or Mandarin mixed with Yilan Creole when speaking with younger generations; younger generations will similarly prefer Mandarin with same-age speakers, but may use Yilan Creole with older generations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to the migration of Japanese from the western part of the Japan to Taiwan in the early half of the twentieth century, with seventy percent of Taiwan’s immigrants being from western Japan, Yilan Creole acquired some of the regional dialects of western Japan. However, these [[Dialect|regional dialects]] are still used unconsciously.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Yilan Creole has the following twenty-two [[consonant]]s from Japanese and Atayal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The orthography is given in angle brackets where it differs from the IPA symbol.

Japanese consonants that Yilan Creole has inherited include the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] [b], [d] and [g]''',''' voiced alveolar [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] [z]''',''' [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveo-palatal]] fricative [ɕ]''',''' alveolar [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] [ts], and alveo-palatal affricates [tɕ] and [dʑ]. It does not have the [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] fricative [Φ] and [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] [N] found in Japanese, however.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Atayal Consonants the Yilan Creole has inherited include the [[glottal stop]] [ʔ], alveolar [[Liquid consonant|liquid]] [l], [[Velar consonant|velar]] fricative [x], and the liquid [l]. It does not have the uvular stop [q] of Atayal. Some other features that Yilan Creole adopted from Atayal are the consonants  [t] and [k] can occur word-finally, velar nasal [ŋ] can appear in the word-initial also word-final position, and fricatives [s], [x] and [h] can occur in word-final position. In some Japanese-based words, [l] has taken place of [r], such as ''suware'' ‘to sit’ becoming ''suwale'' ‘to sit’ in Yilan Creole. The [[phoneme]] [l] similarly does this with [d] in many Japanese based words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vowels ===
Yilan Creole [[vowel]]s consist of [a], [i], [u], [e] and [o] which derive from both Japanese and Atayal, but also [ə] which derives specifically from Atayal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, [u] in Yilan Creole resembles the [[Roundedness|rounded]] [u] of Atayal instead of the unrounded [ɯ] in Japanese.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Long consonants and vowels from Japanese words are often shortened in Yilan Creole, where ''gakkô'' ‘school’ in Japanese becomes ''gako'' ‘school’ in Yilan Creole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Yilan Creole falls on the final syllable as it does in the Atayal language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
Although Yilan Creole verbs derive from Japanese and Ayatal, [[Grammatical conjugation|verb conjugation]] patterns uniquely differ in some aspects. [[Tense–aspect–mood|Tense]] is noted through the use of [[affix]]es and temporal adverbs together. Ayatal based verbs will still use Japanese affixation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some processes of negation in Yilan Creole use Japanese derived forms to accommodate the [[realis mood]] that is part of Atayal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Sanada, S., &amp; Chien, Y. (2011). Negation in Taiwan's Yilan Creole: Focusing on -nay and -ng [Abstract]. Gengo Kenkyu, 73-87. Retrieved March 08, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=25353712&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syntax ===
The [[word order]] of Yilan Creole is SOV. It follows Japanese sentence structure, however, there is evidence of Mandarin-based SVO sentences as well, particularly in younger speakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Vocabulary/Lexis ==
In Yilan Creole, phonological forms of words are derived from Japanese, while the [[Semantics|semantic]] properties are derived from Atayal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to a study on Yilan Creole in Tungyueh Village by  Zeitoun, Teng, and Wu, “the proportion of Atayal-derived words in the Yilan Creole basic vocabulary is 18.3%, and that of Japanese-derived words is 35.6%. Both Atayal-derived words and Japanese-derived words can be used for 33.8% of the items”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Southern Min]] words also exist, but far less. Older generation speakers tend to use Atayal and Japanese variants more often than younger generational speakers, who prefer Mandarin variants, when they exist. Mandarin based words lose their tone in Yilan Creole.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many Atayal words relating to nature, animals, and plants survived in the creole. Vocabulary of most concepts such as these related to traditional [[Atayal people|Atayal]] and [[Seediq people|Seediq]] life and culture are retained in Yilan Creole.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Suffixes ===
The verb [[suffix]] ''–suru'' in Yilan Creole'''',''' derived from the Japanese verb ‘to do’, is similar to its Japanese counterpart, except in that it is a [[Bound and unbound morphemes|bound morpheme]] while the Japanese ''-suru'' can stand alone as a [[Bound and unbound morphemes|free morpheme]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Also, Yilan Creole –''suru'' can attach to nouns, adjectives, and, among young generational speakers, verbs. However, older generation speakers do not accept verbs + -''suru'' combinations.

Another affix in Yilan Creole is the Japanese derived –''rasyeru'' for causative forms. However, while Japanese [[inflection]] differs between consonant versus vowel ending verbs, the Yilan Creole suffix does not.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Compound Words ===
There are four types of [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]] in Yilan Creole:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Type 1: Atayal-derived word + Atayal-derived word (e.g., ''hopa''-''la’i'')

Type 2: Atayal-derived word + Japanese-derived word (e.g., ''hopa''-''tenki'')

Type 3: Japanese-derived word + Atayal-derived word (e.g., ''naka''-''lukus'', ''kako''-''balay'')

Type 4: Japanese-derived word + Japanese-derived word (e.g., ''naka''-''pangcyu'', ''unme''-''zyoto'')

While Type 1 compound words occur in Atayal, Japanese does not have occurrences of Type 4 compound words in its own language, suggesting that Type 2, 3, and 4 compound words are creations of Yilan Creole.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Pronouns ===
A chart detailing Yilan Creole [[pronoun]]s:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|
|Singular
|Plural
|-
|The first-person pronoun
|wa/waha
|watati/wahatati
|-
|The second-person pronoun
|su/anta
|Antatati
|-
|The third-person pronoun  
|hiya/zibun/zin/are
|zintati/zibuntati/aretati
|}
The forms of pronouns are Japanese derived. However, in comparison to both Atayal and Japanese, Yilan Creole has a simplified pronominal system. The creole distinguishes pronouns between [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]. Yilan does not distinguish between [[Grammatical case|case]], bound or free pronouns, nor [[Clusivity|inclusive]] versus [[Clusivity|exclusive]] pronouns as Atayal does. It also does not distinguish between [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Politeness and respect (Japanese language)|degree of politeness]] as Japanese does.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Demonstratives ===
[[Demonstrative (linguistics)|Demonstratives]] in Yilan Creole derive from Japanese.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Adjectives and Adverbs ===
[[Adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s in Yilan Creole derive from both Japanese and Atayal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ayatal adjectives are primarily used for colors and subjective feelings. Unlike Japanese, adjectives in the creole languages are not inflected and tense is expressed through temporal adverbs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adjectives in Yilan Creole may also act as adverbs when modifying verbs. For example, the word ''lokah'' ‘good, strong’ “functions as an adjective when describing ''anta'' ‘you’ in the phrase ''lokah anta'' ‘ you (are) strong’ … while ''lokah'' functions as an adverb as in ''lokah benkyo'' ‘to study hard’”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Writing System ==
The [[writing system]] of Yilan creole uses the [[Kunrei-shiki romanization|Kunrei-shiki Romanization]], as well as the Atayal writing system used in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Atayal uses [[latin script]] as its writing system.
