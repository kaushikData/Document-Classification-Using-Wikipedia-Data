A '''501(c) organization''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] in the [[Law_of_the_United_States#Federal_law|federal law of the United States]] according to {{usc|26|501}} and is one of 29 types of nonprofit organizations exempt from some [[Taxation in the United States|federal]] [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]]. Sections 503 through 505 set out the requirements for attaining such exemptions. Many states refer to Section 501(c) for definitions of organizations exempt from state taxation as well. 501(c) organizations can receive unlimited contributions from individuals, [[corporation]]s, and [[labor union|unions]].

For example, a nonprofit organization may be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) if its primary activities are charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering amateur sports competition, preventing [[child abuse|cruelty to children]], or preventing [[animal cruelty|cruelty to animals]].

==General compliance==
Under Section 511, a 501(c) organization is subject to tax on its "[[unrelated business income]]", whether or not the organization actually makes a profit, but not including selling donated merchandise or other business or trade carried on by volunteers, or certain bingo games.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|513(f)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Disposal of donated goods valued over $2,500, or acceptance of goods worth over $5,000 may also trigger special filing and record-keeping requirements.

Tax exemption does not excuse an organization from maintaining proper records and filing any required annual or special-purpose [[tax return (United States)|tax returns]], e.g., {{usc|26|6033}} and {{usc|26|6050L}}. Prior to 2008, an annual return was not generally required from an exempt organization accruing less than $25,000 in gross income yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Bulletin 23, 1982, exercising {{usc|26|6033(a)(2)(B)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, most organizations whose annual gross receipts are less than $50,000 must file an annual information return known as [[Form 990|Form 990-N]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=169250,00.html |title=Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations – Form 990-N (e-Postcard) |work= Internal Revenue Service |date= 29 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=990Nexceptions|Organizations that are not eligible to file Form 990-N include private foundations, most section 509(a)(3) supporting organizations, and organizations exempt under Section 501(c)(1), 501(c)(20), 501(c)(23), 501(c)(24), 501(d), 527, 529, 4947(a)(2), 4947(a)(1).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-n-e-postcard-organizations-not-permitted-to-file Form 990-N (e-Postcard): Organizations Not Permitted to File]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. February 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Form 990-N must be submitted electronically using an authorized [[IRS e-file]] provider. Form 990, Form 990-EZ, and Form 990-PF may be filed either by mail or electronically through an authorized e-file provider.

Failure to file required returns such as Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax) may result in fines of up to $250,000 per year. Exempt or political organizations, excluding churches or similar religious entities, must make their returns, reports, notices, and exempt applications available for public inspection.  The organization's Form 990 (or similar such public record as the Form 990-EZ or Form 990-PF) is available for public inspection and photocopying at the offices of the exempt organization, through a written request and payment for photocopies by mail from the exempt organization, or through a direct Form 4506-A "Request for Public Inspection or Copy or Political Organization IRS Form" request to the IRS of for the past three tax years. Form 4506-A also allows the public inspection or photocopying access to Form 1023 "Application for Recognition of Exemption" or Form 1024, Form 8871 "Political Organization Notice of Section 527 Status", and Form 8872 "Political Organization Report of Contribution and Expenditures".  Internet access to many organizations' 990 and some other forms are available through [[GuideStar]].{{efn|name=Guidestar|[[Guidestar]] access to recent 990 filings is available for free, but requires one to open a free account.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://learn.guidestar.org/about-us/ About Us]". ''[[Guidestar]]''. Accessed on June 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Certain organizations are exempt from filing Form 990, such as churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches; the exclusively religious activities of any religious order; and religious organizations; and most organizations whose annual gross receipts are less than $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to file such timely returns and to make other specific information available to the public also is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==501(c)(4)==
{{See also|Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission}}

A '''501(c)(4) organization''' is a social welfare organization, such as a civic organization or a neighborhood association. An organization is considered by the IRS to be operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting the common good and general welfare of the people of the community.&lt;ref name="cpe"&gt;{{cite web |title= Political Organizations and IRC IRC 501(c)(4) |first1=Raymond |last1=Chick |first2=Amy |last2=Henchey |work= Exempt Organizations-Technical Instruction Program for FY 1995 |publisher= Internal Revenue Service |url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicm95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reg1501"&gt;[http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Treasury_Regulations,_Subchapter_A,_Sec._1.501(c)(4)-1 Reg. 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt; Net earnings must be exclusively used for charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|501(c)(4)(A)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post Co|The Washington Post]]'', 501(c)(4) organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/13/what-is-a-501c4-anyway/|title=What is a 501(c)(4), anyway?|last=Sullivan|first=Sean|date=2013-05-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...are allowed to participate in politics, so long as politics do not become their primary focus. What that means in practice is that they must spend less than 50 percent of their money on politics. So long as they don't run afoul of that threshold, the groups can influence elections, which they typically do through advertising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Allowed activities===

501(c)(4) are similar to 501(c)(5) and 501(c)(6) in that the organizations may inform the public on controversial subjects and attempt to influence legislation relevant to its program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rev.

The income tax exemption for 501(c)(4) organizations applies to most of their operations, but income spent on political activities—generally the advocacy of a particular candidate in an election—is taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comparison of 501(c) (3)s, 501(c)(4)s, and political organizations |url=http://www.afj.org/assets/resources/resource1/Comparison-of-501C3S-501C4S.pdf |publisher=[[Alliance for Justice]] |date=July 2007 |access-date=15 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215144849/http://www.afj.org/assets/resources/resource1/Comparison-of-501C3S-501C4S.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An "action" organization generally qualifies as a 501(c)(4) organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Rev.

====Electioneering communications====
The use of 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) organizations has been affected by the 2007 [[FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]], in which the Supreme Court struck the part of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold Act]] that prohibited 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) from broadcasting electioneering communications. The Act defined an electioneering communication as a communication that mentions a candidate's name 60 days before a primary or 30 days before a general election.

===Contributions===
Contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations are not tax-deductible as charitable donations unless the organization is either a volunteer fire department or a veterans organization.&lt;ref&gt;Walden, Steve.

===History===
The origins of 501(c)(4) organizations date back to the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], which created a new group of tax-exempt organizations dedicated to social welfare in a precursor to what is now Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(4).&lt;ref&gt;Gershman, Jacob. "[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2013/05/16/the-surprisingly-muddled-history-of-the-501c4-exemption The Surprisingly Muddled History of the 501(c)(4) Exemption]". ''The Wall Street Journal''. May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 introduced a new requirement on 501(c)(4) organizations.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2029/text/enr#link=Q&amp;nearest=H28BF86D91B6D4B0BACAC5DDA239B2E65 H.R.2029: Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016: Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015: Section 405]". ''Govtrack.us''. Civic Impulse, LLC. December 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 60 days of the organization's formation, a 501(c)(4) organization is required to file Form 8976 with the Internal Revenue Service as notification that it is operating as a section 501(c)(4) organization.&lt;ref name = 2016-09&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-16-09.pdf Notice 2016-09]".

July 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Internal Revenue Service will acknowledge receipt of the notification, but the acknowledgment is not a determination that the organization qualifies for section 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name = 2016-41/&gt; A 501(c)(4) organization is not required to send the notification if the organization was formed on or before July 8, 2016, and it either applied for a determination letter using Form 1024 or filed a Form 990 between December 19, 2015 and July 8, 2016.&lt;ref name = 2016-41/&gt;

==501(c)(5)==
A '''501(c)(5) organization''' is a labor organization, an agricultural organization, or a horticultural organization. Labor unions, county fairs, and flower societies are examples of these types of groups. Labor union organizations were a primary benefactor of this organization type, dating to the 19th century. According to the Internal Revenue Service, a 501(c)(5) organization has a duty of providing service to its members first. The organization's benefits may not inure to a specific member, but the rules for inurement vary among the three different types of organizations under this segment. A 501(c)(5) organization can make unlimited corporate, individual, or union contributions.&lt;ref name= inurement&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Inurement-and-Benefits-to-Members-Agricultural-Horticultural-and-Labor-Organizations-(IRC-501(c)(5)) |title= Inurement and Benefits to Members - Agricultural/Horticultural and Labor Organizations (IRC 501(c)(5)) |work= Internal Revenue Service |date= March 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A labor organization may pay benefits to its members because paying benefits improves all members' shared working conditions. An agricultural organization can provide financial assistance to its members in order to improve the conditions of those engaged in agricultural pursuits generally. Members can benefit in incidental ways from the organization's exempt activities as long as the benefits are available to all persons.&lt;ref name= inurement/&gt;

==501(c)(6)==
A '''501(c)(6) organization''' is a business league, chambers of commerce like the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], a real estate board, a board of trade, a professional football league or an organization like the [[Edison Electric Institute]] and the [[Security Industry Association]], that are not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings goes to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.&lt;ref name = irs-501c6&gt;Reilly, John Francis; Hull, Carter C.; Braig Allen, Barbara A.

An association would not qualify if its principal activities consist of securing benefits and performing particular services for members.&lt;ref&gt;American Automobile Association v. Commissioner, 19 T.C. 1146 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

An association that promotes the common interests of certain hobbyists would not qualify because the Internal Revenue Service does not consider hobbies to be activities conducted as businesses.&lt;ref&gt;American Kennel Club v. Hoey, 142 F.2d 920 (2nd Cir. 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization whose primary activity is advertising the products or services of its members does not qualify because the organization is performing a service for its members rather than promoting common interests.&lt;ref&gt;Automotive Electric Association v.

Rul. 79-359, 1979-45 I.R.B. 10". Internal Revenue Service. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cemetery that buries animals is not eligible under 501(c)(13).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr73-454.pdf Rev. Rul. 73-454, 1973-2 C.B. 185]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cemetery company wishing to be recognized under Section 501(c)(13) needs to prepare and file Form 1024 with the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://taxmap.irs.gov/taxmap/pubs/p557-031.htm Publication 557]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. p. 54. Retrieved October 19, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Historically, cemeteries were exempt from local property taxes and excise taxes in most states because states generally considered cemeteries to be performing a recognized civic service.&lt;ref name= irs-eo-501c13/&gt; 

The [[Tariff Act of 1913]] provided an exemption from federal income taxes for mutual cemetery companies that were organized and operated exclusively "for the benefit of their members".&lt;ref name= irs-eo-501c13/&gt; In 1921, Congress extended the tax-exemption to cemetery companies that are not mutual and to cemetery companies that are not operated for profit as well as any corporation solely incorporated to operate a cemetery and whose net gains do not inure to any person.&lt;ref name= irs-eo-501c13/&gt;  

In 1970, Congress included crematorium in the definition of cemetery for the purposes of Section 501(c)(13).&lt;ref name= irs-eo-501c13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"P.L. 91-618 (84 Stat. 1955)".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department''''' [2004] UKHL 56 (also known as the '''''Belmarsh 9''''' case) is a [[UK human rights]] case heard before the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. It held that the indefinite detention of foreign prisoners in [[Belmarsh (HM Prison)|Belmarsh]] without trial under section 23 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]]  was [[declaration of incompatibility|incompatible]] with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

The case should not be confused with the case ''[[A v Secretary of State for the Home Department (No 2)]]'' [2005] UKHL 71, which relates to the use of evidence obtained by torture in British courts.

==Facts==
The case began with nine men who challenged a decision of the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] to eject them from the country on the basis that there was evidence that they threatened national security.

Of the nine appellants, all except two were detained in December 2001; the others were detained in February and April 2002 respectively. All were detained under  the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.lawbore.net/gotosite.php?id=1009&lt;/ref&gt; Part 4 of the Act provided for their indefinite detention without trial and deportation. However, the power was only applied to non-British nationals. Under section 25 of this Act, they had the right to appeal to the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] against their detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051208/aand-1.htm|title=House of Lords - A (FC) and others (FC) (Appellants) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) (2004)A and others (Appellants) (FC) and others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) (Conjoined Appeals)|first=Law Lords|last=Department|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The House of Lords held by a majority ([[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]], [[Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead]], [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope of Craighead]], [[Lord Scott of Foscote]], [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Lord Rodger of Earlsferry]], [[Baroness Hale of Richmond]] and [[Lord Carswell]]) that, whilst their detention was lawful under the ATCSA 2001, section 23 was incompatible with the articles of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. As a consequence, the House of Lords made a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and allowed the appeals.

[[Lord Hoffmann]] dissented in strong terms, but agreed that the appeals should be allowed. Whereas the majority argued that the 2001 Act was contrary to the ECHR because it discriminated between nationals and foreign nationals (Art.14 ECHR), Lord Hoffmann stated that the whole scheme was incompatible with the United Kingdom's constitution, and its commitment to human rights. He dismissed the government's argument that under the ECHR and HRA it was possible to derogate from the ECHR's general provisions. His view was that the test – that there was a "threat to the life of the nation" – was not fulfilled.

{{quote|{{ordered list| start=96| This is a nation which has been tested in adversity, which has survived physical destruction and catastrophic loss of life. I do not underestimate the ability of fanatical groups of terrorists to kill and destroy, but they do not threaten the life of the nation. Whether we would survive [[Hitler]] hung in the balance, but there is no doubt that we shall survive Al-Qaeda. The Spanish people have not said that what happened in Madrid, hideous crime as it was, threatened the life of their nation. Their legendary pride would not allow it. Terrorist violence, serious as it is, does not threaten our institutions of government or our existence as a civil community.
| For these reasons I think that the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] made an error of law and that the appeal ought to be allowed. Others of your Lordships who are also in favour of allowing the appeal would do so, not because there is no emergency threatening the life of the nation, but on the ground that a power of detention confined to foreigners is irrational and discriminatory. I would prefer not to express a view on this point. I said that the power of detention is at present confined to foreigners and I would not like to give the impression that all that was necessary was to extend the power to United Kingdom citizens as well. In my opinion, such a power in any form is not compatible with our constitution. The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for Parliament to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory.}}}}

Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe also dissented, but would have dismissed the appeal. In his opinion, the discrimination was justified due to "sound, rational grounds for different treatment". While the indefinite detention provisions were a "grave concern", they were "necessary" and accompanied by "several important safeguards against oppression". He therefore held that Part 4 of the 2001 Act was "proportionate, rational and non-discriminatory".

==Significance==
Parliament decided to replace Part 4 of ATCSA 2001 with the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This allows anyone of any nationality to be subjected to a [[control order]].

[[File:Fochs Railway Car Second Time Around 1940.jpg|right|thumb|Ferdinand Fochs Railway Car, at the same location as after World War One, prepared by the Germans for the second armistice at Compiègne, June 1940]]

It did not come into effect until after midnight on 25 June.

Signatories for Germany included senior military officers like [[Wilhelm Keitel]],&lt;ref name = "conv"/&gt; the commander-in-chief of the [[Wehrmacht]] (the German armed forces), while those on the French side were more junior, such as General [[Charles Huntziger]]. Following the decisive German victory in the [[Battle of France]] (10 May–21 June 1940), this [[armistice]] established [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|a German occupation zone in Northern and Western France]] that encompassed all [[English Channel]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] ports and left [[Vichy France|the remainder]] "free" to be governed by the French.  Adolf Hitler deliberately chose [[Compiègne Forest]] as the site to sign the armistice due to its symbolic role as the site of the 1918 [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice with Germany]] that signaled the end of [[World War I]] with Germany's surrender.
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Battle of France==
{{main article|Battle of France}}
The best, most modernised French armies &lt;!-- which best and most modern armies?/FW --&gt;had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost their best heavy weaponry and their best armored formations. Between May and June, French forces were in general retreat and Germany threatened to occupy [[Paris]].  The French government was forced to relocate to [[Bordeaux]] on 10 June to avoid capture and declared Paris to be an [[open city]] the same day.

By 22 June, the German Armed Forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') had losses of 27,000 dead, more than 111,000 wounded and 18,000 missing.

French losses were 92,000 dead and more than 200,000 wounded.

The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] suffered 68,000 casualties, with around 10,000 killed.

==Choice of Compiègne==
When Adolf Hitler received word from the French government that they wished to negotiate an [[armistice]], Hitler selected Compiègne Forest as the site for the negotiations. As Compiègne was the site of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|1918 Armistice]] ending the [[World War I|Great War]] with Germany's conflict cessation, Hitler used this place as a supreme moment of [[revenge]] for Germany over France. Hitler decided that the signing should take place in the same rail carriage, the [[Compiègne Wagon]], where the Germans had signed the 1918 armistice. However, in the last sentence of the preamble, the drafters inserted "However, Germany does not have the intention to use the armistice conditions and armistice negotiations as a form of humiliation against such a valiant opponent", referring to the French forces. Furthermore, in Article 3, Clause 2, the drafters stated that their intention was not to heavily occupy North-West France after the cessation of hostilities with [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

[[William Shirer]], who was present on that day, reports, "I am but fifty yards from him. […] I have seen that face many times at the great moments of his life. But today! It is afire with scorn, anger, hate, revenge, triumph."&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, William, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011, ISBN 978-1451651683p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the same railway carriage in which the 1918 Armistice had been signed (removed from a museum building and placed exactly where it was in 1918), on 21 June 1940, Hitler sat in the same chair in which Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] had sat when he faced the representatives of the defeated German Empire. After listening to the reading of the preamble, Hitler – in a calculated gesture of disdain for the French delegates – left the carriage, as Foch had done in 1918, leaving the negotiations to his ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (High Command of the Armed Forces) Chief, General [[Wilhelm Keitel]]. Then negotiations lasted one day, until the evening of 22 June 1940: General Huntzinger had to discuss the terms by phone with the French government representatives who had fled to Bordeaux, mainly with the newly nominated defence minister, General [[Maxime Weygand]].

==Terms==
[[File:13June 25June1940 FallRot.svg|thumb|300px|''[[Fall Rot]]'' in June exploited and sealed the [[blitzkrieg|stunning]] German success of ''[[Fall Gelb]]'' in May.]]

[[Adolf Hitler]] had a number of reasons for agreeing to an armistice. He wanted to ensure that France did not continue to fight from North Africa, and he wanted to ensure that the French Navy was taken out of the war. In addition, leaving a French government in place would relieve Germany of the considerable burden of administering French territory, particularly as he turned his attentions towards Britain. Finally, as Germany lacked [[Kriegsmarine|a navy]] sufficient to occupy France's overseas territories, Hitler's only practical recourse to deny the British use of them was to maintain a formally independent and neutral French rump state.

According to [[William Shirer]]'s book ''[[Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', French General [[Charles Huntziger]] complained that the armistice terms imposed on France were harsher than those imposed on Germany in 1918. They provided for German occupation of three-fifths of France north and west of a line through Geneva and Tours and extending to the Spanish border, so as to give [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' access to all French [[English Channel|Channel]] and [[Altantic Ocean|Atlantic]] ports. All persons who had been granted political asylum had to be surrendered and all occupation costs had to be borne by France, approximately 400 million [[French francs]] a day. A minimal [[French Army]] would be permitted. As one of Hitler's few concessions, the [[French Navy]] was to be disarmed but not surrendered, for Hitler realized that pushing France too far could result in France fighting on from the [[French colonial empire]]. An unoccupied region in the south, the ''[[Zone libre]]'', was left relatively free to be governed by [[Vichy France|a rump French administration]] based in [[Vichy]], which also administered the occupied zones, albeit under severe restrictions.

This was envisaged to last until a final peace treaty was negotiated. At the time, both French and Germans thought the occupation would be a provisional state of affairs and last only until Britain came to terms, which was believed to be imminent.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} For instance, none of the French delegation objected to the stipulation that [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French soldiers would remain prisoners of war]] until the cessation of all hostilities. Nearly one million Frenchmen were thus forced to spend the next five years in prisoner of war camps (about a third of the initial 1.5 million prisoners taken were released or exchanged as part of the ''[[Service du Travail Obligatoire]]'' forced labour programme by the Germans, before the war ended).&lt;ref&gt;Durand, ''La Captivité'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a final peace treaty was never negotiated, and the unoccupied zone was occupied by Germany and its Italian ally in [[Case Anton|Operation ''Anton'']] following the invasion of French North Africa by the Allies in November 1942.

Article 19 of the Franco-German armistice required the French state to turn over to German authorities any German national on French territory, who would then frequently face deportation to a concentration camp (the "Surrender on Demand" clause).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.almondseed.com/vfry/fryfoun.htm |title=The Varian Fry Foundation Project/IRC |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keitel gave verbal assurances that this would apply mainly to those refugees who had "fermented the war", a euphemism for Jews, and especially German Jews who until then had enjoyed asylum in France. Keitel also made one other concession, that French aircraft need not be handed over to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp.233-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The French delegation – led by General [[Charles Huntziger]] – tried to soften the harsher terms of the armistice, but Keitel replied that they would have to accept or reject the armistice as it was. Given the military situation that France was in, Huntziger had "no choice" but to accede to the armistice terms. The cease-fire went into effect at 00:35 on 25 June 1940, more than two days later, only after another armistice was signed between France and Italy, the main German ally in Europe.

The armistice did have some relative advantages for the French, compared to worse possible outcomes, such as keeping the colonial empire and the fleet, and, by avoiding full occupation and disarmament, the remaining French rump state in the unoccupied zone could enforce a certain ''de facto'' independence and neutrality vis-à-vis the Axis.

The Armistice site was demolished by the Germans on Hitler's orders three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://stevenlehrer.com/compiegne.htm |title=Compiègne |last=Lehrer |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Lehrer |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carriage itself was taken to Berlin as a trophy of war, along with pieces of a large stone tablet which bore the inscription (in French):

:&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;''HERE ON THE ELEVENTH OF NOVEMBER 1918 SUCCUMBED THE CRIMINAL PRIDE OF THE GERMAN REICH. VANQUISHED BY THE FREE PEOPLES WHICH IT TRIED TO ENSLAVE''&lt;/span&gt;.

The [[Alsace-Lorraine]] Monument (depicting a German Eagle impaled by a sword) was also destroyed and all evidence of the site was obliterated, except notably the statue of [[Marshal Foch]]: Hitler ordered it to be left intact, so that it would be honoring only a wasteland. The railway carriage was later exhibited in Berlin, and then taken to [[Crawinkel]] in [[Thuringia]] in 1945, where it was destroyed by SS troops and the remains buried. After the war, the site and memorials were restored by German POW labour.

The '''''Bank Act''''' (1991, c. 46) (the ''Act'') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Government of Canada]] respecting banks and banking.

== History ==
The ''Bank Act'' was originally passed in 1871. The terms of the ''Act'' provide for a statutory review of the ''Act'' on a regular basis to ensure that legislators update the ''Act'' in order that it keep pace with developments in the financial system. Historically, this was done on a decennial basis.&lt;ref name="The Quebec History Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/BankinginCanada-CanadianBanks-CanadianHistory.htm |title=History of the Banking system of Canada to 1948 |publisher=The Quebec History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, this requirement was changed to every five years. The ''Act'' contains a "sunset" clause providing that it and the bank charters provided by it will expire unless the statutory review is conducted every five years. The most recent statutory review of the ''Act'' took place in 2012.

=== Credit unions ===
In 2010, the [[Parliament of Canada]] passed amendments to the ''Act'' to allow [[Government of Canada|federal]] credit unions to exist as a new class of financial institution. Credit unions differ from banks in that they are member-owned, democratically controlled and governed by co-operative principles. The ''Bank Act'' allows that federal credit unions may either be created by five persons (of which three must be individuals), or through the continuance of one or more credit unions existing within provincial jurisdiction. The provisions came into force at the end of 2012.

The first federal credit union in Canada was [[UNI Financial Cooperation]] (formerly Mouvement des caisses populaires acadiennes), based in [[New Brunswick]], which converted to a federal charter in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister Morneau Welcomes Canada's First Federal Credit Union|url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/n16/16-086-eng.asp|website=News|publisher=Department of Finance Canada|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2017, the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]] issued an advisory, stating that it planned to enforce the ''Bank Act'''s prohibitions on using the word or verbiage "bank" in connection to any financial service that is not a bank. The terms were required to be removed from websites by the end of 2017, from print materials by the end of June 2018, and from physical signage by the end of June 2019. The announcement was criticised by credit unions, who believed that it would make it difficult to market their services in a comparable manner to banks, as well as the costs of updating marketing materials to comply with the mandate. The OSFI suspended the advisory in August 2017, after the federal government stated that it would review the rules. In February 2018, the ''Bank Act'' was amended as a riser to the federal budget, allowing credit unions to use banking vernacular to market their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/credit-union-bank-act-atlantic-banking-banker-1.4191781|title=Why credit unions will no longer be able offer 'banking' services|work=CBC News|access-date=July 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/credit-unions-canada-banking-terms-federal-budget-1.4555579|title=Federal budget gives credit unions OK to keep using the word 'banking'|work=CBC News|access-date=March 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ottawa-bank-credit-union-terms-1.4244355|title=Feds to review whether credit unions can use banking terms following outcry|work=CBC News|access-date=March 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The ''Act'' groups banks in three schedules. Schedule I banks are domestic banks allowed to accept deposits. Schedule II banks are subsidiaries of foreign banks that allowed to accept deposits through branches in Canada. Schedule III banks are foreign banks with certain restrictions upon the banking business they can conduct in Canada.

The Canadian banking industry includes 20 domestic banks, 24 foreign bank subsidiaries and 22 foreign bank branches operating in Canada.&lt;ref name=CBA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cba.ca/en/banks-in-canada|title=Banks in Canada|work=[[Canadian Bankers Association]]|access-date=December 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211164735/http://www.cba.ca/en/banks-in-canada|archive-date=December 11, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial-government-owned [[Alberta Treasury Branches]] and Canada's many credit unions are not included in this list.

'''Bear spray''' is a specific aerosol bear deterrent, whose active ingredients are [[capsaicin]] and related capsaicinoids, that is used to deter aggressive or charging bears.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogers1984&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ROGERS|first=LYNN L.|date=1984|title=Reactions of free-ranging black bears to capsaicin spray|url=https://www.bearstudy.org/website/images/stories/Publications/Reactions_of_Free-Ranging_Black_Bears_to_Capsaicin_Spray_Repellant.pdf|journal=Wildl. Soc. Bull.|volume=12|pages=59-61}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The development of [[capsaicin]] bear spray took place in the mid 1980’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bebearaware.org/Bear_Spray_Fact_Sheet_for_OWAA.docx |title= Bear Spray Fact Sheet |publisher=Be Bear Aware Campaign |format=docx |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under principal investigator Carrie Hunt, a University of Montana graduate student working under the supervision of Dr. Charles Jonkel and Dr. Bart O’Gara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hcn.org/articles/meet-the-man-who-changed-humans-relationship-with-bears |title=Meet the man who changed humans’ relationship with bears |publisher=High Country News |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bear Spray Works |url=http://bebearaware.org/Bear-Spray-Works-Short-&amp;-Long-Reviewed%207-6-2016.ppsx |page=10 |website=bebearaware.org |publisher=The Be Bear Aware Campaign |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt had identified commercial pepper sprays as an effective, but unreliable deterrent for bears in previous research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bebearaware.org/Publications/BS_2008_28PG_245.66KB.pdf |title= Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee Bear Spray Report June 2008 |publisher=Be Bear Aware Campaign |format=PDF |page=12 |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however these products were only effective inconsistently and required short distances. Hunt's thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8081&amp;context=etd |title= BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF BEARS TO TESTS OF REPELLENTS, DETERRENTS, AND AVERSIVE CONDITIONING |publisher= University of Montana |format=PDF |page=4 |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. Bill Pounds, who eventually founded Counter Assault bear spray, assisted Hunt and offered to help prototype a reliable [[aerosol]] bear spray canister for Hunt's research. They developed a bear spray formula with a spray range of over 30 feet and a spray time of over 7 seconds. Pounds played an important part in developing the ingredients, the dispersal system, and the recommended specifications of bear spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bebearaware.org/Publications/BS_2008_28PG_245.66KB.pdf |title= Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee Bear Spray Report June 2008 |publisher=Be Bear Aware Campaign |format=PDF |page=13 |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company he founded, Counter Assault, became the first Environmental Protection Agency registered aerosol bear spray.

==Use==
Bear spray contains 1-2% capsaicin and related [[capsaicinoid]]s, the key active ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sabrered.com/pepper-spray-frequently-asked-questions-0|title=Pepper Spray Frequently Asked Questions|website=Sabre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How a Potent Pepper Spray Became the Best Bear Repellent|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150925-grizzly-bears-attacks-science-animals-bear-spray/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-09-26|first = Todd|last = Wilkinson|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED September|last2 = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bear spray is intended to be used to deter an aggressive or charging bear. A user points the canister at an aggressive bear and sprays the contents for 2–3 seconds. Effective distance will vary depending on the manufacturer of the spray, but sprays are reported to be effective when sprayed at a charging or aggressive bear from a distance of {{convert|1.5|to|3|meters}},&lt;ref name=Rogers1984/&gt; or an average of roughly {{convert|4|meters}}.&lt;ref name=Smith_2006/&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Bear spray is a very effective deterrent when used properly. In a 2008 review of bear attacks in Alaska from 1985–2006, Smith et al. found that bear spray stopped a bear's "undesirable behavior" in 92% of cases. Further, 98% of persons using bear spray in close-range encounters escaped uninjured.&lt;ref name=Alaska&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Tom S.|title=Efficacy of Bear Deterrent Spray in Alaska|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|year=2008|volume=72|issue=3|pages=640–645|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/hunting/bear_cougar/bear/files/JWM_BearSprayAlaska.pdf|accessdate=27 Mar 2012|doi=10.2193/2006-452|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of bear spray depends on the situation and circumstances of the attack. In the 2008 study, Tom Smith of Brigham Young University reported, “No bear spray has ever been reported to kill a bear.  It is our belief that widespread use of bear spray will promote human safety and bear conservation.”&lt;ref name="Alaska"/&gt;   On the other hand, latent spray (on object) has also led to the attraction of bears, which usually end up with the bear destroying the spray-covered object.&lt;ref name=Alaska /&gt;  

A United States Geological Survey article, "Bear Spray Safety Program," says that bear spray is effective in fending off aggressive bears while also preventing injury to both the human and the bear. It also states, "No deterrent is 100-percent effective."&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|last=Blome|first=Charles|title=Bear Spray Safety Program|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3018/pdf/FS09-3018.pdf|publisher=U.S. geological Survey|accessdate=27 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Living with Grizzlies," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service states, “The Service supports the pepper spray policy of the Interagency Grizzly bear Committee, which states that bear spray is not a substitute for following proper bear avoidance safety techniques, and that bear spray should be used as a deterrent only in an aggressive or attacking confrontation with a bear.”&lt;ref name=BSvB&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|title=Bear Spray vs. Bullets|url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/grizzly/bear%20spray.pdf|accessdate=30 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Studies
Studies suggest that bear spray is effective at reducing the risk of injury or death in these situations. While bear spray can be effective, authorities stress that proper bear-awareness and avoidance techniques are the best ways to minimize injuries due to human–bear conflict.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;

A 2008 "Efficacy of Bear Deterrent Spray in Alaska" study stated:

* "Red pepper spray stopped bears’ undesirable behavior 92% of the time when used on brown bears, 90% for black bears, and 100% for polar bears. 
* Of all persons carrying sprays, 98% were uninjured by bears in close-range encounters. 
* All bear-inflicted injuries (n = 3) associated with defensive spraying involved brown bears and were relatively minor (i.e., no hospitalization required). 
* In 7% (5 of 71) of bear spray incidents, wind was reported to have interfered with spray accuracy, although it reached the bear in all cases. 
* In 14% (10 of 71) of bear spray incidents, users reported the spray having had negative side effects upon themselves, ranging from minor irritation (11%, 8 of 71) to near incapacitation (3%, 2 of 71). 
* Bear spray represents an effective alternative to lethal force and should be considered as an option for personal safety for those recreating and working in bear country."&lt;ref name=Smith_2006&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wdfw.wa.gov/hunting/bear_cougar/bear/files/JWM_BearSprayAlaska.pdf|title = Efficacy of Bear Deterrent Spray in Alaska|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |doi = 10.2193/2006-452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legality===
Bear spray is legal across the [[United States]]. It can be purchased even in Hawaii, New York, or Massachusetts, where standard pepper sprays are illegal unless bought locally by certified firearms dealers or pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loyaldefender.com/pepper-spray-laws.html |title=Pepper Spray Laws |publisher=loyaldefender.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, while legal for use against bears, bear spray is a prohibited weapon if intended to be used against humans.&lt;ref name=Rules&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Danielle|title=Rules confusing around bear, pepper spray|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/02/05/rules-confusing-around-bear-pepper-spray|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=Ottawa Sun|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear spray is illegal in some U.S. National Parks, but Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks encourage carrying bear spray in the backcountry as protection against bears who reside there.&lt;ref name=NPS_Bears&gt;{{cite web|title=Bears - Glacier National Park|url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/bears.htm|website=U.S. National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProperBearSpray&gt;{{cite web|title=Selecting Proper Bear Spray|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearspray.htm|website=Yellowstone National Park|publisher=U.S. National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YOSEMITE&gt;{{cite web|title=Yosemite National Park, California - Weapons/Firearms|url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/weapons.htm|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=21 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear sprays are considered a pesticide in the US and must be registered with the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bebearaware.org/BearSpray/bearspray.html|title=Be Bear Aware - Bear Spray|website=www.bebearaware.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The capsacin in products sold in the U.S. are regulated by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], under the FIFRA act by Congress. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bebearaware.org/BearSpray/bearspray.html|title=Be Bear Aware, Bear Spray|website=Be Bear Aware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charitable Uses Act of 1601''' (known as the ''Statute of Elizabeth'') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] (43 Eliz I, c.4) of the [[Parliament of England]]. It was repealed by section 13(1) of the [[Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act 1888]] (c.42) (but see section 13(2) of that Act).

The preamble to the act contained a list of purposes or activities that was, in effect, a list of purposes or activities that the State believed were of general benefit to society, and to which the State wanted to encourage private contributions. The list has formed the foundation of the modern definition of charitable purposes, which has developed through case law. This has come about because the courts, in considering whether or not a particular purpose was charitable in law, have tended to look for an analogy between the purpose under consideration and the list, and to recognise the purpose as charitable if an analogy with the 1601 list could be found.  &lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/083/en/06083x--.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flammable''' materials are those that ignite more easily than other materials, whereas those that are harder to ignite or burn less vigorously are '''combustible'''.

The degree of flammability or combustibility in air depends largely upon the chemical composition of the subject material, as well as the ratio of mass versus surface area. Take wood as an example. Finely divided wood dust can undergo [[Dust explosion|explosive combustion]] and produce a blast wave.  A piece of paper (made from wood) catches on fire quite easily. A heavy oak desk is much harder to ignite, even though the wood fibre is the same in all three materials. 

Common sense (and indeed [[Phlogiston theory|scientific consensus]] until the mid-1700s) would seem to suggest that material "disappears" when burned, as only the ash is left. In fact, there is an increase in weight because the combustible material reacts (or combines) chemically with oxygen, which also has mass. The original mass of combustible material and the mass of the oxygen required for combustion equals the mass of the combustion products (ash, water, carbon dioxide, and other gases).  [[Antoine Lavoisier]], one of the pioneers in these early insights, stated that ''Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed'', which would later be known as the law of [[conservation of mass]].  Lavoisier used the experimental fact that some metals gained mass when they burned to support his ideas.

==Definitions==
Historically, ''flammable'', ''inflammable'' and ''combustible'' meant ''capable of burning''.&lt;ref&gt;inflammable, a. (n.) 1. combustible a. and n. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "inflammable" came through French from the Latin ''inflammāre'' = "to set fire to," where the Latin preposition "in-"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?id=F5165900 "flammable", ''The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language'', 5th ed. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. 2014. accessed 3/11/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; means "in" as in "indoctrinate", rather than "not" as in "invisible" and "ineligible".

The word "inflammable" may be erroneously thought to mean "non-flammable".&lt;ref&gt;Sherk, Bill. "fireproof", ''500 Years of New Words''. Toronto: Dundurn, 2004. 96. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The erroneous usage of the word "inflammable" is a significant [[safety hazard]]. Therefore, since the 1950s, efforts to put forward the use of "flammable" in place of "inflammable" were accepted by linguists, and it is now the accepted standard in American English and British English.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Bryan A., ''Garner's Modern American Usage''. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2009. 357. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INFLAMMABLE|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/inflammable.html|work=Common Errors in English Usage|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Antonyms of "flammable/inflammable" include: ''non-flammable'', ''non-inflammable'', ''incombustible'', ''non-combustible'', ''not flammable'', and ''fireproof''.

''Flammable'' applies to materials that ignite more easily than other materials, and thus are more dangerous and more highly regulated. Less easily ignited less-vigorously burning materials are ''combustible''. For example, in the United States [[flammable liquid]]s, by definition, have a [[flash point]] below {{convert|100|F|C}}—where combustible liquids have a flash point above {{convert|100|F|C}}. [[HAZMAT Class 4 Flammable solids|Flammable solids]] are solids that are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances that easily ignite by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and spread flame rapidly.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html ''The Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)''. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.]&lt;/ref&gt; The technical definitions vary between countries so the United Nations created the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals]], which defines the flash point temperature of flammable liquids as between 0 and {{convert|140|F|C}} and combustible liquids between {{convert|140|F|C}} and {{convert|200|F|C}}.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

==Flammability==
'''Flammability''' is the ability of a substance to burn or ignite, causing [[fire]] or [[combustion]]. The degree of difficulty required to cause the combustion of a substance is quantified through [[fire test]]ing. Internationally, a variety of test protocols exist to quantify flammability. The ratings achieved are used in [[building code]]s, [[insurance]] requirements, [[fire code]]s and other regulations governing the use of building materials as well as the storage and handling of highly flammable substances inside and outside of structures and in surface and air transportation. For instance, changing an [[occupancy]] by altering the flammability of the contents requires the owner of a [[building]] to apply for a building permit to make sure that the overall [[fire protection]] design basis of the facility can take the change into account.

===Testing===
A [[fire test]] can be conducted to determine the degree of flammability. Test standards used to make this determination but are not limited to the following:

* [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=94&amp;edition=6&amp;doctype=ulstd UL 94 Flammability Testing]
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] IEC 60707, 60695-11-10 and 60695-11-20
* [[International Organization for Standardization]] ISO 9772 and 9773.
* [[National Fire Protection Association]] [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=287 NFPA 287 Standard Test Methods for Measurement of Flammability of Materials in Cleanrooms Using a Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA)]
* [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=701 NFPA 701: Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Flame Propagation of Textiles and Films]
* [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=850 NFPA 850: Recommended Practice for Fire Protection for Electric Generating Plants and High Voltage Direct Current Converter Stations]

===Furniture flammability===
Flammability of furniture is of concern as cigarettes and candle accidents can trigger domestic fires. In 1975, California began implementing [[Technical Bulletin 117]] (TB 117), which required that materials such as [[polyurethane]] foam used to fill furniture be able to withstand a small open flame, equivalent to a candle, for at least 12 seconds.&lt;ref name=TB117&gt;{{Cite report |author=California Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Home Furnishings |authorlink= |date=2000 |title=Technical Bulletin 117: Requirements, test procedure and apparatus for testing the flame retardance of resilient filling|url=http://www.bhfti.ca.gov/industry/117.pdf|publisher=|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In polyurethane foam, furniture manufacturers typically meet TB 117 with additive halogenated organic [[flame retardant]]s. No other U.S. states had similar standards, but because California has such a large market, manufacturers meet TB 117 in products that they distribute across the United States. The proliferation of flame retardants, and especially halogenated organic flame retardants, in furniture across the United States is strongly linked to TB 117. When it became apparent that the risk-benefit ratio of this approach was unfavorable and industry had used falsified documentation (i.e. see [[David Heimbach]]) for the use of flame retardants, California modified TB 117 to require that fabric covering upholstered furniture meet a smolder test replacing the open flame test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of Proposed New Flammability Standards for Upholstered Furniture/Articles Exempt from Flammability Standards|url=http://www.bhfti.ca.gov/about/laws/propregs.shtml|publisher=Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gov. [[Jerry Brown]] signed the modified TB117-2013, which became effective in 2014.&lt;ref name=gov.brown&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nation-jan-june14-flame_01-01/  |title=Calif. law change sparks debate over use of flame retardants in furniture| publisher=PBS Newshour |date=January 1, 2014| accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of flammable substances===
Flammable substances include, but are not limited to:
* [[Gasoline]] - [[Petrol]] / a complicated mixture of hydrocarbons that includes isomers of [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Ethanol]] / CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH
* [[Rubber]]
* [[Isopropyl alcohol]] / CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(OH)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Methanol]] /  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH
* [[Wood]]
* [[Acetone]] / CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Paper]]
* [[Nitromethane]] / CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Examples of nonflammable liquids===
* [[Properties of water|Water]]
* [[Carbon tetrachloride]]
* [[Diesel fuel]]&lt;ref name="martinoil"&gt;[http://www.martinoilco.com/usr/SafetyBrochure.pdf Martin Oil Safety Brochure], subtitle: ''Gasoline is Highly Flammable. Diesel Fuel is Combustible.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of flammability===
The US Government uses the [[Hazardous Materials Identification System]] (HMIS) standard for flammability ratings, as do many US regulatory agencies, and also the US [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA).

The ratings are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Rating !! Degree of flammability !! Examples
|-
| 0 || Materials that do not burn || [[water]]
|-
| 1 || Materials that must be preheated before they ignite || [[lubricating oil]]s, [[cooking oil]]s
|- 
| 2 || Materials that must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively high ambient temperatures before they ignite || [[diesel fuel]]
|-
| 3 || Liquids and solids that can ignite under almost all temperature conditions || [[gasoline]], [[acetone]]
|-
| 4 || Materials that rapidly vaporize at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures, or readily disperse in air and burn readily || [[natural gas]], [[propane]], [[butane]] 
|}

===Codes===
====Flammability====
For existing buildings, fire codes focus on maintaining the [[Occupancy|occupancies]] as originally intended. In other words, if a portion of a building were designed as an [[apartment]], one could not suddenly load it with flammable liquids and turn it into a gas storage facility, because the fire load and smoke development in that one apartment would be so immense as to overtax the [[active fire protection]] as well as the [[passive fire protection]] means for the building. The handling and use of flammable substances inside a building is subject to the local fire code, which is ordinarily enforced by the local fire prevention officer.

==Combustibility==
'''Combustibility''' is a measure of how easily a substance bursts into flame, through [[fire]] or [[combustion]].  This is an important property to consider when a substance is used for construction or is being stored.  It is also important in processes that produce combustible substances as a by-product. Special precautions are usually required for substances that are easily combustible.  These measures may include installation of [[fire sprinkler]]s or storage remote from possible sources of ignition.

Substances with low combustibility may be selected for construction where the fire risk must be reduced, such as apartment buildings, houses, or offices. If combustible resources are used there is greater chance of fire accidents and deaths.  [[Fire-resistance rating|Fire resistant]] substances are preferred for building materials and furnishings.

=== Code Definitions ===
For an [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]], combustibility is defined by the local code. In the [[National Building Code of Canada]], it is defined as follows:

*''Combustible: A material that fails to meet acceptance criteria of [https://web.archive.org/web/20061003193651/http://www.ulc.ca/About_ulc/Publication_Notice_Detail.asp?PN_ID=31 CAN/ULC-S114, Standard Method of Test for Determination of Noncombustibility in Building Materials].''

:This leads to the definition of '''noncombustible''':

*''Non-combustible: means that a material meets the acceptance criteria of [https://web.archive.org/web/20061003193651/http://www.ulc.ca/About_ulc/Publication_Notice_Detail.asp?PN_ID=31 CAN4-S114, "Standard Method of Test for Determination of Non-Combustibility in Building Materials]".

[[British Standards|BS]] 476-4:1970 defines a test for combusibility in which a technician heats three specimens of a material in a furnace. Non-combustibile materials are those for which none of the three specimens either:

* Makes the temperature reading from either of two thermocouples rise by 50 degrees Celsius or more above the initial furnace temperature
* Flame continuously for 10 seconds or more inside the furnace

Otherwise, the material is classified as combustible.

=== Fire testing ===
{{main|Fire test}}
Various countries have tests for determining noncombustibility of materials. Most involve the heating of a specified quantity of the test specimen for a set duration. Usually, the material cannot support combustion and must not undergo a certain loss of mass. As a rule of thumb, concrete, steel, ceramics, in other words inorganic substances pass these tests, so building codes list them as suitable and sometimes even mandate them for use in certain applications. In [[Canada]], for instance, [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] must be made of [[concrete]].

===Combustible dust===
{{main|Dust explosion}}
A number of industrial processes produce combustible dust as a by-product. The most common being [[wood dust]]. Combustible dust has been defined as: ''a solid material composed of distinct particles or pieces, regardless of size, shape, or chemical composition, which presents a fire or deflagration hazard when suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium over a range of concentrations.''&lt;ref name="OSHA-2009"&gt;United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2009) [http://www.osha.gov/Publications/3371combustible-dust.html "Hazard Communication Guidance for Combustible Dusts"], OSHA 3371-08, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wood, combustible dusts include metals, especially magnesium, titanium and aluminum, as well as other carbon-based dusts.&lt;ref name="OSHA-2009" /&gt; There are at least a 140 known substances that produce combustible dust.&lt;ref name="CSBFinalReport"&gt;{{citation |author=United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board |date=17 November 2006 |url=http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Dust_Final_Report_Website_11-17-06.pdf |title=Investigation Report No. 2006-H-1, Combustible Dust Hazard Study |publisher=U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board |place=Washington, D.C. |oclc=246682805}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref&gt;National Materials Advisory Board, Panel on Classification of Combustible Dusts of the Committee on Evaluation of Industrial Hazards (1980) ''Classification of combustible dusts in accordance with the national electrical code'' Publication NMAB 353-3, National Research Council (U.S.), Washington, D.C., {{OCLC|8391202}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the particles in a combustible dusts may be of any size, normally they have a diameter of less than 420&amp;nbsp;[[µm]].&lt;ref name="OSHA-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;I.e. they can pass through a U.S. No. 40 standard sieve.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2012}}, the [[United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has yet to adopt a comprehensive set of rules on combustible dust.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sandy (7 February 2012) [http://ehstoday.com/standards/osha/csb-osha-combustible-dust/ "Only OSHA Has Not Adopted Chemical Safety Board Recommendations Stemming from Imperial Sugar Explosion"] ''EHS Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

When suspended in air (or any oxidizing environment), the fine particles of combustible dust present a potential for explosions. Accumulated dust, even when not suspended in air, remains a fire hazard. The National Fire Protection Association (U.S.) specifically addresses the prevention of fires and dust explosions in agricultural and food products facilities in NFPA Code section 61,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=61 "NFPA 61 Standard for the Prevention of Fires and Dust Explosions in Agricultural and Food Processing Facilities"]&lt;/ref&gt; and other industries in NFPA Code sections 651–664.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;E.g. NFPA 651 (aluminium), NFPA 652 (magnesium), NFPA 655 (sulphur)&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectors designed to reduce airborne dust account for more than 40 percent of all dust explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Zalosh, Robert ''et al.'' (April 2005) [http://www.firexplo.com/images/Dust_Explosion_Scenario_Paper.pdf "Dust Explosion Scenarios and Case Histories in the CCPS Guidelines for Safe Handling of Powders and Bulk Solids"] ''39th AIChE Loss Prevention Symposium Session on Dust Explosions'' Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt; Other important processes are grinding and pulverizing, transporting powders, filing silos and containers (which produces powder), and the mixing and blending of powders.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Michael (2008) [http://www.newson-gale.com/Documents/Controlling%20Static%20Hazards%20is%20Key%20to%20Preventing%20Combustible%20Cloud%20Explosions.pdf "Controlling Static Hazards is Key to Preventing Combustible Cloud Explosions" Newton Gale, Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507171204/http://www.newson-gale.com/Documents/Controlling%20Static%20Hazards%20is%20Key%20to%20Preventing%20Combustible%20Cloud%20Explosions.pdf |date=2012-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of 200 dust explosions and fires, between 1980 to 2005, indicated ''approximately 100 fatalities and 600 injuries.''&lt;ref name="CSBFinalReport" /&gt;{{rp|105&amp;ndash;106}} In January 2003, a polyethylene powder explosion and fire at the West Pharmaceutical Services plant in [[Kinston, North Carolina]] resulted in the deaths of six workers and injuries to 38 others.&lt;ref name="CSBFinalReport" /&gt;{{rp|104}} In February 2008 an [[2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion|explosion of sugar dust]] rocked the [[Imperial Sugar|Imperial Sugar Company's]] plant at [[Port Wentworth, Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;''The chief executive, John C. Sheptor, said the probable cause of the explosion was sugar dust building up in storage areas, which could have been ignited by static electricity or a spark.'' {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/us/09sugar.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1214147101-FDxU4jy1oY6rejeUzZaMJg&amp;oref=slogin|title=Lives and a Georgia Community’s Anchor Are Lost|date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | first=Shaila | last=Dewan}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in thirteen deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan |last=Chapman |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/business/stories/2008/04/12/sugar_0413.html |title=Sugar refinery near Savannah determined to rebuild |date=13 April 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |publisher=''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629033532/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/business/stories/2008/04/12/sugar_0413.html |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization of building materials==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Steinwolle 1600dpi roxul rxl80.jpg|DIN4102 A1 noncombustible rockwool
Image:Tu braunschweig din4102 smoke density test.jpg|DIN4102 A2 [[gypsum]] [[fireproofing]] [[plaster]] leavened with [[polystyrene]] beads
Image:Toilet flange.jpg|DIN 4102 B1 (difficult to ignite/often self-extinguishing) [[Silicone]] caulking used as a component in [[firestop]]ping [[piping]] [[Penetration (firestop)|penetration]]
Image:Palletts at inniskillin vineyard.jpg|DIN 4102 B2: Timber, normal combustibility
Image:Polyurethane foam at inniskillin 2.jpg|DIN 4102 B3: Polyurethane foam (easy to ignite = many [[hydrocarbon]] bonds usually)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Materials can be tested for the degree of flammability and combustibility in accordance with the German [http://www.din.de/ DIN] 4102. DIN 4102, as well as its British cousin [http://www.bsi-global.com/ BS] 476 include for testing of [[passive fire protection]] [[system]]s, as well as some of its constituent materials.

The following are the categories in order of degree of combustibility and flammability:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Rating !! Degree of flammability !! Examples
|-
| A1 || 100% noncombustible (''nicht brennbar'') || 
|-
| A2 || ~98% noncombustible (''nicht brennbar'') || 
|-
| B1 || Difficult to ignite (''schwer entflammbar'') || [[intumescent]]s and some high end [[silicone]]s
|-
| B2 || Normal combustibility || [[wood]]
|-
| B3 || Easily ignited (''leicht entflammbar'') || [[polystyrene]]
|}

A more recent industrial standard is the European EN 13501-1 - Fire classification of construction products and building elements - which roughly replaces A2 with A2/B, B1 with C, B2 with D/E and B3 with F.

B3 or F rated materials may not be used in building unless combined with another material that reduces the flammability of those materials.

==Important characteristics==
===Flash point===
A material's [[flash point]] is a metric of how easy it is to ignite the vapor of the material as it evaporates into the atmosphere.  A lower flash point indicates higher flammability.  Materials with flash points below {{convert|100|F|lk=on}} are regulated in the [[United States]] by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] as potential workplace [[hazards]].

===Vapor pressure===
* The [[vapor pressure]] of a liquid, which varies with its temperature, is a measure of how much the vapor of the liquid tends to concentrate in the surrounding atmosphere as the liquid evaporates.  Vapor pressure is a major determinant of the flash point, with higher vapor pressures leading to lower flash points and higher flammability.

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1987''' was the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], between 13 October 1987 and 17 October 1987, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], [[Brian Mulroney]].

The meeting was marked by a confrontation between most Commonwealth leaders, including conference chair Mulroney, and Britain's [[Margaret Thatcher]] over the issue of [[Disinvestment from South Africa|economic sanctions against South Africa]] with Thatcher opposing sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/thatcher-wrong-on-apartheid-mandela-south-africa-says/article10926500/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuevana''' is an [[peru|Argentine]] website that offers movies and television content in their original languages, with Spanish subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1363354-cuevana-el-gran-invento-argentino |title=Cuevana: el gran invento argentino|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was created in October 2009 and as of 2011 was one of the 20 most visited websites in Argentina with half a million visits daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1375216-cuevana-sacude-la-forma-de-ver |title=Cuevana sacude la forma de ver|publisher= [[La Nación (Argentina)|La Nación]]|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuevana operates as a connecting hub that uses plugins to allow users to stream content. Cuevana claims not to store files itself, but makes it easy to reach content by linking to external online storage. This method of operation has created a strong debate on the matter of the legality of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cronista.com/opinion/El-fenomenoCuevana-20110304-0086.html|title= El fenómeno Cuevana|publisher=[[El Cronista]]|date=March 4, 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semana.com/cultura/todos-hablan-cuevana/157911-3.aspx|title=Todos hablan de Cuevana |publisher= Semana|date=June 4, 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 14, 2012, a download option was created, called DCuevana.

As of 2014, cuevana.tv distributed the software ''Cuevana Storm'' which, like [[Popcorn Time]], operates as a [[BitTorrent|torrent]] client that lets downloaders immediately watch a movie while simultaneously uploading it to others.&lt;ref name=tf&gt;{{cite web|title=Popcorn Time Users Get 'Fined' by Copyright Trolls|work=torrentfreak.com|date=May 15, 2014|url=http://torrentfreak.com/popcorn-time-users-get-fined-copyright-trolls-140515/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Legal instances ==
* November 22, 2011, HBO Latin America initiated a criminal case against Cuevana and one of its founders Tomas Escobar for alleged violation of Argentine law 11,723 (intellectual property).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/HBO-demando-pagina-filmes-Cuevana_0_600540036.html|title=HBO demandó a la página de series y filmes Cuevana|publisher=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conti|first=Juan Pablo|title=Cuevana: The End?|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2011113017494/cuevana-the-end253.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge in the case has decided not to block access to Cuevana.
* November 29, 2011, [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Argentina]] obtained an injunction from the Federal Court of First Instance ordered block any user access to the portal Cuevana for the series  ''Falling Skies'', ''BRIC'' and ''26 people to save the world''. The measure requires companies that provide Internet web links block that provides the gateway to such series under penalty to impose a fine of 1000 pesos daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1428736-la-justicia-pidio-bloquear-el-acceso-a-series-en-cuevana|title=La Justicia pidió bloquear el acceso a series en Cuevana|publisher=[[La Nación (Argentina)|La Nación]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 2, 2011, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) '''''Telecentro SA de Argentina''''' would have completely blocked the entry of customers to the site Cuevana invoking the precautionary measure, the total blockade would not have lasted more than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redusers.com/noticias/telecentro-habria-censurado-a-cuevana-comunicado-del-sitio/|title=Telecentro habría censurado a Cuevana|publisher= RedUSERS|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortunaweb.com.ar/2011-12-02-74001-telecentro-bloquea-a-cuevana-por-la-medida-cautelar/|title=Telecentro dio marcha atrás con bloqueo a Cuevana|publisher=FortunaWeb|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">'''Customary law in Australia''' relates to the systems and practices amongst [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australians]] which have developed over time from accepted moral norms in Aboriginal societies, and which regulate human behaviour, mandate specific sanctions for non-compliance, and connect people with the land and with each other, through a system of relationships.&lt;ref name=lrcwa_2005_7&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/P/project_94.aspx|title=Aboriginal Customary Laws (Project 94) - Discussion Paper Overview|author=[[Law Reform Commission of Western Australia]]|publisher=Quality Press|page=7|date=February 2006|isbn=1-74035-056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customary laws are passed on by word of mouth and are not codified (nor can they be easily codified). In addition, they are not singular throughout Australia — different language groups and clans have different concepts of customary law, and what applies within one group or region cannot be assumed to be universal.&lt;ref name=alrc_1986_24&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/24.%20The%20Proof%20of%20Aboriginal%20Customary%20Laws/proof-aboriginal-customary-laws-australian-e|title=Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws (ALRC Report 31)|author=[[Australian Law Reform Commission]]|date=12 June 1986|chapter=24.

Historically, customary law has not been recognised as part of the canon of Australian law. But, since the late twentieth century, the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] (1986) and the [[Law Reform Commission of Western Australia]] (2005) have written extensive reports investigating the desirability of recognising the role of customary law in legal situations involving Aboriginal Australians. In the [[Northern Territory]], some statutes and courts make explicit reference to customary law where such is useful in identifying relationships or social expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NT|act|cwa208|Community Welfare Act 1983|69}}; {{cite Legislation AU|NT|num_act|sacla20041o2005484|Sentencing Amendment (Aboriginal Customary Law) Act 2004|4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes have not been without controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1994|litigants=Walker v New South Wales |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1994) 182 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 45 |date=16 December 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|42|1993|litigants=Coe v Commonwealth |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially  in cases where customary law is either imprecise, or infringes upon [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1642802.htm|title=High Court rejects customary law defence in sexual abuse case|work=[[The World Today (ABC Radio)|The World Today]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=19 May 2006|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Design and Artists Copyright Society''' (DACS) is a UK [[not-for-profit]] [[Copyright collective|rights management]] organisation that exists to collect and distribute [[royalties]] to [[visual artists]]. 

It works to ensure that [[visual artists]]’ [[copyright]] and related rights are protected and that these rights are recognised both financially and morally. 

DACS was established in 1984 and since being founded&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dacs.org.uk/DACSO/media/DACSDocs/reports-and-submissions/DACS-Annual-Review-2016.pdf|title=DACS Annual Review, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it has distributed £100 million in royalties to visual artists and artists' estates through its services. DACS retains a percentage of the royalties it collects and distributes on behalf of artists to cover its not-for-profit organisational costs. It represents 100,000 visual artists and artists’ estates worldwide through an international network of [[Copyright_collective|collecting societies]]. DACS is a member of [[Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs|CISAC]] (Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisac.org/CisacPortal/afficherArticles.do?numRubrique=4/ CISAC Member Societies List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406090757/http://www.cisac.org/CisacPortal/afficherArticles.do?numRubrique=4%2F |date=6 April 2012 }}. ROLLET, Marianne (CISAC). Validated 2011-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
DACS was founded in 1984 by a group of [[artists]] and [[lawyers]] who identified that there was a need for an organisation to manage visual artist’s [[copyright]] in the UK, to ensure that they were fairly remunerated and their rights respected. 

Copyright [[Licensing]] is the organisation’s longest running service where DACS acts as an agent on behalf of visual artists and their estates to manage requests to reproduce their work. Royalties are paid to artists and estates through this service four times a year. 25% of the monies collected are retained by DACS for administration costs.

In 2001, DACS launched a new collective [[licensing]] service for visual artists. Known as Payback, this service distributes a share of revenue generated through various UK collective licensing schemes back to visual artists. Visual artists whose work has been reproduced in UK publications and on certain UK television channels are entitled to a share of this revenue. Artists are required to submit a claim to DACS between [https://www.dacs.org.uk/for-artists/payback January and May] and royalties are then paid in the Autumn to successful claimants.

On 14 February 2006, and following a [[European Directive]], visual artists in the UK benefited from the Artist's Resale Right ([[Droit de suite]]) for the first time. This Right entitles artists to a portion of the sale price when their work is resold through an [[auction house]], [[art gallery]] or [[art dealer]], however there are certain conditions which govern an artist’s entitlement to benefit from this Right. DACS collects resale royalties on behalf of its artist members and those that do not join another collecting society. The Artist's Resale Right was fully implemented in the UK on 1 January  2012 also entitling artist's heirs and beneficiaries to a resale royalty. DACS retains 15% of the royalties collected from UK sales. They do not retain anything for royalties collected from overseas sales.

In 2014, DACS launched its newest service called [https://www.artimage.org.uk/ Artimage], which complements the organisation's Copyright Licensing service by making artists' images available for licensing via a dedicated website. 

==Governance==
DACS is governed by a [https://www.dacs.org.uk/about-us/governance/board-of-directors board of directors]. They include both artists and lawyers as well as other professionals who are responsible for the overall performance of the organisation. [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)]] CBE, of Howard Kennedy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsilaw.com/|title=London Law FirmHoward Kennedy|website=www.fsilaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been Chair of the Board of Directors since 2011. 

DACS reintroduced Voting membership in 2014. All Voting members are eligible to attend DACS’ Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and vote on matters of the company, for example to appoint or remove a Board Director, to approve their financial documentation or other governance matters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6480">The '''Disarmament of the German Jews''' started in 1933, initially limited to local areas. A major target was Berlin, where large-scale raids in search for weaponry took place. Starting in 1936, the [[Gestapo]] prohibited German police offices from giving [[firearms license]]s to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Dietrich Adam: ''Judenpolitik im Dritten Reich.''&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1938, the ''Verordnung gegen den [[Gun control|Waffenbesitz]] der Juden'' prohibited the possession of Firearms and bladed weapons by Jews.

== Weimar Republic ==
The legal foundations that the [[National Socialists]] later used for the purpose of disarming the Jews were already laid during the Weimar Republic. Starting with the ''Reichsgesetz über Schusswaffen und Munition ''(Reich law on firearms and ammunition), enacted on 12 April 1928, weapon purchase permits were introduced, which only allowed "authorized persons" the purchase and possession of firearms. Mandatory registration of weapons was introduced, which gave the government the opportunity of accessing weapon owner and their weapons at any given time. Manufacture and sale of weapons was only permitted if authorized so. The purpose was to ensure that firearms were only issued to "reliable individuals". Starting in 1930, bladed weapons were also regulated. The carrying of weapons in public now required a weapons permit.

== Takeover of the National Socialists ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H26763,_Berlin,_Razzia_im_Scheunenviertel.jpg|thumb|Police raid in the [[Scheunenviertel]] (Berlin 1933). Residents of a house on  Grenadier-Street are searched for weapons, and have their permits checked.]]
Immediately following the „[[Nazi seizure of power|Machtergreifung]]“ in 1933, the weapon laws of the Weimar Republic were used to disarm Jews, or to use the excuse of "searching for weapons" as a justification for raids and searches of homes. Because the weapons law of 1928 gave the police the authority to issue or withdraw weapon permits, Jewish weapon owners were disarmed through warrants issued by the police. For instance, the president of the police of Breslau enacted an order on 21 April 1933 which stated that Jews had to give their weapons and shooting permits to the police immediately. After the Jewish population was judged as not to be trusted, no weapon permits were issued to them.&lt;ref name="halbrook2001"&gt;Halbrook 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapons law was also used for searches of homes and raids. The preface for that was the allegation that the victims of these searches stored large amounts of weapons and ammunition. A prominent example is [[Albert Einstein]], whose summer residence in [[Caputh, Brandenburg|Caputh]], near the [[Schwielowsee]] was searched in spring 1933. The only item found there was a [[bread knife]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brian: ''Einstein - Sein Leben''.&lt;/ref&gt; Raids, for instance on 4 April 1933 at the [[Scheunenviertel]] in [[Berlin]], also took place. Not only many weapons were found, but also a lot of publications that included criticism of the [[Third Reich]]. Sometimes, Jews without residence permits were also found and arrested.

Starting in 1935, the [[Gestapo]] prevented the issue of weapon permits and weapon purchase permits to Jews.&lt;ref name="halbrook2001"/&gt; The police authorities were the executing authorities, and had to comply with the orders issued by the Gestapo. The self-defense of Jews was abolished and they were subjected to the arbitrariness and terror of the police authorities, without the need to introduce a new law for this.

== Weapons law and act of 1938 ==
In 1938, the national socialists reformed weapons law thoroughly. Today, the ''Waffengesetz'' of 18 March 1938 (RGBl I, 265) is sometimes seen as a relaxation of existing regulations, even though it solely benefited privileged members of the [[NSDAP]] and its associated organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Steindorf: ''Kurzkommentar zum Waffenrecht'', Verlag C.H. Beck 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The law stated that certain groups of NSDAP officials did not need any permit anymore for weapons possession. Amongst them were ''Unterführer'' of the NSDAP, starting from'' Ortsgruppenleiter'', the [[Sturmabteilung]], the [[Schutzstaffel]], the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] and also the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler youth]], starting at'' Bannführer''. The new weapons law also prohibited the possession of any weapons to certain groups of people, namely [[Gypsies]] and all individuals who lost their "Civil Honors" or who were under supervision of the police. The latter also included people convicted due to homosexuality.

Directly after the [[Kristallnacht]], the possession of any weapons by Jews was prohibited through the ''Verordnung gegen den Waffenbesitz der Juden'', enacted on 11 November 1938 (RGBl. I, 1573).

A contemporary report of the apostolic nuntius of Berlin to [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]] about the Kristallnacht stated: „Also, all weapons were taken from the Jews; and even though the purpose of that was altogether different, it was good, because the ideation of suicide must have been enormous in some.“&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Heim (publ.): Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945. Band 2: Deutsches Reich 1938 - August 1939. München 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-486-58523-0}}, S. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Judicial Network (EJN)''' is a network of contact points within the EU designed to facilitate judicial cooperation across borders.&lt;ref name="about EJN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_StaticPage.aspx?Bread=2|title=About EJN|publisher=European Judicial Network (EJN)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/judicial-cooperation/european-network/index_en.htm|title=Criminal Justice: European Judicial Network|publisher=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a focus on serious crime (such as organized crime, corruption, drug smuggling and terrorism), it helps form and maintain contacts between agencies in member states.&lt;ref name="poderjudicial.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Temas/Redes-Judiciales/Otras-redes-judiciales/Criminal-European-Judicial-Network|title=Criminal European Judicial Network|publisher=[[General Council of the Judiciary]] (Spain)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Network was created by Joint Action 98/428 in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31998F0428|title=98/428/JHA: Joint Action of 29 June 1998|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fulfil recommendation no. 21 of the Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime adopted by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 28 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A51997XG0815|title=Action plan to combat organized crime (Adopted by the Council on 28 April 1997)|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority of the EJN is the dissemination of information to its citizens, judges and legal practitioners, primarily through its Web site. The EJN’s main functions are: Facilitating judicial cooperation among the Member States; travelling to meet the contact points of other State Members, as necessary; providing the local judicial authorities of their country with the necessary legal and practical information; providing the local judicial authorities of other member states the necessary legal and practical information; improving the coordination of the judicial cases. 

A member state’s Contact Point can identify relevant other Contact Points via the European Justice Atlas.&lt;ref name="poderjudicial.es"/&gt;

The secretariat of the EJN functions as an independent autonomous unit within the staff of [[Eurojust]], based in [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_Secretariat.aspx|title=EJN Secretariat|publisher=European Judicial Network (EJN)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Telecommunications Institute''' (abbreviated as '''IFT''' and incorrectly referred to as '''IFETEL''') is an independent government agency of [[Mexico]] charged with the regulation of telecommunications and broadcasting services. It was formed on September 10, 2013, as part of larger reforms to Mexican telecom regulations, and replaced the [[Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Mexico)|Federal Telecommunications Commission]] (Cofetel).

The current President of the IFT is Gabriel Oswaldo Contreras Saldívar.

==History==
On August 8, 1996, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] created Cofetel, which originally was based in the tower of the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]].

In 2013, President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] created the IFT to replace Cofetel as part of the telecommunications reform package of the [[Pact for Mexico|Pacto por México]]. The IFT is an autonomous federal agency that is responsible for the regulation of the use of spectrum, telecommunications and broadcasting networks and offerings, and access to infrastructure. IFT also regulates the awarding of concessions and permits for broadcast stations and promotes and protects competition in telecommunications.

Through an agreement with [[PROFECO]], the IFT also handles user comments and complaints for communications services.

== Organization ==
The IFT is headed by a board of seven commissioners, including a Chair. They are each nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

The sitting commissioners are:
* [[Gabriel Oswaldo Contreras Saldívar]] (Chairman)
* [[Adriana Sofía Labardini Inzunza]]
* [[María Elena Estavillo Flores]]
* [[Mario Germán Fromow Rangel]]
* [[Adolfo Cuevas Teja]]
* [[Ernesto Estrada González]]
* [[Javier Juárez Mojica]]

== Mexican telecommunications reform 2015-16 (Red Compartida) ==
[[Red Compartida]] (Red Shared) is the official name of the network that will result from the Mexican Government's 2014-2016 effort to overhaul its telecommunications industry by introducing competition into the marketplace. If successful, the Red Compartida network will be the first fully wholesale mobile network deployed anywhere in the world.

=== Background ===
America Movil, the company owned by Carlos Slim, Mexico's richest man&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/carlos-slim-helu/|title=Carlos Slim Helu &amp; family|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has long held a monopoly in the telecommunications marketplace in Mexico. In July 2014, it was reported in Forbes Magazine that Slim controlled 80% of Mexico’s landline market and 70% of the wireless market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2014/07/09/in-a-surprising-move-mexican-billionaire-carlos-slim-to-sell-telecom-assets-in-compliance-with-new-anti-trust-rules/#2d123efe2624|title=In A Surprising Move, Mexican Billionaire Carlos Slim To Sell Telecom Assets In Compliance With New Anti-Trust Rules|last=Estevez|first=Dolia|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', Mexican consumers have long been complaining at the “high costs and spotty service” provided by Slim’s companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-telecom-slim-20140709-story.html|title=Mexico telecom overhaul passes, billionaire Carlos Slim loses -- maybe|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Slim has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices – for example, using his control over the telecommunications infrastructure to charge prohibitive connection fees to competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/103114/how-carlos-slim-built-his-fortune.asp|title=How Carlos Slim Built His Fortune|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|date=2014-10-31|language=English|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2014, the Mexican Government passed wide-ranging telecommunications reforms, designed to abolish long-distance phone charges, make it easier for customers to switch phone companies, and broaden access to free-to-air television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21606875-carlos-slims-reaction-telecoms-reforms-shows-they-must-be-biting-slimming-down|title=Slimming down|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Slim announced that he would reduce his market share substantially, and announced plans to sell off America Movil assets worth up to 7 billion dollars.

Under the new laws, the Mexican telecommunications regulator was required to establish a wholesale-only wireless network — a "carrier's carrier" that will sell mobile-network capacity to all comers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capx.co/from-oligopoly-to-competition-the-story-of-mexicos-telecom-reform/|title=From oligopoly to competition: the story of Mexico’s telecom reform - CapX|date=2015-06-23|language=English|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the regulator announced the Red Compartida initiative.

=== Wholesale network ===
The Red Compartida network will be “wholesale only”. This means that the company which builds and operates the network will not be involved in providing mobile service to consumers. Instead, the operator will provide access to the network to mobile operators, who will in turn use the network capacity to provide a consumer mobile product. Access to the network for these operators will be sold to the highest bidder in regular auctions.

The advantage of a wholesale only network is that many new entrants can enter the Mexican consumer market at once. The cost of building a mobile network is prohibitive and requires billions of dollars in capital outlay. By providing the infrastructure through a wholesale only network, the cost of offering a new consumer service to Mexican customers will be significantly reduced.

The Mexican Government expects the construction of the wholesale network, and the resultant entry of new providers to the Mexican market to generate 13 billion dollars of Foreign Direct Investment over a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tecma.com/mexican-telecommunications-infrastructure-anticipated-benefiting-from-significant-flows-of-fdi/|title=Mexican telecommunications infrastructure anticipated benefiting from significant flows of FDI - TECMA|date=2016-03-02|language=English|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International reaction ===
The Red Compartida project received international recognition at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in 2016. An award was given to Mexico for its efforts in the area of “Governmental Leadership.” According to Monica Aspe, Mexico’s sub-secretary for telecommunications and transport, receipt of recognition in this area was a landmark telecommunications development in her country. She explained that, in the past, “European countries and China were almost solely the recipients of this award.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tecma.com/mexican-telecommunications-infrastructure-anticipated-benefiting-from-significant-flows-of-fdi/|title=Mexican telecommunications infrastructure anticipated benefiting from significant flows of FDI - TECMA|date=2016-03-02|language=English|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the giant US provider AT&amp;T, which has in recent years invested 4.4 billion dollars in Mexico, was reported to be “particularly discomfited” with the project, especially since as an existing operator, they would be barred from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capx.co/mexicos-wireless-giants-dont-want-to-share/|title=Mexico's wireless giants don't want to share - CapX|date=2015-10-09|language=English|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antitrust requirements ===
The Mexican Government requires that any bidder planning to construct the Red Compartida Network demonstrate that they have no ties whatever to any mobile service provider already operating in Mexico.

=== Timetable ===
An announcement awarding the project to the successful bidder is expected in October 2016.

=== Potential bidders ===
Irish-American firm [[Rivada Networks]] has announced that it will bid to build the Red Compartida network.  Several other companies are believed to be considering bids.

==Political work==
In 2008, the group attempted to convince Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] not to allow an Executive Order signed by former Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] that protected LGBT employees from discrimination in Louisiana to lapse. However, the Governor stated that he did not feel renewal of the Executive Order was necessary.&lt;ref name="advocate808"&gt;{{cite news | title=Jindal to let gay bias order die | work=The Advocate | date=August 21, 2008 | author=Ballard, Mark | location=Baton Rouge, LA | pages=01A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, The Forum met with Louisiana's state Council on Marriage and the Family, a body appointed by conservative Republican Governor Jindal. The video presentation was intended to make the case for easing legal restrictions that bar LGBT families from adopting children in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="adopting children"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ksla.com/Global/story.asp?S=10861417 | title=Gay adoption debate discussed at LA Capitol | work=KSLA | date=August 6, 2009 | accessdate=December 28, 2014 | author=Spunt, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision was to maintain the status quo, which the Forum considered to be a compromise.

[[File:Kornblume.jpeg|thumb|250px|A blue [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflower]], the symbol of the pan-Germanist movement in Austria]]

'''German nationalism''' ({{lang-de|Deutschnationalismus}}) is a political ideology and historical current in [[politics of Austria|Austrian politics]]. It arose in the 19th century as a [[nationalist]] movement amongst the German-speaking population of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It favours close ties with Germany, which it views as the nation-state for all [[ethnic Germans]], and the possibility of the incorporation of Austria into a [[German question|Greater Germany]].

Over the course of Austrian history, from the [[Austrian Empire]], to [[Austria-Hungary]], and the [[Republic of Austria (1919–1934)|First]] and the [[Second Austrian Republic|Second]] Austrian Republics, several political parties and groups have expressed pan-German nationalist sentiment. [[National liberalism|National liberal]] and pan-Germanist parties have been termed the "Third Camp" ({{lang-de|Drittes Lager}}) of Austrian politics, as they have traditionally been ranked behind mainstream Catholic conservatives and socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephan |last=Kamps |title=Die Freiheitlichen – Nazistische Reinkarnation oder politische Erneuerung? |publisher=GRIN Verlag |year=2007 |language=German |pages=27–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_QT85LZB0oC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=9783638715454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Voithofer |title=Drum schliesst Euch frisch an Deutschland an&amp;nbsp;.. |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=2000 |language=German |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_epwaB5q98C&amp;pg=PA57 |isbn=9783205992226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom Party of Austria]], a [[far-right]] political party with representation in the [[Austrian parliament]], has pan-Germanist roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Anton |last=Pelinka |authorlink=Anton Pelinka |title=Jörg Haiders "Freiheitliche" – ein nicht nur österreichisches Problem |work=Liberalismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2000 |language=German |page=233 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWmudq4s4GAC&amp;pg=PA233 |isbn=9783826015540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], both pan-Germanism and the idea of [[Anschluss|political union with Germany]] were discredited by their association with [[Nazism]], and by the rising tide of a civic [[Austrians|Austrian national identity]].

Within the context of rising ethnic nationalism during the 19th century in the territories of the multi-ethnic Austrian Empire, the "German National Movement" ({{lang-de|Deutschnationale Bewegung}}) sought the creation of a [[Greater Germany]], along with the implementation of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] and [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] policies, in an attempt to entrench the German ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="DPSO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions of 1848]], many ethnic groups under imperial rule, including the Serbs,  Czechs, Italians, Croats, Slovenes, and Poles, amongst others, demanded political, economic, and cultural equality. Traditionally, the German-speaking population of the Empire enjoyed societal privileges dating back to the reign of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], and that of her son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. German was considered the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Empire, and Empire's elite consisted primarily of German-speakers.&lt;ref name="DIa"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=fKpnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=isbn:0582353939&amp;dq=isbn:0582353939 | title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 1867–1918 | publisher=Longman | author=John W.

After the Austrian defeat in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] of 1866, and the [[Unification of Germany|unification]] of what was then known as "[[German question|Lesser Germany]]" under [[Prussia]]n stewardship in 1871, the German Austrians in the Austro-Hungarian Empire felt that they had wrongly been excluded from the German [[nation-state]], whilst other ethnicities within the Empire were tearing at its fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Ursprünge, Anfänge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&amp;pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict between Germans and Czechs grew particularly tense in 1879, when minister-president [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Viscount Taaffe]] did not include the [[German-Liberal Party]] ({{lang-de|Deutschliberale Partei}}) in the government of [[Cisleithania]]. This party was considered the main representative of the German-speaking [[Bourgeoisie|middle class]], and as such, the German National Movement went on to accuse the Party of not fighting for the rights of German-speakers within the Empire. The "German School League" ({{lang-de|Deutscher Schulverein}}) was formed in 1880 to protect German-language schools in parts of the Empire where German speakers were a minority.&lt;ref name="G&amp;E"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHAcEB8jh1AC |first= Arnold |last=Suppan |title=′Germans′ in the Habsburg Empire: Language, Imperial Ideology, National Identity and Assimilation | work=The Germans and the East | publisher=Purdue University Press | year=2008 | page=171 | isbn=1557534438|editor1-last=Ingrao |editor1-first=Charles W. |editor2-last=Szabo |editor2-first=Franz A.

[[File:VonSchoenerer.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Georg von Schönerer: radical pan-Germanist, and founder of the Deutschnationaler Verein (German-National Association)]]

A consortium of German nationalist groups and intellectuals published the [[Linz Program of 1882|Linz Program]] in 1882, which demanded the recognition of German predominance in the Empire, along with the complete [[Germanisation]] of the Empire. This manifesto was signed by the radical German nationalist [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer|Georg von Schönerer]], Vienna's populist, pro-Catholic, and royalist mayor [[Karl Lueger]], and the Jewish [[social democrat]] [[Victor Adler]].&lt;ref name="Bideleux"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A history of eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=355 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuW7T8wfNGAC&amp;pg=PA355 |isbn=9780415161121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse signatories of the Linz manifesto split ideologically after Schönerer revised it to add an "[[Aryan paragraph]]" in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Michael |last=Wladika |title=Hitlers Vätergeneration: Die Ursprünge des Nationalsozialismus in der k.u.k.

Schönerer founded the "German-National Association" (Deutschnationaler Verein), and later, in 1891, the "Pan-German Society". He demanded the annexation of all German-speaking territories of [[Austria-Hungary]] to the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] and rejected any form of Austrian pan-ethnic identity. His radical racist German nationalism was especially popular amongst the well-educated [[intelligentsia]]: professors, grammar school teachers, and students. School administrations tried to counteract these sentiments by encouraging civic pride, along with a "[[cult of personality]]" around the [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor]], but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. Vienna mayor Karl Lueger even tried to dismiss all "Schönerians" from city school administrations, but this too failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Karl |last=Klambauer |title=(...) ein in begeisterter Verehrung ergebener Unterthan! |work=Der Forschende Blick: Beiträge zur Geschichte Österreichs im 20.

[[File:Ludwig Grillich7.jpg|thumb|180px|Karl Lueger, an Austrian populist who espoused antisemitic and German nationalist notions]]

Members of the pan-German movement wore blue [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflowers]], known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in their buttonholes, along with [[cockades]] in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Eva |last=Giloi |title=Monarchy, Myth, and Material Culture in Germany 1750–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both symbols were temporarily banned in Austrian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Daniel L. |last=Unowsky |title=The Pomp and Politics of Patriotism: Imperial Celebrations in Habsburg Austria, 1848–1916 |publisher=Purdue University Press |year=2005 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Schönerer, many Austrians hoped for an ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany.{{sfn|Low|1974|p=14}} However, although many Austrians accepted the ideas of the various pan-German movements and felt part of the German nation, they accepted the existence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were loyal to the [[Habsburg dynasty]], and wanted to preserve the sovereignty of Austria.{{sfn|Low|1974|p=15}}

German nationalists protested vehemently against minister-president [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Count Badeni]]'s language decree of 1897, which made German and Czech co-official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages. This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire Czechs, because most educated Czechs knew German, but not the other way around. The support of [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the "[[Away from Rome]]" ({{lang-de|Los-von-Rom}}) movement, which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on "German" Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suppan |title=′Germans′ in the Habsburg Empire | work=The Germans and the East | year=2008 | pages=164, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s, the pan-Germanist movement was fragmented into several splinter parties and factions. The most radical was the [[German Workers' Party (Austria-Hungary)|German Workers' Party]], formed in 1903, which later transformed into the Austrian wing of the [[Austrian National Socialism|Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Dgros"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yheSqWHjExYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=die+grossen+Erzählungen+der+Politik:+politische+Kultur+und+Parteien+in+Österreich+von+der+Jahrhundertwende+bis+1945#v=onepage&amp;q=die%20grossen%20Erzählungen%20der%20Politik%3A%20politische%20Kultur%20und%20Parteien%20in%20Österreich%20von%20der%20Jahrhundertwende%20bis%201945&amp;f=false | title=Die grossen Erzählungen der Politik: politische Kultur und Parteien in Österreich von der Jahrhundertwende bis 1945 | publisher=Böhlau Verlag Wien | author=Robert Kriechbaumer | year=2001 | isbn=3-205-99400-0 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pan-Germanist parties that contested elections during the first decade of the 20th century include the [[German People's Party (Austria)|German People's Party]] and the [[German Radical Party]].  A broad coalition of all ethnic German national and liberal political parties known as the ''[[Deutscher Nationalverband]]'' (lit. German National Association) was formed to contest the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1911|1911 election]] to the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].&lt;ref name="Dnac"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.d/d331764.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en | title=Deutscher Nationalverband | work=Encyclopedia of Austria | accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NDad"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFQyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The New Austrian Reichsrath | work=The Nation | date=3 August 1911 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | pages=92–93 | volume=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to gain the most seats in lower house of the Council, the House of Deputies ({{lang-de|Abgeordnetenhaus}}), replacing the previously dominant [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref name="G&amp;E2"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHAcEB8jh1AC | title=The Germans and the East | publisher=Purdue University Press | year=2008 | pages=165 | isbn=1557534438|editor1-last=Ingrao |editor1-first=Charles W. |editor2-last=Szabo |editor2-first=Franz A.

==Dissolution of Austria-Hungary (1918–1919)==
[[File:GermanAustriaMap.png|Areas claimed by the ''Republic of German Austria''. These represent areas of the former Empire with majority-German populations.|left|thumb|400px]]
After the end of the [[First World War]], which saw the collapse of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], German-speaking parts of the former Empire established a new republic under the name "[[German Austria]]" ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Österreich}}). The republic was proclaimed on the principle of [[self-determination]], which had been enshrined within American president [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ''[[Fourteen Points]]''.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |language=German|title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: Böhmen und Mähren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_Bö.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A provisional national assembly was convened on 11 November, at which the Republic of German Austria was proclaimed. The assembly drafted a constitution that stated that "German Austria is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "German Austria is a component of the German Republic" (Article 2). This phrase referenced the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]] in the former lands of the [[German Empire]], and intended to unite German-speaking Austrians with the German nation-state, completing the [[Greater Germany]] plan. [[Plebiscite]]s held in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] yielded majorities of 98% and 99% respectively in favour of unification with Germany.

Despite this, the victors of the First World War, who drafted the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], strictly forbid any attempt by German Austria to unify with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html |title=Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria; Protocol, Declaration and Special Declaration [1920&amp;#93; ATS 3 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also gave some lands that had been claimed by German Austria to newly formed nation-states. An example of this was the giving of the provinces of [[German Bohemia]] and the [[Province of the Sudetenland|Sudetenland]] to the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovak Republic]]. These lands, having German-speaking majorities, were prevented from being within their own nation-state. Instead, they were trapped in the nation-states of other ethnicities.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; This grievance would play a fundamental part in the rise of pan-Germanism during the [[Interwar period]]. [[Karl Renner]], a member of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party]], served as [[Chancellor of Austria|chancellor]] of German Austria. Renner himself was a proponent of the idea of "Greater Germany", and penned the unofficial anthem ''[[Deutschösterreich, du herrliches Land]]'' ("German Austria, you wonderful country").&lt;ref name="amk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EDT"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vQqNAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=3203508974&amp;dq=3203508974 | title=Ein deutscher Traum | publisher=Europaverlag | author=Ernst Panzenböck | year=1985 | isbn=3-203-50897-4 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renner was born in southern [[Moravia]], which was one of the lands claimed by German Austria, but instead given to the Czecho-Slovak Republic. Despite his background, however, he signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain on 10 September 1919, which established the Allied-drawn borders of the new Austrian republic, and formally forbid any attempt to unify the German-speaking lands of the former Austria-Hungary with Germany.&lt;ref name="amk"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-dmH7FjxassC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0520049551#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Austrian Mind: An Intellectual and Social History, 1848–1938 | publisher=University of California Press | author=[[William M.

==During the First Republic and Austrofascist period (1919–1938)==
During the [[First Austrian Republic]], pan-Germanists were represented by the [[Greater German People's Party]] and the agrarian [[Landbund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Bruce F. |last=Pauley |title=From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=1998 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFdSsmxFl7sC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=greater+german+people%27s+party#v=onepage&amp;q=greater%20german%20people%27s%20party&amp;f=false|isbn=9780807847138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Gernot |last=Stimmer |title=Eliten in Österreich |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=1997 |language=German |page=648 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SNcTu7owGb8C&amp;pg=PA648&amp;dq=gro%C3%9Fdeutsche+volkspartei#v=onepage&amp;q=gro%C3%9Fdeutsche%20volkspartei&amp;f=false|isbn=9783205985877 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their voters to the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]]. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.
[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|187px|[[Adolf Hitler]], dictator of [[Nazi Germany]], was born in Austria and propagated radical German nationalist views]]
One of the foundational problems of the First Republic was that those who had supported the concept of a democratic republic from the German Austria period onward, such as the Social Democrats, did not consider themselves "Austrian", but instead were German nationalists.&lt;ref name="hm3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Habsburg monarchy, 1809–1918: a history of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=[[A.

In the words of historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], "The democrats were not 'Austrian'; the 'Austrians' were not democrats."&lt;ref name="hm3"/&gt; These two groups, the German nationalist democrats, and the Austrian nationalist conservatives, would squabble throughout the first decade of the First Republic. Ultimately, the Austrian nationalist faction would overthrow the democratic republic in 1934 and establish [[Federal State of Austria|a regime]] rooted in "[[Austrofascism]]" under the protection of [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref name="hm3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSe"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&amp;dq=he+Dollfuss/Schuschnigg+Era+in+Austria:+A+Reassessment |first=Peter |last=Berger |title=The League of Nations and Interwar Austria: Critical Assessment of a Partnership in Economic Reconstruction |work=The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria: A Reassessment |series=Contemporary Austrian Studies |volume=11 | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=2003 | location=New Brunswick, New Jersey | page=87 | isbn=1-4128-2189-4

While most of right-wing ''[[Heimwehr]]en'' paramilitary groups active during the First Republic were rooted in [[Austrian nationalism]], and either affiliated with the conservative Christian Socials, or inspired by [[Italian Fascism]], there was also a German nationalist faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Robert |last=Kriechbaumer |title=Österreich! und Front Heil!: Aus den Akten des Generalsekretariats der Vaterländischen Front – Innenansichten eines Regimes |publisher=Böhlau |year=2005 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This faction was most notable within the [[Styria]]n ''Heimatschutz'' ("homeland protection"). Its leader, [[Walter Pfrimer]], attempted a [[putsch]] against a Christian Social government in September 1931. The putsch was directly modelled on the Benito Mussolini's [[March on Rome]], but failed almost instantly due to lack of support from other ''Heimwehr'' groups. Pfrimer subsequently founded the "German ''Heimatschutz''", which would later merge into the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Martina |last=Aicher |chapter=Heimwehren (Österreich) |title=Organisationen, Institutionen, Bewegungen |series=Handbuch des Antisemitismus |volume=5 |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2012 |page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an ''Anschluss'' (union between Austria and Germany to form a [[Greater Germany]]), was one of the principle ideas of the Austrian branch of the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialist]] (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Bruce F. |last=Pauley |title=From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=1998 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFdSsmxFl7sC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=greater+german+people%27s+party#v=onepage&amp;q=greater%20german%20people%27s%20party&amp;f=false|isbn=9780807847138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945 |last= Morgan |first= Philip |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 0-415-16942-9 |page= 72 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVGAZJWJOWkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Thomas |last=Dostal |title=Das 'braune Netzwerk' in Linz: Die illegalen nationalsozialistischen Aktivitäten zwischen 1933 und 1938 |work=Nationalsozialismus in Linz |volume=1 |publisher=Archiv der Stadt Linz |year=2002 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis firmly fought the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] regime of chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], and orchestrated his assassination. They continued this battle against his successor, [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. Austrofacism was strongly supported by [[Benito Mussolini]], leader of [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Fascist Italy]]. Mussolini's support for an independent Austria can be seen in a discussion he had with Prince [[Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg]], an important Austrian nationalist and Heimwehr leader. He said that "an Anschluss with Germany must never be permitted&amp;nbsp;... Austria is necessary to the maintenance of Europe&amp;nbsp;... the day that Austria falls and is swallowed up by Germany will mark the beginning of European chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7SWt-F9wbr0C&amp;q=Between+Hitler+and+Mussolini&amp;dq=Between+Hitler+and+Mussolini | title=Between Hitler and Mussolini | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers | author=Ernst Rüdiger, Prince of Starhemberg | year=1942 | location=London | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrofascist party, [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]], would echo the sentiments of Mussolini, and continue to struggle for an independent Austria. Nazis in both Germany and Austria intended that the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] would quickly annex Austria, the homeland of its leader, [[Adolf Hitler]]. They attempted to bribe many low-ranking [[Heimwehr]] leaders, and also attempted to bring Starhemberg into their fold, in effect merging the Heimwehr with the Nazi [[Freikorps]].&lt;ref name=BHM2&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7SWt-F9wbr0C&amp;q=Between+Hitler+and+Mussolini&amp;dq=Between+Hitler+and+Mussolini | title=Between Hitler and Mussolini | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers | author=Ernst Rüdiger, Prince of Starhemberg | year=1942 | location=London | pages=36–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregor Strasser]], an early, prominent Nazi figure, was charged with this effort. When Starhemberg, a fervent believer in an independent Austria, rejected his merger proposal, Strasser said "Don't talk to me about Austria. There is no Austria&amp;nbsp;... there was once a living corpse which called itself Austria&amp;nbsp;... that this Austria collapsed in 1918 was a blessing&amp;nbsp;... particularly for the German people, who were thereby given the chance to create a Greater Germany."&lt;ref name=BHM2/&gt;

After this, tensions between the Nazis and Austrofascists worsened, culminating in the [[July Putsch]] of 1934, when Nazis attempted to overthrow the government. Whilst they managed to assassinate chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], the putsch was quickly crushed by the police, army, and Heimwehren. In the aftermath of the putsch, conflict between the Social Democrats and the ruling Austrofascists led to the [[Austrian Civil War]] later in the year. After their defeat, the Social Democratic Party was outlawed entirely. This, in tandem with a continued a campaign of violence and propaganda by the Nazis, destabilised the Austrofascist regime, and rallied many to support the idea of ''[[Anschluss]]''.&lt;ref name="OSe"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Österreich.html?id=PAHLAAAACAAJ | title=Österreich: eine tausendjährige Geschichte | publisher=Heyne | author=Gordon Brook-Shepherd | year=2000 | isbn=3-453-16343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nazi campaign was ultimately successful, and Hitler would go on to annex Austria in 1938 with the ''Anschluss''. Hitler's journey through his home country Austria became a triumphal tour that reached its climax in [[Vienna]] on 15 March 1938, when around 200,000 cheering German Austrians gathered around the ''[[Heldenplatz]]'' (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler say that "The oldest eastern province of the German people shall be, from this point on, the newest bastion of the German Reich"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gFb2-sYf6XIC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq='The+oldest+eastern+...+German+people+shall+be,+from+this+point+on,+the+newest+bastion+of+the+German+Reich#v=onepage&amp;q='The%20oldest%20eastern%20...%20German%20people%20shall%20be%2C%20from%20this%20point%20on%2C%20the%20newest%20bastion%20of%20the%20German%20Reich&amp;f=false|page=184|title=The German Myth of the East: 1800 to the Present|first=Vejas Gabriel|last=Liulevicius|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=9780191610462}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by his "greatest accomplishment" (completing the annexing of Austria to form a Greater German Reich) by saying: "As leader and chancellor of the German nation and Reich I announce to German history now the entry of my homeland into the German Reich."&lt;ref&gt;In German: "Als Führer und Kanzler der deutschen Nation und des Reiches melde ich vor der deutschen Geschichte nunmehr den Eintritt meiner Heimat in das Deutsche Reich."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.film.data.film/f107a.mpg|title=Video: Hitler proclaims Austria's inclusion in the Reich (2 MB)|accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Anschluss'', Hitler remarked as a personal note: "I, myself, as Führer and Chancellor, will be happy to walk on the soil of the country that is my home as a free German citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Giblin|title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler|year=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-395-90371-8|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Toland|title=Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-87277-2|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler responded to the foreign press regarding the ''Anschluss'' by saying: "Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators."&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''Anschluss'', the historical aim of the German nationalists who supported the union between Austria and Germany was completed.&lt;ref name="Bideleux"/&gt; The pan-Germanists were then fully absorbed into the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).&lt;ref name="Pelinka"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Anton |last=Pelinka |title=Die FPÖ im internationalen Vergleich: Zwischen Rechtspopulismus, Deutschnationalismus und Österreich-Patriotismus |journal=Conflict &amp; communication online |volume=1, |number=1 |year=2002 |language=German |page=7 |url=http://www.cco.regener-online.de/2002_1/pdf_2002_1/pelinka.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Second Republic (since 1945)==

After the end of the [[Second World War]], when [[Allied occupation of Austria|Austria]] was re-established as an independent state, the German nationalist movement was discredited because of its links to the former Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="Pelinka"/&gt; The dominant parties of the new republic were the Christian conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] and the Socialist Party. Both promoted Austrian independence, and considered the idea of a "Greater Germany" an anachronism. All former members of the Nazi party were banned from any political activity, and disenfranchised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ionas Aurelian |last=Rus |title=Variables affecting nation-building: The impact of the ethnic basis, the educational system, industrialization and sudden shocks |year=2008 |page=435 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bx32zNOxX4C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=freedom+party+austria+german+nationalism#v=onepage&amp;q=freedom%20party%20austria%20german%20nationalism&amp;f=false|isbn=9781109059632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Germanist and liberal "Third Camp" was later revived in the form of the [[Federation of Independents]] ({{lang-de|Verband der Unabhängigen}}), which fought [[de-Nazification]] laws imposed by the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]], and represented the interests of former Nazis, [[Wehrmacht]], and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers. In 1956, the Federation was transformed into the [[Freedom Party of Austria]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the German nationalist movement, represented by the Freedom Party and its affiliated organisations, was very active in universities, where the ''[[Burschenschaft]]en'', a type of student fraternity, helped spread German nationalist and liberal views. Inside the Freedom Party, the liberal wing grew to overtake the pan-Germanist wing, and Austrian patriotism was gradually incorporated into the party's ideology.&lt;ref name="Pelinka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gingrich_Banks"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=André |last1=Gingrich |first2=Marcus |last2=Banks |title=Neo-nationalism in Europe &amp; beyond |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2006 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zScJs9HjixQC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=freedom+party+austria+german+nationalism#v=onepage&amp;q=german%20nationalism&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845451905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Norbert Steger]]'s party leadership during 1980–1986, and the Freedom Party's participation in a coalition government with the Social Democrats, the pan-Germanist faction was weakened further.&lt;ref name="Pelinka2"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Anton |last=Pelinka |title=Jörg Haiders "Freiheitliche" – ein nicht nur österreichisches Problem |work=Liberalismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2000 |language=German |page=235 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWmudq4s4GAC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=deutschnational+freiheitliche#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Jörg Haider]]'s assumption of party leadership in 1986 was considered a triumph by the German nationalist faction.&lt;ref name="Gingrich_Banks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelinka2"/&gt; However, Haider's [[right-wing populism]] did not stress pan-Germanist traditions, as doing so would have cost votes. In 1987, only six percent of Austrian citizens identified themselves as "Germans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ernst |last=Bruckmüller
|title=Die Entwicklung des Österreichbewußtseins |year=1998 |page=17 |url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~europe/euro-ach/a/intro/texte/bruckmueller.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Haider had branded Austrian national identity as an ideological construct, going so far to refer to it as a "monstrosity" ''({{lang-de|Mißgeburt}})'' in 1988, he launched the "Austria First" [[petition]] in 1993, and claimed two years later that the Freedom Party was a "classical Austrian patriotic party", expressly renouncing his earlier "monstrosity" statement.&lt;ref name="Bruckmüller40"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ernst |last=Bruckmüller |title=Nation Österreich: Kulturelles Bewusstsein und gesellschaftlich-politische Prozesse |publisher=Böhlau |year=1996 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of German nationalism was still present, however, and could be seen in hostile actions against Slavic minorities in Austria, such as in conflicts over bilingual road sign with the [[Carinthian Slovenes]], along with hostility to [[immigration]] and [[European integration]].&lt;ref name="Pelinka"/&gt; Traditional Greater German ideas have therefore been replaced by a German-Austrian concept (i.e. only considering Austrians of German origin and tongue as "real" Austrians).&lt;ref name="Bruckmüller40"/&gt; This may be summarised as an "amalgamation of traditional German nationalism with Austrian patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Anton |last1=Pelinka |first2=Hubert |last2=Sickinger |first3=Karin |last3=Stögner |title=Kreisky – Haider: Bruchlinien österreichischer Identitäten |publisher=Braumüller |year=2008 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the pan-Germanist wing is only a minor faction within the Freedom Party. In 2008, fewer than seventeen percent of the Freedom Party's voters questioned the existence of a unique Austrian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Österreicher fühlen sich heute als Nation |newspaper=Der Standard |date=12 March 2008 |language=German |url=http://derstandard.at/3261105 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; German nationalists, including [[Andreas Mölzer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/euwahl/464619/index?gal=464619&amp;index=3&amp;direct=466658&amp;_vl_backlink=/home/politik/eu/index.do&amp;popup=|work=[[Die Presse]]|language=German|title=Ab nach Brüssel?: Die Spitzenkandidaten für die EU-Wahl|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Graf]],&lt;ref name="dpkul"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/medien/763208/Eine-stete-GrafWanderung&amp;usg=ALkJrhiMNQBFnzHJRc2LPv7Vx0TKAY_q-A | title=Eine stete Graf-Wanderung | work=Die Presse | date=4 June 2012 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Regina Pöll | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=Zur Zeit |page=2 |issue=43 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; now refer to themselves as "cultural Germans" (''Kulturdeutsche''), and stress the importance of their identity as ethnic Germans, in contrast to the distinct [[Austrians#Republic of Austria .281955 to present.29|Austrian national identity]]. In 2006, FPÖ members of parliament reaffirmed the party's root in the pan-Germanist tradition, at least symbolically, by wearing blue cornflowers in their buttonholes, along with ribbons in Austria's national colours (red and white), during the initial meeting of the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]]. This caused controversy, as the media interpreted the flower as a former Nazi symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anklänge an illegale NSDAPler |publisher=ORF.at |url=http://newsv1.orf.at/061030-5431/index.html |date=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Government Legal Department''' (previously called the '''Treasury Solicitor's Department''' until 2015) is the largest in-house legal organisation in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Government Legal Service]].

The Department is headed by the '''Treasury Solicitor'''. This office goes back several centuries. The office was enshrined in law by the '''Treasury Solicitor Act 1876''', which established the Treasury Solicitor as a [[corporation sole]] (an office with perpetual succession).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsol.gov.uk/about_us/our_history.htm |title=Our history |year=2013 |publisher=Treasury Solicitor's Department |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202717/http://www.tsol.gov.uk/about_us/our_history.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees of the department exercise legal powers which are vested in the corporation sole.

The department is a [[non-ministerial government department]] and [[executive agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/treasury-solicitor-s-department |title=Treasury Solicitor's Department |year=2013 |website=GOV.UK |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury Solicitor reports to the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]]. The department employs more than 1,400 [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s to provide advice and legal representation on a huge range of issues to many government departments.

==History==
The Department was historically known as the Treasury Solicitor's Department, but changed name to the Government Legal Department on 1 April 2015. The new name reflects a "significant period of change", which saw the department double in size to 2,000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasury Solicitor’s Department announces name change|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/treasury-solicitors-department-announces-name-change|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=Website of the Government of the United Kingdom|agency=gov.uk|date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the department combines the ancient office of [[Queen's Proctor]] (or King's Proctor) with that of [[Treasury Solicitor]]. He has the formal title of Her Majesty's Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor. Currently, the office is held by [[Jonathan Guy Jones|Jonathan Jones]]. He is also the [[Chief Executive]] of the department as an [[executive agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-permanent-secretary-for-the-treasury-solicitors-department |title=New Permanent Secretary for the Treasury Solicitor's Department - Press releases |website=GOV.UK |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The department is the authorised address for service of proceedings on most government departments, by virtue of the list published under the [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]].

In England (with the exception of [[Lancashire]], [[Manchester]] and [[Cornwall]], where the function is delegated to [[Farrer &amp; Co]]), the Treasury Solicitor is the Crown's nominee for the collection and disposition of ownerless property (''[[bona vacantia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsol.gov.uk/about_us.htm |title=About TSol |year=2013 |publisher=Treasury Solicitor's Department |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908094627/http://www.tsol.gov.uk/about_us.htm |archivedate=8 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically comprises the assets of dissolved companies and the estates of persons who die intestate and with no known kin.

=== Treasury Solicitor ===
Historically, there were two solicitors in the Treasury. The first (The Solicitor for Negotiating and Looking after the Affairs of the Treasury), which existed alone until 1696, had become a [[sinecure]] by 1744, and perhaps as early as 1716; from the late 18th century the office included a salary of £200 a year. It was abolished in 1800. A second Treasury Solicitor, the precursor of the modern office, was established in 1696 and was assigned all the legal business undertaken in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]]; as the first Solicitor became a sinecure, the second Solicitor became the only one responsible for legal business. By 1786, its office-holder was carrying out legal work for other secretaries of state and the Attorney-General, and in the early nineteenth century was employed by other government departments as well. From 1794, the Solicitor was also barred from running their own private practice. The salary began at £500, increased to £1,000 in 1755 and then to £2,000 in 1794; until the 1830s, the Solicitor also charged fees for work done in departments outside the Treasury, but these were then abolished and he received an allowance of £850 in addition to his salary. The whole salary was fixed at £2,000 in 1851, and then increased to £2,500 in 1872.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/office-holders/vol1/pp97-98 "Solicitors and Assistant-Solicitors, 1660–1870"], in [[John Sainty (civil servant)|J.

The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] has evolved over a long period of time beginning in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom and continuing to the present day. The relative stability of the British polity over centuries, progressing without a revolution or regime change that lasted, has obviated the need to write a constitution from first principles, in contrast to many other countries. What Britain has instead is an accumulation of various [[statutes]], judicial precedents, [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], treaties and other sources which collectively can be referred to as the British Constitution. It is thus more accurate to describe Britain's constitution as an ‘[[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]]’ constitution, rather than an ‘unwritten’ one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the UK Constitution?|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/whatis/uk-constitution|publisher=UCL Constitution Unit|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the British Constitution?|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/what-is-the-british-constitution/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=15 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211140036/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/what-is-the-british-constitution/|archivedate=11 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Question: Why doesn't the UK have a written constitution, and does it matter?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-why-doesnt-the-uk-have-a-written-constitution-and-does-it-matter-781975.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|publisher=The Independent|date=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Magna Carta and contemporary constitutional change|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/magna-carta-and-contemporary-constitutional-change|accessdate=28 April 2015|publisher=History and Policy|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingdom of Scotland==
{{Further|Kingdom of Scotland}}

===Origins===
{{Further|Kingdom of Scotland#History}}
From the fifth century AD, north Britain was divided into a series of petty kingdoms. Ferocious Viking raids beginning in AD 793 may have speeded up a long-term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] and [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdoms. This culminated in the rise of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cínaed mac Ailpín]] (Kenneth MacAlpin) as "king of the Picts" in the 840s (traditionally dated to 843),&lt;ref name=Webster1997p15&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; which brought to power the [[House of Alpin]].&lt;ref name=Yorke2006p54&gt;B. Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600–800'' (Pearson Education, 2006), {{ISBN|0582772923}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900 one of his successors, [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall II]] (Donald II), was the first man to be called ''rí Alban'' (King of Alba).&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Anderson, ''Early Sources of Scottish History, A.D. 500 to 1286'' (General Books LLC, 2010), vol. i, {{ISBN|1152215728}}, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Scotia would increasingly be used to describe the heartland of these kings, north of the [[River Forth]], and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings would be referred to as Scotland.&lt;ref name=Webster1997p22&gt;Webster, ''Medieval Scotland'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The long reign (900–942/3) of Donald's successor [[Constantine II of Scotland|Causantín]] (Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba/Scotland, and he was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;A. Woolf, ''From Pictland to Alba: 789 – 1070'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748612343}}, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malcolm I of Scotland|Máel Coluim I]] (Malcolm I) (reigned c. 943–954) annexed [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], over which the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;B. T. Hudson, ''Kings of Celtic Scotland'' (Westport: Greenhill 1994), {{ISBN|0313290873}}, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The reign of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] has been characterised as a "[[Davidian Revolution]]",&lt;ref name=Barrow1992pp9-11&gt;G.

Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Random House, 2011), {{ISBN|1446475638}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced a system of [[feudalism|feudal]] land tenure, established the first [[royal burgh]]s in Scotland and the first recorded Scottish coinage, and continued a process of religious and legal reforms.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp29-37&gt;Webster, ''Medieval Scotland'', pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Scottish monarchy in the Middle Ages was a largely itinerant institution, [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at [[Stirling Castle|Stirling]] and [[Perth Castle|Perth]] becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before [[Edinburgh]] developed as a capital city in the second half of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=McNeil&amp;MacQueenpp159-63&gt;P.

The Crown remained the most important element of government, despite the many royal [[minor (law)|minorities]]. In the late Middle Ages, it saw much of the aggrandisement associated with the New Monarchs elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', {{ISBN|0140136495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theories of [[constitutional monarchy]] and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly [[George Buchanan]], in the sixteenth century, but James VI of Scotland advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises.  The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the sixteenth century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage, until it was effectively dissolved with the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp200-2&gt;Thomas, "The Renaissance", pp. 200–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament of Scotland]] also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, ''The History of the Scottish Parliament volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235–1560'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), pp. 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Middle Ages it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent royal minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p21"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern era, Parliament was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and was never as central to the national life as its counterpart in England.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords of the [[mormaer]]s (later [[earl]]s) and toísechs (later [[thegn|thanes]]), but from the reign of David I, [[sheriffdom]]s were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships.&lt;ref name=McNeil&amp;MacQueenpp191-4&gt;McNeill and MacQueen,''Atlas of Scottish History to 1707'', pp. 191–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth century the creation of [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] and the [[Commissioner of Supply]] helped to increase the effectiveness of local government.&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Principality of Wales==
{{Further|Principality of Wales}}

===1216–1542===
The Principality of Wales existed between 1216 and 1536, encompassing two-thirds of modern [[Wales]] during its height between 1267 and 1277. For most of its history it was "annexed and united" to the English Crown. However, for a few generations, specifically the period from its foundation in 1216 to [[Edward I of England|Edward I's]] completion of the conquest of Wales in 1284, it was ''de facto'' independent under a Welsh [[Prince of Wales]], albeit one who swore [[fealty]] to the [[List of English monarchs|King of England]].

[[Cyfraith Hywel]], also known as Welsh law, was the system of law practised in [[medieval Wales]] before its [[conquest of Wales by Edward I|final conquest by England]]. Subsequently, the Welsh law's criminal codes were superseded by the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in AD 1284 and its civil codes by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s series of [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Acts]] between 1535 and 1542.

The Laws in Wales Acts formally incorporated all of Wales within the [[Kingdom of England]]. There has been no geographical or constitutional basis for describing any of the territory of Wales as a principality since then, although the term has occasionally been used in an informal sense to describe the country, and in relation to the honorary title of Prince of Wales.

===After 1542: union with England===
{{Further|History of Wales}}

The [[Encyclopaedia of Wales]] notes that the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]] was created by [[Edward IV]] in 1471 as a household institution to manage the Prince of Wales's lands and finances. In 1473 it was enlarged and given the additional duty of maintaining law and order in the Principality and the Marches of Wales. Its meetings appear to have been intermittent, but it was revived by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] for his heir, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]]. The Council was placed on a statutory basis in 1543 and played a central role in co-ordinating law and administration. It declined in the early 17th century and was abolished by Parliament in 1641. It was revived at the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] before being finally abolished in 1689.

From 1689 to 1948 there was no differentiation between the government of England and government in Wales. All laws relating to England included Wales and Wales was considered by the British Government as an indivisible part of England within the United Kingdom. The first piece of legislation to relate specifically to Wales was the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]].  A further exception was the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]], which disestablished the [[Church in Wales]] (which had formerly been part of the [[Church of England]]) in 1920.

In 1948 the practice was established that all laws passed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] were designated as applicable to either "[[England and Wales]]" or "[[Scotland]]", thus returning a legal identity to Wales which had not existed for hundreds of years following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] with Scotland in 1707. Also in 1948 a new [[Council for Wales and Monmouthshire|Council for Wales]] was established as a parliamentary committee. In 1964 the [[Welsh Office]] was established, based in London, to oversee and recommend improvements to the application of laws in Wales. This situation would continue until the devolution of government in Wales and the establishment of the autonomous [[National Assembly for Wales]] in 1998.

==Pre-Civil War England==
{{Further| Kingdom of England}}

=== Before the Norman Conquest ===
The [[Kingdom of England]] was formed in the mid 9th Century; for example, [[Alfred the Great]] issued laws as ''King of the West Saxons'', and what is now recognised as England came about in 927 AD when the last of the [[Heptarchy]] kingdoms fell under the rule of the [[King of England|''King of the English'']], [[Athelstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Feilden, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Norman conquest of England|14 October 1066]], King [[Harold II]] of England was killed while leading his men in the [[Battle of Hastings]] against Duke [[William of Normandy]].  The event completely changed the course of English history. Until 1066, England was ruled by monarchs that were elected by the ''[[witan]]'', (meaning ''wise''). There were various elements of democracy at a local level too, known as [[folkmoot]].

=== The Normans ===
[[Henry I of England]] (c. 1068 – 1 December 1135) was king from 1100 to 1135, ruling through the [[Curia regis]]. When he ascended to the throne he granted the [[Charter of Liberties]], a series of decrees and assurances to the [[barons]]. Probably the most important statement in the charter is at the beginning, where the king admits ''"that by the mercy of God and the common counsel of the barons of the whole kingdom of England I have been crowned king of said kingdom"''. This represented a step away from absolute rule; the king had recognised that the right to rule came not only from God but also from the common counsel of the barons.

=== The Plantagenets ===
King John (24 December 1167 – 19 October 1216) was King of England from 1199 to 1216. He was the youngest brother of Richard I. His reign was fraught with conflicts; there was conflict between England and France, between England and the [[Pope]] and between the King and the barons. Eventually the barons forced John to sign the [[Magna Carta]], a practical solution to the political crisis he faced in 1215, which established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta: an introduction|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272) succeeded his father John. Henry was only nine years of age when he became king and so the country was ruled by [[regent]]s until Henry reached the age of 20. Under pressure from the barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], Henry had to accept constitutional limitations on the monarchy placed by [[Provisions of Oxford]] and [[Provisions of Westminster]] and the existence of the [[Montfort's Parliament|first representative English Parliament]].

The [[Ordinances of 1311]] were a series of regulations imposed on King Edward II by the Lords and higher clergy to restrict the power of the king.

Later in the 14th century, during the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], there was an uprising known as the [[Peasants' Revolt]] (1381). The rebels came very close to their demands (such as fair rents and the abolition of serfdom) being granted by the king, but at the end the protesters were tricked out of such gains. The revolt remains as an important moment in history, but it failed to contribute to the written body of the constitution.

=== The Tudors ===
The first [[Act of Supremacy]] (1534) made King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the "supreme head" of the [[Church of England]]. Henry VIII died in 1547, leaving three children as potential heirs.

The second Act of Supremacy (1559) restored these powers over the church to Elizabeth I, reversing normalising legislation passed during the reign of her sister Mary I, although the title Elizabeth gained was "[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]" rather than "supreme head", so as not to imply that she had control over the church's doctrine, or, that the Monarch was usurping the primacy of Jesus. The Act also required all office-holders, including the [[clergy]], to take an [[Oath of Allegiance (1559)|oath of allegiance]] acknowledging the Queen as the supreme governor of the Church of England.

The monarchy had to get the consent of Parliament in all issues, but with the threat of war looming from Spain, Parliament showed great loyalty toward Queen Elizabeth, who was a strong leader. However, after the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated in 1588, Parliament felt safer and thus it decreased its loyalty to the monarchy.

Parliament consisted of two levels of administration: the [[House of Lords]] that was made up of the influential [[Peerage of England|peers of the realm]] and [[Lords Spiritual]], and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], which consisted of representative members of the [[aristocracy]] and the [[middle-class]].

The House of Commons had grown sharply, doubling in size due to the prosperity of the middle-class during that time. There were a number of vocal [[Puritan]]s in the House of Commons (although the extent to which they influenced the Commons is disputed, [[Sir John Neale]] identified a unified bloc of 43 members, whereas revisionists have suggested that this is an exaggeration) who began asking for more rights for the Puritans, but Elizabeth I was strong enough to ignore their demands. [[James I of England|James I]] would later have problems with them.

[[John Aylmer (classicist)|John Aylmer]], a Greek scholar, saw an immediate resemblance of the Tudor constitution to that of the [[classical republic]] of [[Sparta]]. [[Geoffrey Elton]], who wrote ''The Tudor Constitution'', gave hearty approval to Aylmer's conclusions. It was the Greek scholars, such as Aylmer, that popularised the Greek classical political terminology and influenced English and later British constitutionalist thought. They brought forward the idea of [[mixed government]] from [[Classical antiquity]] and applied it to their form of government.

=== James VI and I ===
When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 without issue, she was succeeded by her cousin [[James VI of Scotland]], the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and he became King James I of England. This was a major step towards creating a single British state, although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] did not come about until a hundred years later.

James VI faced a fractious religious England since it contained [[Anglican]]s (of the Church of England), Puritans, [[Separatist]]s (who wanted to break from the Church of England), and also many Roman Catholics, although many did not declare their continuing allegiance to Rome, which was the cause of much mistrust.

James VI was a believer in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], which stated that Kings were chosen by [[God]] and should therefore be absolute and answerable only to God. This was corroborated by his Presbyterian belief in predestination, and such a birthright as kingship made him almost explicitly a part of the elect. Though he was Presbyterian (Calvinist, Huguenot, Puritan), he was against the Presbyterian idea of allowing the congregation (people) to elect their presbyters (church officials) since it undermined his [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] (according to the Divine Right). Thus he was often at odds with the Puritans, who were English Presbyterians.

He did concede to the Puritans by commissioning the "[[King James Bible]]", an English language translation and interpretation of the Bible.

Then James VI began fighting with the Roman Catholics, but eventually gave them rights (after his secretly Catholic wife probably persuaded him to), exempting them from having to pay [[tithes]] to the Anglican Church, but this caused a great decrease in Anglican Church revenue, so he quickly took those rights away. The actions of King James VI were unpopular during his reign.

== The Civil War ==

=== Charles I and the Civil War ===
James was succeeded by his son who became Charles I in 1625. Charles I believed in the Divine Right of Kings, like his father, and thus continued to fight with parliament.

Parliament's main power at this time was its control of the [[tax]]es. Parliament demanded more power over the taxes. Traditionally, Parliament had voted at the beginning of a King's reign on the amount allowed for a King's [[Tonnage and Poundage]], the [[customs]] duties (taxes on imported goods like wool and wine) that made up a large portion of a king's annual income. Now Parliament wanted to re-evaluate these taxes annually, which would give it more control over the king. James I resisted this abrogation of his 'Divine Right' and dealt with the situation by dissolving Parliament. Charles I did the same at first and later just ignored its annual evaluations.

Charles acquired much of his money with forced loans from the rich. He also received a lot of money through taxes. One important tax that Charles collected was the [[Ship Money]] tax that required the counties bordering the sea to fund a [[navy]] to protect the English coastline. The coastal counties were unhappy with it since Charles was collecting the Ship Money tax during a time of peace and since he wasn't using it really to fund the navy. To get even more money, Charles placed the Ship Money tax on the interior counties as well - which angered the English people, because now Charles was creating new taxes without the consent of the Parliament (which was against the (unwritten) law). A London MP named [[John Hampden]] refused to pay this "new," interior Ship Money tax, so he was tried for a crime by Charles I and was convicted with a vote of 7 to 5. This meant that 5 of 12 jurors were against their king, which did not look good or bode well for Charles I.

But Charles I was at war with France and Spain, and this war was costing a lot of money; he was forced to call upon Parliament (1629) to raise new taxes for him. Parliament would not grant Charles new taxes (more money) until he had signed the [[Petition of Right]]s that established conditions in which Charles had to submit to the law of the Parliament:

* The king could not establish martial law in England during times of peace.
* The king could not levy taxes without the consent of the Parliament.
* The king could not arbitrarily imprison people.
* The king could not quarter soldiers in private homes.

After Charles got the taxes from Parliament (1629), he dissolved Parliament and broke the tenets of the Petition of Rights which, under the divine right theory, he considered void.

[[William Laud]] and [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]] were appointed to fill the void that the Duke of Buckingham left.

On top of the wars England had with France and with Spain (both caused by the Duke of Buckingham), Charles I and William Laud (the Archbishop of Canterbury) began a war with Scotland in an attempt to convert Scotland to the Church of England (the Anglican Church). This was called the [[Bishops' Wars|Bishops' War]] (1639–1640) and it had two major parts: The first Bishops' War (1639) ended in a truce. The second Bishops' War, the following year, began with the a Scottish invasion of England in which the Scottish defeated the English and remained stationed in England until their issues were solved. To get the Scottish out, Charles I signed the [[Treaty of Ripon]] (1640), which required England to pay an [[indemnity]] of £850 for each day that the Scottish were stationed in England.

During the second part of the Bishops' War, Charles I had run very low on money (since he was also fighting France and Spain), so he was forced to call a Parliament to make new taxes. He and the Parliament could not agree on anything, so after three weeks, Charles I dissolved the Parliament. Then he desperately needed new taxes, so Charles I called a Parliament again and it would only help him if he agreed to some terms, which ultimately made Charles I a [[constitutional monarch]]. It was called the [[Long Parliament]] (1640–1660), because it was not officially dissolved by its own vote until 1660.

These terms were:
* That Charles I had to impeach Thomas Wentworth and William Laud. He reluctantly placed them under arrest and put them in [[Tower of London|The Tower]], executing Wentworth in 1641 (for which Charles I never forgave himself since he was close to Thomas Wentworth) and William Laud in 1645.
* Charles I had to agree to the [[Triennial Act]] (1641), which required the Parliament to meet every three years with or without the king's consent.
* Charles I had to abolish the Court of the [[Star Chamber]], a royal court controlled completely by Charles I in which the prosecutor was also the judge (which pretty much guaranteed a guilty verdict for the defendant) and it was intended to be used to implement the will of the king legally with a "[[judicial]]" [[façade]]. It was considered an "extralegal" court. It dealt with odd cases and punishments.
* Charles I had to abolish the High Court, which was the same as the Court of the Star Chamber, though it dealt with religious heresy. It was considered an "extralegal" court.
* Charles I had to accept the [[Grand Remonstrance]] and allow the circulation of its copies, and it was a document that outlined ([[hyperbole|hyperbolically]]) the crimes that officials had accused Charles of committing since the beginning of his reign. Charles I was also never to do any of those crimes again.
* Charles I, most importantly, had to agree never to dissolve a Parliament without the consent of the Parliament.

Most of England believed that Parliament had done enough to curb the power of King Charles I, but the radicals in Parliament (the extremist Puritans) and the radicals around the country (again, extremist Puritans) wanted to reform the Church of England by getting rid of the bishops (and all other things with the semblance of Catholicism) and by establishing the Puritans' method of worship as the standard. This caused a political division in Parliament, so Charles I took advantage of it. He then sent 500 soldiers into the House of Commons to arrest five of the Puritans' ringleaders (John Hampden included). The five ringleaders had been tipped off, so they had left Parliament and Charles I was left with only shame for storming Parliament.

King Charles I left London and went to [[Oxford]], and the [[English Civil War]] began (1642). The North and West of England were on Charles I's side (along with most of the Nobles and country gentry). They were known as the ''Cavaliers''. Charles I created an army illegally (since he needed the Parliament's consent).

The South and East of England were on Parliament's side and were known as ''[[Roundhead]]s'', for their haircuts. In response to Charles I raising an army, they did so as well. Yet, they didn't have the military might that King Charles I (and his nobles) had, so they solicited the help of the Scottish with the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] that promised to impose the Presbyterian religion on the Church of England. They called their army the [[New Model Army]] and they made its commander [[Oliver Cromwell]], who was also a member of Parliament. The New Model Army was composed mostly of Presbyterians.

=== Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth ===
Though Parliament won, it was clear to the Scots that it was not going to uphold the Solemn League and Covenant by imposing Presbyterianism on England (Puritanism wasn't quite Presbyterian), so the New Model Army, Parliament and the Scots began falling apart. The Scots were paid for their help and sent back to Scotland.

The Presbyterian Roundheads were interested in freedom to practice their religion and not in making the Presbyterian religion the state religion.

Cromwell proposed that Parliament reinstate the bishops of the Church of England and King Charles I as a constitutional monarch, but allow for the toleration of other religions. Though at the end of the war, the people of England could accept Charles I back in office but not religious toleration. They also wanted the New Model Army dissolved since it was a provocative factor. Thus Parliament disallowed religious toleration and voted to disband the New Model Army, but the New Model Army refused the order.

Charles I then made the same deal that the Roundheads had made with the Scottish and Parliamentary Presbyterians. He solicited the help of Scotland (and the Presbyterians) and in return he promised to impose Presbyterianism on England. The New Model Army would not allow this deal to be made (because it would give Charles I military power once more). Thus a "new" civil war broke out in 1648.

This time, Scotland, the Parliamentary Presbyterians and the royalists were on the side of Charles I. The New Model Army and the rest of Parliament were against him.

In the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] (1648) Cromwell and his New Model Army defeated Charles I.

Then one of Cromwell's officers, [[Colonel Pride]], destroyed the Presbyterian majority in Parliament by driving out of Parliament 143 Presbyterians of the 203 (leaving behind 60). The new Parliament constituted a [[Rump Parliament]], which was a Parliament in which the minority (Presbyterians) carried on in the name of the majority that was kicked out. The Rump Parliament:
*Abolished the monarchy and the House of Lords in Parliament (it then executed Charles I after publicly trying him for crimes).
*Created a republic called the "[[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]" that was really just a [[dictatorship]] run by Cromwell.

Scotland was against Cromwell's "Commonwealth" (Republic) and declared Charles I's son king at Edinburgh as King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but Cromwell and the New Model Army defeated him (1650) and he fled to France where he stayed until 1660.

Cromwell then went to Ireland to govern it, but was "disgusted" with the Catholics, so he massacred many of them (in battle) and so the Irish rebelled against him as well.

Cromwell then dissolved the Rump Parliament and declared himself to be the Lord Protector (dictator).

=== Richard Cromwell and Charles II ===
Cromwell died (1658) and was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell]], who tried to keep power militarily and absolutely, but he was also incapable of unifying all of the diverse groups (religious and ethnic). [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General George Monk]] came down from Scotland and overthrew Richard. He then invited the remnants of the Long Parliament (the [[Rump Parliament]]) to reconvene. The Long Parliament met and officially ended (in 1660, after being open since 1640) when it voted to dissolve itself and create a new Parliament. The new Parliament began the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (of the monarchy) by choosing Charles I's son Charles II to be the King of England.

== Post-Civil War ==

=== Popular political movements ===
The idea of a political party with [[Political faction|faction]]s took form around the time of the Civil War. Soldiers from the Parliamentarian [[New Model Army]] and a faction of [[Levellers]] freely debated rights to political representation during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647. The Levellers published a newspaper (The Moderate) and pioneered political [[petition]]s, [[pamphleteer]]ing and party colours. Later, the pre-war [[Royalist]] (then [[Cavalier]]) and opposing Parliamentarian groupings became the [[Tory]] party and the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s in the Parliament.

In 1649 [[Diggers]], a small people's political reform movement, published ''[[The True Levellers Standard Advanced]]: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men.'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20041022185832/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/digger.html] This is another important document in the history of British constitutionalism{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, though different from the others listed here because the Diggers' declaration comes from the ''people'' instead of from the state. They are some times called "True Levellers" to distinguish themselves from the larger political group called the Levellers, which had supported the republicans during the civil war. The Diggers were not satisfied with what had been gained by the war against the king and wanted instead a dismantling of the state. They can be best understood through such philosophies as [[libertarianism]], [[anarchism]], and [[religious communism]].

Also at this time, the [[Polish Brethren]] arrived in England and [[Holland]]. The sect of Polish Brethren had been driven out of [[Poland]] after [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] because they were commonly considered to be collaborators with the [[Sweden|Swedish]].

The Diggers' [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] ideas influenced thinkers in Poland, Holland, and England, playing an especially important role in the philosophy of [[John Locke]].  Locke, in turn, profoundly impacted the development of political ideas regarding liberty, which would later influence the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].

===Glorious Revolution===
{{Further|Glorious Revolution}}
The Glorious Revolution was the overthrow of [[James II]] in 1688 and his replacement with [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as joint monarchs. The [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] of 1689 drew up a Declaration of Right to address perceived abuses of government under James II and to secure the religion and liberties of Protestants. This was enacted by the [[Parliament of England]] as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which limited royal power and reaffirmed certain [[civil rights]], building on the [[Petition of Right| Petition of Right 1628]] and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Scotland]] approved it as the [[Claim of Right]].

Both the Bill of Rights and the Claim of Right contributed a great deal to the establishment of the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the curtailment of the powers of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutionalism: America &amp; Beyond|url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|publisher=Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP), U.S. Department of State|accessdate=30 October 2014|quote=The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading, ultimately, to the establishment of [[constitutional monarchy]]. They furthered the protection of the [[rule of law]], which had started to become a principle of the way the country is governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemsruleoflaw.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rule of Law|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=3 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092303/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act of Settlement===
{{Further|Act of Settlement 1701}}
In the Act of Settlement 1701, Parliament altered the line of succession to the throne. In order to preserve the Protestant succession, Parliament ensured the Crown would pass to Sophia, the granddaughter of James I and first cousin to Charles II and James II. Sophia's son [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] became King in 1714 and his descendants, including the incumbent monarch Queen Elizabeth II, have reigned Britain ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Act of Settlement|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/actofsettlement/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also introduced the concept of [[judicial independence]] by establishing that judges can keep their position as long as they maintain "good behaviour". Before 1701 a judge's position was held at the disrection of the monarch and there were instances of judges being removed from their position after making judgements that the monarch did not like. After the Act of Settlement, a judge could only be removed from office by the agreement of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords with the subsequent approval of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Kingdom of Great Britain==
[[File:Treaty of Union.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Treaty of Union]].]]
{{main|Treaty of Union|Acts of Union 1707}}

After severe economic dislocation in Scotland in the 1690s, there were moves toward the [[political union]] of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acts of Union: exhibition marks the 300th anniversary of the Anglo-Scottish Union of 1 May 1707|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/historic/actsofunion/|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed on 22 July 1706,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniting the Kingdom?|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then ratified by both the [[Parliament of England]] and [[Parliament of Scotland]] each passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act of Union 1707|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/act-of-union-1707/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined parliament, the [[First Parliament of Great Britain|first]] [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. It sat in [[Westminster]] and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the [[House of Lords]]. It was also a full economic union, replacing the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade.&lt;ref name="Mitchison2002p314"&gt;R.

===Prime ministerial government ===
{{further|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom}}
The role of [[prime minister]] began to emerge during the period 1721-1742 as [[Robert Walpole]] chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all other ministers, and developed the doctrine of cabinet solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institution of Prime Minister|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom: History of Government Blog|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=1 January 2012|author=Dr Andrew Blick and Professor George Jones — No 10 guest historian series, Prime Ministers and No. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Byrum E.|title=Office of the Prime Minister|date=2015|origyear=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400878260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Historical Development of the Office of Prime Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United Kingdom ==
{{Main|Acts of Union 1800}}
The United Kingdom was created by the Union in January 1801 of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been ruled by English and British monarchs since the Middle Ages, with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#| title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

=== Supremacy of the Commons ===
The [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]] asserted the supremacy of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by limiting the legislation-blocking powers of the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] allowed the creation of life peers which gave the Prime Minister the ability to change the composition of the House of Lords.

=== Expansion of the electoral franchise ===
{{further|Elections in the United Kingdom#History}}
Between 1832 and 1928, numerous Acts of Parliament repealed voting restrictions and expanded the franchise from just 5% of the adult population to [[universal suffrage]] for all male and female adults aged 21 and over. The Representation of the People Act 1969 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting the vote|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Parliamentary Franchise|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-14|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s UK [[Midlothian campaign]] between 1878-80 began the move towards modern [[political campaign]]ing.

===Irish independence and partition===
{{further|Irish Home Rule bills|Partition of Ireland|Irish War of Independence}}
In 1912, the House of Lords managed to delay a Home Rule bill passed by the House of Commons. It was enacted as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. During these two years the threat of religious civil war hung over Ireland with the creation of the [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] [[Ulster Volunteers]] opposed to the Act and their nationalist counterparts, the [[Irish Volunteers]] supporting the Act. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Catholic demands for independence.  Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election [[Sinn Féin]] won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the [[First Dáil]] parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]], the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An [[Anglo-Irish War]] was fought between Crown forces and the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] between January 1919 and June 1921.  The war ended with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921 that established the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Joost Augusteign, ed., ''The Irish revolution, 1913–1923'' (Basingstoke, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became [[History of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Henessy, ''A History of Northern Ireland, 1920–1996'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Britain officially adopted the name "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"  by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].

=== European law ===
{{further|European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|l1=European Communities Act 1972}}
The European Communities Act 1972 (UK) incorporated European Community law into United Kingdom law, which subsequently became [[European Union law]]. It is arguable that the European Communities Act of 1972 is “semi-entrenched”; for as long as the UK remains a member of European Union that Act cannot be repealed.&lt;ref name=SN00293 /&gt;

=== Devolution and other New Labour reforms ===

==== First term ====
In [[Blair ministry|Labour's first term]] (1997–2001), it introduced a large package of constitutional reforms, which it promised in its 1997 manifesto. The most significant were:
*The creation of a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] parliament in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], with their own direct elections.
*The creation of a devolved assembly in [[London Assembly|London]] and the associated post of a directly elected Mayor.
*The beginning of a process of reform of the [[House of Lords]], including the removal of all but 92 [[hereditary peer]]s.
*The incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into UK law by passing the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].
*The passing of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].
*The passing of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]], creating the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] to regulate elections and [[referendum]]s and party spending to an extent.
*The granting of independence over decisions about [[monetary policy]] including [[interest rate]]s to the [[Bank of England]].

==== Second term ====
During the Labour government's second term (2001-2005), the House of Commons voted on seven options in February 2003 on what proportion of elected and appointed members (from 100% elected to 100% appointed) the House of Lords should have. None of the options received a majority.

In 2004, a [[Joint Committee]] (of the House of Commons and House of Lords) tasked with overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill, published its first report, in which, among other things, it suggested amending the bill's clauses that grant [[Cabinet Minister]]s the power "to disapply or modify any [[Act of Parliament]]" as overly wide, and that the bill should be modified to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed "the fundamental parts of constitutional law" of the United Kingdom:&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtdcc/184/18407.htm#a44 Joint Committee on Draft Civil Contingencies Bill - First Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

This amendment was defeated by the government and the bill was passed without it. However, the government partially one recommendation — the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] may not be amended by emergency regulations.

The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] created the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and guarantees [[judicial independence]].

===Conservative-Liberal Democrat reforms===
The [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition]] introduced several reforms including the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]], which reformed the Royal Prerogative and made other significant changes; the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which introduced fixed-term parliaments of 5 years.

A key Liberal Democrat policy was that of voting reform, to which a [[United Kingdom alternative vote referendum, 2011|referendum]] took place in May 2011 on whether or not Britain should adopt a system of [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] to elect MPs to Westminster. However, the proposal was rejected overwhelmingly, with 68% of voters in favour of retaining [[first-past-the-post]].

====Royal succession in the Commonwealth Realms====
In late October 2011, the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|prime ministers]] of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s voted to grant gender equality in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|royal succession]], ending the male-preference [[primogeniture]] that was mandated by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2054467/UK-royal-succession-laws-Commonwealth-agrees-historic-change-sex-equality.html?ito=feeds-newsxml "Commonwealth agrees historic change to give sex equality in Royal succession"]. ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 28 October 2011. Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment, once enacted, also ended the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/global/commonwealth-lift-law-banning-monarchs-marrying-catholics "British monarchs can soon marry Catholics"]. ''National Catholic Reporter'', 28 October 2011. Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the Act of Settlement 1701 came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015 which changed the laws of succession to the British throne. In the United Kingdom, it was passed as the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]].

===Further devolution===
Further powers were devolved under the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], [[Northern Ireland Act 2006]], [[Northern Ireland Act 2009]], [[Scotland Act 2012]], [[Wales Act 2014]], and the [[Scotland Act 2016]].

====Scottish Independence referendum====
{{Further|Scottish independence referendum, 2014}}
On 18 September, a referendum was held in Scotland on whether to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. The three UK-wide political parties - Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats - campaigned together as part of the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign, together with the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]]. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued [[The Vow (devolution promise)|'The Vow']], a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.

The [[Smith Commission]] was announced by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] on 19 September 2014 to propose the powers that would be devolved to the [[Scottish Government]]. Once the recommendations had been published they were debated in the UK Parliament and a [[command paper]] was published in January 2015 putting forward draft legislative proposals. A Scottish Parliament committee report published in May 2015 said that this draft bill did not meet the recommendations of the Smith Commission, specifically in relation to welfare payments. A spokesman for the UK Government said that a full Parliamentary discussion would follow.&lt;ref name = "SP committee"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32731463 |title=Holyrood powers bill 'falls short' of Smith proposals |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill based on the Smith Commission's recommendations was announced by the UK government in the May 2015 [[Queen's Speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Scottish devolution: What next for Scotland? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32810553 |newspaper=BBC News |location=Scotland |date=27 May 2015 |access-date=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill subsequently became law as the [[Scotland Act 2016]] in March 2016.

===EU referendum===
{{Further|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit}}
On 20 February 2016, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union would be held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Debates and campaigns by parties supporting both "Remain" and "Leave" focused on concerns regarding [[trade]] and the [[European Single Market|single market]], [[security]], [[Human migration|migration]] and [[sovereignty]].  The result of the referendum was in favour of the country leaving the EU with 51.9% of voters wanting to leave.&lt;ref name=NYTEUBrexit&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/britain-brexit-european-union-referendum.html|title=Britain Votes to Leave E.U., Stunning the World|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=23 June 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK remains a member for the time being, but is expected to invoke Article 50 of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], which would begin negotiations on a withdrawal agreement that will last no more than two years (unless the Council and the UK agree to extend the negotiation period) which will ultimately [[Brexit|lead to an exit from the European Union]].&lt;ref name=BBCEUBrexit&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36618317 EU Brexit referendum: UK 'must not delay leaving'], BBC News. Retrieved 24 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 the prime minister, [[Theresa May]], promised a "[[Great Repeal Bill 2016|Great Repeal Bill]]" which would repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and import its regulations into UK law, with effect from the date of British withdrawal. The regulations could then be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law|title=Theresa May's 'great repeal bill': what's going to happen and when? |last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=2 October 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] issued [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|a ruling]] in January 2017 that an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] is needed before the government can [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50|trigger {{nowrap|Article 50}}]] to leave the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 50 'Brexit' Appeal|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/article-50-brexit-appeal.html|publisher=The Supreme Court|accessdate=28 January 2017|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian trademark law''' statutorily protects [[trademarks]] as per the Trademark Act, 1999 and also under the [[common law]] remedy of [[passing off]].&lt;ref name=narayanan&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayanan|first=P.|title=Law of Trade Marks and Passing off|year=2004|publisher=Eastern Law House|location=Kolkata|isbn=9788171772322|edition=6th|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statutory protection of trademark is administered by the [[Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks]], a government agency which reports to the  [[Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion (India)|Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion]] (DIPP), under the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]].

The law of trademark deals with the mechanism of registration, protection of trademark and prevention of fraudulent trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Preamble, Trade Marks Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The law also provides for the rights acquired by registration of trademark, modes of transfer and assignment of the rights, nature of infringements, penalties for such infringement and remedies available to the owner in case of such infringement.

==History==
The law of trademark in India before 1940 was based on the [[common law]] principles of passing off and [[Equity (law)|equity]] as followed in [[England]] before the enactment of the first [[Registration Act, 1875]].&lt;ref name="Narayanan, p. 3"&gt;Narayanan, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The first statutory law related to trademark in India was the Trade Marks Act, 1940 which had similar provision like the UK Trade Marks Act, 1938. In 1958, the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was enacted which consolidated the provisions related to trademarks contained in other statutes like, the [[Indian Penal Code]], [[Criminal Procedure Code]] and the [[Sea Customs Act]].&lt;ref name="Narayanan, p. 3"/&gt;  
The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was repealed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and is the current governing law related to registered trademarks.&lt;ref name="Narayanan, p. 3"/&gt;  The 1999 Act was enacted to comply with the provisions of the [[TRIPS]].  Though some aspects of the [[unregistered trade mark]]s have been enacted into the 1999 Act, but they are primarily governed by the common law rules based on the principles evolved out of the judgments of the Courts.&lt;ref name="Narayanan, p. 3"/&gt;  Where the law is ambiguous, the principles evolved and interpretation made by the Courts in England have been applied in India taking into consideration the context of the legal procedure, laws and realities of India.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan, pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark==
Trademark defined under Section 2 (zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as, "trade mark means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours." A mark can include a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of colors or any such combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 (m)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trademark Classes ==
Trademark law 2002, suggests that trademark can be registered in India&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/images/pdf/classification_GoodsServices_29November2013.pdf|title=Trademark classification|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the following classes:

{{Main article|information privacy|privacy law}}

'''Information privacy law ''' or '''data protection laws''' prohibit the disclosure or misuse of [[information]] about private individuals. Over 80 countries and independent territories, including nearly every country in Europe and many in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa, have now adopted comprehensive data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|title=Global Data Privacy Laws: 89 Countries, and Accelerating|ssrn=2000034|publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2000034|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] has the [[General Data Protection Regulation]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dativa.com/virtual-dpo/ Adopting a Virtual Data Protection Officer] Published by Dativa, June 7, 2018, retrieved June 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, in force since May 25, 2018. The United States is notable for not having adopted a comprehensive information [[privacy]] law, but rather having adopted limited sectoral laws in some areas.

These laws are based on Fair Information Practice that was first developed in the United States in the 1970s by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department for Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)]]. The basic principles of data protection are:
* For all data collected there should be a stated purpose.
* Information collected by an individual cannot be disclosed to other organizations or individuals unless specifically authorized by law or by [[consent]] of the individual
* Records kept on an individual should be accurate and up to date
* There should be mechanisms for individuals to review data about them, to ensure accuracy. This may include periodic reporting
* Data should be deleted when it is no longer needed for the stated purpose
* Transmission of personal information to locations where "equivalent" personal data protection cannot be assured is prohibited
* Some data is too sensitive to be collected, unless there are extreme circumstances (e.g., sexual orientation, religion)

==By jurisdiction==
The [[Data Act (Sweden)|Data Act]] is the world's first national data protection law and was enacted in [[Sweden]] on 11 May 1973.&lt;ref name=impl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Öman|first1=Sören|title=Implementing Data Protection in Law|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-18.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Colin J.|title=Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801480108|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=D17pcdORb9UC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Law Library of Congress|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) went into effect on 1 January 2001, applicable to private bodies which are federally regulated. All other organizations were included on 1 January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada|url=http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.asp|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/02_06_01_e.asp|title=The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Privacy Commissioner of Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=privcom.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PIPEDA brings Canada into compliance with [[Data Protection Directive|EU data protection law]].

PIPEDA specifies the rules to govern collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information in the course of recognizing the right of privacy of individuals with respect to their personal information. It also specifies the rules for the organizations to collect, use, and disclose personal information.

The [[PIPEDA]] apply to:
# The organizations collect, uses, or disclosure in the matter of commercial use.
# The organizations and the employee of the organization collect, use, or discloses in the course of operation of a federal work, undertaking, or business.

The [[PIPEDA]] Does NOT apply to
# Government institutions to which the Privacy Act applies.
# Individuals who collect, use, or disclose personal information for personal purpose and use.
# Organizations which collect, use, or disclose personal information only for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes. 

As specified in PIPEDA:

"[[Personal Information]]" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

"[[Organization]]" means an association, a partnership, a person and a trade union.

"Federal work, undertaking or business" means any work, undertaking or business that is within the legislative authority of Parliament. Including:

# a work, undertaking or business that is operated or carried on for or in connection with navigation and shipping, whether inland or maritime, including the operation of ships and transportation by ship anywhere in Canada;
# a railway, canal, telegraph or other work or undertaking that connects a province with another province, or that extends beyond the limits of a province;
# a line of ships that connects a province with another province, or that extends beyond the limits of a province;
# a ferry between a province and another province or between a province and a country other than Canada;
# aerodromes, aircraft or a line of air transportation;
# a radio broadcasting station;
# a bank;
# a work that, although wholly situated within a province, is before or after its execution declared by Parliament to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more provinces;
# a work, undertaking or business outside the exclusive legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces; and
# a work, undertaking or business to which federal laws, within the meaning of section 2 of the Oceans Act, apply under section 20 of that Act and any regulations made under paragraph 26(1)(k) of that Act.

The PIPEDA gives individuals the right to:
# understand the reasons why organizations collect, use, or disclose personal information.
# expect organizations to collect, use or disclose personal information in a reasonable and appropriate way.
# understand who in the organizations pays the responsibility for protecting individuals' personal information.
# expect organizations to protect the personal information in a reasonable and secure way.
# expect the personal information held by the organizations to be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
# have the access to their personal information and ask for any corrections or have the right to make complain towards the organizations.

The PIPEDA requires organizations to:
# obtain consent before they collect, use, and disclose any personal information.
# collect personal information in a reasonable, appropriate, and lawful ways.
# establish personal information policies that are clear, reasonable, and ready to protect individuals' person information.

===Europe===
{{Further|General Data Protection Regulation}}
The right to data privacy is relatively heavily regulated and actively enforced in Europe. Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) provides a right to respect for one's ''"private and family life, his home and his correspondence"'', subject to certain restrictions. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has given this article a very broad interpretation in its [[jurisprudence]]. According to the Court's case law the collection of information by officials of the state about an individual without their consent always falls within the scope of Article 8. Thus, gathering information for the official [[census]], recording [[fingerprint]]s and [[photograph]]s in a police register, collecting [[medical data]] or details of personal expenditures and implementing a system of personal identification has been judged to raise data privacy issues.

Any state interference with a person's privacy is only acceptable for the Court if three conditions are fulfilled:
# The interference is in accordance with the law
# The interference pursues a legitimate goal
# The interference is necessary in a democratic society

The government is not the only entity which may pose a threat to data privacy.  Other citizens, and private companies most importantly, may also engage in threatening activities, especially since the automated processing of data became widespread. The [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]] was concluded within the [[Council of Europe]] in 1981.  This convention obliges the signatories to enact legislation concerning the automatic processing of personal data, which many duly did.

As all the member states of the [[European Union]] are also signatories of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]], the [[European Commission]] was concerned that diverging data protection legislation would emerge and impede the free flow of data within the EU zone.  Therefore, the European Commission decided to propose harmonizing data protection law within the EU. The resulting [[Data Protection Directive]] was adopted by the [[European Parliament]] and ministers from national governments in 1995 and had to be transposed into national law by the end of 1998.

The directive contains a number of key principles with which member states must comply. Anyone processing personal data must comply with the eight enforceable principles of good practice.&lt;ref name="dpa1998"/&gt; They state that the data must be:
# Fairly and lawfully processed.
# Processed for limited purposes.
# Adequate, relevant and not excessive.
# Accurate.
# Kept no longer than necessary.
# Processed in accordance with the data subject's rights.
# Secure.
# Transferred only to countries with adequate protection.

Personal data covers both facts and opinions about the individual.&lt;ref name="dpa1998"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/1|title=Data Protection Act 1998|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes information regarding the intentions of the data controller towards the individual, although in some limited circumstances exemptions will apply. With processing, the definition is far wider than before. For example, it incorporates the concepts of "obtaining", "holding" and "disclosing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersticeconsulting.com/ibtt/tradeandtaxation/data-protection-where-does-processing-occur/|title=International Business, Trade and Taxation|website=intersticeconsulting.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429192727/http://intersticeconsulting.com/ibtt/tradeandtaxation/data-protection-where-does-processing-occur/|archivedate=2014-04-29|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All EU member states adopted legislation pursuant this directive or adapted their existing laws.  Each country also has its own supervisory authority to monitor the level of protection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Because of this, in theory the transfer of personal information from the EU to the US is prohibited when equivalent privacy protection is not in place in the US.   American companies that would work with EU data must comply with the [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ Safe Harbour] framework.  The core principles of data protected are limited collection, consent of the subject, accuracy, integrity, security, subject right of review and deletion.  As a result, customers of international organizations such as Amazon and eBay in the EU have the ability to review and delete information, while Americans do not.  In the United States the equivalent guiding philosophy is the [[FTC Fair Information Practice|Code of Fair Information Practice]] (FIP).

The difference in language here is important: in the United States the debate is about privacy where in the European Community the debate is on data protection.  Moving the debate from privacy to data protection is seen by some philosophers as a mechanism for moving forward in the practical realm while not requiring agreement on fundamental questions about the nature of privacy.

====France====
[[France]] adapted its existing law, ''no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 concerning information technology, files and civil liberties"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnil.fr/ More information] is available on the website of the [[CNIL]] (in French only).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
In [[Germany]], both the federal government and the states enacted legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfd.bund.de/|title=Internetauftritt der Bundesbeauftragten für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit  -  Startseite|website=www.bfd.bund.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
While [[Switzerland]] is not a member of the [[European Union]] (EU) or of the [[European Economic Area]], it has partially implemented the EU [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Directive on the protection of personal data]] in 2006 by acceding to the [[STE 108]] agreement of the [[Council of Europe]] and a corresponding amendment of the federal Data Protection Act. However, Swiss law imposes less restrictions upon data processing than the Directive in several respects.&lt;ref&gt;See the Federal Council's Message to Parliament, [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/ff/2003/2101.pdf BBl 2003 2101] p. 2117 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]]. The Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (DPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/org/00828/index.html?lang=en|title=Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (DPA)|website=admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance (DPO) entered into force on July 1, 1993. The latest amendments of the DPA and the DPO entered into force on January 1, 2008.

The DPA applies to the processing of personal data by private persons and federal government agencies. Unlike the data protection legislation of many other countries, the DPA protects both personal data pertaining to natural persons and legal entities.&lt;ref name=dataprotection&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataprotection.ch|title=dataprotection.ch : dataprotection.ch - Walder Wyss AG|website=www.dataprotection.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner in particular supervises compliance of the federal government agencies with the DPA, provides advice to private persons on data protection, conducts investigations and makes recommendations concerning data protection practices.

Some data files must be registered with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner before they are created. In the case of a transfer of personal data outside of Switzerland, special requirements need to be met and, depending on the circumstances, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner must be informed before the transfer is made.&lt;ref name=dataprotection/&gt;

Most Swiss cantons have enacted their own data protection laws regulating the processing of personal data by cantonal and municipal bodies.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] (c 29) ([[Information Commissioner]]) implemented the EU [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Directive on the protection of personal data]] .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/ Information Commissioner's Office - ICO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516052148/http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/ |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the [[Data Protection Act 1984]] (c 35). The 2016 [[General Data Protection Regulation]] supersedes previous Protection Acts. The [[Data Protection Act 2018]] (c 12) updates data protection laws in the UK. It is a national law which complements the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR).

===Asia===

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], Republic Act No. 10173, entitled as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 was signed on August 15, 2012 by then President [[Benigno Aquino III]].

===United States===
{{Main article|Privacy laws of the United States}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Data privacy is not highly legislated or regulated in the [[United States|U.S]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.frontiertechnology.co.uk/about-us/news/differences-between-eu-and-us-data-laws/|title=The differences between EU and US data laws|date=2015-10-12|work=Frontier Technology|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, access to private data contained in, for example, third-party credit reports may be sought when seeking employment or medical care, or making automobile, housing, or other purchases on credit terms. Although partial regulations exist, there is no all-encompassing law regulating the acquisition, storage, or use of personal data in the U.S.  In general terms, in the U.S., whoever can be troubled to key in the data, is deemed to own the right to store and use it, even if the data was collected without permission, except to any extent regulated by laws and rules such as the federal Communications Act's provisions, and implementing rules from the Federal Communications Commission, regulating use of [[customer proprietary network information]] (CPNI).  For instance, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act|Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998]] (COPPA), and the [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act|Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003]] (FACTA), are all examples of U.S. federal laws with provisions which tend to promote information flow efficiencies.

The Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution to grant a right of privacy to individuals in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''. Very few states, however, recognize an individual's right to privacy, a notable exception being [[California]]. An inalienable right to privacy is enshrined in the [[California Constitution]]'s article 1, section 1, and the California legislature has enacted several pieces of legislation aimed at protecting this right. The California [[Online Privacy Protection Act]] (OPPA) of 2003 requires operators of commercial web sites or online services that collect personal information on California residents through a web site to conspicuously post a [[privacy policy]] on the site and to comply with its policy.

The [[Safe Harbor Principles|safe harbor arrangement]] was developed by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in order to provide a means for U.S. companies to demonstrate compliance with European Commission directives and thus to simplify relations between them and European businesses.

Recently, lawmakers in several states have proposed legislations to change the way online businesses handle user information. Among those generating significant attention are several [[Do Not Track legislation]]s and the [[Right to Know Act]] (California Bill AB 1291). The California Right to Know Act, if passed, would require every business which keeps user information to provide its user a copy of stored information when requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowenthal|first=Bonnie|title=AB-1291 Privacy: Right to Know Act of 2013: disclosure of a customer’s personal information|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1291|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill faced heavy oppositions from trade groups representing companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, and failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_23067322/silicon-valley-companies-quietly-try-kill-internet-privacy|title=Silicon Valley companies quietly try to kill Internet privacy bill|first=Steven |last=Harmon|publisher=Bay Area News Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2018 California legislature passed AB 375, the [[California Consumer Privacy Act]] of 2018, effective January 1, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375|title=Bill Text - AB-375 Privacy: personal information: businesses.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the law is not amended before it becomes effective, The California Consumer Privacy Act, AB. 375 — gives California residents an array of new rights, starting with the right to be informed about what kinds of personal data companies have collected and why it was collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new-data-privacy-law|title=What You Need to Know About California’s New Data Privacy Law|date=2018-07-11|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIPAA====
The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) was enacted by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1996.  HIPAA is also known as the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA-Public Law 104-191), effective August 21, 1996. The basic idea of HIPAA is that an individual who is a subject of individually identifiable health information should have:
* Established procedures for the exercise of individual health information privacy rights.
* The use and disclosure of individual health information should be authorized or required.

One difficulty with HIPAA is that there must be a mechanism to authenticate the patient who demands access to his/her data. As a result, medical facilities have begun to ask for Social Security Numbers from patients, thus arguably decreasing privacy by simplifying the act of correlating health records with other records.&lt;ref name="HIPPA breach Cases"&gt;{{citation|title=Recent News Regarding HIPAA Violation Breach Cases|url=http://www.medicalansweringservice.net/hipaa-breach-cases.htm|accessdate=February 16, 2014|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of consent is problematic under HIPAA, because the medical providers simply make care contingent upon agreeing to the privacy standards in practice.

====FCRA====
The [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] applies the principles of the Code of Fair Information Practice to credit reporting agencies. The FCRA allows individuals to opt out of unwanted credit offers:
* Equifax (888) 567-8688 Equifax Options, P.O.  Box 740123 Atlanta GA 30374-0123.
* Experian  (800) 353-0809 or (888) 5OPTOUT  P.O.  Box 919, Allen, TX 75013
* TransUnion (800) 680-7293 or (888) 5OPTOUT P.O Box 97328, Jackson, MS 39238.

Because of the [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]], each person can obtain a [[annualcreditreport.com|free annual credit report]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre34.shtm Facts for Consumers], Federal Trade Commission, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fair Credit Reporting Act has been effective in preventing the proliferation of specious so-called private credit guides.  Previously, private credit guides offered detailed, if unreliable, information on easily identifiable individuals.   Before the Fair Credit Reporting Act salacious unsubstantiated material could be included, in fact, gossip was widely included in credit reports. EPIC has a [http://www.epic.org/privacy/fcra/ FCRA page]. The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents the consumer reporting industry, also has a Web site with FCRA information.[http://www.cdiaonline.org]

The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides consumers the ability to view, correct, contest, and limit the uses of credit reports. The FCRA also protects the credit agency from the charge of negligent release in the case of misrepresentation by the requester.  Credit agencies must ask the requester the purpose of a requested information release, but need to make no effort to verify the truth of the requester's assertions.  In fact, the courts have ruled that, "The Act clearly does not provide a remedy for an illicit or abusive use of information about consumers" (Henry v Forbes, 1976).  It is widely believed that in order to avoid the FCRA, ChoicePoint was created by Equifax at which time the parent company copied all its records to its newly created subsidiary. ChoicePoint is not a credit reporting agency, and thus FCRA does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://epic.org/privacy/choicepoint/ | title = Electronic Privacy and Information Center: Choicepoint | publisher=EPIC | accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] similarly limits dissemination of information about a consumer's financial transactions.  It prevents creditors or their agents from disclosing the fact that an individual is in debt to a third party, although it allows creditors and their agents to attempt to obtain information about a debtor's location.  It limits the actions of those seeking payment of a debt. For example, debt collection agencies are prohibited from harassment or contacting individuals at work. The [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2005 (which actually gutted consumer protections, for example in case of bankruptcy resulting from medical cost) limited some of these controls on debtors.

====ECPA====
The [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] (ECPA) establishes criminal sanctions for interception of electronic communication.  However, the legislation has been criticized for lack of impact due to  loopholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/deep-dive-updating-electronic-communications-privacy-act|title=Deep Dive: Updating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act|last=Reitman|first=rainey|date=2012-12-06|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several US federal agencies have privacy statutes that cover their collection and use of private information.  These include the Census Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, and the National Center for Education Statistics (under the Education Sciences Reform Act).  In addition, the [[CIPSEA]] statute protects confidentiality of data collected by federal statistical agencies.

== "Safe harbor" privacy framework ==
{{Main article|Safe harbor arrangement}}
Unlike the U.S. approach to privacy protection, which relies on industry-specific legislation, regulation and self-regulation, the European Union relies on comprehensive privacy legislation. The [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|European Directive on Data Protection]] that went into effect in October 1998, includes, for example, the requirement to create government data protection agencies, registration of databases with those agencies, and in some instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. In order to bridge these different privacy approaches and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with the Directive, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission developed a "safe harbor" framework. The safe harbor - approved by the EU in July 2000 - is a way for U.S. companies to comply with European [[privacy law]]s.

'''IMDG Code''' or '''International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code''' is accepted as an international guideline to the safe transportation or shipment of [[dangerous goods]] or [[hazardous materials]] by water on vessel. IMDG Code is intended to protect crew members and to prevent [[marine pollution]] in the safe transportation of hazardous materials by vessel. It is recommended to governments for adoption or for use as the basis for national regulations.s mandatory in conjunction with the obligations of the members of united nation government under the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS) and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ([[MARPOL 73/78]]).
It is intended for use not only by the mariner but also by all those involved in industries and services connected with [[shipping]]. Contains advice on terminology, packaging, labeling, placarding, markings, stowage, segregation, handling, and emergency response.  The [[HNS Convention]] covers hazardous and noxious substances that are included in the IMDG code.

The code is updated and maintained by the CCC (formerly DSC) Sub-Committee of the [[International Maritime Organization]] every 2 years.

IMG Code in calendar year 2017 is the either the 2014 Edition; Incorporating Amendment 37-14 or 2016 Edition; Incorporating Amendment 38-16.  Both the 2014 Edition and the 2016 Edition were voluntary in 2017.  The 2016 Edition becomes mandatory in 2018 and will again be voluntary in 2019 when the 2018 Edition will also be in use.

The {{nihongo|'''Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers'''|社団法人日本音楽著作権協会|Shadanhōjin Nihon Ongaku Chosakuken Kyōkai}}, often referred to as '''JASRAC''', is a Japanese [[copyright collective|copyright collection society]]. It was founded in 1939 as a non-profit making organization, and is the largest musical [[copyright]] administration society in Japan. 

==Overview==
JASRAC's main business activity is to act as trustee of [[copyright]] rights such as recording and [[performing rights]] for songwriters, lyricists, and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s. It manages licensing to music users, collects license fees, and distributes the same to the rights holders. It also supervises [[copyright infringement]]s and prosecutes infringers. Because JASRAC is a foundation, it is subject to the General Foundation and Estate Foundation Act &lt;!--- ([[一般社団法人及び一般財団法人に関する法律]])---&gt; subject to the rules non-profit management.  
	
The headquarters is located in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo, in a building owned by the [[Masao Koga]] Music Cultural Memorial Foundation. It has 22 branches in major cities of Japan. JASRAC was established in 1939 with the predecessor Great Japan Music Association, and is the oldest copyright management company in Japan.

==History==
===Prague Whirlwind===
In 1988 Japan joined the [[Berne Convention]] where the [[Copyright]] law was enforced. However, there was no concept on how to pay royalties for recorded songs for each live performance. In 1931, Wilhelm Prague ([[ウィルヘルム・プラーゲ]]), a German teacher at the imperial First High School under the old system, established a copyright management organization called "Prague Institution" in Tokyo, and argued that it mainly acquired the agency right for Japan from a European copyright management organization and began requesting music usage fees to all businesses using music, such as broadcasting stations and orchestras. 

As the license fees requests of Prague were at the time extralegal and their enforcement included pressurizing, the use of compositions outside Japan became actually difficult. Even [[NHK]] was due to a deadlock in the negotiations with the Prague Institution for over one year not able to broadcast foreign music pieces. Prague also began to urge Japanese artists to let the Prague Institute act as agent of their copyright management.  Though he was also considered to pursue not monetary goals but the proper management of copyrights, he wasn't able to bridge the gap to the music users, and the acquisition of agency rights from Japanese authors caused further uproar. These incidents were called the "Prague Whirlwind" and triggered concentration management of copyright in Japan.

===Establishment of the Copyright Brokerage Business Act===
In order to develop the situation, in 1939 the copyright brokerage act ([[著作権ニ関スル仲介業務ニ関スル法律]]) was enacted providing that only holders of permission from the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)]] can undertake copyright brokerage business, and the predecessor of JASRAC (Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers), the Great Japanese Music Copyright Association, was established and started operation in 1940. Prague was excluded from copyright management work, received a fine for violating this law, and left Japan in 1941. The Agency for Cultural Affairs granted permission of brokerage business to four organizations, including the Great Japan Music Association, and other organizations. They didn't allow other entry, and the mediation of music copyright became the monopoly business of the Great Japan Music Association.

==Video-sharing site==
In 2006, JASRAC took legal action by requesting that nearly 30,000 videos featuring songs or clips that violated the copyrights of [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]], [[Avex Japan]], [[Pony Canyon]], [[JVC Victor]], [[Warner Japan]], [[Toy's Factory]], and [[Universal Japan]] be removed from YouTube.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6127857.html |title=YouTube erases clips per Japan media demand |publisher=zdnet |accessdate=2006-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128115103/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6127857.html |archivedate=28 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Trial and criticism==
In April 2008, FTC (Fair Trade Commission) officials raided the society's Tokyo headquarters on suspicion of violating Japan's Anti-Monopoly Law. In February 2009, the FTC ruled that the system prevents other companies from entering the copyright-fee collection and management business.

In February 2009, a cease-and-desist order was issued by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (FTC) for allegedly breaking the Anti-monopoly Law, demanding that the society end its blanket-fee system.&lt;ref name="jt20131104"&gt;{{cite news |date= 4 November 2013|title= Court nixes FTC order on music copyright fees|newspaper= The Japan Times|location= Japan|publisher= The Japan Times Ltd.|page= 2|url= |deadurl= |accessdate= |registration= |subscription= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under that system, radio and TV stations are allowed unlimited use of JASRAC-managed music copyrights for a flat fee of 1.5% of their annual broadcasting revenue.&lt;ref name="yomiuri20131101"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20131101-OYT1T00815.htm?from=main6|archive-url= https://archive.is/20131101110604/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20131101-OYT1T00815.htm?from=main6|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 1 November 2013|script-title=ja:ＪＡＳＲＡＣの使用料徴収は競争を妨害…高裁|trans-title=|date= 1 November 2013|work= Yomiuri Online|publisher= The Yomiuri Shimbun|location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japandailypress20131104"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://japandailypress.com/tokyo-high-court-says-music-copyright-company-violates-anti-monopoly-law-0438930/|title= Tokyo High Court says music company violates anti-monopoly law|first= Ida |last= Torres|date= 4 November 2013|work= Japan Daily Press|publisher= The Japan Daily Press|location= Japan|page= |language= Japanese|format= |accessdate= 6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was withdrawn, however, in June 2012.&lt;ref name="jt20131104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri20131101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japandailypress20131104"/&gt;

On 1 November 2013, in response to a petition by rival e-License Inc., the Tokyo High Court declared that JASRAC's fee levying system impeded competition within the industry and made it extremely difficult for other organizations to enter the market.&lt;ref name="jt20131104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri20131101"/&gt;

In February 2017, JASRAC sparked a controversy that they announced they would start collecting copyright fees off of music schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KIKUCHI|first1=DAISUKE|title=Japan copyright body courts anger by casting a wider net|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/06/05/reference/japan-copyright-body-courts-anger-casting-wider-net/#.WrhTLojwbDc|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JASRAC Faces Criticism for New Copyright Claims Against Music Schools|url=https://keisenassociates.com/jasrac-faces-criticized-for-new-copyright-claims-against-music-schools/|website=keisenassociates|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Lanham (Trademark) Act''' ({{USStatute|79|489|60|427|1946|7|5}}, codified at {{USC|15|1051}} et seq. ({{usctc|15|22}})) is the primary federal [[trademark]] statute of law in the United States. The Act prohibits a number of activities, including [[trademark infringement]], [[trademark dilution]], and [[false advertising]].

==History==
Named for Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]] of Texas, the Act was passed on July 5, 1946, and signed into law by President [[Harry Truman]], taking effect "one year from its enactment", on July 6, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act, § 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In rare circumstances, a conflict will arise between trademarks that have been in use since before the Lanham Act went into effect, thus requiring the courts to examine the dispute according to the trademark act that existed before the Lanham Act.

The Act has been amended several times since its enactment. Its impact was significantly enhanced by the [[Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|98|473|98|2179|1984|10|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made the intentional use of a counterfeit [[trademark]] or the unauthorized use of a counterfeit trademark an offense under [[Title 18 of the United States Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|2320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced enforcement remedies through the use of ''[[ex parte]]'' seizures&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1116|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the award of treble profits or damages (whichever is greater).&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1117|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] inserted {{uscsub|15|1125|d}}, and amended {{uscsub|15|1114|2|D}}.

===Civil enforcement===
§§ 42 and 43 of the Act (now known as {{usc|15|1124|1125}}) set out the remedies that can be sought when a trademark is infringed. These provisions forbid the importation of goods that infringe registered trademarks, and restrict, through the use of injunctions and damages, the use of false descriptions and trademark dilution.

§ 43(a) ({{uscsub|15|1125|a}}) is the "likelihood of confusion" standard for infringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress, and courts still frequently refer to the provision as "Section 43(a)":

{{bq|1=
15 U.S.C. § 1125 - False designations of origin, false descriptions, and dilution forbidden

(a) Civil action

(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which{{emdash}}
:(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or
:(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
}}

{{uscsub|15|1125|a|1|A}} is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a consumer or business.  The claimant must prove that a false or misleading statement was made in commerce and that the statement creates a likelihood of harm to the plaintiff.

{{uscsub|15|1125|a|1|B}} is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a business.

===Jurisprudence===

The Act has been held to have extraterritorial impact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1999|last=Brown|first=Erika M.|title=The Extraterritorial Reach of Trademark Law: A Review of Recent Decisions Under the Lanham Act|url=http://iplj.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Essay-THE-EXTRATERRITORIAL-REACH-OF-UNITED-STATES-TRADEMARK-LAW-A-REVIEW-OF-RECENT-DECISIONS-UNDER-THE-LANHAM-ACT.pdf|journal=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]]|volume = IX|issue = 3|pages = 863{{endash}}884|publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the circuit courts have been giving more favorable interpretations in extending its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lawrence R.

#the conduct of the defendant must have a substantial effect on United States commerce,
#the defendant must be a United States citizen, and
#there must be an absence of conflict with foreign law.

Although the Lanham Act sets out clear parameters as to what constitutes trademark infringement, subsequent court decisions, especially those involving the Internet, have loosened the strictures.&lt;ref name=cardozolawreview&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2005|last=Rothman|first=Jennifer E.|title=Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads of Trademark Law|url=http://cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/27-1/ROTHMAN.FINAL.VERSION.pdf|journal=[[Cardozo Law Review]]|volume = 27|issue = 1|pages = 105{{endash}}191|publisher = [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law had no impact on public domain works in ''[[Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.]]''

In 2014, the various interpretations that had been adopted by the circuit courts as to who had [[Standing (law)|standing]] to sue under {{uscsub|15|1125|a}} were ousted by the Court in ''[[Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components]]'', where [[Justice Scalia]] adopted a multi-step approach:

#Under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized "injury in fact" that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'', {{ussc|504|555|1992}}, at 560&lt;/ref&gt;
#''AGC'' requires the ascertainment, as a matter of statutory interpretation, of the "scope of the private remedy created by" Congress, and the "class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under" a legislatively conferred cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'', {{ussc|459|519|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests "fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allen v. Wright]]'', {{ussc|468|737|1984}}, at 751&lt;/ref&gt; and the "zone of interests" formulation applies to all statutorily created causes of action, as it is a "requirement of general application" and Congress is presumed to "legislat[e] against the background of" it, "which applies unless it is expressly negated."&lt;ref&gt;''Bennett v. Spear'', {{ussc|520|154|1997}}, 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;
#A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation'', {{ussc|503|258|1992}}, at 268{{endash}}270&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff suing under §1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.
#Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under §1125(a).

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]'', {{ussc |3=2013 |docket=12-761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act complemented the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], allowing a company to sue for infringement by way of [[civil action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = POM notches legal win in Coke's fruit juice battle|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/101754215|publisher = [[Reuters]]|date = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Matal v. Tam]]'' in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in {{uscsub|15|1052|a}} of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as disparaging an individual or group, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants' [[freedom of speech (United States)|freedom of speech]].

==Divisions==
In the [[United States Code]], the Act has been divided into four subchapters:

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Subchapter !! Name !! Sections  !!Description
|- valign="top"
| I || The [[Principal Register]] || §§ 1051–1072 || Lanham Act, ss. 1–22

|- valign="top"
| rowspan = "3" | III ||rowspan = "3" | General Provisions || §§ 1111–1127 || Lanham Act, ss. 29–45
|- valign="top"
| § 1128 || later creation of the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council
|- valign="top"
| § 1129 || passage of prohibitions against [[International Cybercrime#Copyright.C2.AD and Trademark.C2.AD-related Offences|cyberpiracy]] originally codified here, but now covered by {{UnitedStatesCode|15|8131}}
|- valign="top"
| IV || The [[Madrid Protocol]] || §§ 1141–1141n || later passage, in consequence of US accession to the [[Madrid system]]
|}

===The Trademark Registers===
Subchapter I sets forth the requirements that a mark must meet to receive a registration on the [[Principal Register]], which bestows various rights on the trademark owner to prevent others from infringing their mark. Among the requirements are prohibitions against the registration of marks that are confusingly similar to existing marks, are generic or merely descriptive, are scandalous or immoral, or fall onto certain other prohibited categories. Subchapter I also sets forth certain procedural requirements, such as the submission of an affidavit of continued use after five years of registration.

Subchapter II sets forth a form of registration on the [[Supplemental Register]], for certain marks that are unregistrable under Subchapter I, but may become registrable in the future, such as those that are merely descriptive. This form of registration, while not granting all the protections of registration on the Principal Register, does provide notice to potential infringers that the mark is in use, and also provides some procedural benefits.

The '''Library Services and Construction Act''', enacted in 1962 by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], provides federal assistance to [[library|libraries]] in the United States for the purpose of improving or implementing library services or undertaking construction projects.

The 88th U.S. Congressional session passed the S. 2265 [[Bill (law)|bill]] which the 36th President of the United States [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] enacted into law on February 11, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26067 |title=Lyndon B. Johnson: "Remarks Upon Signing Bill Amending the Library Services Act.," February 11, 1964 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since public libraries depended on local taxes, sometimes there would be a struggle for funding, especially in rural areas. After the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and the creation of the [[Works Progress Administration]] in 1935, part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the [[American Library Association|American Library Association (ALA)]] realized federal funding was the best solution. In 1956, the ALA was finally able to persuade Congress to pass the [[Library Services Act]], which provided funds for public library initiatives but did not extend to buildings or land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Sandra|title=Information Services Today: An Introduction|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9781442239586|page=14|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aim==
Influenced by the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, a primary aim of the Library Services and Construction Act was to provide funding for underserved and/or disadvantaged communities in need of library service. Some of these groups include but are not limited to the institutionalized, the physically handicapped, low-income families, senior citizens, and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="AL198909"&gt;Bruce E. Daniels.  "In Defense of LSCA. (Library Services and Construction Act)". ''American Libraries'' '''v20.n8''' (Sept 1989): pp741(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reauthorizations==
In its thirty-year history, the Library Services and Construction Act has undergone numerous reauthorizations. Each amendment has been dictated by changing needs in the library community, and these needs have been identified and voiced by state librarians and public library directors alike. Some of these amendments include appropriations for [[literacy]] programs and the acquisition of foreign-language materials.&lt;ref name="AL198909" /&gt; While changes to the Library Services and Construction Act have sought to keep this piece of legislation current, through the years many have voiced opposition to certain aspects of this act.

==Modifications==
Federally funded, many programs for the purpose of educational and social development have more traditionally been a fiscal responsibility of each individual [[U.S. state|state]]. Though with shrinking state budgets, a shift to a state-funded program for library services and construction seemed somewhat unfeasible.  Additionally, a re-examination of which library services should be preserved and which should be abandoned has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Holley. "Is it time to rethink federal library legislation? (Library Services and Construction Act)". ''American Libraries'' '''v20.n6''' (June 1989): pp525(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps as a result of this opposition, in 1995 the LSCA was replaced by the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA), dropping construction from the federal funding available.

==Funded programs==
Its change of title in 1995 notwithstanding, numerous library programs and services have been initiated by funds through the Library Services and Construction Act, and continue to depend on those funds for their existence. An example of one program funded through the LSCA is Project PLUS (Promoting Larger Units of Service). This program uses federal funding so that library systems can demonstrate the services of a library to a group of unserved residents, so that they may experience what services and resources would be available to them if a referendum was passed in their community and a library was established.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Rohrer. "LSCA: A History of Innovation and Cooperation in Illinois Library Services". ''Illinois Libraries'' '''v80.n3''' (Summer 1998): pp.177-179.&lt;/ref&gt; While programs such as Project PLUS have provided success stories from the funds provided by the LSCA, discussion will undoubtedly continue as to the legitimacy and necessity of federal funds for libraries throughout the country.

On {{Start date|df=yes|2013|1|19}}, Megaupload was re-launched as [[Mega (service)|Mega]] under the domain name mega.co.nz (later moved to mega.nz).

==Software==

===Mega Manager===
[[File:Mega manager.png|thumb|Mega Manager screenshot]]
Megaupload also released its upload/download manager, Mega Manager,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megaupload.com/manager/ |title=Mega Manager |website=Megaupload.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412044013/http://www.megaupload.com/manager/ |archivedate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[download manager]] that featured a link-checker for Megaupload links as well as options to manage uploaded files, and to access the online control box that was on MegaUpload.

===Megakey===
Megakey was an [[adware]] application which removed bandwidth limitations on Mega services during "happy hour" periods. In return, the users running Megakey agreed to supply some personal identification and [[demographic]] data and to allow the substitution of ads on third party websites they visited with those of Megaupload.

===Megabox===
Megabox, a new form of media downloading site, was the first of its kind. Kim "Dotcom" described Megabox as "very similar to iTunes" except that it operated in a web browser using HTML5 technology and loaded "much faster than iTunes or anything else out there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1551347/kim-dotcom-at-sxsw-megabox-online-music-service-could-launch-in-next-six |first=Glenn |last=Peoples |title=Kim Dotcom at SXSW: Megabox Online Music Service Could Launch in Next Six Months |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filebox===
FileBox was a [[Adobe Flash|Flash applet]] that could be embedded onto any external webpage. It allowed users to upload content to Megaupload without having to visit the website itself or download the Mega Manager.

==Reception==

===Unavailability===
Although incorporated in Hong Kong, the company did not operate in Hong Kong. From 2009 onward, users with Hong Kong [[IP address]]es were banned from accessing the site. The reason for the block was never disclosed by Megaupload,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php?t=105752&amp;page=1 |title=Is Megaupload dead in Hong Kong? |website=Hongfire.com |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128112503/http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/105752-Is-Megaupload-dead-in-Hong-Kong |archivedate=28 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Hong Kong Customs officials have suggested that the block was an attempt to hinder law enforcement investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201201/20/P201201200626.htm |title=HK Customs-US authorities co-operation smashes a transnational piracy syndicate with over HK$300 million worth of crime proceeds restrained (with photos) |website=Hong Kong Government |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802044759/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201201/20/P201201200626.htm |archivedate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 23 May 2010, access to Megaupload was intermittently blocked by the internet authorities in Saudi Arabia by their regulator [[Communications and Information Technology Commission]].&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Rick |title=The Megaupload saga: A timeline of events |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/the-megaupload-saga-a-timeline-of-events/ |website=Digital Trends |accessdate=7 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121135820/http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/the-megaupload-saga-a-timeline-of-events/ |archivedate=21 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megavideo was also intermittently blocked in the [[United Arab Emirates]] due to pornographic content being accessible through the service.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

From 9 June 2011 onward, the Malaysian government through [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] ordered all ISPs in Malaysia to block Megaupload and Megavideo. Some ISPs reportedly blocked all the sites on the list while other ISPs throttled connection speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amanz.my/2011/06/skmm-meminta-penyedia-internet-menghalang-akses-ke-10-laman-perkongsian-popular/ |title=SKMM Meminta Penyedia Internet Menghalang Akses ke 10 Laman Perkongsian Popular |language=Malay |date=9 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219042207/http://amanz.my/2011/06/skmm-meminta-penyedia-internet-menghalang-akses-ke-10-laman-perkongsian-popular/ |archivedate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, access to Megaupload and Megavideo were blocked in [[India]] for [[Reliance Entertainment]] customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/india/india-starts-blocking-file-storage-websites-in-a-move-against-piracy/635 |title=India starts blocking file storage websites in a move against piracy |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210034900/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/india/india-starts-blocking-file-storage-websites-in-a-move-against-piracy/635 |archivedate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy |website=ZDNet |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a court order was obtained, citing illegal copies of the 2011 film ''[[Singham]]'' on file hosting sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medianama.com/2011/07/223-files-sharing-sites-blocked-in-india-because-reliance-big-pictures-got-a-court-order/ |title=Update: Files Sharing Sites Blocked In India Because Reliance BIG Pictures Got A Court Order |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914114735/http://www.medianama.com/2011/07/223-files-sharing-sites-blocked-in-india-because-reliance-big-pictures-got-a-court-order/ |archivedate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy |website=Medianama |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2012, U.S. federal prosecutors in the state of [[Virginia]] shut Megaupload down and laid charges against its founder [[Kim Dotcom]] and others for allegedly breaching [[copyright infringement]] laws.&lt;ref name="apindictment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mega.co.nz/ |title=Home |website=MEGA.co.nz |accessdate=19 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010717133953/http://www.mega.co.nz/ |archivedate=17 July 2001 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/megaupload-indicted-shuttered |title=Feds Shutter Megaupload, Arrest Executives |website=Wired |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2012 |first=David |last=Kravets |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209090650/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/megaupload-indicted-shuttered |archivedate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time after the closure of the site, users could access material via Google's [[web cache]] and [[The Internet Archive]]. One day after the indictment Google and Archive.org voluntarily removed the site mirrors to avoid the responsibility of hosting a website taken down for [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name="Net Giants react to Megaupload take-down."/&gt;

===Criticism===
In January 2011, [[MarkMonitor]] published a report entitled "Traffic Report: Online Piracy and Counterfeiting", which said that Megaupload and Megavideo were, along with [[RapidShare]], the top three websites classified as "digital piracy", with more than 21 billion visits per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markmonitor.com/download/report/MarkMonitor_-_Traffic_Report_110111.pdf |title=Traffic Report: Online Piracy and Counterfeiting |website=MarkMonitor |date=January 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megaupload responded by stating: "Activity that violates our terms of service or our acceptable use policy is not tolerated, and we go to great lengths to swiftly process legitimate [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] takedown notices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megaupload.com/?c=faq |title=FAQ |website=Megaupload |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906042015/http://www.megaupload.com/?c=faq |archivedate=6 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Mulligan, an analyst at [[Forrester Research]], pointed out that the number of visits did not necessarily indicate the number of downloads of illegal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12163161 |title=Piracy websites attract billions of visits |website=BBC News |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719213613/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12163161 |archivedate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megaupload Toolbar was said{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to redirect users to a custom error page when a [[HTTP 404|404]] error occurred in the user's browser. It was also said to contain spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecredence.com/?p=126 |title=Megaupload Toolbar is a Spyware which Changes Browser Settings |website=TheCredence.com |date=13 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511134904/http://www.thecredence.com/?p=126 |archivedate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBM Software said that the Megaupload toolbar is free of [[spyware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbmsoftware.com/spyware-net/Application/Megaupload_Toolbar |title=Megaupload Toolbar on Spyware-Net |website=FBM Software.com |accessdate=8 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628132839/http://www.fbmsoftware.com/spyware-net/Application/MegaUpload_Toolbar/ |archivedate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a file is uploaded to Megaupload and another file with the same hash is already found to exist, the uploader is asked if they would like to link to the already existing file. Therefore, a single file may contain multiple links to it. This has caused some controversy, since when a DMCA takedown notice is issued only the link that was provided is removed; not necessarily the file itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-what-made-it-a-rogue-site-worthy-of-destruction-120120/ |title=Megaupload: What it a rogue site worthy of destruction? |website=TorrentFreak.com |accessdate=22 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714201759/http://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-what-made-it-a-rogue-site-worthy-of-destruction-120120/ |archivedate=14 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2012 the [[United States Department of Justice]] seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. The lead prosecutor, [[Neil MacBride]], had formerly served as Vice President, Anti-Piracy and General Counsel, of the [[Business Software Alliance]], where he oversaw global anti-piracy enforcement and copyright policy.

===Arrests in New Zealand===
Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the [[New Zealand Police]] arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at [[Coatesville, New Zealand|Coatesville]] near [[Auckland]] on Friday, 20 January 2012 ([[Time in New Zealand|NZDT]], UTC+13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Megaupload founder arrested in NZ, site shut down |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/megaupload-founder-arrested-in-nz-site-shut-down-4694527 |date=20 January 2012 |website=TVNZ |accessdate=20 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723072147/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/megaupload-founder-arrested-in-nz-site-shut-down-4694527 |archivedate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/fbi-seeks-extradition-of-internet-pirate-20120120-1qacn.html |title=FBI seeks extradition of internet 'pirate' |last=Johnston |first=Kirsty |date=21 January 2012 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=21 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912081159/http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/fbi-seeks-extradition-of-internet-pirate-20120120-1qacn.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10780321 |title=Dotcom birthday party targeted |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |first=David |last=Fisher |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910004110/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10780321 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assets worth $17 million including art works and cars were seized.

On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Megaupload-accused-Kim-Schmitz-in-court-helicopter-part-of-bail-debate/tabid/423/articleID/240281/Default.aspx |title=Megaupload accused Kim Schmitz in court, helicopter part of bail debate |website=3news.co.nz |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730022205/http://www.3news.co.nz/Megaupload-accused-Kim-Schmitz-in-court-helicopter-part-of-bail-debate/tabid/423/articleID/240281/Default.aspx |archivedate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577178830739157386?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Judge Delays Kim Dotcom Bail Decision |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012 |first=Lucy |last=Craymer |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629100225/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203806504577178830739157386.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |archivedate=29 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that "he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/01/megaupload-founder-has-been-denied-bail/ |title=Megaupload Founder has been DENIED Bail |website=WordswithMeaning |accessdate=31 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526202027/http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/01/megaupload-founder-has-been-denied-bail/ |archivedate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the [[High Court of New Zealand]] upheld the decision to deny bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16869788 |title=Megaupload co-founder's bail appeal rejected by court |website=BBC News |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723162333/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16869788 |archivedate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/02/kim-dotcom-released-from-prison |title=Kim Dotcom Released From Prison |website=WordswithMeaning! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331172937/http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/02/kim-dotcom-released-from-prison/ |archivedate=31 March 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17122866 |title=Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom granted bail |website=BBC News |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719030910/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17122866 |archivedate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the [[extradition]] to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17257308 |title=Megaupload founder extradition papers filed by US |website=BBC News |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724081150/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17257308 |archivedate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG]] and [[Toyota Alphard|Toyota Vellfire]] that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/megaupload-founder-kim-schmitz-assets-worth-750000-returned-44480.html |title=Megaupload Founder Kim Schmitz: Assets Worth $750,000 Returned |website=autoevolution.com |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730025911/http://www.autoevolution.com/news/megaupload-founder-kim-schmitz-assets-worth-750000-returned-44480.html |archivedate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated "I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter," as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.

On 28 June 2012, [[High Court of New Zealand|New Zealand High Court]] judge Justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the [[search warrant]]s used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying "The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18623043 |title=Megaupload raid warrant 'invalid', New Zealand judge says |website=BBC News |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419193811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18623043 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18779866# |title=Megaupload extradition case delayed until March 2013 |website=BBC News |date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114042025/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18779866# |archivedate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand judge Justice Helen Winklemann said that U.S. authorities would need to provide evidence of "Internet piracy" before Dotcom was extradited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19280898 |title=Megaupload case: New Zealand court wants FBI evidence |website=BBC News |date=16 August 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117223504/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19280898 |archivedate=17 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2012, New Zealand's Prime Minister [[John Key]] ordered an inquiry into whether staff at the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] had unlawfully spied on Kim Dotcom and the other defendants in the case. Key commented "I expect our intelligence agencies to operate always within the law. Their operations depend on public trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19699196 |title=Kim Dotcom: Inquiry ordered into 'unlawful spying' |website=BBC News |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419193807/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19699196 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2014, it was reported that the proceedings to [[extradition|extradite]] Dotcom from New Zealand to the USA had been delayed until February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28193718|title=Kim Dotcom extradition hearing delayed again |website=BBC News |date=7 July 2014|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved.&lt;ref name="winforDotcom"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11320761 | title=A win for Dotcom over seized property | newspaper=The New Zealand Herald | date=8 September 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2014 | last=Bayer |first=Kurt | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2015, New Zealand judge Nevin Dawson ruled that Kim Dotcom, as well as three of his colleagues, can be extradited to the United States to face copyright infringement charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/technology/megaupload-founder-can-be-sent-to-us-judge-says.html |title=Megaupload Founder Can Be Sent to U.S., Judge Says |date=24 December 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Dotcom's lawyers said they would appeal the decision.

===Basis of indictment===
[[File:MegaUploadIndictment.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of the indictment, listing the defendants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78786408/Mega-Indictment |title=Mega Indictment |website=Scribd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The indictment&lt;ref name="indictment&amp;nbsp;— reasons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/wwmpapers/papers/78786408-Mega-Indictment.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1 |title=Mega Indictment |website=Google |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that Megaupload differed from other online [[File hosting service|file storage businesses]].

Media reports covering the case highlighted several points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's [[business model|operating model]] as being evidence of [[intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]]:&lt;ref name="indictment&amp;nbsp;— reasons" /&gt;

# In practice, the "vast majority" of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability. Continued storage is dependent upon regular downloads of the file occurring. Files that are infrequently accessed are rapidly removed in most cases, whereas popular downloaded files are retained. (items 7–8)
# Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising. Adverts are primarily viewed when files are downloaded and the business model is therefore not based upon storage but upon maximizing downloads. (items 7–8)
# Persons indicted have "instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... [and] ... have also shared with each other comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies of copyrighted content." (item 13)
# Persons indicted, unlike the public, are not reliant upon links to stored files, but can search the internal database directly. It is said{{by whom|date=January 2018}} they have "searched the internal database for their associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content". (item 14)
# A comprehensive takedown method is in use to identify [[child pornography]], but not deployed to remove infringing content. (item 24)
# Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants "made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works" (items 55–56)
# An incentive program was adopted encouraging the upload of "popular" files in return for payments to successful uploaders. (item 69e ''et al.'')
# Defendants explicitly discussed evasion and infringement issues, including an attempt to copy and upload the entire content of YouTube. (items 69i-l. YouTube: items 69 i,j,l,s)

====Counter arguments advanced====
Defense attorney Ira Rothken says that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.&lt;ref name="def"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57362609-261/megaupload-assembles-worldwide-criminal-defense/ |title=Megaupload assembles worldwide criminal defense |website=[[CNET]] |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |last=Sandoval |first=Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KangWaPo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/megaupload-lawyer-qanda-on-doj-criminal-case/2012/01/20/gIQA3HJhDQ_story.html |first=Cecilia |last=Kang |title=Megaupload lawyer Q&amp;A on DOJ criminal case |newspaper=Washington Post |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as said, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as "novel theories" of the law&lt;ref name="latimes novel"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2012/01/copyrights-feds-push-novel-theories-in-megaupload-case.html |title=Copyrights: Feds push a few novel theories in MegaUpload case |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and could be challenged in court. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' analysis stated that the author was "struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious";&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; likewise a [[TechDirt]] analysis concluded that while the [[Kim Dotcom|founder of Megaupload]] had a significant history of "flounting the law", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services".&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis"/&gt; Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:

:* Indictment cites lack of a site search as evidence supporting criminality, but in other copyright cases having a site search has been described as evidence in support of criminality and in ''[[Legal aspects of file sharing#Legal issues relevant to file sharing|Atari v. RapidShare]]'' &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; having a site search was agreed by the court as evidence of responsible activity given that some infringing content might exist and be searched for if one existed.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; In the case of ''[[IsoHunt]]'', the ''presence'' of a search feature was interpreted as evidence of inducement.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt; [[TechDirt]] commented that "To use the lack of a feature, that previously was shown to be a problem, as evidence of a conspiracy is crazy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The "top 100" list excluded copyrighted titles, but the indictment says this was evidence of concealing, rather than avoiding downloads of, infringing materials.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The indictment asserts as evidence that no effort was made to identify infringing files or users, in other words by acts of omission. But federal court rulings repeatedly agree that no duty exists to search these out.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; In particular, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' the Supreme Court looked at "substantial noninfringing uses"; mere lack of monitoring was not by itself sufficient to show wrongdoing or inducement.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; It may not be possible (or reasonable to require) the host to know and identify what activity is legitimate or not, as file sharing may be used by many content creators.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Deletion after a limited period of non-download is suggested as evidence of a motive. But many legitimate sites such as [[Imgur]] remove unused content after a while to free up server space. If files were routinely deleted after a short period it could equally suggest legitimate use - because it serves users who share legitimately for a short while, and enforces removal afterwards.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Much of the indictment, in the words of one analysis, "seems to be based on the simple assumption that encouraging more usage means they must be encouraging infringement", in other words there should be evidence of actual wrongdoing, not merely evidence of popular use. Many legitimate files are popular and popularly shared, and an assumption that paid use largely equates to infringing use would need evidence.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Failure to remove all links following a takedown request is often legitimate. For example the same content may be uploaded by legitimate and illegitimate users. Removing the infringing ''link'' does not affect legitimate uploaders. Removing the infringing ''file'' would wrongfully cause it to be deleted for legitimate users too.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt; Similarly, once child pornography is identified, it is ''always'' illegal for ''all'' users. But other material may be legal for some users and not for others. So the fact one case requires ''file'' removal and the other only requires ''link'' removal may well be correct conduct.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The indictment includes [[money laundering]] charges. But these include "basic payments" for web hosting, suggesting "[[lumping in]]"—adding matters that are in no way illegal to make a case look bad.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Megaupload had indicated willingness to attend court in the U.S. already, and answer civil cases.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;

====Safe harbor provisions====
The US [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] provides [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has [[actual knowledge]] and does nothing about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars |title=Why the feds smashed Megaupload |website=Ars Technica.com |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713194540/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload/ |archivedate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the DMCA "safe harbor" is less important in criminal cases than civil cases because defeating the first element, lack of knowledge or awareness of infringement, may be easier for the prosecution than meeting the "willfulness" requirement for criminal copyright liability.&lt;ref name="Benton Martin"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Benton |last1=Martin |first2=Jeremiah |last2=Newhall |ssrn=2229376 |title=Criminal Copyright Enforcement against Filesharing Services |date=6 March 2013 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy&amp;nbsp;– the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment says that Megaupload executives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 20, page 9 of the indictment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prosecutors said in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as "VV." Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.&lt;ref name="DMCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/17/justice/megaupload-com-indictment/ |title=Feds broaden piracy case against Megaupload.com |website=CNN |date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119091740/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/17/justice/megaupload-com-indictment/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a television interview with [[3 News]], Kim Dotcom said he was not a "piracy king", and said that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also said that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.&lt;ref name="3news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx |title=Kim Dotcom's first TV interview: 'I'm no piracy king' |website=[[3 News]] |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729131119/http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal defense action===
Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him and retained the services of [[Ira P. Rothken]], an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KangWaPo"/&gt;

Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney [[Robert S. Bennett|Robert Bennett]], who had confirmed he was going to represent Megaupload in the copyright infringement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/dc-attorney-robert-bennett-to-represent-megaupload-in-piracy-case-promises-vigorous-defense/2012/01/20/gIQAPCzGEQ_story.html |title=DC attorney Robert Bennett to represent Megaupload in piracy case, promises vigorous defence |newspaper=Washington Post |date=20 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131084804/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/dc-attorney-robert-bennett-to-represent-megaupload-in-piracy-case-promises-vigorous-defense/2012/01/20/gIQAPCzGEQ_story.html |archivedate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2012/01/20/renowned_attorney_bennett_to_represent_megaupload_1327113598/ |first=Matthew |last=Barakat |title=Renowned attorney Bennett to represent Megaupload |agency=Associated Press |website=[[Boston.com]] |date=20 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124043950/http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-21/business/30651208_1_file-sharing-website-sexual-harassment-copyright |archivedate=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/22/megauploads-high-profile-defense-lawyer-robert-bennett-withdraws-from-piracy-case/ |title=Megauploads high-profile defense lawyer Robert Bennett withdraws from piracy case |newspaper=[[National Post]] |location=Canada |accessdate=31 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717213710/http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/22/megauploads-high-profile-defense-lawyer-robert-bennett-withdraws-from-piracy-case/ |archivedate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ingram |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/us-usa-megaupload-bennett-idUSTRE80L0UV20120122 |title=U.S. lawyer for Megaupload.com withdraws |website=Reuters |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123003914/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/us-usa-megaupload-bennett-idUSTRE80L0UV20120122 |archivedate=23 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 23 January, attorney Paul Davison was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/23/internet-piracy-megaupload-idUKL4E8CN3X620120123 |first=Michael |last=Perry |title=Megaupload boss says innocent, rival stops file-sharing |website=Reuters UK |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm [[Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan|Quinn Emanuel]], retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, said in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms dropped out of the case after the DoJ informed them of potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel said this "conflict of interest" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/04/government-trying-to-deny-megaupload-legal-representation.ars?clicked=related_right |title=Government trying to deny Megaupload fair legal representation |website=Ars Technica |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707170141/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/government-trying-to-deny-megaupload-legal-representation/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Techdirt]] argued that while the [[Kim Dotcom|founder of Megaupload]] had a significant history of "flouting the law", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services".&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120120/00373617487/megaupload-details-raise-significant-concerns-about-what-doj-considers-evidence-criminal-behavior.shtml |title=Megaupload Details Raise Significant Concerns About What DOJ Considers Evidence Of Criminal Behavior |website=Techdirt |first=Mike |last=Masnick |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914001422/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120120/00373617487/megaupload-details-raise-significant-concerns-about-what-doj-considers-evidence-criminal-behavior.shtml |archivedate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Goldman]], a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]], described the Megaupload case as "a depressing display of abuse of government authority". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the "deeply unconstitutional effect" of denying legitimate users access to their data.&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt; Other legal commentators have expressed more skepticism toward Megaupload's likelihood of defending against charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement on "willfulness" grounds if the allegations of fact in the indictment turn out to be true.&lt;ref name="Benton Martin"/&gt;

The defence has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case and in a judgement at the end of May 2012, New Zealand judge [[David Harvey (jurist)|David Harvey]] granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/digital-notes-judge-presses-u-s-in-megaupload-case/ |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Ben |last=Sisario |title=Digital Notes: Judge Presses U.S. in Megaupload Case |date=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711193838/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/digital-notes-judge-presses-u-s-in-megaupload-case/ |archivedate=11 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but are dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/95215045/Torrent-Freak-Mega-Extra |title=Torrent Freak Mega Extra |website=Scribd.com |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, saying the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful.&lt;ref name="no jurisdiction"&gt;{{PacerRef

===Data retention===
Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users.&lt;ref name=Chloe1&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |title=Megaupload Shutdown Targets Pirates ...

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/megaupload-user-asks-court-return-his-video-files |title=Megaupload user asks court return of his video files |date=30 March 2012 |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220163557/https://www.eff.org/press/releases/megaupload-user-asks-court-return-his-video-files |archivedate=20 December 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over 9,000 USD a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that 35 million USD had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/us-megauploads-hosting-company-might-be-sued-next-120415/ |title=US Megaupload hosting company might be sued next |website=TorrentFreak |date=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121217191452/https://torrentfreak.com/us-megauploads-hosting-company-might-be-sued-next-120415/ |archivedate=17 December 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous===
Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and other websites were taken offline following concerted [[denial of service]] attacks attributed to [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9027246/Anonymous-attacks-FBI-website-over-Megaupload-raids.html |title=Anonymous attacks FBI website over Megaupload raids |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120211101/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9027246/Anonymous-attacks-FBI-website-over-Megaupload-raids.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=no |location=London |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Christopher |last=Williams |date=20 January 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous in revenge attack for MegaUpload shutdown |url=http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2012/01/anonymous-megaupload-ddos/#axzz1k55k0F00 |newspaper=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121055307/http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2012/01/anonymous-megaupload-ddos/ |archivedate=21 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gizmodo]] concurred that it was "almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled [[DDoS]] [Distributed Denial of Service] attack—and easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time", commenting that "if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more".&lt;ref name="Gizmodo" /&gt; Links posted in chatrooms and on [[Twitter]], when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]].
On 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com taking responsibility for the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anonymous post |website=Pastebin |url=http://pastebin.com/WEydcBVV |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719071740/http://pastebin.com/WEydcBVV |archivedate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[RT (TV network)|RT network]], Anonymous described the attacks as "the single largest Internet attack in its history".&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5877679/anonymous-kills-department-of-justice-site-in-megaupload-revenge-strike |title=Anonymous Goes on Megaupload Revenge Spree: DoJ, RIAA, MPAA, and Universal Music All Offline |last=Biddle |first=Sam |date=19 January 2012 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=31 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120185705/http://gizmodo.com/5877679/anonymous-kills-department-of-justice-site-in-megaupload-revenge-strike |archivedate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/anonymous-megaupload_n_1217418.html |title=Anonymous Responds To Megaupload Takedown; Claims Credit For DOJ, RIAA, MPAA, Universal Music Outages (UPDATE) |last=Smith |first=Gerry |date=19 January 2012 |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=31 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120114043/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/anonymous-megaupload_n_1217418.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible return of data===
On 31 May 2013, a New Zealand court ordered police to return any items not relevant to the case and to provide copies of relevant material to Dotcom and his associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-31/files-returned-to-kim-dotcom/4726460 | title=Police ordered to return seized files to internet mogul Kim Dotcom |website=ABC |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reactions===
Former French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping "criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works". "The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states" in the fight against online copyright infringement, he said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FBI unplugs top piracy site |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fbi-unplugs-top-piracy-site/story-e6frg6so-1226249800286 |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=20 January 2012 |date=20 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230222045/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fbi-unplugs-top-piracy-site/story-e6frg6so-1226249800286 |archivedate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file hosting service|File hosting websites]] limited the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating "All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled.

The '''Ministry of Justice of Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველოს იუსტიციის სამინისტრო}}, ''sakartvelos iustitsiis saministro'') is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Georgia]] in charge of regulating activities in the justice system, overseeing the public prosecutor, maintaining the legal system and public order, protection of the public and instituting law reforms in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The ministry is headed by [[Tea Tsulukiani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=124&amp;mod_id=0&amp;info_id=0&amp;new_year=0&amp;limit=0&amp;date=&amp;new_month=&amp;entrant=2 |title=Government of Georgia |accessdate=2011-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081927/http://www.government.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=124&amp;mod_id=0&amp;info_id=0&amp;new_year=0&amp;limit=0&amp;date=&amp;new_month=&amp;entrant=2 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of the judicial system in Georgia dates back to [[Caucasian_Iberia#Pharnavaz_I_and_his_descendants|Pharnavazi era]] when legislative functions were regulated by the People's Assembly and the Council of Elders. In 9th-10th centuries, the system was assigned to a state body called ''[[Darbazi]]'' (Chamber) which included clergy, aristocracy and the commons. This institution was in charge of issuing important legal documents, such as ''Samparavtmdzebnelo Law'' (Criminal Law), ''Bagrat Kurapalati Law'', ''Giorgi V Law'', ''Royal Court Regulations'', as well as translation and adaptation of international documents such as Law of Moses, Greek and Roman-Syrian laws, etc. A single collection of old documents was preserved and saved during the reign of [[Vakhtang VI]] in the beginning of the 18th century. The collection is known as the ''Book of Laws of Vakhtang VI'' (issued in 1703-1709).

King Vakhtang’s ''Dasturlamal'' (the Book of Regulations) has survived to the present day. Composed in 1707-1709, it contains description of the statesmen and assignment of their duties, survey and census of the population, economy, revenues, taxes and property accounts, etc. The duties assumed by the present day Minister of Justice of Georgia were divided among a Chancellor, Chief Bookkeeper and Chief Mandaturi (supervisor).
 
Despite establishment of Russian rule over Georgia, Georgian laws continued to function until the beginning of the 20th century, when any practice of traditional judicial system was ceased upon occupation of Georgia by the [[Bolshevik]]s in 1918.

The first Ministry of Justice of independent [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian Republic]] was established when the [[National Council of Georgia]] adopted an Act of Independence of Georgia on May 26, 1918 which functioned up until annexation of Georgia to Soviet Russia in 1921. According to the act of October 11, 1918, a Codification Subdivision was formed at the Ministry of Justice taking over the codification of legislation and publishing of official issue "Collection of Laws and Resolutions of the Government". 
After independence of Georgia was restored in 1991, the ministry was re-established.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=66 |title=Ministry of Justice of Georgia.

==Structure==
The ministry is headed by the minister aided by three deputy ministers. The ministry carries out its activities in accordance with the resolution enacted by the Presidential Decree No. 541 dated November 7, 2008. As of January 2000, the Ministry of Justice acquired the most important competences, such as governing the [[penitentiary system]] and its organizational management, functions of Public and Civil Register (in 2004), governing [[National Archives of Georgia|State Archives]] (in 2004); organizational maintenance of effective governing system, as well as of State Commission of territorial settlement reform and activities of its workgroups (in 2006).&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;

Main functions of the ministry are protection of state interests at national and international courts and tribunals; identification of standards of active regulatory acts; bringing Georgian legislation in accordance with international guidelines; 
formation of the State Register; adjustment of emigration and migration procedures; regulation of Notary Functions, Public Registry Services, Civil Registry Services; maintaining State Archives; enforcement of court decisions; arrangement of the state representation at the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=142 |title=Ministry of Justice of Georgia.

Later publications include a selection of copies with autographs, manuscript amendments and ownership marks, censor’s copies, artistic bindings, bibliophile and luxury publications. In addition to 28,000 rare publications, the collection includes 150 manuscripts. Research on old books has been conducted in the library for over 50 years.

The oldest book in the rare book collection is a work of [[Lambertus de Monte]], a theologian from [[Cologne]], - ''Copulatasuper tres libros Aristotelis De Anima...'' (Cologne, 1486). The oldest Estonian publication is [[Heinrich Stahl]]'s book of sermons ''Leyen Spiegel'' (Reval, 1641–1649) with parallel texts in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and in [[German language|German]].

==History==

On December 21, 1918, the Provisional Government of the Estonian Republic took the decision to establish the '''State Library'''. The primary collection of the Library was about 2,000 titles necessary for lawmaking and government, and the first users were the members of Parliament ([[Riigikogu]]). The Library was situated in two small rooms of the Parliament building in the [[Toompea Castle]].

During the time of the independent Republic of Estonia from 1918–1940, the Library developed and grew fast. In 1919, the Library began to receive a legal deposit copy of all printed matter published in Estonia. In 1921, the first international exchange agreements were concluded. In 1935 the State Library established an Archival Collection of all publications in the Estonian language and about Estonia. This was the beginning of a systematic acquisition of printed matter on Estonia and the Baltic countries. In the 1930s, the State Library started to perform more functions than those of a parliamentary library – the collections comprised about 50,000 items and the readership included outstanding intellectuals, cultural and public figures.

With the [[Estonian SSR|Soviet occupation]], the Library became a regular public library, known under the name of the '''State Library of the Estonian SSR'''. The role of the Library changed considerably: all links with foreign countries and their libraries were severed, and Russian publications predominated, mostly consisting of all-Union deposit copies. The bulk of Estonian and foreign publications was placed in restricted access collections. Between 1948 and 1992 the Library was housed in the former [[Estonian Knighthood House]] in Tallinn’s historic centre.

1953, the Library was named after [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]], a leading man of letters of the Estonian National Awakening and the author of the Estonian national epic, ''[[Kalevipoeg]]''. The collections then amounted to one million items already.

The liberation movement that began in the Baltic countries in the 1980s and the restoration of the independent Republic of Estonia on August 20, 1991 considerably changed the role of the Library.

In 1988, the '''Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald State Library''' was renamed the National Library of Estonia with a mission to collect, preserve and provide access to all documents published in the Estonian language and in Estonia, and also about or including information on Estonia.

In 1989, the Library’s legal status as a parliamentary library was restored with an obligation to provide information services for the Riigikogu and the Government. The present National Library of Estonia is a legal entity in public law, which operates pursuant to the [[National Library of Estonia Act]], adopted in 1998, and amended in 2002 and 2006, and its Statutes. Its collegial decision-making body is the National Library Board with members appointed by the Riigikogu.

===Library building===

The National Library building at [[Tõnismägi]] in Tallinn, specially designed for the library, was constructed between 1985 and 1993. The architect of the building is [[Raine Karp]] and its interior designer is [[Sulev Vahtra]]. The eight-storey building with two floors below ground level is until now the largest library in the Baltic countries. It houses 20 reading rooms with 600 reader’s seats, a large conference hall, a theatre hall and numerous exhibition areas. The Library’s stacks are designed to hold five million volumes. All stacks are equipped with shelves and air-conditioning, appropriate for preserving the documents.

The '''Paulet–Newcombe Agreement''' or '''Paulet-Newcombe Line''', was a 1923 agreement between the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] governments regarding the position and nature of the boundary between the [[League of Nations Mandate|Mandates]] of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], attributed to Great Britain, and the Mandate of [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and the [[French mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]], attributed to France.

Together with a preliminary 1920 agreement, these are known as the '''Franco-British Boundary Agreements'''.

==December 1920 agreement==
The boundary between the forthcoming [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] mandates was first defined in broad terms in the 1920 "Franco-British Convention on Certain Points Connected with the Mandates for Syria and the Lebanon, Palestine and Mesopotamia", signed in [[Paris]] by the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British Ambassador to France]], [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Charles Hardinge]] and the French Foreign Minister, [[Georges Leygues]], on 23 December 1920.&lt;ref name="treaty1920"&gt;Text available in ''American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 16, No. 3, 1922, 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRANCO-BRITISH CONVENTION"&gt;Text available in {{cite book|last=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, American Association for International Conciliation|title=International conciliation, Volume 166|year=1921|publisher=American Branch of the Association for International Conciliation|pages=297–303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IyoeAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA3-PA297&amp;ots=EV7ST3kmOu&amp;pg=RA3-PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; That agreement placed the bulk of the [[Golan Heights]] in the French sphere. 

The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise details of the border and mark it on the ground.&lt;ref name="treaty1920" /&gt;

==March 1923 agreement==
The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, which included a number of amendments. The amendments included:{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=147-8}}
* North East boundary moved westward (reducing the area of Palestine) to avoid splitting the lands of Emir Mahmud El-Fa’ur of  [[Quneitra]]{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=147-8}}
* Northern boundary moved northward (increasing the area of Palestine) to include the entire Sea of Galilee and the Yarmuk valley{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=147-8}}

It was approved with some caveats by the French and British governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923.&lt;ref name=1923A&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130702180004if_/http://www.hartzman.com/Israel/Mandate%20Era/British-French%20Boundary%20Agreement,%201923.pdf Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government respecting the Boundary Line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hámmé.

'''''Poulos v. New Hampshire''''', 345 U.S. 395 (1953),&lt;ref name="PoulosSCOTUS"&gt;{{ussc|name=Poulos v. New Hampshire|link=|volume=345|page=395|pin=|year=1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a [[New Hampshire]] city ordinance regarding permission to hold a meeting in a public park did not violate the appellant's rights to Free Exercise of Religion even if he and his group were arbitrarily and unlawfully denied a license to hold a religious meeting in that public park.

==Background==
A [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] municipal ordinance provided that "No theatrical or dramatic representation shall be performed or exhibited and no parade or procession upon any public street or way, and no open air public meeting upon any ground abutting thereon shall be permitted unless a license therefor shall first be obtained from the City Council."&lt;ref name="PoulosSCOTUS"/&gt;

The [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] had construed the discretion vested in the city council as "limited in its exercise by the bounds of reason, in uniformity of method of treatment upon the facts of each application, free from improper or inappropriate considerations and from unfair discrimination."

Thus, the discretion of the official was ministerial. The City could "take one of its small parks and devote it to public and nonreligious purposes under a system which is administered fairly and without bias or discrimination." In fact, the City of Portsmouth denied all religious groups the privilege of using the park for religious services.

The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who applied for a permit and were arbitrarily denied, nevertheless chose to hold a religious meeting in the public park. The preacher was arrested. They argued, as they had done on dozens of cases previously, that the arbitrary action of the city council was a defense to their "illegal" holding of the religious meeting.

==Decision of the Court==
The Court ruled in favor of the City, deciding that because no appeal to the denial was made, despite ample opportunity, punishment under the law was constitutional.

Justice Reed delivered the opinion of the Court.

===Dissenting opinions===
Justice Douglas' approach to Free Exercise/Speech in this case was first articulated nearly a decade earlier in ''[[Murdock v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Murdock v. Pennsylvania|link=|volume=319|page=105|pin=|year=1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks of the "preferred position" granted freedom of speech, religion, press and assembly by the First Amendment. "The case is therefore quite different from a legislative program in the field of business, labor, housing and the like where regulation is permissible." He quoted with approval Justice [[Owen Roberts|Roberts]]' opinion in ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Cantwell v. Connecticut|link=|volume=310|page=296|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the effect that even if there was an available remedy (such as mandamus) for abuses in the system of licensing, it still leaves in its place a system of [[prior restraint]] that was arbitrarily exercised.

Douglas was quite adamant: "There is no free speech in the sense of the Constitution when permission must be obtained from an official before a speech can be made." Thus, for him, the case was an example of prior restraint of a privileged freedom, a freedom that could be exercised with impunity if it was improperly curtailed by civic officials.

'''Reconciliation''' in [[family law]] is the process by which parties who are [[Legal separation|legally separated]] resume their marital relationship and [[cohabitation]].

Reconciliation is allowed because separation is revocable; state laws may require "the joint application of the parties, accompanied  with [[Preponderance of evidence|satisfactory evidence]] of their reconciliation ... by the court which rendered it, subject to such regulations and restrictions as the court thinks fit to impose."&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', N.Y.

'''''Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.''''', 530 U.S. 133 (2000), was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]] concerning [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act|age discrimination in employment]].

==Background==

In 1995, 57-year-old Roger Reeves and Joe Oswalt, who was in his mid-thirties, were supervisors at Sanderson Plumbing Products, being managed by 45-year-old Russell Caldwell. Caldwell reported a drop in production in the summer of 1995 to the director of manufacturing, Powe Chesnut, who was also married to the president of the company, Sandra Sanderson. Chesnut investigated briefly, and determined that Reeves, Oswalt, and Caldwell had all made errors in tracking time worked by their employees. Chesnut recommended to Sanderson that she fire Reeves and Caldwell, and in October 1995, she followed that recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.|volume=530|page=133|pin=137-38|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural history==

In June 1996, Reeves sued in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]] under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]]. He alleged that Chesnut "had demonstrated age-based animus" while they were working together, and that he had "absolute power" to make employment decisions, due to his position and his relationship with the president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 138.&lt;/ref&gt; That case ended with the judge instructing the jury that Reeves must prove that age "was a determinative or motivating factor" in the employment decision in order to find in favor of the plaintiff, and the jury returned a verdict awarding Reeves $35,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and an additional $35,000 in [[liquidated damages]] based on the willfulness of the discrimination.&lt;ref name=Reeves139&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed, saying that Reeves did not provide enough evidence to prove that his age was the cause of the employment decision in question. This decision arose out of the determination that the discriminatory comments made by Chesnut "were not made in the direct context of Reeves's termination".&lt;ref name=Reeves139/&gt;

==Questions at issue==

The court granted certiorari primarily to address the question of whether a ''prima facie'' case of discrimination is "adequate to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination" against the employer, when "sufficient evidence" is provided to disprove the employer's defense of its decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

Justice O'Connor delivered the majority opinion. Her first task was to set out the context of the case, starting with explaining that she would assume that ''[[McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green|McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green]]'', 411 U.S. 792 (1973), was the relevant standard for analyzing a case brought under the ADEA, because nobody had disputed that fact, even though the court had never addressed that issue before.&lt;ref name=Reeves142&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 142.&lt;/ref&gt; She also noted that they would assume that the plaintiff met his burden in laying out a ''prima facie'' case against the defendant, because again, nobody had disputed that contention, and ample supporting evidence had been presented.&lt;ref name=Reeves142/&gt;

She then turned to the next stage of the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting]] framework to determine whether the defendant had then provided adequate evidence that the employment decision in question had been made for "a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', quoting {{ussc|name=Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine|link=Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine|volume=450|page=248|pin=254|year=1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That burden, too, was met, according to O'Connor's analysis.

The final prong considered in the case was whether the plaintiff had provided, after the defendant's production of evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for the decision, proof by "a preponderance of the evidence" that the defendant's reason is merely pretext.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 144.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point, the court noted that most of the defendant's evidence for nondiscrimination was negated by the plaintiff at trial, and also that the Fifth Circuit agreed, but did not find this to be sufficient for a ruling in favor of Reeves.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 144-146.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor explained that the Fifth Circuit was correct to think that the trial court ''could'' find in favor of the defendant if the nondiscriminatory reason was not disproven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they were mistaken in claiming that they were ''compelled'' to.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning is that, if an employer is shown to be untruthful about the reason for a decision, they may be inferred to have been covering up actual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court stopped short of saying that a court ''must'' assume discrimination where a nondiscriminatory reason is shown to be false. The trier of fact may reasonably find for the employer where the plaintiff makes only a weak showing of evidence as to the untruth of the employer's defense, or where there is ample evidence of another nondiscriminatory reason that the employer did not offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

After determining that the trial court could have found in favor of Reeves, O'Connor turned to examining the procedural questions at hand. She determined that respondent had not been entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, both because there was a question of fact to be decided by a jury in evaluating the truth of the defendant's nondiscriminatory explanation, and because the court of appeals should have reviewed the entire record in a manner favorable to the nonmoving party, which in this case was Reeves.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Ginsburg's opinion concurring in the judgment===
Justice Ginsburg concurred in the judgment but suggested that, because the court of appeals required Reeves to produce evidence that was neither a ''prima facie'' case nor evidence contradicting the defendant's proffered reasons, their decision could be overturned without any broader holding.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;''Reeves'', 530 U.S. at 154 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

She also wrote separately to note that future cases may require the court to examine exactly which circumstances may give rise to the plaintiff being required to provide further evidence. She stated that such cases will be rare, because a dishonest defendant may be assumed to have some level of culpability, based on a fundamental principle of evidence law.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt;

==Significance==
This case lays out a framework for determining liability as part of the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting]] framework, and clarifies parts of that framework as it applies to cases where the employer's reasons for making the decision are shown to be false. This was also the first case brought under the ADEA where the Supreme Court used the McDonnell Douglas framework to make their decision, though they left that question open for another case to decide, mostly because they weren't asked to rule on the matter.

'''Rolls-Royce New Zealand Ltd v [[Carter Holt Harvey]] Ltd''' [2005] 1 NZLR 324 is decision of the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] regarding tort claims in situations where a claim can be in both [[tort]] and [[contract]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=6th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=9781877511400|year=2010 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Carter Holt entered into a contract with ECNZ (now Genesis Energy) for them to construct a cogeneration plant at their Kinleith paper mill that would be fueled by waste byproduct from the mill, with the contract having a non liability clause.

ECNZ in turn subcontracted the work to Rolls Royce.

Problems later were experienced with the generators that were installed, and CHH sued ECNZ for breach of contract. As there was no contract between CHH and Rolls Royce, they were sued for negligence in tort.

Rolls Royce applied for the tort claim against them to be struck out on the basis that ECNZ could not have a claim in both contract and tort.

==Held==
The court ruled where parties are involved in complex commercial relationships, there could only be duties owed in contract, and not in tort. Accordingly, the court granted Rolls Royces application to strike out part of the claim.

However, the court did leave open to a claim in tort still being arguable for misrepresentation claims in tort, as per in [[Hedley Byrne]].

[[File:Конституция РСФСР 1918 года.jpg|thumb|The constitution]]
The '''first constitution of Russia''', also called the '''Basic Law''' (Основной закон, ''Osnovnoy zakon'') which governed the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], described the regime that assumed power in the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. This constitution, which was ratified soon after the ''Declaration Of Rights Of The Working And Exploited People'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declaration Of The Rights Of Labouring And Exploited People|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/jan/03.htm|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[Pravda]]|date=3 January 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; formally recognized the working class as the ruling class of [[Russia]] according to the principle of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], therein making the Russian SFSR the world's first constitutionally [[Socialism|socialist]] state.

The ultimate aims of the state were outlined as: "the abolition of the exploitation of men by men, the entire abolition of the division of the people into classes, the suppression of exploiters, [and] the establishment of a socialist society." The constitution stated that an historical alliance had been formed between the workers and peasants, who together would govern the state through the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]. The constitution explicitly denied political power to higher classes of Russian society or to those who supported the [[White movement|White]] armies in the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918–21). To prevent the higher classes from re-claiming state power, the first article called for all workers and peasants to be armed and organized into a [[Red Army]] while the higher classes be fully disarmed.

Supreme power rested with the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], made up of deputies from local soviets across Russia. The steering committee of the Congress of Soviets—known as the [[Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets|Central Executive Committee]]—acted as the "supreme organ of power" between sessions of the congress and as the [[Collegiality|collective]] [[President|presidency]] of the state.

The congress elected the [[Council of People's Commissars]] ([[Sovnarkom]], ''Sovet narodnykh kommissarov'') as the administrative arm of the young government and defined its responsibilities as "general administration of the affairs of the state". (The Sovnarkom had exercised governmental authority from November 1917 until the adoption of the 1918 constitution July 10 by the Congress of Soviets.)

One of the first Soviet iterations of a perennial biblical phrase appeared in Article 18, which declares labour to be the duty of all citizens of the Republic, and sloganeers: '[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat]]!'

Importantly, the 1918 Russian Constitution's main principles served as a precursor to the ensuing constitutions of both united and autonomous Soviet republics.  They were recognized as fundamental to the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]], which was the formative document of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&lt;ref name="Presidential"&gt;{{cite web |title=The first Constitution of RSFSR adopted 10 July 1918 |publisher=[[Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library]] |url=http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/History/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=588 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Solar Decathlon Europe''' is an international competition that challenges collegiate teams to design and build houses powered exclusively by the sun. The winner of the competition is the team able to score the most points in 10 contests.

On Oct. 18, 2007, the Spanish and U.S. governments signed a memorandum of understanding in which the Spanish Ministry of Housing committed to organize and host Solar Decathlon Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solardecathlon.gov/sd_europe.html U.S. Department of Energy page on SD Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723173342/http://www.solardecathlon.gov/sd_europe.html |date=2015-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., next to the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid’s Casa Solar during the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2007 competition. The American signatory was Alexander A. Karsner, assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Department of the U.S. Department of Energy, with Fernando Magro Fernández, undersecretary of housing of the Ministry of Housing representing the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdeurope.org/sde_menu.htm Select "SD Europe" for more information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714053557/http://www.sdeurope.org/sde_menu.htm |date=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solar Decathlon Europe 2010 ==
Modeled after the U.S. Department of Energy [[Solar Decathlon]], the first '''Solar Decathlon Europe''' took place in [[Madrid]], Spain, in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdeurope.org/sde_menu.htm Select "History" for more information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714053557/http://www.sdeurope.org/sde_menu.htm |date=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decathletes from 17 teams spent 10 days competing in the Villa Solar near the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] (Palacio Real).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/06/virginia-tech-wins-2010-solar-decathlon-europe Renewable Energy World report]&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of task completion, measurement, and jury scoring determined Solar Decathlon Europe's first champion: [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] with Lumenhaus project.

In the United States, a '''special prosecutor''' (or '''special counsel''', '''independent counsel''', and '''independent prosecutor''') is a [[lawyer]] appointed to [[Criminal investigation|investigate]], and potentially [[prosecution|prosecute]], a particular case of suspected wrongdoing for which a [[conflict of interest]] exists for the usual prosecuting authority. Other jurisdictions have similar systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-idUSKBN16D0EC|title=South Korea prosecutor paves way for charges against Park if impeachment upheld|date=2017-03-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Special Prosecutors|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/criminal-justice/bc-prosecution-service/about/special-prosecutors |publisher=British Columbia government|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the investigation of an [[allegation]] against a sitting [[President of the United States|President]] or [[attorney-general]] might be handled by a special prosecutor rather than by an ordinary prosecutor who would otherwise be in the position of investigating their own superior. Investigations into other persons connected to the government but not in a position of direct authority over the prosecutor, such as cabinet secretaries or election campaigns, have also been handled by special prosecutors.

While the most prominent special prosecutors have been those appointed since the 1870s to investigate presidents and those connected to them, the term can also be used to refer to any prosecutor appointed to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance thereof. The concept originates in state law: "state courts have traditionally appointed special prosecutors when the regular government attorney was disqualified from a case, whether for incapacitation or interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Federal Special Prosecutor in American Politics|last=Harriger|first=Katy|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=1992|isbn=0-7006-0535-5|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because district attorneys' offices work closely with police, some activists argue that cases of police misconduct at the state and local level should be handled by special prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justiceinpolicing.com/policy-reforms/independent-oversight/policy-11-special-or-independent-prosecutors/|title=Policy 11: Special or Independent Prosecutors {{!}} Justice in Policing Toolkit|website=www.justiceinpolicing.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The terms 'special prosecutor', 'independent counsel', and 'special counsel' have the same fundamental meaning, and their use (at least at the federal level in the U.S.) is generally differentiated by the time period to which they are being applied. The term 'special prosecutor' was used throughout the Watergate era, but was replaced by the less confrontational 'independent counsel' in the 1983 reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/history.html|title=The Office - A Brief History Of The Independent Counsel Law {{!}} Secrets Of An Independent Counsel {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those appointed under that act after 1983 are generally referred to as 'independent counsels'. Since the independent counsel law expired in 1999, the term 'special counsel' has been used. This is the term used in the current U.S. government regulations concerning the appointment of special counsels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=e-CFR: TITLE 28—Judicial Administration|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=28f9a33cf15632118467b6a4974270e0&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt28.2.600&amp;rgn=div5|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term 'special prosecutor' is sometimes used in historical discussions of such figures before 1983, the term 'special counsel' appears to have been frequently used as well, including, for example, in contemporary newspaper accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/12/10/79262594.pdf|title=THE WHISKY RING FRAUDS.; THE PROSECUTIONS IN ST.

==United States history at the federal level==

===Pre-Watergate===
The first federal special prosecutor, [[John B. Henderson]], was appointed by [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] in 1875 to investigate the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal. After attempting to stifle Henderson's investigation of the president's personal secretary, Grant fired Henderson on the basis that Henderson's statements to a grand jury regarding Grant were impertinent.&lt;ref name="govinfo.library.unt.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/oic/SMALTZ/speeches/GTLJ.htm|title=OIC Smaltz: Speeches and Articles: Georgetown Law Journal: A View From Inside|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following criticism, Grant appointed a new special prosecutor, [[James Broadhead]], to continue the investigation.

[[James A. Garfield|James Garfield]] appointed the next special prosecutor, William Cook, in 1881 to investigate the [[Star route scandal]]. Cook continued his investigation into the [[Chester A. Arthur|Chester Arthur]] administration. Under the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] administration, special prosecutors were appointed to investigate two scandals. In 1903, Roosevelt appointed two special prosecutors (a Democrat and a Republican) to investigate allegations of bribery at the Post Office Department. In 1905, Roosevelt's attorney general, [[Philander C. Knox|Philander Knox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations|last=Greenberg|first=Gerald|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|isbn=0-313-30735-0|location=Westport, CT|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed [[Francis J. Heney|Francis Heney]] special prosecutor to investigate the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]].

[[Calvin Coolidge]] appointed two special counsels, [[Atlee Pomerene]] and [[Owen Roberts]] to investigate the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. This appointment was unique in that it was mandated under a special Congressional joint resolution, and was subject to approval in the Senate, similarly to a cabinet appointment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/teapotdome.htm|title=A summary of the Teapot Dome scandal from the Brookings Institution|website=academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was unique in the history of federal special prosecutors.

In 1952, [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] appointed [[Newbold Morris]] "special assistant to the Attorney General" to investigate the corruption at the Bureau of Internal Revenue following Congressional pressure and calls for a special prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations|last=Greenberg|first=Gerald|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|isbn=0-313-30735-0|location=Westport, CT|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Morris submitted a lengthy questionnaire on personal finances to be completed by all senior executive officers, he was fired by Attorney General [[J. Howard McGrath|Howard McGrath]], who was in turn fired by the president. Following the appointment of a new attorney general, the investigation was continued through regular channels.

===Watergate===
Before his May 25, 1973, appointment as [[Richard Nixon]]'s attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson|Elliott Richardson]] had agreed at his Senate confirmation hearing to appoint a [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] special prosecutor, and so immediately on taking office appointed [[Archibald Cox]] under a special one-time regulation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43112.pdf|title=Independent Counsels, Special Prosecutors, Special Counsels, and the Role of Congress|last=Maskell|first=Jack|date=June 20, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox first requested and then subpoenaed the [[Nixon White House tapes]]; secret recordings Nixon had made of conversations in the Oval Office and elsewhere. The Nixon administration refused to produce the tapes citing [[executive privilege]], and the dispute was fought in court until October.

After a Court of Appeals instructed the president to comply with the special prosecutor's subpoena, Nixon ordered the special prosecutor fired. In a [[constitutional crisis]] that became known as the [[Saturday Night Massacre]], both the attorney general and deputy attorney general (who had both made promises regarding the special prosecutor in their Senate confirmation hearings) resigned rather than carry out the order to fire Cox. [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]], who was third in line at the Department of Justice, then fired Cox. Initially, the Nixon White House announced that the office of the special prosecutor had been abolished, but after public outcry Nixon instead had Bork appoint [[Leon Jaworski]] as the second Watergate special prosecutor. The firing was ruled illegal in the case of Nader v. Bork, but, as a new special prosecutor had already been appointed, the case was already moot when decided, and the decision was never appealed past the [[United States district court|district court]].&lt;ref name="Nader v. Bork"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/366/104/1502657/|title=Nader v. Bork, 366 F. Supp. 104 (D.D.C. 1973)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaworski continued Cox's pursuit of the White House tapes, but Nixon resisted. He raised [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] questions under the U.S. Constitution. Since the special counsel is a member of the [[Executive Branch|executive branch]], Nixon argued that the special counsel is ultimately answerable to the president and that the president could not be compelled by a subpoena issued by his own subordinate. The tapes were ultimately released following the Supreme Court decision in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]''. Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, and Jaworski resigned about two and a half months later, to be replaced by his (and Cox's) deputy, Henry Ruth Jr.—who in turn resigned in 1975, leaving [[Charles Ruff]] the fourth and final Watergate special prosecutor.

Acting under his existing appointment as Watergate special prosecutor, Ruff conducted an unrelated investigation into whether Gerald Ford had misused campaign funds while a congressman, clearing the new president of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Gerald |year=2000 |title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOgCthdaJqIC&amp;pg=PA293#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-313-30735-0 |oclc=918095805 |pages=293–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics in Government Act===
Inspired in part by Watergate, in 1978 Congress passed the [[Ethics in Government Act]]. Title VI of this act was known as the Special Prosecutor Act and later renamed the Independent Counsel Act, which established formal rules for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The appointment of special prosecutors varied in important ways from appointments made before and since. Majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally request the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor on a particular matter, but the decision of whether or not to appoint the independent counsel remained with the attorney general and was not reviewable in court. If the attorney general decided not to appoint an independent counsel in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the decision to appoint a special prosecutor was still made by the attorney general, the actual selection of the special prosecutor was made by a three-judge panel called the Special Division, selected from the Courts of Appeals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/special.html|title=The Office - What Is The Special Division? {{!}} Secrets of an Independent Counsel |work=FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law did not allow special prosecutors to be removed except under specific circumstances such as wrongdoing or incapacitation. The special prosecutor provisions in the bill were temporary but were reauthorized by Congress in 1983 and 1987, expiring five years later in 1992, they were reinstated for another five years in 1994 before expiring again in 1999. The [[constitutionality]] of the law was affirmed by a 7–1 decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]''.

Roughly twenty special prosecutors (called independent counsels after 1983) were appointed under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/chart.html|title=The Office - Independent Counsel Investigations, 1978 To The Present {{!}} Secrets of an Independent Counsel |work=FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]] administrations. These include significant investigations into the [[Iran–Contra affair]] and the [[Whitewater controversy]], the latter of which ultimately led to the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] over the [[Lewinsky scandal]]. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by independent counsels during this period.

During the period 1992–1994 when the independent counsel provisions were not in force, Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] appointed [[Robert B. Fiske|Robert Fiske]] special counsel to investigate Whitewater. When the law was reauthorized in 1994, Reno invoked it to order an independent counsel be appointed to investigate Whitewater, and suggested Fiske continue in that role. Instead, [[Ken Starr]] was given the job by the three-judge panel. Starr resigned and was replaced by [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] in 1999 just before the expiration of the independent counsel statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Starr's Chosen Successor Draws Praise, Criticism |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/17/news/mn-23285 |agency=From ''The Washington Post'' |date=1999-10-17 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray formally concluded the Whitewater investigation in 2003.

===Current regulations===
Since the expiration of the independent counsel statute in 1999, there has been no federal statutory law governing the appointment of a special counsel. Upon the law's expiration in 1999, the Justice Department, under Attorney General Janet Reno, promulgated procedural regulations governing the appointment of special counsels.

In 1999, these regulations were used by Reno to appoint [[John Danforth]] special counsel to investigate the FBI's handling of the [[Waco siege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/1999/agwaco9999.htm|title=09-09-99: PRESS CONFERENCE WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO RE: APPOINTMENT OF FORMER SENATOR JOHN DANFORTH TO HEAD WACO PROBE|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plame affair====
In 2003, during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] was appointed special counsel to investigate the [[Plame affair]] by [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[James Comey]] after the [[Judicial disqualification|recusal]] of Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]].

====Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)====
{{Main|Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)}}
On May 17, 2017, former [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] was appointed special counsel to take over the previous FBI investigation of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election]] by Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] after the recusal of Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]].&lt;ref name="Appointment of Special Prosecutor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Appointment of Special Prosecutor|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel|website=Department of Justice|publisher=Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal authority==
In 1999, the [[Department of Justice (United States)|Department of Justice]] under Attorney General Janet Reno promulgated regulations for the future appointment of special counsels. As of 2018, these regulations remain in effect in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28, part 600 (28 CFR §600).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The regulations restrict the power to fire the special counsel into the hands of the attorney general alone, and they forbid the firing of the special counsel without good cause. They are internal Department of Justice regulations deriving their power from various acts of Congress, such as U.S. Code, Title 28, section 510 (28 U.S.C. 510).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=28 U.S. Code § 510 - Delegation of authority |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/510 |website=Cornell Law School |accessdate=November 8, 2018|quote=The Attorney General may from time to time make such provisions as he considers appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, employee, or agency of the Department of Justice of any function of the Attorney General.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress has the power to directly limit the firing of special counsels or to delegate that power to the Attorney General. An agency regulation promulgated within the authority granted by statute has the force and effect of law, is binding upon the body that issues it, and can't be arbitrarily revoked.&lt;ref name="Nader v. Bork"/&gt;

The existence of a law or regulations specifying the process to appoint a special counsel has not stopped the attorney general (or acting attorney general) from using their statutory authority to appoint a special counsel by other means, as has happened twice. Despite the passage of the Ethics in Government Act the previous year, [[Paul J. Curran|Paul Curran]] was appointed to investigate Jimmy Carter's peanut business in 1979 under the attorney general's statutory authority (and was selected by him rather than by a three-judge panel as under the law), ostensibly because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the passage of the act.&lt;ref name="govinfo.library.unt.edu"/&gt; Patrick Fitzgerald's appointment as special counsel in 2003 was specifically not made under the 28 CFR 600 regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/osc/documents/2006_03_17_exhibits_a_d.pdf|title=December 30, 2003 Letter from Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey to Patrick J. Fitzgerald|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special counsel regulations specify that a special counsel must be a lawyer from outside the US government, while Fitzgerald was already a federal prosecutor at the time of his appointment.

===Initiating a special counsel investigation===
The decision to appoint a special counsel rests with the attorney general (or acting attorney general). The current special counsel regulations specify that:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and—
{{plainlist|
*(a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and
*(b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.}}}}

The attorney general sets the subject jurisdiction of the special counsel:

{{quote|The jurisdiction of a Special Counsel shall be established by the Attorney General. The Special Counsel will be provided with a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated. The jurisdiction of a Special Counsel shall also include the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter being investigated and/or prosecuted.}}

The choice of whom to appoint is to be made by the attorney general with the following guidelines:

{{quote|An individual named as Special Counsel shall be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking, and with appropriate experience to ensure both that the investigation will be conducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies. The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States Government. Special Counsels shall agree that their responsibilities as Special Counsel shall take first precedence in their professional lives, and that it may be necessary to devote their full time to the investigation, depending on its complexity and the stage of the investigation.}}

===Terminating a special counsel investigation===
Generally, the special counsel him or herself decides when an investigation will terminate, with or without formal charges being pursued. The special counsel typically issues a final report on their investigation at this time. The current special counsel regulations specify that&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel."

====Firing the special counsel====
The current special counsel regulations specify that:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The Special Counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney General may remove a Special Counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies. The Attorney General shall inform the Special Counsel in writing of the specific reason for their removal.}}

===Role of the legislative and judicial branches===
Since the expiration of the independent counsel provisions in the Ethics in Government Act in 1999, as was the case before 1978, neither Congress nor the courts have any official role in the appointment of a special counsel; however Congress can use other powers to pressure an administration into appointing a special counsel. This happened, for example, in the appointment of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox; senators secured a promise from Attorney General nominee Richardson to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. Congress also has independent authority to investigate the president and their close associates through Congressional hearings as part of its government oversight role.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==At the state level==
Special prosecutors are appointed in state court with greater frequency than federal, and most often in cases where a conflict of interest arises or to avoid even the appearance such a conflict exists. In local state governments, special prosecutors are appointed by a judge, government official, organization, company or group of citizens to prosecute violations of law committed by one or more governmental agents and procure indictments for actions taken under color of state law. Unlike in courts having federal jurisdiction, where the terms "special counsel" and "independent counsel" have a uniform definition, in state court meanings of legal terms continually vary, but with "special prosecutor" referencing the appointment of an attorney (supra) in contemplation of representation and prosecution of one or more government agent(s) for unlawful conduct.

The information presented here covers the legal implications of [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES), rather than [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPSCs). The laws surrounding the two differ because while both have similar capacities in differentiation, their modes of derivation are not. While embryonic stem cells are taken from embryoblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells are undifferentiated from [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] adult cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19269371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Soldner F, Hockemeyer D, Beard C, Gao Q, Bell GW, Cook EG, Hargus G, Blak A, Cooper O, Mitalipova M, Isacson O, Jaenisch R |title=Parkinson's disease patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells free of viral reprogramming factors |journal=Cell |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=964–77 |year=2009 |pmid=19269371 |pmc=2787236 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stem cell]]s are cells found in most, if not all, multi-cellular organisms. A common example of a stem cell is the [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSC) which are multipotent stem cells that give rise to cells of the blood lineage. In contrast to multipotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and are thought to be able to give rise to all cells of the body. Embryonic stem cells were isolated in mice in 1981, and in humans in 1998.&lt;ref name=without&gt;John Ydstie and Joe Palca, "Embryonic Stem Cells Made Without Embryos," ''NPR'', November 21, 2007, found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16493814 NPR website story of 11-21-09].  Retrieved April 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stem cell treatments]] are a type of cell therapy that introduce new cells into adult bodies for possible treatment of [[cancer]], [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], [[diabetes]], and other medical conditions. [[Cell cloning|Cloning]] also might be done with stem cells.  Stem cells have been used to repair tissue damaged by disease.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Neel and Joanne Silberner, "Stem Cells Used In Woman's Windpipe Transplant," ''All Things Considered'', November 18, 2009, found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97210169 NPR story of 11-18-2008]. Retrieved April 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Embryonic Stem (ES) cells are cultured from the embryoblast 4–5 days after fertilization, harvesting them is most often done from donated embryos from ''in vitro'' fertilization (IVF) clinics. In January 2007, researchers at [[Wake Forest University]] reported that "stem cells drawn from amniotic fluid donated by pregnant women hold much of the same promise as embryonic stem cells."&lt;ref name=without /&gt;

==Europe==
The [[European Union]] has yet to issue consistent regulations with respect to stem cell research in member states. Whereas [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] prohibit or severely restrict the use of embryonic stem cells, Greece, [[Sweden]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have created the legal basis to support this research.&lt;ref name=Embo&gt;[http://www.embo.org EMBO, the European Molecular Biology Organization's official website].  Accessed April 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Belgium]] bans reproductive cloning but allows therapeutic cloning of embryos.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt; [[France]] prohibits reproductive cloning and embryo creation for research purposes, but enacted laws (with a [[sunset provision]] expiring in 2009) to allow scientists to conduct stem cell research on imported a large amount of embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt;  [[Germany]] has restrictive policies for stem cell research, but a 2008 law authorizes "the use of imported stem cell lines produced before May 1, 2007."&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt; [[Italy]] has a 2004 law that forbids all sperm or egg donations and the freezing of embryos, but allows, in effect, using existing stem cell lines that have been imported.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt;  [[Sweden]] forbids reproductive cloning, but allows therapeutic cloning and authorized a stem cell bank.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Embo /&gt;

According to modern stem cell researchers, [[Spain]] is one of the leaders in stem cell research and currently has one of the most progressive legislations worldwide with respect to hESC research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.05.016 |pmid=19497274 |title=Stem Cell Research in Spain: If Only They Were Windmills … |journal=Cell Stem Cell |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=483–6 |year=2009 |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos Izpisúa }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Spanish law allows existing frozen embryos - of which there are estimated to be tens of thousands in [[Spain]] - to be kept for patient's future use, donated for another infertile couple, or used in research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_11689.asp{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Spain's laws state that embryos left over from IVF and donated by the couple that created them can be used in research, including ES cell research, if they have been frozen for more than five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_12163.asp{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] amended the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]] (since amended by the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008]]) to permit the destruction of embryos for hESC harvests but only if the research satisfies one of the following requirements:

# Increases knowledge about the development of embryos,  
# Increases knowledge about serious disease, or  
# Enables any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.

The United Kingdom is one of the leaders in stem cell research, in the opinion of Lord Sainsbury, Science and Innovation Minister for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4124035&amp;chk=sQKTPr UK Government Press Release].&lt;/ref&gt; A new £10 million stem cell research centre has been announced at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/genes/article/0,,1828492,00.html The Guardian website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
The primary legislation in [[South Africa]] that deals with embryo research is the Human Tissue Act, which is set to be replaced by Chapter 8 of the National Health Act. The NHA Chapter 8 has been enacted by parliament, but not yet signed into force by the president. The process of finalising these regulations is still underway. The NHA Chapter 8 allows the Minister of Health to give permission for research on embryos not older than 14 days. The legislation on embryo research is complemented by the South African Medical Research Council's Ethics Guidelines. These Guidelines advise against the creation of embryos for the sole purpose of research. In the case of ''Christian Lawyers Association of South Africa &amp; others v Minister of Health &amp; others''&lt;ref&gt;1998 (4) SA 113 (T), 1998 (11) BCLR 1434 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the Bill of Rights is not applicable to the unborn. It has therefore been argued based on constitutional grounds (the right to human dignity, and the right to freedom of scientific research) that the above limitations on embryo research are overly inhibitive of the autonomy of scientists, and hence unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jordaan DW |title=Science versus anti-science: the law on pre-embryo experimentation |journal=South African Law Journal |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=618–34 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/ju_salj/ju_salj_v124_n3_a12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Stem cell laws and policy in the United States}}
Federal law places restrictions on funding and use of hES cells through amendments to the budget bill.&lt;ref name=Pew /&gt; In 2001, [[George W. Bush]] [[George W. Bush#Stem cell research and first use of veto power|implemented a policy]] limiting the number of stem cell lines that could be used for research.&lt;ref name=without /&gt; There were some state laws concerning stem cells that were passed in the mid-2000s. [[New Jersey]]'s 2004 [[S1909/A2840]] specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and [[Missouri]]'s 2006 [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006)|Amendment Two]] legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state. On the other hand, [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]], [[Michigan]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] passed laws to prohibit the creation or destruction of human embryos for medical research.&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;Christine Vestal, Staff Writer, Stateline.org, "Stem Cell Research at the Crossroads of Religion and Politics," Pew Forum paper, July 17, 2008, found at [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=316 Pew Forum website].  Accessed April 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States#Stem cell research|Bush's second term]], in July 2006, he used his first Presidential veto on the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]]. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was the name of two similar bills, and both were vetoed by President George W. Bush and were not enacted into law.  [[New Jersey]] congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] wrote a [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)#section Stem cell research|Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005]], which made some narrow exceptions, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

In November 2004, [[California]] voters approved [[Proposition 71]], creating a US$3 billion state taxpayer-funded institute for stem cell research, the [[California Institute for Regenerative Medicine]]. It hopes to provide $300 million a year.

[[Presidency of Barack Obama#Stem cell research|Barack Obama]] removed the restriction of federal funding passed by Bush in 2001, which only allowed funding on the 21 cell lines already created. However, the Dickey Amendment to the budget, The [[Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009]], still bans federal funding of creating new cell lines. In other words, the federal government will now fund research which uses the hundreds of more lines created by public and private funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/09/obama.stem.cells/index.html Obama overturns Bush policy on stem cells on CNN],  Added April 14, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In March 2002, the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] announced the first ever guidelines for human pluripotent stem cell research in Canada. The federal granting agencies, [[CIHR]], [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]], and [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]] teamed up and agreed that no research with human [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|IPSCs]] would be funded without review and approval from the Stem Cell Oversight Committee (SCOC).&lt;ref name= "CIHR"&gt;[http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/42071.html]{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, Canadian parliament enacted the [[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]] (AHRA), modeled on the United Kingdom’s Human Fertilization and Embryology Act of 1990. Highlights of the act include prohibitions against the creation of embryos for research purposes and the criminalization of commercial transactions in human reproductive tissues.&lt;ref name= "McMahon"&gt;McMahon, E., Reguly, TA, "Follow–on biologics in Canada: A look at the new draft guidelines." Originally published in Update 2008, Issue 3, June 08, 2008, http://www.torys.com/Publications/Documents/Publication%20PDFs/AR2008-42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Canada]] enacted a law permitting research on discarded embryos from in vitro fertilization procedures. However, it prohibits the ''creation'' of human embryos for research.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl" /&gt;

On June 30, 2010, The Updated Guidelines for Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research outline that: 
# The embryos used must originally have been created for reproductive purposes
# The persons for whom the embryos were created must provide free and informed consent for the unrestricted research use of any embryos created, which are no longer required for reproductive purposes
# The ova, sperm, nor embryo must not have been obtained through commercial transactions&lt;ref name="CIHR" /&gt;

Canada's National Embryonic Stem Cell Registry:
* contains all human embryonic stem cell lines generated using CIHR funds or funds from any of the research councils 
* is a prerequisite for obtaining CIHR funding for human embryonic stem cell research
* will minimize the need to generate large numbers of cell lines, and decrease the need for donation of large numbers of embryos&lt;ref name="McMahon" /&gt;

==Oceania==
[[Australia]] is partially supportive (exempting reproductive cloning yet allowing research on embryonic stem cells that are derived from the process of [[IVF]]). [[New Zealand]], however, restricts stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2014/vol-127-no-1399/6236|title=Where does New Zealand stand on permitting research on human embryos? - New Zealand Medical Journal|website=www.nzma.org.nz|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taxes on knowledge''' was a [[slogan]] defining an extended British campaign against duties and taxes on [[newspaper]]s, their advertising content, and the paper they were printed on. The paper tax was early identified as an issue: "A tax upon Paper, is a tax upon Knowledge" is a saying attributed to [[Alexander Adam]] (1741–1809), a Scottish headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Edinburgh Review, Or, Critical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOoEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA126|year=1836|publisher=A. and C. Black|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration of Lord Liverpool and the press==
The "taxes on knowledge" were at their peak in 1815, as the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended. The [[Liverpool administration]] actively discouraged certain sections of the press, with prosecutions, including those for [[seditious libel]], aimed at editors and writers.&lt;ref name="LedgerFurneaux2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sally Ledger|author2=Holly Furneaux|title=Charles Dickens in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j5c9GqZ_7BMC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2 June 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88700-7|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of taxing publications and pamphlets had been introduced by an [[Stamp Act 1712|Act of 1712]], at the level of a [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] (½''d''.). The duty had risen over time to 4''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns5PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA195|year=1839|publisher=C. Knight|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Newspaper and Stamp Duties Act]] of 1819 was not very effective in controlling the circulation of news, but cramped the development of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tim Holmes|author2=Sara Hadwin|author3=Glyn Mottershead|title=The 21st Century Journalism Handbook: Essential Skills for the Modern Journalist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HmmBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=19 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-86477-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was aimed at the journalism of [[William Cobbett]], the Hunt brothers (''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]''), and [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] (''[[The Black Dwarf]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael O'Neill|author2=Madeleine Callaghan|title=The Oxford Handbook of Percy Bysshe Shelley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzlEvzmNeSEC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-955836-0|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1819, "newspaper" was defined carefully, and the fiscal burden fell on all periodicals that were more frequently published than monthly, and priced below 6''d''. It had a negative effect on the English provincial press, i.e. newspapers outside London; and drove out cheap political papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Laurel Brake|author2=Marysa Demoor|title=Dictionary of Nineteenth-century Journalism in Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA454|year=2009|publisher=Academia Press|isbn=978-90-382-1340-8|page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The War of the Unstamped==
[[Stamp duty]] was levied on newspapers, and the first phase of the campaign was the distribution of newspapers that were unstamped, and therefore illegal. A central figure of this "war of the unstamped" was [[Henry Hetherington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=13136|first=Joel H.|last=Wiener|title=Hetherington, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unstamped paper, ''[[The Poor Man's Guardian]]'', was launched in 1831. It tested the boundaries of the government's willingness to enforce the duty, recruiting hundreds of paper sellers and flaunting its illegal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joss Marsh|title=Word Crimes: Blasphemy, Culture, and Literature in Nineteenth-Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=se_KUXGAua8C&amp;pg=PA82|date=15 August 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50691-3|pages=82–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of the Working Classes]] took up the attack on "taxes on knowledge"; it had an [[Owenite]] background, with the British Association for Promoting Co-operative Knowledge founded in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold Silver|title=English Education and the Radicals (RLE Edu L): 1780-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTealHTDFFoC&amp;pg=PA62|date=16 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-46121-7|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Jacob Holyoake|title=The History of Co-operation in England: Its Literature and Its Advocates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ix9NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=1875|publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Company|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whig government of the time faced the opinion of [[Lord Brougham]], [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1830 to 1834, that newspapers should be available for 1''d''., rather than 7''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Crawfurd|title=Taxes on Knowledge.

==Act of 1836==
The "war of the unstamped" saw nearly 800 people imprisoned. In 1834 the stamp duty was abolished on pamphlets; and in 1836 newspaper duty was reduced to 1''d''., from 4''d''., by [[Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon|Thomas Spring Rice]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. On the other hand the penalties for evasion of the duties were made more serious, and the definition of periodicals in the scope of the duty was broadened. The measures did not make for a cheap press or a free one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Hewitt|title=The Dawn of the Cheap Press in Victorian Britain: The End of the 'Taxes on Knowledge', 1849-1869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqgVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=5 December 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4725-1456-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Francis (publisher)|John Francis]] of ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' was a persistent campaigner against taxes affecting publications, as they stood in the later 1830s, including paper duty at 1½''d''. per [[pound (mass)|pound]], and advertisement duty at a flat rate of 1''s''. 6''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=10075|first=Barbara Quinn|last=Schmidt|title=Francis, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising duty had been cut in 1833: before that it had stood at 3''s''. 6''d''; paper duty had been 3''d''. per pound to 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Eaman|title=The A to Z of Journalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e98aMyleL-cC&amp;pg=PA272|date=12 October 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7067-3|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Schlicke|title=The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYCcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA407|date=3 November 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-964018-8|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] the publisher of the [[Library of Useful Knowledge]] wanted paper duty abolished, but saw reason in the newspaper duty to avoid a popular radical press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=15716|first=Rosemary|last=Mitchell|title=Knight, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortlived Association of Working Men to Procure a Cheap and Honest Press of early 1836 in effect became in a matter of months the [[London Working Men's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

Hetherington and [[William Lovett]] advocated, within the [[Chartist movement]], a '''Knowledge Chartism''', or gradualist approach to complete repeal of the taxes on knowledge and building of popular education. Their direction was forthrightly condemned by [[Feargus O'Connor]]. In line with O'Connor's views, the taxes on knowledge were marginal to the main thrust of a decade Chartist agitation, until the late 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Hewitt|title=The Dawn of the Cheap Press in Victorian Britain: The End of the 'Taxes on Knowledge', 1849-1869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqgVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=5 December 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4725-1456-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varieties of Knowledge Chartism were displayed in the 1840s by [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]] (the "Barker Library"), [[Samuel Smiles]] (self-help), and [[John Epps]] (opposition to medical jargon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W P McCann|title=Popular Education and Socialization in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXBssBdJBrkC&amp;pg=PA84|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-03102-2|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

The campaign against "taxes on knowledge" made further progress in the 1850s, after more fundamental Chartist political agitation dropped back. The People's Charter Union of 1848 was set up primarily to oppose O'Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=42336|title=Collet, Collet Dobson|first=Miles|last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had as treasurer [[Richard Moore (radical)|Richard Moore]], who conducted a steady activist role in the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty. Via the intermediate National Stamp Abolition Committee, by making the central organisational vehicle the new Association for Promoting the Repeal of Taxes on Knowledge (APRTOK, also called Society for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge) he was able to involve [[Richard Cobden]]. Cobden had already publicised in 1848 his wish to remove some of the taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=19145|first=Matthew|last=Lee|title=Moore, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Hewitt|title=The Dawn of the Cheap Press in Victorian Britain: The End of the 'Taxes on Knowledge', 1849-1869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqgVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=5 December 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4725-1456-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful drive for reform was recognised by [[William Edwin Adams]] as "a twelve years' agitation". Secretary of APRTOK was [[Collet Dobson Collet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/adams/c_autobiog12.htm|title=William Edwin Adams: 'Memoirs of a Social Atom' (12).|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President from 1850 was [[Thomas Milner Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=10637|first=H.

Milner Gibson commented that Garnett "was a free trader who did not like free trade in newspapers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=28890|first=M.|last=Hewitt|title=Watts, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ayerst|title=Guardian; biography of a newspaper|year=1971|publisher=Collins|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the "taxes on knowledge"==
Advertisement duty was abolished in 1853, followed by newspaper stamp duty in 1855. The paper duty was removed in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Royle|title=Victorian Infidels: The Origins of the British Secularist Movement, 1791-1866|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rclRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261|year=1974|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-0557-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Gladstone]], as Chancellor of the Exchequer, repealed the paper duties, but only after a false start in 1860, when the House of Lords rejected his bill, against conventions on financial issues. The following year Gladstone returned to the measure, consolidated into a [[United Kingdom budget|Budget Finance Bill]], the first such: the Lords chose not to reject the Budget as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L.G.

==Consequences==
The repeal of "taxes on knowledge" was one factor in a number promoting an increase of publications in the United Kingdom, in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Olsen|title=Juvenile Nation: Youth, Emotions and the Making of the Modern British Citizen, 1880-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0W1VAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|date=16 January 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4725-1009-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, the British press took on a role as [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="LedgerFurneaux2011"/&gt;

The first paper to derive a clear benefit from the fiscal changes was ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Mokyr|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssNMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA79|date=13 August 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510507-0|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 1855, a penny paper out of many that appeared. The ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' was a weekly magazine, also set up in 1855, and which featured new authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Eli Adams|title=A History of Victorian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtZ2IGGe2Z8C&amp;pg=PA143|date=17 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-67239-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; New provincial daily newspapers were also seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Brantlinger|title=The Reading Lesson: The Threat of Mass Literacy in Nineteenth Century British Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y96vbajgYk8C&amp;pg=PA148|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21249-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Bookseller]]'' in April 1861, just before the repeal of the paper duty, gave statistics on London newspapers: in 1830 there had been 64, of which three were for a working-class readership; in 1860 there were 177, eight being for the working classes. These numbers were attributed to John Francis. Total weekly circulation (i.e. issues, rather than readers) had risen from 399,747 to 2,284,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bookseller: The Organ of the Book Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0nQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA215|year=1861|publisher=J. Whitaker|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper reading habits changed, towards purchase and reading at home. The older habits—the use of a reading room, club or newsroom with newspapers, the hire of a paper by the hour in a public house—began to fall away.&lt;ref name="Hewitt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Hewitt|title=The Dawn of the Cheap Press in Victorian Britain: The End of the 'Taxes on Knowledge', 1849-1869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqgVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|date=5 December 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4725-1456-1|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11565">A '''retention of title clause''' (also called a '''''Romalpa'' clause''' in some jurisdictions) is a provision in a contract for the sale of goods that the title to the goods remains vested in the seller until certain obligations (usually payment of the purchase price) are fulfilled by the buyer.

==Purpose==

The main purpose of retention of title ("ROT") clauses is to ensure that where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]], the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid they should be able to repossess the goods.  Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or credit arrangement regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], where an [[Administration (insolvency)|administration order]] is made with respect to a company, section 11 of the ''[[Insolvency Act 1986]]'' prevents goods being repossessed without the leave of the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of title clauses are mandated in the [[European Union]] by Article 9 of the [[Late Payments Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial= 2011/7/EU|year= |date= 16 February 2011|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions (recast)|eurlextag= OJ:L:2011:048:0001:0010:EN:PDF}}, replacing Article 4 of {{cite EU directive |serial= 2000/35/EC|year= |date= 29 June 2000|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions|eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:200:0035:0038:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sellers' ROT rights are recognized by Article 7 of the [[Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000|Insolvency Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU regulation| serial= 1346/2000| date= 29 May 2000| description = on insolvency proceedings| eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:160:0001:0018:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially prevalent in [[Germany]],{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=13{{endash}}15}} these clauses are permitted in the United Kingdom by s.19 of the ''[[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]'', which expanded upon the 1976 judgment of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in ''[[Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 676&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to English law,{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=633}} the common-law jurisdictions in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] have instituted the concept of "[[security interest]]", under which ROT clauses may need to be registered in order to have effect:{{sfn|Duggan|2011|p=654}}

:* in the United States, states have adopted [[Secured transactions in the United States|Article 9]] of the ''[[Uniform Commercial Code]]'', which limits the clause's effectiveness{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=15{{endash}}18}}
:* common-law provinces in Canada have adopted their ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Acts]]'' which operate similarly
:* in [[Quebec]], there is no "presumption of [[hypothec]]", and therefore an ROT clause is not considered to be a [[security interest]]; art. 1497 of the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' provides that "An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives legal authority to such clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Peter J. Cullen|chapter = Canada|editor= Alexander von Ziegler|year= 2011|title= Transfer of Ownership in International Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H5m9VatRGkkC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=VCZ3hQQezh&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page = 73|location= The Netherlands|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Law International BV]]|isbn= 978-90-411-3134-8|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Australia and New Zealand have also adopted their own versions of the ''[[Personal Property Securities Register|Personal Property Security Act]]''

==Legal analysis==
Although title retention clauses are conceptually very simple, they have become increasingly widely drafted, which has resulted in the courts in a number of countries striking down the clauses, or recharacterising them as the grant of a [[security interest]]. It has consequentially been noted that "the practical outcome of a series of later cases has put it beyond doubt that 'extended' title reservation clauses will not work."{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=639}}  Several particular problems have been identified:

:* If for example, the clause reserves only part of the title to the seller (instead of reserving title to the whole thing) then in many jurisdictions this is [[recharacterisation|recharacterised]] as an [[Security interest#Equitable charge|equitable charge]], and is often void if certain registration requirements are not complied with.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England in ''Re Bond Worth Ltd'' [1980] Ch 228 such a clause was held to be void as it had not been registered within 21 days as required by section 395 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Problems can also arise where the goods sold are mixed with other goods of a similar nature, so that they are no longer identifiable (e.g. a quantity of oil, or grain).&lt;ref&gt;In most common law jurisdictions, so long as the clause prohibited mixing in this manner, the rule is that the buyer and the seller jointly own the whole mixture as [[Concurrent estate#Tenancy in common|tenants in common]], see ''[[Indian Oil v. Greenstone Shipping]]'' [1987] 3 WLR 869&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Many jurisdictions allow the buyer to re-sell the goods before title has passed to him (often this is the only way that he can pay the seller).  In many jurisdictions such an onward sale passes good title to the subsequent purchaser, and the original seller loses title despite the clause&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England this is the effect of section 25(1) of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], and section 2(1) of the Factors Act 1889&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where the seller tries to have a clause which provides that, if the buyer re-sells the goods, then the proceeds of sale of the goods shall be held on [[trust (law)|trust]] for the seller, this can be recharacterised as a registrable charge, which may also be void for non-registration.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''[[E Pfeiffer v. Arbuthnot Factors]]'' [1988] 1 WLR 150, although a differently worded clause was distinguished and upheld in ''[[Compaq Computer v. Abercorn]]'' [1991] BCC 484&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Another frequently litigated problem occurs where the goods which are subject to the clause are then either improved (e.g. raw thread is worked into cloth) or mixed with other raw materials to form a new product (e.g. silica is used to make glass).&lt;ref&gt;Generally speaking, in England, the law has been consistently applied that if the retention of title clause purports to apply to the new substance which has been made, then it takes effect as a charge and would be void if not registered, see for example, ''[[Re Peachdart]]'' [1984] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In some countries, where a clause purports to retain title until, not only the purchase price, but also any other debts of the buyer to the seller are paid in full, such clauses have been struck down for non-compliance with security registration requirements in those jurisdictions.

==Sample clauses==
Retention of title clauses will obviously vary from country to country, and even within countries they will usually be specialised to the form of industry used in, and the type of goods which are sold.  The following are just two examples of the types of clause which can be seen.

''A shorter form clause:''
:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.

''A longer form clause:''

:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.  Until title to {''the Goods''} passes:
:##{''the Seller''} shall have authority to retake, sell or otherwise deal with and/or dispose of all or any part of {''the Goods''};
:##{''the Seller''} and its agents and employees shall be entitled at any time and without the need to give notice enter upon any property upon which {''the Goods''} or any part are stored, or upon which {''the Seller''} reasonably believes them to be kept; 
:##{''the Buyer''} shall store or mark {''the Goods''} in a manner reasonably satisfactory to {''the Seller''} indicating that title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}; and
:##{''the Buyer''} shall insure {''the Goods''} to their full replacement value, and arrange for {''the Seller''} to be noted on the policy of insurance as the loss payee.
:#Irrespective of whether title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}, risk in {''the Goods''} shall pass to {''the Buyer''} upon delivery.

"'''Treehouse of Horror IV'''" is the fifth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]] and the fourth episode in the ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' series of [[Halloween]] specials. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 28, 1993, and features three short stories called "The Devil and Homer Simpson", "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet", and "Bart Simpson's Dracula". The episode was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and co-written by [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Bill Oakley]], [[Josh Weinstein]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Dan McGrath]], and [[Bill Canterbury]].

In "The Devil and Homer Simpson", [[Homer Simpson]] announces he would sell his soul for a doughnut, and the Devil appears to make a deal with Homer. Homer tries to outsmart the Devil by not finishing the doughnut but eventually eats it and is sent to Hell. A trial is held between Homer and the Devil to determine the rightful owner of Homer's soul. In "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet", while riding the bus to school, [[Bart Simpson]] believes he sees a [[gremlin]] taking apart the bus piece by piece. Nobody sees it except for Bart, so he tries to remove it on his own. In "Bart Simpson's Dracula", [[Mr. Burns]] is a [[vampire]] and Bart falls victim to his bite. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and the rest of the family go to Burns' castle to kill Burns so Bart can return to normal.

As with the rest of the Halloween specials, the episode is considered [[Canon (fiction)|non-canon]] and falls outside the show's regular continuity. The episode makes cultural references to television series such as ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', and ''[[Peanuts]]''. References are also made to films such as ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Lost Boys]]''. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 14.5, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] introduces each of the three segments by walking through a gallery of paintings and each time choosing one of them as the focus of his story.

===The Devil and Homer Simpson===
In a parody of ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'', at work, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] states that he would sell his soul for a [[doughnut]] after finding that [[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl]] took all the doughnuts and threw them at an old man ([[Grandpa Simpson|Grampa]]) "for kicks". The [[devil]], revealed to be [[Ned Flanders]], appears and offers Homer a contract to seal the deal. However, before Homer finishes the doughnut, he realizes that Ned will not be able to have his soul if he does not eat all of the doughnut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, while half-asleep and looking for a midnight snack, he eats the final piece of the "forbidden donut", and Ned instantly reappears to take possession of Homer's soul. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] plead with Ned, finally getting him to agree to hold a trial the next day. Until then, Homer is sent to spend the rest of the day being punished in [[Hell]]. At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons' lawyer, [[Lionel Hutz]], flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Enraged, the Devil leaves, but gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into a doughnut.

===Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet {{anchor|Terror at 5 1/2 Feet}}===
In a parody of the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" including the final segment in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', after having a [[nightmare]] in which he is killed in a bus crash, Bart rides the bus to school one rainy morning. He panics when he sees a [[gremlin]] on the side of the bus loosening the lug nuts on one of the wheels. Bart unsuccessfully tries to convince the other passengers of the danger. In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an [[flare|emergency flare]]. The gremlin catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned, who decides to [[pet adoption|adopt]] the creature. When the bus finally stops, everyone sees the obvious damage, but Bart is still sent away to an [[Psychiatric hospital#Juvenile wards|insane asylum]] for the rest of his life for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but the gremlin appears in the back window of the ambulance, holding Flanders' decapitated (yet still living) head, which makes Bart scream in terror.

===Bart Simpson's Dracula===
In a parody of ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', after a news story about several [[vampire]] attacks, Lisa begins to suspect that [[Mr. Burns]] is a vampire, but the rest of the family dismisses her concerns. The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in [[Pennsylvania]], where Bart and Lisa discover a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them. Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the "Super Fun Happy Slide", causing him to be captured and get bitten by Mr. Burns. Lisa tries to warn her parents, but Burns reappears with Bart who is now very pale and is behaving oddly. But these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now [[undead]] Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart. The next morning, however, Lisa discovers that everyone in the Simpson family except for herself is a vampire, and that the true head vampire is inexplicably Marge, not Mr. Burns. With this revelation, the whole entire family swoops in on Lisa, only to stop, break character, and wish everyone a happy [[Halloween]]. Then, they all harmonize "[[Hark the Herald Angels Sing]]", parodying ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.

==Production==
[[File:Conan O'Brien by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Conan O'Brien]] was one of the writers of the episode.]]

"Treehouse of Horror IV" was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and co-written by [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Bill Oakley]], [[Josh Weinstein]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Dan McGrath]], and Bill Canterbury. It is the fourth episode of the annual ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' Halloween specials.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; As with the rest of the Halloween specials, the episode is considered [[Canon (fiction)|non-canon]] and falls outside the show's regular continuity. O'Brien worked on the "wraparounds" of Bart introducing each segment to make sure that they "pulled" the episode together.&lt;ref name="Conan"&gt;{{cite video |people=O'Brien, Conan |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wraparounds are based on [[Rod Serling|Rod Serling's]] television series ''[[Night Gallery]]'', in which Serling appears at an art gallery and introduces each episode by unveiling paintings depicting the stories. Executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] loved the show, so it was "great fun" for him to do the parody.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite video |people=Brooks L., James |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Show runner]] [[David Mirkin]] thought the ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes were the hardest episodes to do because the staff had to fit in all three stories in only 22 minutes. Mirkin said, "Things had to happen really fast. They're really just crammed with jokes and story beats and everything."&lt;ref name="Mirkin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first segment, "The Devil and Homer Simpson", was written by Daniels and McGrath.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks the same as the devil [[Chernabog]] from the 1940 [[Walt Disney]] produced film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence.&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he was the character whom viewers would least expect. He also thought [[Harry Shearer]] did a good job of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]", which aired in the show's [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]].&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt;

The second segment, "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet", was written by Oakley and Weinstein. It was inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]", in which [[William Shatner]]'s character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions.&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt; Oakley said there was a lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet" to make him scary "within ''The Simpsons'' universe".&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror IV" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and "yet it looks like a completely organic ''Simpsons'' character". [[Üter]], a character from [[Germany]], makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was "such a perfect stereotype".&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt;

The third segment, "Bart Simpson's Dracula", was written by Canterbury. It is based on [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''. Mirkin was a big fan of the film and pushed for a segment about vampires inspired by the movie. He liked the final result and felt Mr. Burns was perfect in the role as Dracula.&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt; Dracula and his castle was designed by Silverman. Mirkin, a "big" ''[[Peanuts]]'' fan, came up with the idea for the ending of "Bart Simpson's Dracula".&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
The wraparound segments are a reference to [[Rod Serling]]'s television series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page6.shtml |title=Treehouse of Horror IV |accessdate=2007-03-21 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet" is a parody of the final segment seen in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The title and a majority of the plot of "Bart Simpson's Dracula" is a parody of the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]]  |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |pages=124–125 |ref={{harvid|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ending of "Bart Simpson's Dracula" is a reference to ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The demon who is feeding Homer donuts says: "I don't understand it. [[James Coco]] went mad in fifteen minutes!",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/scripts/thoh-4 ‘Treehouse of Horror IV’ script], Simpson Crazy.&lt;/ref&gt; referencing an actor who received attention for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frieddoughho.com/the-simpsons-offers-homer-donut-hell/ The Simpsons offers Homer Donut Hell], ''Fried Donut Ho''&lt;/ref&gt; The jury at Homer's trial consists of [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Lizzie Borden]], [[John Dillinger]], [[Blackbeard]], [[Benedict Arnold]], the starting lineup of the [[1975–76 Philadelphia Flyers season|1976]] [[Philadelphia Flyers]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The first time the Devil appears, he resembles the demon [[Chernabog]] from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'',&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt; especially after Homer discovers a technicality and starts taunting the Devil that he's "smarter than the devil", until the Devil turns into the Chernabog-esque demon and glares at him before disappearing. The scene in Hell where Homer is fed all the doughnuts in the world, and asks for more, is a direct parody of the cartoon ''[[Pigs Is Pigs (1937 film)|Pigs is Pigs]]'', in which a generic pig character (a [[Porky Pig]]-esque character) known for being a glutton is taken in by a scientist and forced to eat all the food in the world.&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt; At Mr. Burns' castle, Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand in the basement. She runs over and reads the title: "Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns. Foreword by Steve Allen," a reference to American actor [[Steve Allen]].&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt; Shortly after she finds the tome, she makes allusions to [[Shemp Howard|Shemp]] and [[Curly Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]], mistaking Bart's fearful attempts at getting her attention as impressions of the two. In "Bart Simpson's Dracula", Bart is seen floating outside Lisa's bedroom window. This is a parody of ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' as well as Stephen King's novel ''[[Salem's Lot]]''. The family's plan to kill the head vampire is also a reference to both the film and novel. In particular, the twist revelation that Burns is not the head vampire is also a reference to the twist ending of ''The Lost Boys''.&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt; The closing credits of the episode features a version of the ''Simpsons'' theme that is a combination of the instruments used in ''[[The Munsters]]'' theme song and the [[harpsichord]] and clicking from ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' theme song.&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Treehouse of Horror IV" finished 17th in the ratings for the week of October 25 to October 31, 1993, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 14.5, translating to 13.6 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prime-Time TV Ratings |work=Rocky Mountain News |author=Moore, Frazier |page=18D |date=November 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode included many notable sequences and was "probably the best" ''Treehouses of Horror'' episode. They particularly liked the scenes in Hell where Homer is punished by the Devil, and [[Chief Wiggum]]'s attempts to deal with Dracula (who he thinks is a [[mummy]]) in the "Bart Simpson's Dracula" segment by ordering the [[Egypt]]ian wing of the Springfield museum to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet" was the best segment of the episode. Jacobson praised "The Devil and Homer Simpson" as clever funny, and described "Bart Simpson's Dracula" as "easily the least effective", claiming it, "presents some good moments but never quite takes flight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode an A grade and called it "one of the very best" Halloween specials, although said "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" was better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Patrick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116115733/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Central Michigan Life]]''{{'}}s John Thorpe named it the tenth best episode of the series, and wrote: "The best part comes when Homer decides not to eat the last part of the doughnut, thus saving him from hell.
