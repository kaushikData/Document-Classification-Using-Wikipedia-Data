An empirical basis for the clinical assessment of competence has not yet been established.

'''Alliance Healthcare''', formerly '''Alliance UniChem''', wholesales, distributes, and retails pharmaceutical, surgical, medical, and healthcare products throughout Europe. The company supplies more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centres and hospitals from over 288 distribution centres in 11 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Profile: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) |work= |publisher=Reuters |date=31 August 2016 |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=WBA.O |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120041811/https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=WBA.O |archivedate=20 November 2016 |format= |doi= |accessdate=20 November 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Stefano Pessina]] founded Alleanza Salute Italia in 1977 under the name of Alleanza Farmaceutica, which expanded to form Alliance Santé SA.&lt;ref name="About Stefano Pessina"&gt;[http://www.stefanopessina.com/about.html Stefano Pessina Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1997, Alliance Santé SA merged with UniChem PLC to form Alliance UniChem. The combined business became one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in Europe. In 1998 it purchased a majority stake in the Spanish pharmaceutical wholesaler Grupo Safa.

In 1999, Alliance UniChem entered into a partnership with Galenica AG of Switzerland, and created the Alliance Farmacie business in Italy. Plus [[S.r.o. (llc)#Czech Republic|s.r.o.]] and Pragopharm s.r.o. of the Czech Republic were purchased that year, and Alliance Santè and UniChem's Portuguese subsidiaries merged to form Alliance UniChem Farmacêutica S.A.

The company purchased the Dutch firms Interpharm and De Vier Vijzels in 2000. In 2001 the company entered into a strategic wholesale pharmaceutical partnership with the Turkish company Hedef Holding. In 2002, Alliance UniChem bought the Norwegian pharmaceutical wholesaler Holtung. The company entered the [[FTSE 100]] index that year.

In 2003, Alliance UniChem bought a 40% indirect stake in the Egyptian wholesaler UCP via Hedef. The group launched the ''Almus'' brand for the marketing of manufacturers' generic products in the UK, and launched the virtual pharmacy chain Alphega in France. The virtual chain was introduced in Italy the following year.

Alliance UniChem acquired Swiss specialist healthcare logistics and pre-wholesaler Alloga in 2005, as well as Spanish pharmaceutical wholesaler Farmacen, and the Bairds Chemist retail business in Northern Ireland. The UK retail pharmacy business was rebranded from ''Moss Pharmacy'' to ''Alliance Pharmacy''.

On October 3, 2005, it was formally announced that Alliance UniChem would enter into a friendly merger with Boots Group, the UK's largest retail pharmacy chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boots announces £7bn merger deal |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 October 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4303570.stm |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed on July 31, 2006, forming Alliance Boots. Alliance UniChem was renamed Alliance Healthcare in 2009.

[[File:Archibald Menzies 1754-1842.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Archibald Menzies]]
'''Archibald Menzies''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|ŋ|ɪ|s}} {{respell|MING|iss}}; 15 March 1754 – 15 February 1842) was a Scottish [[surgeon]], [[botanist]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]]. He spent many years at sea, serving with the [[Royal Navy]], private merchants, and the [[Vancouver Expedition]]. He was the first recorded European to reach the summit of the Hawaiian volcano [[Mauna Loa]] and introduced the [[Araucaria araucana|Monkey Puzzle tree]] to England. 

== Life and career ==
Menzies was born at Easter Stix (or Styx) in the parish of [[Weem]], in [[Perthshire]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Birth (or Baptism) Record held in the General Registers of Scotland, 1754 Births in the Parish of Weem in the County of Perth, Reference 398/0010 0104&lt;/ref&gt; While working with his elder brother William at the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|Royal Botanic Gardens]], he drew the attention of [[John Hope (botanist)|Dr John Hope]], professor of [[botany]] at [[Edinburgh University]], who encouraged him to study [[medicine]] there. Having qualified as a [[surgery|surgeon]], Menzies served as assistant to a doctor in [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]], Wales, then joined the [[Royal Navy]] as assistant surgeon on {{HMS|Nonsuch|1774|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZlaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=14 March 2018|year=1849|author=Linnean Society of London|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present at [[Battle of the Saintes]] (12 April 1782), in peacetime Menzies served on Halifax Station in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="dcbo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=3557 |title=MENZIES, ARCHIBALD | first=William T. |last=Stearn |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |publisher=University of Toronto | year=1988 | accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786 Menzies was appointed surgeon on board the ''Prince of Wales'' (Captain [[James Colnett]]), on a fur-trading voyage round [[Cape Horn]] to the northern Pacific.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt; This ship, in company of ''[[Princess Royal (sloop)|Princess Royal]]'' (Captain Duncan), visited North America, China and Hawaii (the Sandwich Isles) several times; Menzies collected a number of new plants on this voyage, and also ensured that none of the crew died of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Galois |first= Robert |title= Voyage to the Northwest Side of America: The Journals of James Colnett, 1786-89 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |isbn= 978-0-7748-0855-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WX9HiIsiMZgC |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menzies returned to Great Britain in 1789. He was elected a fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] in 1790.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

In 1790, Menzies was appointed as naturalist to accompany Captain [[George Vancouver]] on [[Vancouver Expedition|his voyage around the world]] on [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']]. When the surgeon fell ill, Menzies took over his duties.&lt;ref name=menzies&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Mokuaweoweo from the air.gif|thumb|The remote summit of Mokuaweoweo]]
In 1794, while ''Discovery'' spent one of three winters in [[Hawaii]], Menzies, with Lieutenant [[Joseph Baker (captain)|Joseph Baker]] and two other men, made the first recorded ascent to [[Mokuaweoweo]], the summit of [[Mauna Loa]]. Menzies used a portable [[barometer]] to measure the height of the mountain as {{convert|13564|ft}} compared to its currently known height of {{convert|13679|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/599/JL25059.pdf?sequence=2|title=Earliest Ascents of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai'i |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society, Honolulu |author=Walther M. Barnard |hdl= 10524/599 |journal=Hawaiian Journal of History|volume=25 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be forty years before another European, fellow Scotsman [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], would reach the summit on 29 January 1834.&lt;ref name=menzies/&gt; 

In 1795, Menzies was served the seeds of the Chile Pine, ''[[Araucaria araucana]]'', as a dessert while dining with the Viceroy of Chile. He was able to pop some seeds into his pocket and grow them on board ship on the way back to Europe, and returned to England with five healthy plants, the first seen in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://apps.kew.org/trees/?page_id=136|title = Monkey Puzzle Araucaria araucana |author= |publisher = [[Kew Gardens]]|accessdate=13 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the Monkey Puzzle tree, the Chile Pine became a favourite in most formal gardens of the nineteenth century.

After the voyage, Menzies served with the Navy in the [[West Indies]]. He received the degree of M.D. at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1799. After retiring from the Navy he became a doctor and surgeon at [[Notting Hill]], London.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt; He became the father of the Linnean Society upon the death of [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB | first=George Simonds |last=Boulger | wstitle=Menzies, Archibald (DNB00) | volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menzies's wife died in 1837. They had no children. Menzies himself died in London on 15 February 1842 and is buried in [[Kensal Green cemetery]].&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Menzies' name is commemorated in the scientific names of several of the plants he discovered, including ''[[Menziesia]]'', a genus of [[shrub]]s in the [[Ericaceae]], and the [[Douglas fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'', the most commercially important tree in western North America.&lt;ref&gt;C.

'''Capitation''' is a payment arrangement for [[health care]] service providers such as [[physician]]s, [[physician assistants]] or [[nurse practitioner]]s. It pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. These providers generally are [[contract]]ed with a type of [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) known as an [[independent practice association]] (IPA), which enlists the providers to care for HMO-enrolled [[patient]]s. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected health care utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history.

==Types==
Primary capitation is a relationship between a managed care organization (MCO) and primary care physician (PCP), in which the PCP is paid directly by the MCO for those enrolled members who have selected the physician as their provider.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow K, Auerbach A, Bertko J, Brownlee S, Casalino LP, Cooper J, Crosson FJ, Enthoven A, Falcone E, Feldman RC, Fuchs VR, Garber AM, Gold MR, Goldman D, Hadfield GK, Hall MA, Horwitz RI, Hooven M, Jacobson PD, Jost TS, Kotlikoff LJ, Levin J, Levine S, Levy R, Linscott K, Luft HS, Mashal R, McFadden D, Mechanic D, Meltzer D, Newhouse JP, Noll RG, Pietzsch JB, Pizzo P, Reischauer RD, Rosenbaum S, Sage W, Schaeffer LD, Sheen E, Silber BM, Skinner J, Shortell SM, Thier SO, Tunis S, Wulsin L, Yock P, Nun GB, Bryan S, Luxenburg O, van de Ven WP. [[Toward a 21st-century health care system: recommendations for health care reform.]] Ann Intern Med. 2009; 150 (7): 493-5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary capitation is a relationship arranged by the MCO between a PCP and a secondary or specialist provider, such as an X-ray facility or ancillary facility such as a durable medical equipment supplier whose secondary provider is also paid capitation based on that PCP’s enrolled membership.

Global capitation is a relationship based on a provider who provides services and is reimbursed per-member per-month (PMPM) for the entire network population.

==Incentives==
Under capitation, physicians are given an incentive to consider the cost of treatment. Pure capitation pays a set fee per patient, regardless of their degree of infirmity, giving physicians an incentive to avoid the most costly patients.&lt;ref name="BetterWays"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Harold D. Miller]] | title = From volume to value: better ways to pay for health care | journal = [[Health Affairs (Project Hope)]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 1418–1428 |date=September–October 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.1418 | pmid = 19738259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care==
Providers who work under such plans focus on [[preventive health care]], as there is a greater financial reward in the prevention of illness than in the treatment of the ill. Such plans divert providers from the use of expensive treatment options.

==Insurance==
The financial risks providers accept in capitation are traditional [[insurance]] risks. Provider revenues are fixed, and each enrolled patient makes a claims against the full resources of the provider. In exchange for the fixed payment, physicians essentially become the enrolled clients' insurers, who resolve their patients' claims at the point of care and assume the responsibility for their unknown future health care costs.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Large providers tend to manage the risk better than do smaller providers because they are better prepared for variations in service demand and costs, but even large providers are inefficient risk managers in comparison to large insurers. Providers tend to be small in comparison to insurers and so are more like individual consumers, whose annual costs as a percentage of their annual cash flow vary far more than do those of large insurers. For example, a capitated eye care program for 25,000 patients is more viable than a capitated eye program for 10,000 patients. The smaller the roster of patients, the greater the variation in annual costs and the more likely that the costs may exceed the resources of the provider. In very small capitation portfolios, a small number of costly patients can dramatically affect a provider's overall costs and increase the provider's risk of insolvency.

Physicians and other health care providers lack the necessary [[actuarial]], [[underwriting]], [[accounting]] and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt; Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk-assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the levels of profits they achieve by retaining risks.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;

===Reinsurance===
Providers cannot afford [[reinsurance]], which would further deplete their inadequate capitation payments, as the reinsurer's expected loss costs, expenses, profits and risk loads must be paid by the providers. The goal of reinsurance is to offload risk and reward to the reinsurer in return for more stable operating results, but the provider's additional costs make that impractical. Reinsurance assumes that the insurance-risk-transferring entities do not create inefficiencies when they shift insurance risks to providers.

Without any induced inefficiencies, providers would be able to pass on a portion of their risk premiums to reinsurers, but the premiums that providers would have to receive would exceed the premiums that risk-transferring entities could charge in competitive insurance markets.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Reinsurers are wary of contracting with physicians, as they believe that if providers think they can collect more than they pay in premiums, they would tend to revert to the same excesses encouraged by fee-for-service payment systems.

She was briefly called '''Cuddles''' before a contest was held to officially name her. (Mrs. Howard Brannon of Zanesville, Ohio, won the contest.)&lt;ref&gt;Colo’s Story: The Life of One Grand Gorilla by Nancy Roe Pimm {{ISBN|978-0-9841554-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colo's name was derived from the place of her birth, [[Columbus, Ohio|'''Col'''umbus]], [[Ohio|'''O'''hio]].&lt;ref name=columbuszoo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://columbuszoo.org/colo/|title=Columbus Zoo – Colo's Birthday!|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
As she was rejected at birth by her mother, zookeepers had to hand-raise Colo. They hand-raised her much like a human child, by dressing her in clothes and giving her bottles of [[Infant formula|formula]].&lt;ref name="Popular Science Monthly 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Popular Science Monthly|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=1960|volume=176|pages=83–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of two years, Colo was introduced to a 19-month-old male from [[Africa]] called '''Bongo'''. Colo and Bongo had three offspring, the first on February 1, 1968, Emmy, a female. Colo and Bongo had two more offspring: Oscar, born July 18, 1969, and Toni, on December 28, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2012/12/oldest-known-gorilla-in-the-world-celebrates-birthday-at-columbus-zoo.html|title=World's Oldest Gorilla Celebrates Birthday at Columbus Zoo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 1979, Columbus Zoo had its first third generation birth. The infant was named Cora, short for '''C'''entral '''O'''hio '''R'''are '''A'''pe. On January 27, 1997, Colo's great-grandson Jantu was born. A birth at the [[Henry Doorly Zoo]] made Colo a great-great-grandmother in 2003.&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorillagenealogy.web44.net/index.php?p=1_16|title=Columbus — Gorilla Genealogy – Charts &amp; Family Trees for Gorillas in Captivity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Colo did not raise any of her own offspring, she reared her twin grandsons, Macombo II and Mosuba, from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=editor-in-chief Bernhard Grzimek. [Vol. 10].

Colo resided at the Columbus Zoo longer than any other animal in the zoo's collection. She celebrated her 50th birthday in 2006 with her keeper Gregory Moore with a [[Chimpanzees' tea party|chimps' tea party]]. Colo and her progeny, five of which still reside at the Columbus Zoo, comprised about one-third of Columbus Zoo's gorilla collection of 17 as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/slightlyblurred/6236728332/|title=Gorilla Family – Columbus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colo was the oldest living gorilla in captivity, following the death of 55-year-old [[Jenny (gorilla)|Jenny]] in September 2008.&lt;ref name=fwst&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=55-year-old gorilla dies at Dallas Zoo |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/dallas_news/story/888756.html|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Fort Worth Star Telegram]]|date=2008-09-06 |accessdate=2008-09-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colo celebrated her 60th birthday on 22 December 2016.&lt;ref name="columbuszoo"/&gt; The Columbus Zoo announced that Colo died in her sleep on January 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://columbuszoo.org/home/about/press-releases/press-release-articles/2017/01/17/columbus-zoo-announces-the-death-of-colo|title=Columbus Zoo Announces the Death of Colo, World's Oldest Zoo Gorilla|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Genealogy==
Colo was a mother to three, a grandmother to 16, a great-grandmother to 12, and a great-great-grandmother to three.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/18/a-nation-mourns-the-death-of-colo-the-worlds-oldest-zoo-gorilla/ |work = The Washington Post | date = January 18, 2017 | accessdate = January 18, 2017| title = Thousands mourn the death of Colo, the world’s oldest zoo gorilla|first=Samantha | last = Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delta Corporation''' is a [[beer]] and [[soft drink]] company of [[Zimbabwe]].  The company is headquartered in [[Harare]] and is listed on the [[Zimbabwe Stock Exchange]] and its stock index, the [[Zimbabwe Industrial Index]].

==Operations==
'''Delta's''' brand names include:
*'''Beer'''
**[[Lager]]s : [[Castle Lager]], [[Eagle Lager]], [[Lion Lager]], [[Zambezi Lager]], [[Carling Black Label]], [[Golden Pilsener Lager]], [[Bohlingers Lager]]
**Traditional Beers: [[Chibuku]], brewed from malted [[maize]] and [[sorghum]], available in 2-liter plastic containers
*'''Soft drinks'''
**[[Carbonated]] soft drinks: [[Coca-Cola]], [[Fanta]], [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]], [[Sparletta]], [[Scwheppes]] 
**Non-Carbonated soft drinks: Mr. Juicy fruit drinks and [[Mahewu]] [[sorghum]] drink

'''Cultural sponsorship'''
*'''Delta''' promotes its brands through cultural activities including the [[Jikinya Dance Festival]], the [[Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival]] and the [[Chibuku Road to Fame]] competition which is similar to [[reality tv]] shows such as [[American Idol]] and the [[Gulder Ultimate Search]] in [[Nigeria]], sponsored by [[Nigerian Breweries]].They also host the Lion Lager campus nights meant for university students and Lion lager beer festival.

==Production sites==
Delta has two lager breweries, one in Southerton in Harare and Belmont in Bulawayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.delta.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=190 | title=Delta Corporation Activities | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 14 Sorghum breweries across Zimbabwe to produce Chibuku which has a short shelf-life and consequently needs to be produced closer to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.delta.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=85 | title=Chibuku Brand page | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional investments were of USD 12 million made at the Chibuku brewery in Chitungwiza, to increase annual production to 1,8 million hectoliters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.herald.co.zw/delta-in-us12m-chibuku-expansion/ | title=Delta in US$12m Chibuku expansion | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A maltings plant was built in Kwe-kwe to produce barley malt from locally grown barley. A smaller sorghum maltings plant in Harare was taken over from the municipality to produce sorghum malt for the Chibuku brand.

'''Europe PubMed Central''' ('''Europe PMC''') is an on-line database that offers free access to a large and growing collection of biomedical research literature. It was known as '''UK PubMed Central''' until 1 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.europepmc.org/2012/11/ukpmc-becomes-europe-pubmed-central.html |title=UKPMC becomes Europe PubMed Central |first=Anna |last=Kinsey |date=1 November 2012 |publisher=Europe PubMed Central |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europe PMC project was originally launched in 2007 as the first 'mirror' site to PMC, which aims to provide international preservation of the open and free-access biomedical and life sciences literature. It forms part of a network of PMC International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pmci/ |title=PMC International |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (PMCI) repositories that includes [[PubMed Central Canada]]. Europe PMC is not an exact "mirror" of the PMC database but has developed some different features.&lt;ref name="EuropePMC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UKPMC"&gt;[http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articles/PMC3013671 "UKPMC: a full text article resource for the life sciences"], ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'', 2011 January; '''39''' (Database issue): D58–D65&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2013, ''CiteXplore'' was subsumed under Europe PubMed Central.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/citexplore/ CiteXplore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource is managed and developed by the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]]-[[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EMBL-EBI), on behalf of an alliance of 27 biomedical and life sciences research funders, led by the [[Wellcome Trust]].  The Europe PMC funders group requires that articles describing the results of biomedical and life sciences research they have supported be made freely available in Europe PMC within 6 months of publication to maximise the impact of the work that they fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europepmc.org/Funders/ |title=Funders - About - Europe PubMed Central |publisher=Europepmc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Europe PMC provides free access to more than 3.7 million full-text biomedical and life sciences research articles and over 31 million citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europepmc.org/contentrss|title=Europe PMC Content Holdings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe PMC contains some citation information and includes text-mining based marked up text that links to external molecular and medical datasets.&lt;ref name="EuropePMC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UKPMC" /&gt; The Grant Lookup facility allows users to search for information on over 56,700 grants awarded by the Europe PMC funders.

Europe PMC offers a manuscript submission system, Europe PMC plus, which allows scientists to submit their peer-reviewed research articles for inclusion in the Europe PMC collection.

==Support==
Europe PMC is supported by 27 organisations: [[Academy of Medical Sciences, United Kingdom|Academy of Medical Sciences]], [[Action on Hearing Loss]], [[Alzheimer's Society]], [[Arthritis Research Campaign|Arthritis Research UK]], [[Austrian Science Fund]] (FWF), the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]], [[Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research|Bloodwise]], [[Breast Cancer Now]], the [[British Heart Foundation]], [[Cancer Research UK]], the Chief Scientist Office of the [[Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates|Scottish Executive Health Department]], [[Diabetes UK]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], the Dunhill Medical Trust, the [[European Research Council]], [[Marie Curie (Charity)|Marie Curie]], the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], the [[Motor Neurone Disease Association]], the [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain|Multiple Sclerosis Society]], the Myrovlytis Trust, the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), [[Parkinson's UK]], Prostate Cancer UK, [[Telethon]] Italy, the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[World Health Organization]] and Worldwide Cancer Research (formerly [[Association for International Cancer Research]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europepmc.org/Funders/ |title=Europe PubMed Central Funders |accessdate=2015-05-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25886">[[Mixed martial arts]] (MMA) in the [[United States]] was sanctioned under the ''[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts|Unified Rules]]'' in the states of [[New Jersey]] and [[Nevada]] in 2001, and is now regulated in all states by their combat sport commissions.  {{As of|2014|04}}, there have been five recorded deaths resulting from sanctioned contests, '''Sam Vasquez''' in Texas on November 30, 2007 and '''Michael Kirkham''' in South Carolina on June 28, 2010 both died of [[cerebral hemorrhage]],  '''Tyrone Mims''' in South Carolina on August 11, 2012 due to an unknown cause, and '''Booto Guylain''' a Congolese fighter died on March 5, 2014 following complications resulting from a head injury experienced during an MMA bout a week earlier in South Africa with a Durban fighter named Karen Davies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIkB55RkGZM&lt;/ref&gt; '''Donshay White''' died of heart disease on July 16, 2017 in Kentucky.

==List of fatalities==

===Sanctioned===

====Sam Vasquez====
35-year-old Sam Vasquez competed in a Renegades Extreme Fighting bout on October 20, 2007 in [[Houston Texas|Houston]], Texas, losing the fight in the third round by way of knockout.

Vasquez lost consciousness again shortly thereafter and was taken to Saint Joseph Medical Center's Critical Care Unit. He was diagnosed with a [[subdural hemorrhage]] for which a section of the skull bone was removed to allow the brain to swell without compressing it. Additional swelling led to the placement of a tube to allow [[cerebral spinal fluid]] to be drained out of the cavities in the brain to make room for more swelling as well as to allow the monitoring of pressure in the brain. He slipped into a coma for 48 hours until his death on November 30.

Vasquez's death was officially ruled as a death due to complications of blunt trauma of the head with a subdural hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Formal-Autopsy-on-Vasquez-Published-12357 |title=Formal Autopsy on Vasquez Published |publisher=Sherdog.com |last=Martinez |first=Jaime |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vasquez was the first fighter to die from injuries sustained in sanctioned mixed martial arts competition in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-fighterdeath120207 |title=MMA fighter Vasquez dies weeks after fight |publisher=Sports.Yahoo.com |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |date=2007-12-02 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Texas-Committee-Reviews-Vasquez-Death-Autopsy-and-Future-Protocol-13002 |title=Texas Committee Reviews Vasquez Death, Autopsy, and Future Protocol |publisher=Sherdog.com |last=Martinez |first=Jaime |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

35-year-old [[Nigerian]]-born Pablo Elochukwu, an [[Ontario]] resident died after competing in his first amateur mixed martial arts bout in the Amateur Fighting Club in [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Michigan]], on April 7, 2013.

Sometime in the third round, Elochukwu was mounted and was not properly defending himself causing the referee to halt the bout. Elochukwu appeared to be fine during the announcement of the final decision and walked away on his own accord but on the way to the dressing room he stopped and sat down citing exhaustion. Those around Elochukwu noticed something was wrong and offered him some orange juice believing his blood sugar may have dropped significantly (he was said to be [[hypoglycaemic]]).&lt;ref name="CALSUN1"&gt;{{Citation

[[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] (the largest MMA promotion company in the world) executive Tom Wright, who heads up the organizations efforts in [[Canada]], fielded questions about Elochukwu's death on April 10 at UFC 161 press conference in [[Winnipeg]]. Saying "What we don't know is whether or not there were any pre-existing medical conditions that Pablo was suffering from, and in a regulated environment, we would have known that," he said. "We also don't know if the referees were properly trained. We don't know whether or not there were the appropriate EMTs and ambulances and medical precautions in place. We don't even know if it was a fair fight as far as if the competitors were evenly balanced."

"Those are kinds of things we would know if the sport had been regulated, if the event had been regulated," he continued. "It speaks to the importance of regulation in our sport, why it's important that we have the appropriate kind of rigor and standards, from medical care to pre- and post-fight medical testing to drug testing to insuring the health and safety of these athletes is always first and foremost. And in the case of an unregulated event, you don't know whether those things are in place, which is why we as an organization have always run to regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilcox|first=Nate|title=UFC, Michigan legislature respond to Felix Pablo Elochukwu's death in unregulated amateur MMA bout|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/4/11/4214312/ufc-michigan-legislature-respond-to-felix-pablo-elochukwus-death-in|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=Bloody Elbow|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

47-year-old [[Trinidad]]-born Jameston Lee-Yaw died in April 2015 while competing in an amateur MMA bout at the SouthShore Mall in [[Aberdeen, Washington]].

Lee-Yaw was initially taken to ''Grays Harbor Community Hospital'' and then transferred to [[Harborview Medical Center]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], where he died. ''Twin Dragons Center Mixed Martial Arts'', which has training facilities at the mall, billed the event as ''Brawl at the Mall''. In Washington state, amateur bouts that take place at a gym are not required to have medical staff on hand and leave the training facility and its staff responsible for the health and safety of participants. It is unknown what caused the kidney failure. Furthermore, Lee-Yaw's age (47) would by law disqualify him from participation as a fighter in many states, which have age limits similar to those in boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schild|first1=Jake|title=Medical examiner’s office attributes MMA fighter’s death to kidney failure|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/medical-examiners-office-attributes-mma-fighters-death-to-kidney-failure/|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=Seattletimes.com|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Mookie|title=Amateur MMA fighter collapses, dies of kidney failure following bout in Washington State|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/4/28/8507931/amateur-mma-fighter-collapses-dies-of-kidney-failure-washington-state-mma-news|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=BloodyElbow.com|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">'''Fruits &amp; Veggies – More Matters''' is a national public health initiative from Produce for Better Health Foundation and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. This campaign, begun in 2007, took the place of the [[5 A Day]] program. The shift was implemented in order to better communicate updated dietary guidelines, which recommended more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables for some Americans.

== Details ==

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]]’s ''2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans'', released in January 2005, recommends various numbers of servings of fruits and vegetables depending on an individual’s calorie needs – ranging from 4 to 13 servings, or 2 to 6.5 cups, per day, yet research indicates that over 90 percent of Americans do not meet their recommended amount. To meet these recommendations, most need to more than double the amount of fruits and vegetables they currently eat. Closing the consumption gap requires a national call to action. Fruits &amp; Veggies—More Matters provides a national call to action designed to encourage Americans to eat more fruits and vegetables for their better health.

Produce for Better Health Foundation  launched a consumer website in March 2007 aimed at educating [[Gen X]] moms about the Fruits &amp; Veggies—More Matters campaign and the benefits of eating more fruits and vegetables.

'''Halbert L. Dunn''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (1896–1975) was the leading figure in establishing a national [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]] system in the United States and is known as the "father of the [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] movement".

==Early life==
Born in [[New Paris, Ohio]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]] where he earned his M.D. in 1922 and his Ph.D. in 1923. He served as an assistant in medicine at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|Presbyterian Hospital]] of [[New York City]] 1923-1924 and as fellow in medicine at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] (1924–1925).

==Work in statistics==
In 1929, he was the first [[biostatistics|biostatistician]] hired by the [[Mayo Clinic]] and established its computer coding system for deriving [[medical statistics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was Chief of the National Office of Vital Statistics from 1935 through 1960, first as part of the [[United States Census Bureau|Bureau of the Census]] and later under the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], where it eventually became the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] in 1960. In his final year with the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] he was Assistant Surgeon General for aging.

He was one of the founders of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) and of the Inter-American Statistics Institute (IASI).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was Secretary General of the IASI from 1941 to 1952. The [[Halbert L. Dunn Award]], named in his honor, has been presented since 1981 by NAPHSIS in recognition of outstanding and lasting contributions to the field of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital and health statistics]].

==Wellness==
Dunn is known as the "father" of the wellness movement.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Daniela Blei |url=http://daily.jstor.org/the-false-promises-of-wellness-culture/ |title=The False Promises of Wellness Culture |magazine=JSTOR Daily |publisher=[[JSTOR]] |date=January 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between good health—not being ill—and what he termed [[high-level wellness]], which he defined as "a condition of change in which the individual moves forward, climbing toward a higher potential of functioning".&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt; He introduced the concept in a series of twenty-nine lectures at the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church in [[Arlington County, Virginia]] in the late 1950s,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which provided the basis for his book, ''High Level Wellness'', published in 1961. The book was reissued in a number of editions but did not have a great deal of immediate impact. It did, however, come into the hands of a number of the future leaders of wellness and [[holistic health]] movement that bloomed more than a decade later, such as [[Don B. Ardell]], [[Robert Russell (health educator)|Robert Russell]], [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]], and [[Elizabeth Neilson]].

Four events in the mid-1970s broadened the impact of Dunn's ideas. First, [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]] opened the first US wellness center  (Mill Valley, CA, 1975). This center and other organizations were then described in Don Ardell's 1976 book, using Dunn's title (giving Dunn due credit for his origination of the title and concept). Then Elizabeth Neilson founded the journal ''Health Values: Achieving High Level Wellness'' (renamed the ''American Journal of Health Promotion'' in 1996), which was dedicated to Dunn and reprinted one of his papers in its first edition. Lastly, the publisher of ''Health Values'', Charles B. Slack, Inc., published a reprint edition of Dunn's ''High Level Wellness'' that achieved a wider distribution and impact.

==Healthcare==
The proportion of health expenditure in the national budget increased from 8.7% in 1998 to 10.9% in 2000. Total expenditure on health in 2001 was $98. The Maldives has a universal health insurance scheme, [[Aasandha]].

There are two hospitals in [[Malé]], the [[Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital]], which is public and the [[ADK Hospital]] which is commercial. On all the inhabited atolls there are primary care facilities, and secondary care with beds on the larger islands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maldives |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/maldives/health |website=Lonely Planet |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atoll-based hospitals have trouble getting supplies of medicine:

== Biological ==
Rather than a single herb, imphepho is a number of herbs (around 250 species) from the genus ''Helichrysum''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Medicinal Plants of South Africa by Ben-Erik van Wyk, Bosch van Outshoorn and Nigle Gerike, Briza Publications, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Helichrysum'' species used as imphepho grow abundantly in South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho but especially around coastal areas apart from the largely arid Northern Cape province. 
The plants grow abundantly in gardens and in the wild, for this reason most imphepho is wild harvested and commercial cultivation in South Africa is unknown. 
''Helichrysum'' species used as imphepho are hardy and adaptable, they can grow in a wide variety of soil types, are drought resistant, wind resistant and can survive light frost.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;In Celebration of Vynbos by Petra Vandecasteele, Struik, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The seeds are wind dispersed. 
Little preference is shown for specific types of imphepho, amongst traditional healers, local availability seems more important than a preference for a particular species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Muthi and Myths From the African Bush by Heather Dugmore and Ben-Erik can Wyk, Marula Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence for medicinal properties being stronger in certain ''Helichrysum'' species and for ritual purposes they are all treated as exactly the same.
For medicinal and ritual purposes, mainly the fresh, or more often dried, areal parts of the plant are used, less commonly the roots.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Uses ==
Its traditional common name of ''kooigoed'' translates as "bedding stuff" and it is still used to provide a soft and aromatic mattress. It is listed as a weed in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAL IPC - ''Helichrysum petiolare'' ''|url=http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/weedlist.php|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential oil has been investigated for its anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. In [[South Africa]] it forms a component of traditional African medicine. The leaves and twigs are boiled and prepared as a sort of tea to soothe coughs and fever. The leaves are also applied to wounds to prevent infection, and are ceremonially burnt to produce a traditional incense.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=%22Helichrysum%20petiolare%22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PlantzAfrica - ''Helichrysum petiolare''|url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/planthij/helichryspet.htm|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicinal uses ==
In its ritual use, imphepho is believed to invoke and placate the ancestors and to drive away malicious spirits; since these are regarded as common causes of illness in African traditional medicine, it is not surprising that imphepho is a very important medicinal plant in this traditional medical field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Apart from its traditional importance, imphepho has been widely researched in recent years. A great deal of scientific and anecdotal evidence seems to support the claims of traditional healers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Imphepho is traditionally used as a wound dressing. The plant has proven anti microbial properties and appears to work effectively as pain relief and as an anti-inflammatory, probably due to various volatile oils and flavanoids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ash from burnt imphepho and fresh or dried areal parts of the plant are common ingredients in wound dressings; burning the plant causes chemical changes to the plant which affect its healing properties. The oils are said to be of great value in healing scars and acne, imphepho is believed to stimulate cellular regeneration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Imphepho is boiled either in water or milk to make a tea, it is used internally to treat coughs, colds, fever, infection, menstrual pain, headaches, insomnia, hypertension and even allergies and diabetes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  For pain relief and to treat coughs, colds, bronchitis and other chest infections the plant is burnt and the smoke inhaled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; No evidence is available as to how effective imphepho is as a treatment for tuberculosis but the plant's common use in the area and the prevalence of the illness suggest that it may be ineffective.

The papery flowers of various species come in a range of colours with bright to dull yellow, white, pink and orange being most common. They are popular in flower arrangements and have been used in [[potpourri]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Ritual uses ==

In traditional rituals and ceremonies imphepho is burnt in large quantities. It is usually burnt indoors and traditionally in a badly ventilated hut, the herb is used as incense but in such large quantities that it may resemble fumigation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Before and during consultations with the ancestors for the purposes of divination or otherwise, Sangomas will burn imphepho.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The areal parts of the plant (leaves, twigs and flowers if the plant is in flower) are collected and tied up in tight bundles which are dried. A bundle of Imphepho can smoulder for quite a long time producing a great deal of smoke.
The herb is burnt to invoke, honour and placate the ancestors. Burning Imphepho is seen as a ritual offering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 
The plant is mainly used in traditional ceremonies and rituals as well as African traditional medicine, but it may be used privately by individuals from time to time to ward off evil, dispel negativity, for meditation or other such purposes. Despite its mild psychoactive properties the plant is not commonly used recreationally as a mind-altering or consciousness-expanding herb. 
Unlike many plants with magical properties ascribed to them which are used in traditional medicine and shamanism, ''Helichrysum'' species do not contain alkaloids, instead a mixture of flavanoids, volatile oils, sesquiterpenoids and acylated phloroglucinols seem to mimic the effects of alkaloid compounds on the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
In order to experience the effects of imphepho a lot of smoke must be breathed in for a long time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
Euphoria, ecstasy, uncontrolled giggling and sedation are commonly experienced by people inhaling imphepho smoke. Violent mood swings, mental confusion and personality changes have not been reported.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other symptoms may be more rare and are normally seen in connection to the African traditional beliefs, mild hallucinations (such as seeing everything bathed in a gentle golden light) are seen as 'visions' and "speaking in tongues" has been known.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Whether these are a result of the effects of the plant or of the psychological state of those involved in the rituals is uncertain. There is no evidence that even prolonged heavy use of imphepho can lead to any sort of physical or psychological dependency and there is no evidence of any health problems arising from prolonged use (apart from those associated with smoke inhalation perhaps). 
Imphepho is an important part of African traditional medicine and rituals and the plant is revered, however little to no effort is made to protect areas in which the plant commonly grows. This may be because the plant is very common in Southern Africa. Although the use of imphepho in rituals and ceremonies is normally associated with African traditional beliefs, it is often burned as incense in South African Christian churches. Here it is assumed that its use is similar to that of frankincense and not associated with honouring the ancestors. The plant is commonly available and seldom sold for much money,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it is difficult to say whether it is seen as a 'holy' or 'sacred' plant. The plant is believed to increase the spiritual awareness and psychic abilities of those who use it.
South African law protects the right of individuals to burn imphepho as part of ceremonies and rituals associated with traditional beliefs. 
The dried bundle of imphepho is usually burnt in the middle of a (typically badly ventilated) room or hut in a potsherd.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Smoking imphepho through a pipe or in a cigarette is unknown. The smoke has a smell which is not always liked by everyone, it has been described as being similar to mildew and camphor with fenugreek overtones.

'''Herpesviral encephalitis''' is [[encephalitis]] due to [[herpes simplex virus]].

Herpes simplex [[encephalitis]] (HSE) is a viral infection of the human [[central nervous system]]. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500,000 individuals per year&lt;ref name=pmid16675036&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitley RJ | title = Herpes simplex encephalitis: adolescents and adults | journal = Antiviral Research | volume = 71 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 141–8 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16675036 | doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2006.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some studies suggest an incidence rate of 5.9 cases per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name=pmid16740836&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kropp RY, Wong T, Cormier L, Ringrose A, Burton S, Embree JE, Steben M | title = Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections in Canada: results of a 3-year national prospective study | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1955–62 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16740836 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-1778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of cases of herpes encephalitis are caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), the same virus that causes cold sores. 57% of American adults are infected with HSV-1,&lt;ref name=pmid16926356&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu F, Sternberg MR, Kottiri BJ, McQuillan GM, Lee FK, Nahmias AJ, Berman SM, Markowitz LE | title = Trends in herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 seroprevalence in the United States | journal = JAMA | volume = 296 | issue = 8 | pages = 964–73 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16926356 | doi = 10.1001/jama.296.8.964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is spread through droplets, casual contact, and sometimes sexual contact, though most infected people never have cold sores. About 10% of cases of herpes encephalitis are due to HSV-2, which is typically spread through sexual contact. About 1 in 3 cases of HSE result from primary HSV-1 infection, predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18; 2 in 3 cases occur in [[Serostatus|seropositive]] persons, few of whom have history of recurrent orofacial herpes. Approximately 50% of individuals who develop HSE are over 50 years of age.&lt;ref name=pmid11853816&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitley RJ, Gnann JW | title = Viral encephalitis: familiar infections and emerging pathogens | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9305 | pages = 507–13 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11853816 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07681-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as [[Mental confusion|confusion]], and changes in personality.  Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in patient's [[cerebrospinal fluid]], without the presence of [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].  Patients typically have a fever&lt;ref name=pmid16675036/&gt; and may have seizures.  The electrical activity of the brain changes as the disease progresses, first showing abnormalities in one [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, which spread to the other temporal lobe 7–10 days later.&lt;ref name=pmid16675036/&gt; Imaging by CT or MRI shows characteristic changes in the temporal lobes (see Figure). Definite diagnosis requires testing of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for presence of the virus. The testing takes several days to perform, and patients with suspected Herpes encephalitis should be treated with [[acyclovir]] immediately while waiting for test results.

==Pathophysiology==
HSE is thought to be caused by the transmission of virus from a peripheral site on the face following HSV-1 reactivation, along a nerve [[axon]], to the brain.&lt;ref name=pmid16675036/&gt; The virus lies dormant in the [[ganglion]] of the trigeminal [[cranial nerve]], but the reason for reactivation, and its pathway to gain access to the brain, remains unclear, though changes in the immune system caused by stress clearly play a role in animal models of the disease.  The olfactory nerve may also be involved in HSE,&lt;ref name=pmid7437807&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dinn JJ | title = Transolfactory spread of virus in herpes simplex encephalitis | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 281 | issue = 6252 | pages = 1392 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7437807 | pmc = 1715042 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6252.1392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain its predilection for the [[temporal lobe]]s of the brain, as the olfactory nerve sends branches there.  In horses, a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] is sufficient to allow the virus to cause neurological disease;&lt;ref name=pmid19456260&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van de Walle GR, Goupil R, Wishon C, Damiani A, Perkins GA, Osterrieder N | title = A single-nucleotide polymorphism in a herpesvirus DNA polymerase is sufficient to cause lethal neurological disease | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 200 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–5 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19456260 | doi = 10.1086/599316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no similar mechanism has been found in humans.

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=July 2018}}

==Treatment==
Herpesviral Encephalitis can be treated with high-dose intravenous [[acyclovir]], which should be infused 10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg(adult) over 1 hour to avoid renal failure. Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximately 70% of cases; survivors suffer severe neurological damage.&lt;ref name=pmid16675036/&gt;  When treated, HSE is still fatal in one-third of cases, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half of survivors. Twenty percent of treated patients recover with minor damage. Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function.&lt;ref name=pmid11853816/&gt; Indeed, many amnesic cases in the scientific literature have etiologies involving HSE. Earlier treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) improves the chances of a good recovery. Rarely, treated individuals can have relapse of infection weeks to months later. There is evidence that aberrant inflammation triggered by herpes simplex can result in granulomatous inflammation in the brain, which responds to steroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varatharaj A, Nicoll JA, Pelosi E, Pinto AA | title = Corticosteroid-responsive focal granulomatous herpes simplex type-1 encephalitis in adults | journal = Practical Neurology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–144 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28153849 | doi = 10.1136/practneurol-2016-001474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the herpes virus can be spread, encephalitis itself is not infectious. Other viruses can cause similar symptoms of encephalitis, though usually milder ([[Human herpesvirus 6|Herpesvirus 6]], [[varicella zoster virus]], [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[coxsackievirus]], etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3588">'''The Institute of Medicine Equation''' was published in September 2002. It is the equation which is behind the [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion#Dietary Guidelines for Americans|2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] and the new food pyramid, [[MyPyramid]].

The Institute of Medicine equation uses a different approach to most others. The equation doesn't measure [[basal metabolic rate]], but uses experiments based on [[Doubly labeled water|doubly labelled water]]. The scientists at the [[Institute Of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] said in their report that the factorial method tended to underestimate calorie expenditure.

==Equations==

&lt;big&gt;'''EER'''&lt;/big&gt; (Estimated Energy Requirement) - the estimated number of daily kilocalories, or [[Calorie|Calories]], an individual requires in order to maintain his or her current weight.

*Adult Men: &lt;math&gt;EER=(662-(9.53*Age))+PA*((15.91*wt)+(539.6*ht))&lt;/math&gt;
*Adult Women: &lt;math&gt;EER=(354-(6.91*Age))+PA*((9.36*wt)+(726*ht))&lt;/math&gt;
*Boys Age 3-18: &lt;math&gt;EER=(88.5-(61.9*Age))+PA*((26.7*wt)+(903*ht))&lt;/math&gt;
*Girls Age 3-18: &lt;math&gt;EER=(135.3-(30.8*Age))+PA*((10*wt)+(934*ht))&lt;/math&gt;
*Toddlers aged 2: &lt;math&gt;EER=(89*wt)-80&lt;/math&gt;

These [[equations]] are for healthy weight children and adults. Correction formulae are used for overweight and obese individuals. These corrections for children and adolescents have been debated by S. J. Woodruff, R. M. Hanning, and S. I. Barr in a paper in [[Obesity]] Reviews published January 1, 2009. The issue is whether or not the different formulae are actually necessary or possibly even harmful if overestimate occurs and thus contributes to an even higher and unhealthier [[Human body weight|body weight]] in these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, S. J., Hanning, R. M., &amp; Barr, S. I. (2009). Energy recommendations for normal weight, overweight and obese children and adolescents: are different equations necessary?. Obesity Reviews, 10(1), 103-108. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00525.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are as follows:

*Obese Girls Age 3-18: &lt;math&gt;EER=(389-(41.2*age))+PA*((15.0*wt)+(701.6*ht))&lt;/math&gt;
*Obese Boys Age 3-18: &lt;math&gt;EER=(-114-(50.9*age))+PA*((19.5*wt)+(1161.4*ht))&lt;/math&gt;

All weights are in kilogrammes, heights are in metres, and age is in years. PA is for physical activity coefficient. The activity coefficients are tabulated below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

'''Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise''' ('''IHE''') is a  non-profit organization based in the US state of [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Governance  |work= Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise web site |url= http://www.ihe.net/Governance/ |accessdate= August 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It sponsors an initiative by the [[healthcare industry]] to improve the way computer systems share information. IHE was established in 1998 by a consortium of [[radiologists]] and [[information technology]] (IT) experts.

==Operations==
IHE created and operates a process through which [[interoperability]] of health care IT systems can be improved.  The group gathers case requirements, identifies available standards, and develops technical guidelines which manufacturers can implement.  IHE also stages "connectathons" and "interoperability showcases" in which vendors assemble to demonstrate the interoperability of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise: A Primer: Part 4.

IHE is sponsored by the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS), the [[Radiological Society of North America]] (RSNA), and the [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC). The [[eye care]] domain is sponsored by the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is IHE?|url=http://www.ihe.net/FAQ/#Who_is_IHE?|website=IHE.net|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
IHE integration profiles describe a clinical information need or [[workflow]] scenario and document how to use established [[standardization|standards]] to accomplish it. A group of systems that implement the same integration profile address the need/scenario in a mutually compatible way.

For example, the [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine]] (DICOM) standards specify many different formats for image data. A given set of images that might comply with some optional parts of the standards might still not be accepted by an application in use by a particular radiologist. Profiles reduce the chances of these incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Image Exchange: IHE and the Evolution of Image Sharing |author1=David S. Mendelson |author2=Peter R. G.

The [[Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes]] (LOINC) standard codes for use in [[database]]s are often used in IHE profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= HL7/LOINC Document Ontology: Proposed Revision |author= Kevin Coonan |publisher= Deloitte Consulting |date= August 30, 2012 |work= Presentation for LOINC meeting |url= http://loinc.org/meetings/20120830/LOINC_DocOnt_Description.pdf |accessdate= August 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A model for [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing|cross-enterprise document sharing]] called [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing|XDS]] allows hospitals to share electronic records that use the [[Health Level 7]] (HL7) standards and LOINC codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Design and Implementation of the System Architecture for Sharing Medical Information Based on HL7-CDA among Hospitals by the XDS Model of IHE |author1=Bong-Mun Jang |author2=Joong Il Kim |author3=Keon Ho Yang |author4=Dong Hoon Han |author5=Hyo Min Cho |author6=Haijo Jung |author7=Hee-Joung Kim |date= August 27, 2006 |journal= World Congress of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering |publisher= Springer |volume= 14 |pages= 460–1833 |doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-36841-0_123 |isbn= 978-3-540-36841-0 |url= https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-36841-0_123.pdf |accessdate= August 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= LOINC® Document Ontology Proposed Extension and Revision |date= July 24, 2012 |work= LOINC meeting material |url= http://loinc.org/meetings/20120830/2012%2008%20-%20LOINC_DocOnt_Description.pdf |accessdate= August 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHE integration statements are prepared and published by a vendor to list the IHE profiles supported by a specific release of a specific product.

IHE technical frameworks are detailed documents which specify the integration profiles and associated actors (systems) and transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= IHE: integrating the healthcare enterprise, towards complete integration of healthcare information systems |vauthors=Bernardini A, Alonzi M, Campioni P, Vecchioli A, Marano P |pmid= 14509182 |date= January–March 2003 |journal= Rays |volume= 28 |number=1 |pages= 83–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Headache Society''' ('''IHS''') is a [[charitable organization|charity]] membership organisation founded in 1981 for those with a professional commitment to helping people affected by [[headache]].

It has over 1,000 ordinary members (including national society members). The society publishes an international journal ''[[Cephalalgia (journal)|Cephalalgia]]''. The society was incorporated in 1994 in England and Wales as a Company Limited by Guarantee and registered in 1995 as a charity.

==International Headache Congress==
The International Headache Congress (IHC) is held every second year, organized and hosted on behalf of IHS by a member national society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2266">'''James Roderick Johnston Cameron''' [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|PPRCSE]] (1902&amp;ndash;1997) was a 20th century Scottish surgeon who served as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] from 1967 to 1970.

==Life==
[[File:The grave of James Roderick Johnston Cameron, Grange Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of James Roderick Johnston Cameron, Grange Cemetery]]
He was born on 24 June 1902 in [[Belfast]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancestryresearchservice.com/genealogy/familygroup.php?familyID=F1781&amp;tree=cameron1&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a dentist of Scottish descent, and originally trained as a dentist.

He studied Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] and did postgraduate studies at the [[University of Montreal]] and [[McGill University]] developing an interest in [[neurosurgery]] under Prof [[Wilder Penfield]]. Returning to Britain he became an assistant surgeon at [[Leith Hospital]] then in 1939 got a position at [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] he joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. He landed at [[Narvik]] following the [[D-Day landings]]. A hand injury prevented him from operating and he was posted to the [[Chasseurs Alpins]] (Les Diables Bleu) as their Medical Officer. He returned to Edinburgh after the war and specialised in [[thyroid]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal, obituary 6 Sept 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 23 February 1997. He is buried in [[Grange Cemetery]]. The simple stone lies in the south-west section.


==Family==

In 1940, just prior to going to war, he was married to Dorothy Margaret Pearson (1913-1995).&lt;ref&gt;Grave of J R J Cameron, Grange Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt; She was an artist and her portrait of James is held in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/james-roderick-johnston-cameron-19021997-frcsed-1931-prcsed-19671970-187222&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons and two daughters.

The '''Kuma–Manych Canal''' ({{lang-ru|Кумо–Манычский канал}}) is an [[irrigation]] [[canal]] in Russia's [[Stavropol Krai]]. The canal, completed in 1965,&lt;ref name=kuma&gt;[http://www.vladsc.narod.ru/library/stavrop/prikumie.htm Kuma Region Irrigation] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs across the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]], connecting the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]], which flows into the [[Caspian Sea]], with the [[East Manych|East Manych River]], which also flows toward the Caspian, but dries out long before reaching it. The East Manych River should not be confused with the [[Manych River|West Manych]], a tributary of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] which flows into the [[Sea of Azov]] and connects to the [[Black Sea]].

The Kuma–Manych Canal begins near the village of Novokumsky on the Kuma River, between the cities of [[Budyonnovsk]] and [[Neftekumsk]]. Its starting point is at a small reservoir on the Kuma River ({{coord|44|48|10|N|44|39|40|E|name=start}}) into which the [[Terek–Kuma Canal]] (Терско–Кумский канал; completed 1958&lt;ref name=kuma/&gt;) brings the [[Terek River|Terek]] water from the south. From there, the Kuma–Manych Canal carries water first toward the north-east, and then toward the north-west, ending at the southern shore of the [[Chogray Reservoir]] on the [[East Manych]] River; Google maps show a [[River delta|small peninsula, formed by the alluvial deposits]] at the canal's end point there ({{coord|45|27|50|N|44|37|33|E|name=end}}).

== Other proposed canals in the area ==
In June 2007, the leaders of [[Kazakhstan]] suggested that Russia build a much deeper canal (dubbed [[Eurasia Canal]]) along the bottom of the Kuma–Manych Depression, suitable for large-ship navigation between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]]. The [[Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences]] started conducting a review of possible routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2007/gb2007079_528939.htm Caspian Canal Could Boost Kazakh Trade] [[Business Week]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lac du Verney''' is an artificial reservoir in the department of [[Isère (département)|Isère]], in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] of [[France]]. It serves as the lower reservoir for the [[Grand'Maison Dam]] [[pumped-storage]] scheme.

Neighbouring lakeside communities include Oz and [[Allemond]].

Since 2006 it has hosted the opening swim of the [[Alpe d'Huez Triathlon]].

'''Lake Arenal''' ({{lang-es|Lago Arenal}}) is a lake which is situated in the northern highlands of [[Costa Rica]]. It is currently the largest lake in [[Costa Rica]] at {{convert|85|sqkm|mi2|adj=on}}.  Its depth varies between 30 and 60 meters (100–200&amp;nbsp;feet) seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Lake Arenal Depth|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/attractions/national-park/lake-arenal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Arenal was relocated to higher ground when the lake was expanded in 1979.  The old towns of Arenal and Tronadora now lie abandoned at the bottom of the lake, with the new town of Arenal existing to the northeast on the lake.

== Hydroelectricity ==
Lake Arenal was tripled in size with the construction of the [[Presa Sangregado Dam|Arenal dam]] in 1979, which exists at the eastern end of the lake.  This [[hydroelectric]] project is hugely important to Costa Rica, initially generating 70% of the country's electricity, now closer to 17%, and was also a driving force behind Costa Rica's green energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Carlos | last=Pérez| coauthors=| contribution=Results of the Event| title=Minutes of the Workshop on Adaptation to Climate Change in Costa Rica| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=Trofcca Central America| place=San José, Costa Rica| pages=| date=2006-12-13| id= | contribution-url=http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/trofcca/america/workshops/wrkshp_adapt_costa_rica_Dec_2006.doc| format=DOC| accessdate=2007-10-02| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Fish species in Lake Arenal the [[machaca (fish)|machaca]] and the [[rainbow bass]]. There are also many species of plants, 120 mammals (including [[jaguar]] and [[tapir]]), and 300 birds (including [[quetzal]]).

== Recreation ==
From November through April the strong, dependable winds attract windsurfers and kite surfers to its western end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticowind.com/ |title=Lake Arenal Costa Rica Tico Wind Windsurf Center - Windsurfing Kiteboarding Rentals Lessons |accessdate=2015-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many consider Lake Arenal one of the world's foremost windsurfing and kite surfing areas. Wakeboarding is gaining popularity in Costa Rica, with Lake Arenal being the center of this activity. Stand up paddling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Costa Rica Stand Up Paddling Tours|url = http://www.desafiocostarica.com/desafio-adventure-company-tours/all/stand-up-paddling|website = www.desafiocostarica.com|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kayaking are also popular activities for tourists visiting the lake's Eastern part near the earthen dam.  There are many good fishing (primarily for rainbow bass) and now kayak fishing opportunities in the shallow and secluded coves. The area surrounding the lake has good hiking, biking, bird watching, and horseback riding opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Lake Arenal Activities|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/attractions/national-park/lake-arenal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand French|Malnutrition au Tibet|date=May 2012}}

'''Malnutrition''' is an important health concern in [[Tibet]]. According to a study conducted in 1994/1995 in eleven districts of Tibet, malnutrition affected more than half of the children from 1–7 years old. The major cause was poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/eo20010728a2.html|title=Malnutrition plagues Tibet's children|author=Cesar Chelala|first=|date=July 28, 2001|website=|publisher=Japan Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 14, 2012|quote=QUOTE: "In 1996, the Western Consortium for Public Health, a private U.S.-based organization, said 60 percent of the children studied fell drastically below accepted international growth reference values and concluded that the height of Tibetan children was a matter of grave concern. Their data indicated that the children’s shortness was a result of nutritional deficiencies — chronic malnutrition during the first three years of life — rather than the consequence of genetics or altitude, as had been previously suggested."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Segametsi Mogomotsi''' was a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was found murdered on 6 November 1994 in [[Mochudi]], [[Botswana]]. She went missing sometime on 5 November, and her body was found naked and mutilated in an open space the next morning. The ''dipheko'' ([[medicine murder]]) sparked protests by the students at the Radikolo Community Junior Secondary School (RCJSS), the school where she attended, as well as among the citizens of Mochudi. The protests led to riots in neighbouring [[Gaborone]], prompting the government of Botswana to call in the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]]. No one has been formally charged with the murder, and an official police report was conducted, but as of August 2012, the results have not yet been released.{{sfn|Pitse|2011}} The murder inspired the stories in [[Unity Dow]]'s novel ''The Screaming of the Innocent'', Michael Stanley's mystery ''Deadly Harvest'', and [[Alexander McCall Smith]]{{'s}} novel ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (novel)|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]''.{{sfn|Wheretowhento.com|2012}}

==Background==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = So Segametsi was taken to a hill and a cloth was put in her mouth so she couldn't shout. She was killed by three men, and the one took the anus. The other parts were the breasts, vagina, and the tongue. She was heard crying during the night saying, "M., leave me alone, how can you kill me, I know you."

{{Quote box
 |quote  = They picked this girl, who was a clever girl and a good student, because she was poor and they thought no one would make a fuss if she disappeared.

}}
''Dipheko'' is the ritual murder of a person whose body parts are cut off to make ''[[muti]]'' (medicine) that is used to promote business deals.{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=208}} Dipheko is not uncommon in Botswana. The British dealt with ritual murder cases when the country was still a [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|protectorate]] as early as the 1930s,{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=204}} and social scientist Cyprian Fisiy has called witchcraft "the primary concern of most African communities".{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=40}} Children, especially highly educated students, are the primary targets of dipheko because of their perceived potential for success.{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=213}} When social anthropologist Ørnulf Gulbrandsen interviewed several Batswana, one man said that, "we have no other way to explain how some people become rich overnight".{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=287}} Those who committed dipheko recount either being possessed to murder or being threatened by future attacks through ''boloi'' (witchcraft) and thus were coerced to kill.{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=205}}

==Murder==
In November 1996, anthropologist Charlanne Burke interviewed a student who summarised the murder:

{{bq|1=Segametsi was selling oranges to raise money for a school trip. Some men came to her and bought all of her oranges, but they said they didn't have change so they would go to get it and come back. So Segametsi waited there all day and into the evening, till it was almost dark. Then some men came and grabbed her and put cotton … in her mouth, blindfolded her, and tied up her hands. They took her to a house in the bush …. This killer cut Segametsi into parts, putting arms and legs in piles according to the requests of the businessmen who had ordered the killing.{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=209}}}}

==Investigation==
Segametsi's stepfather was arrested after confessing that he and other local businessmen killed the girl, but he retracted his statement, saying that the confession was really a second-hand account.{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=41}} While the named businessmen were arrested, they were released, sparking controversy in Mochudi.{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=41}} In 2008, Sekobye Mokgalo, one of the named businessmen, asked for government compensation for the wrongful conviction.{{sfn|Pitse|2008}} In 2009, he received 300,000 [[Botswana pula]] for damages from the government.

==Protests==
In January 1995, students at Radikolo Community Junior Secondary School organized a march at the District Commissioner's office in Mochudi in response "perceived [...] government collusion in the practice of witchcraft".{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=41–42}} The march escalated into riots and protesters burned the house of the suspects.{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=42}} The violence continued in Gaborone starting on 16 February 1995.{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=288}} An ''ad hoc'' group, the Revolutionary War Council, pressed for justice "without [the] state's intervention."{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=42}} The Special Services Group, the riot police of the [[Botswana Defence Force]], used tear gas on protesters in the central business district while students at the [[University of Botswana]] stormed an ongoing meeting of the [[National Assembly of Botswana]].{{sfn|Gewald|2002|p=42}} President [[Quett Masire]] issued a statement in response to the protests:

{{bq|1=We shall not tolerate lawlessness, destruction of public and private property as well as unruly behaviour...Government has taken stern action to stamp out these unwelcome developments, so I have instructed the police and the army to restore law and order. Those who continue with such behaviour will regret.{{sfn|Molomo|2001|p=46}}}}

Both rioters and police were injured: more than fifteen protesters were treated for rubber bullet wounds at the Deborah Relief Memorial Hospital,{{sfn|Molomo|2001|p=46}} a small boy was killed and a bystander was paralyzed; both by police rubber bullets.{{sfn|Burke|2000|p=210}} A man was later executed by the police for the protests.{{sfn|Titlestad|1996}} The [[Botswana National Front]] Youth League criticized the government's response to the riots, saying that the military force was "not in keeping with democratic practice and may signal the emergence of a police/military state".{{sfn|Molomo|2001|p=46}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">The '''National Children’s Study''' (NCS) was a longitudinal [[cohort study]] that planned to recruit participants from across the United States of America. It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to [[health]] and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014.&lt;ref name=Science121214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jocelyn Kaiser|title=NIH cancels massive U.S. children’s study|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/12/nih-cancels-massive-u-s-children-s-study|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Science|date=December 12, 2014|quote=has too many flaws to be carried out in a tight budget environment, advisers today told National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins.

==Organization==
The NCS was led by the [[National Institutes of Health]], with the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) serving as the scientific lead. Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD.

For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety.

In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/organization/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Mandate==
The "President’s Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children" recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to:

# plan, develop, and implement a [[prospective cohort study]], from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and
# investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes.

The Act required this NCS to:
# incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children’s well-being;
# gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and
# consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/html/2011-10500.htm New Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Neuropsychosocial Measures Formative Research Methodology Studies for the National Children's Study] Federal Register, vol 76, No. 84, May 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment—broadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences— and [[genetics]] on the growth, [[child development|development]], and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to:
# contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children
# deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes
# understand factors that lead to health disparities.

With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/overview/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinued==
The NCS was in its Vanguard, or [[pilot study|pilot]] phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013.

On December 12, 2014, the National Children’s Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.&lt;ref&gt;National Children’s Study (NCS) Working Group [http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/NCS_WG_FINAL_REPORT.pdf FINAL REPORT – DECEMBER 12, 2014]  National Institutes of Health, Advisory Committee to the Director, 19 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCS will not collect any new information from participants.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The NIH plans to make data already collected available to researchers in late 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The '''Novocherkassk massacre'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1961novocherkassk&amp;Year=1961 1961: Novocherkassk Massacre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303225923/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1961novocherkassk&amp;Year=1961 |date=2011-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to events tied to the [[labor strike]] at a locomotive building plant in [[Novocherkassk]], a city in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. The events eventually culminated into the protests of June 1–2, 1962 when reportedly 26 protesters were killed by [[Soviet Army]] troops, and 87 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bessmertnybarak.ru/article/ne_khvataet_deneg_na_myaso/|title=«Не хватает денег на мясо и колбасу, ешьте пирожки с ливером»|website=Бессмертный барак|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

The riots were a direct result of shortages of food and provisions, as well as the poor working conditions in the factory.  The protest began on June 1 in the ''[[Semyon Budyonny|Budyonny]] Electric [[Locomotive]] Factory'', when workers from the [[foundry]] and [[forge]] shops stopped work after factory management refused to hear their complaints. The strike and attendant discussions had spread throughout the whole factory by noon.

The unrest began when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] raised the prices of meat and butter throughout the Soviet Union on June 1st.  On the same day, as required by a separate economic plan, the minimum production quotas for each worker at the factory were increased,&lt;ref&gt;Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshkov, ''Inside the Kremlin's Cold War: from Stalin to Khrushchev'', Harvard University Press, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; thereby effectively reducing pay rates.&lt;ref name=Hosking&gt;Hosking, Geoffrey.  A History of the Soviet Union, [[Fontana Press]], [[London]].  1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  This culminated in a march on the [[town hall]] and police headquarters, and the strike spread to other enterprises after police arrested thirty workers.

According to documents declassified in 90's, motorized infantry units were called to suppress the protesters, but they fired in the air, and the lethal fire came from a unit of [[Internal Troops of Russia|Internal troops]], from [[Rostov-on-Don]] composed of 10 snipers and 2 machine guns, who were set up at the "Don" hotel. Orders to kill were approved through the whole [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], from Khrushchev, through the ministry of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bessmertnybarak.ru/article/ne_khvataet_deneg_na_myaso/|title=«Не хватает денег на мясо и колбасу, ешьте пирожки с ливером»|work=Бессмертный барак|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commander of the North-Caucasian Troops, general [[Matvey Shaposhnikov|Kuzmich Shapochnikov]], refused to execute an order to attack peaceful demonstrators with tanks (he reportedly said, "I don't see any enemy that we could turn our weapons against"), for which he was later degraded and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bessmertnybarak.ru/Shaposhnikov_Matvey_Kuzmich/|title=Шапошников Матвей Кузьмич - История на сайте Бессмертный барак|work=Шапошников Матвей Кузьмич :: Бессмертный барак|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to now available official sources, 26 protesters were killed by the [[machine-gun]]-equipped&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=124198&amp;cid=1&amp;date=02.06.2007 (in Russian) Новочеркасск вспоминает жертв трагедии, Vest, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827865,00.html And Then the Police Fired], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', October 19, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Army troops, and 87 were wounded with 3 of those dying later of their wounds.  After the initial demonstrations, a curfew was implemented in the town. The dead bodies were secretly buried in the cemeteries of other towns of the [[Rostov Oblast]]. However, the following morning, a large group of several hundred demonstrators again gathered in the square. One hundred and sixteen were arrested, of which fourteen were convicted by show trials, seven of those receiving a death sentence and were executed. The others were sentenced to prison terms of ten to fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taubman, William]]. ''[[Khrushchev: The Man and His Era]]'', First Edition, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Co.]], [[New York City|New York]], NY.  2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, the Soviet government directed extra food supplies to the region and began an investigation.  Additional arrests of workers followed, as did [[court martial|courts martial]] of military officials involved. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] claimed that individuals wounded in the unrest and their families were exiled to [[Siberia]].

The whole story was never allowed to appear in the press or any other Soviet mass media and remained an official secret until 1992, when the remains of 20 bodies were recovered and identified in 1992 and buried in the cemetery of [[Novoshakhtinsk]].

== In fiction ==

During a Politburo scene in ''[[The Devil's Alternative]]'' (1979) by author [[Frederick Forsyth]], the [[Chairman of the KGB|KGB chief]], asked if he could suppress riots during famine, responds that the KGB could suppress ten, even twenty Novocherkassks, but not fifty – intentionally using the example to highlight how serious the difficulties would be that the Soviet Union finds itself in the novel.

The massacre is dramatized in [[Francis Spufford]]'s 2010 novel ''Red Plenty''.

The '''Nutrition Labeling and Education Act''' (NLEA) (Public Law 101-535) is a 1990 [[United States]] Federal law. It was signed into law on November 8, 1990 by President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name = "AHA"/&gt;

The law gives the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) authority to require nutrition labeling of most foods regulated by the Agency; and to require that all nutrient content claims (for example, 'high fiber', 'low fat', etc.) and health claims meet FDA regulations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nutritional Labeling |journal=[[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] |url=//www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/nleatxt.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014547/http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/nleatxt.html |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act did not require [[restaurant]]s to comply with the same standards.

The regulations became effective for health claims, ingredient declarations, and percent juice labeling on May 8, 1993 (but percent juice labeling was exempted until May 8, 1994).&lt;ref name = "FDA"/&gt;

Effective Jan. 1, 2006, the Nutrition Facts Labels on packaged food products are required by the FDA to list how many grams of [[trans fatty acid]] (trans fat) are contained within one serving of the product.&lt;ref name = "AHA"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary Supplement Act of 1992==
Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah introduced the [[Health Freedom Act]] of 1992 which would have blocked the FDA from using health claims as a reason to regulate dietary supplements as drugs.  The senator said he "entered the controversy after hearing from constituents in his home state, including both consumers and makers of dietary supplements". Hatch stated that the FDA "can put anybody out of business if they want to."  Hatch's bill did not get very far, but it encouraged Congress to pass the [[Dietary Supplement Act]] of 1992 (Public Law 102-571), which blocked the FDA from applying its forthcoming labeling rules for conventional foods to dietary supplements for another year, until the end of 1993.&lt;ref name = "pol"&gt;{{cite book

[[Contact dermatitis|Contact Dermatitis]] due to irritation is [[inflammation]] of the skin which results from a contact with an irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irritant Dematitis|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-540-31294-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that this type of [[dermatitis]] does not require prior sensitization of the [[immune system]]. There have been studies to support that past or present [[Atopic dermatitis|atopic]] [[Atopic dermatitis|dermatitis]] is a risk factor for this type of [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coenraads|first=P. J.|last2=Diepgen|first2=T.

The acute form of this dermatitis develops on exposure of the skin to a strong irritant or caustic chemical. This exposure can occur as a result of [[accident]] at a [[workplace]] . The irritant reaction starts to increase in its intensity within minutes to hours of exposure to the irritant and reaches its peak quickly. After the reaction has reached its peak level, it starts to heal. This process is known as decrescendo phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dermatotoxicology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0849397738|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent potent irritants leading to this type of dermatitis are acids and alkaline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eichmann|first=A.|last2=Amgwerd|first2=D.|date=1992-05-05|title=[Toxic contact dermatitis]|journal=Schweizerische Rundschau Für Medizin Praxis = Revue Suisse De Médecine Praxis|volume=81|issue=19|pages=615–617|issn=1013-2058|pmid=1589676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include redness and swelling of the skin along with the formation of blisters.

The chronic form occurs as a result of repeated exposure of the skin to weak irritants over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=M. V.|date=1988-01-01|title=Chronic, irritant contact dermatitis: mechanisms, variables, and differentiation from other forms of contact dermatitis|journal=Advances in Dermatology|volume=3|pages=261–275|issn=0882-0880|pmid=3152823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical manifestations of the contact dermatitis are also modified by external factors such as environmental factors (mechanical pressure, temperature, and humidity) and predisposing characteristics of the individual (age, sex, ethnic origin, preexisting skin disease, atopic skin diathesis, and anatomic region exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/dermatitis.html|title=Dermatitis, Irritant Contact : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another occupational skin disease is glove-related hand [[urticaria]],  believed to be caused by repeated wearing and removal of the gloves. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers. The reaction is caused by the latex or the [[nitrile]] present in the gloves.&lt;ref&gt;Glove-related hand urticaria: an increasing occupational problem amongst health care workers. Hawkey S, Abdul Ghaffar S.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==

Prevention measures include avoidance of the irritant through its removal from the workplace or through technical shielding by the use of potent irritants in closed systems or automation, irritant replacement or removal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=handbook of occupational dermatology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal protection of the workers. Low quality evidence exists for the effectiveness of certain therapies and their ability to specifically prevent hand skin irritation in the workplace. The limited evidence that does exist suggests that moisturizers used alone or in combination with a barrier cream can result in a clinically beneficial effect in the long or short-term primary prevention of occupational irritant hand dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer A, Rönsch H, Elsner P, Dittmar D, Bennett C, Schuttelaar MA, Lukács J, John S, Williams HC.

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
[[File:Cigarette_packet_foil.JPG|150px|right|thumb|Cigarette box of the company Philip Morris.]]
[[File:Flag of Uruguay.svg|150px|right]]

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties.

[[File:testedlabel.jpg|thumb|right|A common label for certifying that a device has been tested.]]
'''Portable appliance testing''' (commonly known as "PAT", "PAT inspection" or ([[RAS syndrome|redundantly]]) as "PAT testing") is the name of a process in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrengineers.co.uk/pat-testing|title=PAT Testing {{!}} Gas Safety Certificate from £30 Inc VAT|website=www.mrengineers.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is "in-service inspection &amp; testing of electrical equipment".  Testing involves a [[visual inspection]] of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.

Similar procedures exist in other countries, for example, testing of  equipment according to ''DGUV Vorschrift 3'' in Germany.

==Purpose==
[[Health and safety]] regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers.  Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards.

Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the [[British Standard Code of Practice]] and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out.

==Origin of name==
Portable appliance testing is abbreviated as PAT. The correct term for the whole process is "In-service Inspection &amp; Testing of Electrical Equipment" (as defined by IET/IEE and City and Guilds).

In Australia and New Zealand, the common name for PAT is simply 'Test and Tag'. The regulatory guidelines are set out in AS/NZS3760:2010.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==UK legal obligations==

===Appliances===
British law (the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]]) requires that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger. Private houses are not covered by this legislation, although [[occupiers' liability in English law|occupiers' liability]] requires householders not to deliberately expose occupants or visitors to unreasonable risks. The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation.

===Fixed wiring in buildings===
Guidance from the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET, published under the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] brand) and the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) recommends that a competent person must inspect the installation regularly in any public building or a place that people work. They suggest initial intervals for combined inspection and testing that range from three months (for construction equipment) to one year, and in many cases, longer periods for re-testing (certain types of appliance in schools, hotels, offices and shops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Health and Safety Executive, Electrical safety and you]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]] is an obligation on UK businesses, there is no obligation to undertake PAT inspection.  In reality neither act nor their corresponding regulations and associated statutory instruments detail PAT inspection as an obligation, but rather impose a requirement of maintenance of safety and evidence of [[planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] for all hand-held, portable and plug-in equipment.

Today a great many private companies and other organizations do meet their legal obligations to protect their workers by an enforced PAT regime, but it is not the only route.

Recent HSE publications have relaxed their tone somewhat to acknowledge this, and now point out that in many situations annual PAT is disproportionate to the risks and is often not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Maintaining portable electric equipment in low-risk environment]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the HSE reviewed its approach to portable appliance maintenance in its own offices. Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training.

Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments.
You do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections.
Regular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment.
For landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a "duty of care" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;http://electricians-portsmouth.co.uk/electrical-landlord-certificates-need-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in UK ==

The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates.  This was under the control of the [[Property Services Agency]] – prior to 1972 the [[Ministry of Public Building and Works]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In some cases testing was conducted on a three-month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of "passed", "tested for electrical safety" and "do not use after..." labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the [[Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] and the [[Electricity at Work Act 1989]].

==Site and campus requirements, events and contractors==

In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work.  Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner.

The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false.  Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation.  Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe.

The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as "Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition" and refrain from overzealous statements such as "must be PAT inspected" which can be restrictive without improving safety.  Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker.

==Carrying out PAT ==

This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person.  In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables.

===User checks===
Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised not to use the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before operation, and the results are generally not recorded, unless a defect is identified.

===Formal visual inspections===
This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysafety.govt.nz/about/publications/accident-summaries Faults and electrical safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined inspections and PAT ===
At periodic intervals, the portable appliances are tested to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing. Note the inside of the plug should be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous).

==Testing==

The tests an appliance is required to undergo will depend on the type of appliance, its electrical [[Appliance classes|Class]] and subject to a risk assessment by the technician. e.g. it may not be safe to perform a leakage current test which powers up the appliance, such as a grinder, if it can not be secured to a bench; an insulation resistance test may be a safe option.

===Earth resistance test===
This test shows the resistance offered by the earthing rods with the connection leads. Various testing instruments are available for earthing resistance tests. The earthing resistance should be less than 1Ω.

===Earth continuity test===
The equipment shall have a measured resistance of the [[Protective earth|protective earth circuit]], or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing is performed using an ohmmeter or [[Portable Appliance Test|PAT]] tester;
* Using the ohmmeter to produce a reading;
* Using a PAT tester under the following conditions;
** 12V maximum, test current range 100mA to 200mA - commonly known as "earth continuity test" or "screen test" 
** 12V maximum, test current 10A - commonly known as "routine test" 
** 12V maximum, 1.5 times rated current of appliance or 25A, whichever is greater - commonly known as "type test" or "bond test".

The choice of which of the tests to use is at the operator's discretion as there is merit in each test for given situations.  Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the "screen test". Older mains powered units can do all tests. Even "type testing" may only be testing at a fraction of the operational power of the unit.The power dissipated in the earth is only 300 watts compared to operational power which may be in excess of 2000 watts.

===Insulation resistance test===

A leakage current test performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliances or 1mA for [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2. 3.3.2(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, measure [[Electrical insulation|insulation resistance]] values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c. or alternatively, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the [[Surge protector|metal oxide varistors]] (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V d.c.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.2(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 230V AC. (therefore it can not be performed with a digital multimeter)

Insulation resistance testing is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 500V d.c (250 V d.c. may be used for equipment containing [[Surge protector|MOVs]] / EMI filtering)

A deficiency of the insulation resistance (500V/250V d.c) test is that the d.c voltage will not activate electromagnetic switches or internal relays etc. that are common in many modern power tools, computers, TVs etc. and therefore it can only test the appliance up to that point. Appliances with these components / design should be tested using the leakage current test.

===Polarity check===
In countries where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that can be carried out using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the socket end.&lt;ref&gt;BS7671 wiring rules OR Best Practices in Testing &amp; Tagging of Electrical Equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2003. (Zahra &amp; Virieux 2007) 5.8.1&lt;/ref&gt; Note: The earth is tested during the [[#Earth continuity test|earth continuity test]]. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).

====Plugs====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Neutral (light blue wire) and then Active (brown wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(a). General&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cord extension sockets====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCDs / ELCBs / Safety Switches===
There are two tests methods to be used;

====Press button====
This test requires specific test equipment RCD tester:

(the TEST button referred to here is the test button on the RCD tester NOT the TEST button on the RCD itself. If the RCD is live, pressing the RCD's own TEST button should ALWAYS trip the RCD).

The RCD tester should be connected with the socket, with earth terminal (must !!) and 
1)select the testing range 'delta' (10mA,30mA,100mA,300mA,500mA).
2)Select half delta range, and press TEST button - the RCD should not operate, this ensures against nuisance tripping.
3)Select delta range, and press TEST button - The RCD should operate, within m Sec for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz,230V system (as per BS 7671)

====Applied current====
This test requires specialised test equipment, knowledge and training;
*A current, equal to the rated tripping current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and protective earth and the operating time measured&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Appendix D D3&lt;/ref&gt; with maximum trip time 40ms for Type I and 300ms for Type II.

In addition to this, many technicians also test;
*using 1/2 (half) the rated tripping current to detect nuisance tripping.
*using 5 times rated tripping current, with trip times reduced accordingly, to simulate high current exposure.
* under 0 degree and 180 degree phases

Best Practice is to test the RCD under 1/2, 1X and 5X rated tripping current, each at both the 0 degree and 180 degree phases.

===Microwave ovens===
There are two specific extra checks mandated for microwave ovens in the United Kingdom.

The first is that the device immediately ceases production of the microwave radiation when the door is opened, which checks that the safety interlock systems are functional; and the second is that any leakage when operating is less than 5 mWcm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; which indicates that the door and casing are not distorted and any seals are intact so that there is no hazard to those in the vicinity of the equipment.

A piece of calibrated equipment is required for these tests to detect and measure leakage of the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz microwave radiation, it is usually a hand-held device with a sensing antenna that can be scanned over the areas where the door meets the casing to find any radiation ''hot-spots'' whilst the unit is operating.  As Microwave ovens are not normally designed to be operated without a load this will usually take the form of an open container containing a quantity of water which is used to absorb the energy and as it gets warmed gives an indication that a unit not previously examined by a tester is actually producing microwaves.  After checking for leakage the door is required to be opened by whatever means is provided and the measurement device is not to record a level above the given limit.  In some scenarios a known quantity of water is heated for a known period of time and the temperature rise over the period of operation is used to generate an indication of the effective power output of the magnetron. This can be helpful to determine whether the oven is operating at the expected power levels indicated by labelling.

== Class of construction ==
Electrical [[appliance classes]] are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes.  The protocols for PAT Testing vary by appliance class. 
*'''Class I''' – Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I.
*'''Class II''' – Double insulated wiring, The earth clamp is still connected during the insulation test even though no earth on appliance. Class II is indicated by double box.
*'''Class III''' – These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50&amp;nbsp;V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked.

The earth lead is connected to metal parts on both Class I and Class II appliances. For "Class I" during the earth test to prove continuity between earth pin and metal parts on the appliance. For "Class II" during the insulation test to prove the insulation between active-neutral and the metal parts of the appliance. i.e. there is no leakage from mains coming into the appliance to the metal parts that are exposed.

==PAT training and qualifications==
[[File:PATtest.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing at a workbench]]

In the UK, there is no requirement to have a formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing.  The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that where required, inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency.  It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a 2377–22 City and Guilds qualification.  PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. An example of a nationally recognised qualification of competence in PAT is offered by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City &amp; Guilds]]: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment – 4th Edition (No. 2377)'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-850C2351-18A457AB/cgonline/hs.xsl/1779.html?search_term=2377 City &amp; Guilds 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are others provided by EAL available.

In Australia it is a legal requirement to have attended a course or gained a qualification in order to PAT.  Proof of a company’s competence takes the form of a course certificate or qualification. A formal examination process for the topic is operated in collaboration with EAL or city and guilds (the awarding body) under the authority of the QCA (The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) who validate and authorise the qualification.

==Types of PAT testers==
At the basic level PAT test instruments carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.

===Pass / fail PAT testers===
These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper portable appliance testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Mains powered testers require AC power.   Battery operated PAT testers are self-contained and convenient to use. They usually come with rechargeable batteries.

These testers have a simple "lights" system. They have a "Pass" light, a "Fail" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show:
*earth continuity
*insulation resistance
*polarity.

===Advanced PAT testers===

These testers display more information than just pass or fail, including:
*Earth continuity resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 – 1.99&amp;nbsp;Ω at high test currents (usually 8&amp;nbsp;A, 10&amp;nbsp;A or 25&amp;nbsp;A) and lower test currents (in the range 20&amp;nbsp;mA to 200&amp;nbsp;mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested;
*Insulation resistance tests at test voltages of 500&amp;nbsp;V DC or 250&amp;nbsp;V DC.
*Protective conductor/touch current measurement (sometimes referred to as "earth leakage tests" on some older PAT units);
*Fuse test;
*Lead polarity.

These readings require interpretation by an electrician or someone with electrical understanding. Advanced PAT testers are effective as facilities management tools because they can record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances.

'''RCD testing'''

Some units can also test [[Residual-current device]]s, following the recommendation in the current IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter. 
[[Image:PrimeTest 250 RCD.jpg|thumb|left|Modern PAT testers include an RCD test]]

===Computerised PAT testers===
Some advanced PAT testers can download information to a computer. Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler, and can be used with other test accessories such as label printers. Records can be maintained using PAT software such as [https://patorganiser.com.au PATorganiser]

== Calibration of testers ==
As PAT testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit.

When a PAT tester is calibrated it is re-configuring it to match the original specification. This includes:

*Calibrating the unit back to national standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukas.com/ The United Kingdom Accreditation Service]&lt;/ref&gt;
*If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out.
*A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested.

Dual purpose check boxes (which are essentially known resistances either side of the test limits)have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased.

'''Project Raahat''' is an initiative of Enactus Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies and was started on 29 December 2015 in collaboration with Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, India. Enactus is a global non-profit organisation run by students at individual university and college levels committed to using the power of entrepreneurial action to transform lives and shape a better and more sustainable world. In India, Enactus is active in more than 150 colleges and universities involving more than 4,300 students working on nearly 122 projects across the country. The SSCBS Enactus team comprises 70 students, of which 20 are directly involved in Project Raahat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/80482/enactus-delhi-india-toilet-sanitation-slums/|title=How a Bunch of College Kids Made Two Delhi Slums Become Almost Completely Open Defecation Free|date=2017-01-03|newspaper=The Better India|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With DUSIB, Enactus SSCBS has become the first student body in Delhi to be allocated four toilet complexes in Sultanpuri and Kirti Nagar slums for holistic growth and upkeep of the local community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under Project Raahat, the management of Community Toilet Complexes (CTCs) is undertaken by the students, including aspects relating to operational management, aesthetic modification and sensitisation activities. Project Raahat aims to eradicate open defecation and provide safe sanitation facilities to the urban slum dwellers of Delhi. They come up with innovative measures for management of toilet complexes, incorporate aesthetic modification and sensitize people on healthy sanitary practices. The idea sprung from an older project called ‘Sanitary Solutions’ in which they were educating people living in slums about healthy and hygienic practices like the use of sanitary napkins, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The project has currently been launched at toilet complexes in Sultanpuri and Kirti Nagar.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/When-art-bridged-barriers-between-sanitation-awareness/article14408909.ece|title=When art bridged barriers between sanitation awareness|last=Khanna|first=Simran|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==
[[Open defecation]] is the practice of people [[defecating]] outside and not into a designated [[toilet]]. The term is widely used in literature about water, sanitation, and hygiene issues in developing countries. Open defecation causes [[public health]] problems in areas where people defecate in fields, urban parks, rivers, and open trenches in close proximity to the living space of others.

India's sanitation and toilet statistics continue to raise a stink. The World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimate that there are more than 620 million people practising open defecation in the country; over 50 per cent of the population. Moreover, the latest Census data reveals that the percentage of households having access to television and telephones in rural India exceeds the percentage of households with access to toilet facilities. The economic impact of inadequate sanitation is about Rs. 2.4 trillion ($38.4 million), or 6.4 per cent of India’s gross domestic product, according to the Water and Sanitation Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/half-of-indias-population-still-defecates-in-the-open/article5367467.ece|title=Half of India’s population still defecates in the open|last=Shivakumar|first=Girija|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over five lakh residents in the national capital continue to defecate in the open. Lack of toilets is not the only reason behind this preference for open defecation. Improper maintenance of the existing ones and restrictive timings have forced residents to head out into the open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/over-5-lakh-defecate-in-the-open-due-to-lack-of-toilets-in-delhi/story-9ToJ1o19v8P6R02HfWKRLN.html|title=Over 5 lakh defecate in the open due to lack of toilets in Delhi|date=2016-07-24|newspaper=http://www.hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 234 spots in Delhi are used by the poor as open defecation grounds, a first ever citywide survey on the practice has revealed. Most of these spots are open fields next to slums or spaces along railways tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/234-open-defecation-spots-in-city-finds-survey/articleshow/51971363.cms|title=234 open-defecation spots in city, finds survey - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raahat Model ==
The Raahat Model is carried out in phases. 
* The first leg of the project is identification of a slum in which they can conduct their operations. The sites have to be scouted for the demography, as well as adequate infrastructural requirements to suit the needs of the project. Need assessment surveys are carried out for the same.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* After a required site has been chosen, the appropriate governmental body (mostly DUSIB) is contacted for allocation of a toilet complex in the vicinity of that area. 
* Also, an entrepreneur and a cleaner is identified from the community which acts as the caretaker for the toilet complex. The entrepreneur is free to take decisions for the CTC in consultation with the project members. The caretaker is taught how to carry out basic operations for the site for a period of one year, after which the intervention of the team is minimal. Skill development and training of the entrepreneur takes place simultaneously. A critical aspect of Project Raahat is entrepreneurship. In this case the students identify and appoint a caretaker and cleaner from within the slum community who is given a fixed monthly salary based on the number of passes sold and renewed each month.The intention behind this move is to sensitize people to the fact that cleaning toilets is a dignified job and people doing it shouldn’t be looked down upon in society due to the caste hierarchy. Enactus doesn’t end its role there. They ensure the caretaker’s family members are enrolled for relevant government schemes and their children sent to school too.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raahat empowers it’s entrepreneurs in the following ways:
** ''Livelihood i.e.'' a source of income is provided by the project. Most people in slums work as daily wage laborers who either don’t earn in proportion to their work or are unable to fend for their families. Raahat provides productivity linked income to the entrepreneurs which uplifts them through a better living status.
** ''Safety and Security'' of job and work is not often found in the informal sector. Raahat complies with all the rules and regulations of formal business sector and hence shifts the populace from the unorganized to an organized business environment.
** ''Social Security Benefits'' are almost never availed by urban slum dwellers. All the Raahat entrepreneurs and cleaners are provided with basic amenities like a gratuity fund and life insurance, bringing them peace of mind.
* The operations begin with aesthetic modification of the site with wall art, posters and vertical gardens. Moving forward, proper set-up for the model to work. Market research is conducted through surveys and statistics are collected by the caretaker at the entrance. They also conduct weekly camps to inculcate messages to take a step toward a daily sanitary routine or health hazards of garbage accumulation. Posters are then conceptualised with the same message so that they can be put up at the complex in order to reinforce the message. The reach of the activities conducted is then evaluated on the basis of the data collected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Innovations ==

=== Raahi ===
The team created a cartoon character called Rahi, a superhero, to draw the attention of slum kids towards the importance of using a toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=Students-try-to-flush-out-open-defecation-from-28062016006045|title=The Times Group|website=epaperbeta.timesofindia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to engage the families through little ones, a superhero called Raahi, who is an epitome of cleanliness, has also been painted on one of the walls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The character is used in their camps, being impersonated by one other members. Kids see Raahi as a someone who is there to help them lead a healthy life.

=== Ticket System ===
A ticket system has been put in by Project Raahat in their complexes which enables the community to reap benefits through reduced expenditure on their use of the CTC. Under conventional pay-per-use system employed in majority of the toilet complexes, the users are charged Re.1 each time they use a toilet complex. Under the Ticket system, they buy a bundle of Rs.10 containing 11 tickets instead. The users turn in one ticket each time they use the complex.

[[File:Saint Joseph's Hospital (Atlanta), Dec 2017.jpg|thumb|Saint Joseph's Hospital in 2017]]
'''Saint Joseph's Hospital''' of Atlanta is an [[acute care]] [[hospital]] located in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It was a sole part of Catholic Health East until a partnership with [[Emory Healthcare]] and Catholic Health East became effective January 2012. Saint Joseph's (also known as SJHA) was recognized as one of the 50 finest hospitals in the country by [[HealthGrades]] for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgrades.com/consumer/index.cfm?fuseaction=mod&amp;modtype=hospitals&amp;modact=hospitals_search_results&amp;prodtype=hosprat&amp;state=GA&amp;city=&amp;maparea=&amp;proc=&amp;tabset=ab50&amp;hgid=&amp;useragree=yes HealthGrades - Information on Hospitals, Doctors and Nursing Homes &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031138/http://www.healthgrades.com/consumer/index.cfm?fuseaction=mod&amp;modtype=hospitals&amp;modact=hospitals_search_results&amp;prodtype=hosprat&amp;state=GA&amp;city=&amp;maparea=&amp;proc=&amp;tabset=ab50&amp;hgid=&amp;useragree=yes |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1880, Saint Joseph’s facility is Atlanta's oldest [[hospital]].{{fact|date=July 2014}}

==History==
Opened by four Mercy sisters, it was the first hospital in the city after the [[American civil war|Civil War]]. In 1900, Atlanta Hospital began its School of Nursing where it educated and trained more than 1,320 nurses over the next 73 years. Through the years, the Hospital grew and became known as the St. Joseph’s Infirmary. The hospital has had three locations throughout its history: Baker Street, Courtland Street, and currently a {{convert|32|acre|adj=on}} site just inside the perimeter of Atlanta. The current campus was dedicated in 1978 when the hospital was renamed Saint Joseph’s Hospital of Atlanta (SJHA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjosephsatlanta.org/about/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has expanded greatly since it was opened in 1978 and now accommodates 410 beds serviced by over 750 physicians. The hospital had 16,358 admissions in the most recent available data. It performed 7,251 annual inpatient and 4,939 outpatient surgeries. There were 33,745 visits to its emergency room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ga/st.-joseph%27s-hospital-6380200]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Joseph’s Hospital of Atlanta is a non-profit hospital.

==Saint Joseph Hospital’s mission==
“Furthering the healing ministry of the Sisters of Mercy, Saint Joseph's Hospital gives tangible expression to Christ's merciful love by providing compassionate, clinically excellent health care in the spirit of loving service to those in need, with special attention to the poor and vulnerable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjosephsatlanta.org/about/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109103849/http://www.stjosephsatlanta.org/about/index.html |archivedate=2013-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Saint Joseph’s has received the distinguished Magnet Recognition for Nursing Excellence by [[American Nurses Association]] Credentialing Center. The hospital was named best in Georgia and top 5% in the country for cardiac and vascular programs. It also made Solucient’s list of the top 100 hospitals in the nation for [[cardiac physiology| cardiac]] and [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic service]]. Additionally, Saint Joseph’s is the only hospital in Atlanta honored on J.D. Power and Associates Distinguished Hospital Program for Service Excellence. It is also deemed one of the best specialty-referral hospitals in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjosephsatlanta.org/about/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109103849/http://www.stjosephsatlanta.org/about/index.html |archivedate=2013-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community service==
Saint Joseph’s Hospital provides an extensive community network to the city of Atlanta, providing more than $37 million annually in charitable and uncompensated care for the poor and elderly. Additionally, another $7 million is raised each year to help those least able to cover medical costs. The staff also has a number of organized service-oriented projects including Raise the Roof, a joint effort with Charis to build homes for families in need, and Mercy Day, an effort to collect items to provide hygiene kits to the homeless in accordance with the Sisters of Mercy and their mission.

==Mercy Care Services==
The hospital is deeply committed to its original mission and focus on the poor. Saint Joseph’s Mercy Care Services carries out this goal by providing health services, education, and social services to thousands of Atlanta’s needy through two health care clinics, as well as a mobile clinic and five vans.

==Movie location==
Recently a variety of movies have been filming in Saint Joseph’s. These include the Three Stooges update, [[Ring of Fire (2013 film)|''Ring of Fire'']], [[Flight (2012 film)|''Flight'']], [[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues|''Anchorman 2'']], ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'', as well as the USA network television show ''[[Necessary Roughness (TV series)|Necessary Roughness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2011/12/19/denzel-washington-and-friends-enjoy-night-out-in-atlanta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123110708/http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2011/12/19/denzel-washington-and-friends-enjoy-night-out-in-atlanta/ |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/06/25/tuesday-june-26-filming-location-info-for-don-jons-addiction-the-walking-dead-percy-jackson-grown-ups-2-more/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-supply of water and sanitation''' (also called '''household-led water supply''' or '''individual supply''') refers to an approach of incremental improvements to [[Water supply|water]] and [[sanitation]] services, which are mainly financed by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/self-supply|title=Rural Water Supply Network Self-supply site|last=Rural Water Supply Network|first=|website=www.rural-water-supply.net/en/self-supply|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; People around the world have been using this approach over centuries to incrementally upgrade their water and sanitation services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Olschewski, A. (2016). [https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/3347 A business case for supported Self-supply as service delivery approach to achieve SDGs]. Skat Foundation, Switzerland, 7 th RWSN Forum “Water for Everyone” 7 ème Forum RWSN « L’eau pour tous » 29 Nov - 02 Dec 2016, Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire&lt;/ref&gt; The approach does not refer to a specific technology or type of water source or sanitation service although it does have to be feasible to use and construct at a low cost and mostly using tools locally available. The approach is rather about an incremental improvement of these services. It is a [[Market economy|market-based]] approach and commonly does not involve product subsidies.

"Self-supply" is different from "supported self-supply." The first term refers to situations where people improving their water and sanitation services on their own. "Supported self-supply" refers to a deliberately guided process, usually by a government agency or a non-governmental organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many examples of self-supply taking off in a short time come from situations where government-led service provision broke down (e.g., in countries of the former Soviet Union&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Olschewski |first=Andre |year=2016 |title=Supported Self-supply – learning from 15 years of experiences |url= https://rwsnforum7.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/full_paper_0044_submitter_0121_olschewski_andre.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The approach can also be deliberately used by government agencies or external support agencies to complement other types of service provision, such as community-managed water supply.

Self-supply is an important strategy - in combination with other approaches such as community-managed services - to  achieve the United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]], particularly for Goal number 6: "Ensure access to water and sanitation for all".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term is commonly used in the water sector in the [[Development aid|development cooporation]] context, but less commonly in the [[sanitation]] sector. Certain approaches such as [[community-led total sanitation]] or [[container-based sanitation]] systems have many similar aspects to self-supply. Some organizations use other terms referring to approaches which are led by individual households. For example, the World Health Organization uses the term "individual supply".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Richtert et al. |first=Bettina |year=2016 |title=Status of Small-scale Water Supplies in the WHO European Region |url= http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/320511/Status-SSW-supplies-results-survey-en.pdf?ua=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of developed countries, a related concept is called living "[[Off-the-grid|off the grid]]".

==Definition==
The short definition of self-supply is: "People improving water and sanitation services by themselves". The basic idea of self-supply is that people are providing water for themselves through their own means without direct government support.  Humans have been improving their own access to water and sanitation without government aid for millennia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As an approach to improving access it is a [[User-centered design|user-centered]] approach that involves incrementally improving current service levels, most of the time mainly financed by the end users.  Generally this means that the improvements to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] are achieved either through labor by the end-users or by the end-users paying a technician or a company to complete the work.  The incentives and benefits for the end users to improve their own water and sanitation services privately may include: convenience, proximity to home, larger volume of water, faster services than municipal water systems, cheaper than municipal water systems, lack of municipal water systems, privacy, security, and reliability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no specific technology that is advocated with self-supply. Self-supply is rather an approach of how to improve access to water and sanitation services, commonly referred to as "moving up the water and sanitation ladders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/watsan-ladder/|title=The drinking water and sanitation ladders|last=|first=|date=|website=WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the bottom of the "water ladder" are unprotected sources of water.  The users "climb the water ladder" by adding protection to their water source or additional technology for convenience.  For example, a user with an unlined hand dug well with a rope and bucket as a lifting device would be at the bottom of the water ladder.  A user with a lined hand dug well would be higher on the water ladder since the water source has a lower risk of contamination due to the lining.  A user with a hand pump would have the benefit of being able to get a larger volume of water more quickly than with a bucket, and contamination of the source is reduced.  Finally, a user with a motorized pump would have the convenience of not having to expend any manual energy on pumping water.  It should be noted that even sources on the lowest rungs of the ladder would provide service all day, every day, all year round.

In applying self-supply in sanitation, one approach used is that of sanitation marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsp.org/toolkit/what-is-sanitation-marketing|title=What is Sanitation Marketing?|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Water and Sanitation Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modularization is a part of the sanitation marketing approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Devine, J., Kullmann, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1258 Introductory Guide to Sanitation Marketing - WSP Scaling Up Rural Sanitation]. WSP, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; The sanitation product to be marketed is designed so that upgrades can be made gradually over time, towards an improved sanitation facility, as budget allows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Background ==
In 2015, 663 million people worldwide lacked access to [[improved water source]]s and 158 million people used surface water as their main source of drinking water (i.e. an "unimproved" water source). 8 out of 10 people without improved drinking water sources live in rural areas. Likewise, 1 in 8 people worldwide practise [[open defecation]] (946 million people).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Joint Monitoring Programme |first= |year=2015 |title= Key Facts from the JMP 2015 Report |url= https://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-2015-update-key-facts-English.pdf |access-date=2017-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers show that there is a continued need to keep improving these services for millions of people.

Self-supply is not formally part of the water strategy to increase access to improved water sources in most [[developing countries]] and is not commonly counted in inventories of access to [[improved water source]]s,. This is partly related to the fact that self-supply does not refer to a specific technology or service level. However, even in countries where significant initiatives of self-supply have been observed, these usually are not taken into consideration in official numbers of service coverage. Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are exceptions to this rule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Costs ===
Studies in Zambia and Zimbabwe showed that by using a strategy combining community-managed water supply and self-supply, the [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle costs]] to the government would be 50% lower, compared to a strategy only using community-managed water supply.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Manually drilled wells  ===

{{Main|Water well#Drilled wells}}
A wide range of manual well drilling technology exist in developing countries.  Manually driven tube wells are ubiquitous on the coasts of Madagascar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; EMAS in Bolivia uses a hybrid percussion-jetting-rotation manual drilling method for the installation of tube wells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Hand-agar drilling is common in Niger where it has been used for the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Manual Drilling Compendium gives a good overview of the status of these technologies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/_ressources/documents/default/1-653-34-1442223588.pdf|title=Manual Drilling Compendium 2015|last=Danert|first=Kerstin|date=2015|website=|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MzuzuDrilling1280x768px.jpg|thumb|right|Manual drilling using the "Mzuzu" method]]

===Private wells, tube wells, upgraded family wells===

In the United States, 44 million people used self-supply and private water sources in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/wudo.html|title=United States Geological Survey |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 22% of the rural population uses private wells to access groundwater for their water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/resources-top/details/57|title=An Introduction to Self-Supply: Putting the User First. Rural Water Supply Series Field Note. Water and Sanitation Program and Rural Water Supply Network.|last=Sutton|first=Sally|date=2009|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20-60% of the population in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union relies on self-supply for water. For example, 35% of the population in Ukraine, 57% in Moldova, 38% in Romania, and 22% in Albania rely on self-supply for a water source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Danube Utility Benchmarking and Information Sharing | url= http://www.danubis.org |last=World Bank and IAWD, the International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area|first=|date=2009|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date= 2017-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh is one of the cases where self-supply has reached mainstream, with millions of tubewells and hand pumps in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/_ressources/documents/default/1-653-34-1442223588.pdf|title=Manual Drilling Compendium 2015|last=Danert|first=Kerstin|date=2015|website=|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Upgraded Family Well" program has been implemented by the government of Zimbabwe in rural areas to improve the quality of self-supply wells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Rope Pump model 1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a Rope Pump]]
=== Rope pumps and pitcher pumps ===
{{Further|Rope pump|Hand pump}}
A [[rope pump]] for self-supply was developed and introduced in Nicaragua in 1990.  Since then, thousands of rope pumps have been installed on family wells. For example, as of 2004, about 30,000 rope pumps were installed serving at least 25 percent of rural population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=J.H.|year=2004|title=The rope pump – an example of technology transfer|url=http://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/Alberts-2004-Rope.pdf|journal=Waterlines|volume=22|pages=22–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hand pump|Pitcher pumps]] on driven wells are ubiquitous along the coasts of Madagascar.  The sandy soils and shallow water tables make it a particularly appropriate technology to use for accessing water.  Madagascar’s main port of [[Tamatave]] in particular is estimated to have at a minimum of 9,000 pitcher pump wells servicing 170,000 people, making it one of the largest example of an unsubsidized pump market in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Rainwater harvesting ===

{{Further|Rainwater harvesting}}
[[File:Rainwater harvesting tank (5981896147).jpg|thumb|Rainwater harvesting tank from rooftop at a school near Kigali, Rwanda]]
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is one of the simplest and oldest methods of self-supply.  This can be as simple as putting a bucket at the edge of a tin roof.  It can also involve the construction of small reservoirs and gutters along the edge of a roof to collect a larger quantity of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gdrc.org/uem/water/rainwater/|title=Rainwater Harvesting And Utilisation|last=|first=|date=|website=Rainwater Harvesting|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain water harvesting has been extensively promoted in Thailand and is an example of how self-supply initiatives can reach large scale (even though in a first phase, the initiative was more of a direct implementation by the Thai government), in this case several million rural households.&lt;ref name="saladin2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rural-water-supply.net/en/resources/details/759|title=Rainwater Harvesting in Thailand - learning from the World Champions|last=Saladin|first=Matthias|date=2016|website=|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Household water treatment ===

{{Main article|Portable water purification}}
Household water treatment a means to improve quality of water before consumption. It can be implemented under a self-supply approach, but also under other approaches.  The most ubiquitous method of household water treatment in the world is boiling.  Other methods that have been advocated are point-of-use [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[SODIS]], and various types of water filters.

[[File:Emas pump Zambia.jpg|thumb|right|Emas pump]]
=== EMAS technologies in Bolivia ===

EMAS (Mobile Water &amp; Sanitation School - Spanish acronym, Escuela Móvil de Agua y Saneamiento) has been promoting different technologies to improve [[water supply and sanitation in Bolivia]] since the 1980s. Technologies promoted by EMAS in Bolivia are hand-pumps for household water supply, rainwater harvesting, [[safe household water storage]] tanks made of ferrocement,  pit latrines, and a hybrid percussion-jetting-rotation manual drilling method.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|title=Introduction to EMAS Technologies|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/training-research/introduction-to-emas-technologies|publisher=Rural Water Supply Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 an independent assessment was conducted that examined all of the technologies promoted by EMAS in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacCarthy|first=Michael|title=EMAS Household Water Supply Technologies in Bolivia|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/_ressources/documents/default/1-518-3-1375685563.pdf|year=2013|publication-place=Field Note No 2013-4|publisher=Rural Water Supply Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that a majority of the households surveyed (53 of 86) purchased EMAS technology with no subsidies or loans.  Also, a majority of the households surveyed had operational EMAS pumps (78 out of 79) with all of the pumps being installed 11 years or more previously (18 out of 79) still being operational

==Approaches for sanitation==

In the field of sanitation, the term "self supply" is not commonly used. However, a similar concept is that of [[community-led total sanitation]]. This is a [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] approach which results in people abandoning [[open defecation]] and typically building and using [[pit latrines]] instead.

Another approach which could be used for self supply in sanitation is that of [[container-based sanitation]] even though the collection and treatment steps are usually carried out by an external service provider, not by the households themselves.

==Challenges==
===Health risks===
[[File:Groundwater Contamination SW Asia Sm.png|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Waterborne diseases]] can be spread via a groundwater well which is contaminated with fecal pathogens from [[pit latrine]]s]]

Because of limited capacities of governments in many countries for private supplies to be regularly tested, often combined with unclear responsibilities for water quality of private supplies, the health risks of these supplies tend to be higher than of larger networks. As a consequence, households who provide their own water supply and sanitation might end up with polluted drinking water. One example is the problem with [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic polluted groundwater]] in Bangladesh.

===Poverty===

In contrary to a direct intervention approach, where either a government agency or a private actor (usually a non-profit organization) directly provides a defined target group with a specific service level, self-supply relies on establishing mechanisms to let people decide themselves on the level, the location and the timing of the service provided. This needs special attention to market development, to strengthening the capacities of the private sector (as a service provider) and government agencies (e.g., as quality monitoring agency). Thus, while not interacting directly with any households, self-supply does not imply that the poorest households and individuals are abandoned, but it optimizes the limited resources available at all levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In cases where the government can not fulfil this role of a regulator and monitoring agencies, dynamic processes have led to overexploitation of groundwater resources (e.g., in the city of [[Lagos]]) and of increased public health problems due to the consumption of groundwater that is [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|naturally contaminated with arsenic]].

However, there are also examples where self-supply contributed to better access to water and sanitation services even by the poorest. For example, Thailand, where millions of rural people upgraded their water service level by buying additional vessels for storing rainwater, is one of the countries with most equal rates of access to drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WHO/UNICEF|first=|title=Investing in Water and Sanitation: Increasing Access, reducing inequalities|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/139735/1/9789241508087_eng.pdf?ua=1|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many cases the owners of a private well or other water source are not the only people who benefit from it.  Neighbors, who may be poorer than the owners, also benefit from the water source since frequently they are allowed to use it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacCarthy|first=Michael|title=Low-Cost Household Groundwater Supply Systems for Developing Communities|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/5261/|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Role of government ===

Advocating for self-supply improvements means supporting the target population in a different way than many [[WASH]] programs do.  Instead of focusing on government providing specific services directly it implies strengthening capacities of the private sector and aims to improve their quality of service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Apart from capacity building, the role of government may also include quality assurance, monitoring, and regulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human right to water and sanitation===

The criticism is based on the assumption that the [[Human right to water and sanitation|Human Right to Water and Sanitation]] imply that the government directly has to deliver water and sanitation services to everyone. However, as the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation pointed out, the government can also opt for a strategy of strengthening capacities of the private sector under a supported self-supply approach, allowing its resources to be used efficiently and reaching people in sparsely populated rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/resources/details/748|title=Human rights to water and Self-Supply – Potential and challenges.|last=Olschewski|first=André|date=2015|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term "self-supply" was coined by members of the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN) during the RWSN Forum in Uganda in 2004. It subsequently became one of the key topics of this network, which continues to update information regarding self-supply under their thematic website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around 2010 it became apparent that there is a need to distinguish between "self-supply" and "Accelerated self-supply", which often also is mentioned as "Supported self-supply".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/_ressources/documents/default/241.pdf|title=Accelerating Self-supply - A Case Study from Uganda. Rural Water Supply Series Field Note.|last=Sutton|first=Sally|date=2010|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas in many non-industrialized countries self-supply is a naturally occurring process largely without government supervision, there are also exceptions to this rule. For example, self-supply has been formally endorsed by the national government of Ethiopia as a service delivery model for water in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rural-water-supply.net/_ressources/documents/default/1-406-2-1350288088.pdf|title=A Hidden Resource - Household-led rural water supply in Ethiopia|last=Sutton et al.|first=Sally|date=2012|website=|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the experience of Thailand (see example on Rainwater Harvesting)&lt;ref name="saladin2016" /&gt; shows how a country can start with a government-driven approach and substantial use of subsidies to a self-supply approach once the private sector is strong enough, and that the resources and emphasis of the government agencies then can shift to monitoring water quality.

'''Spring Cooper''' (born '''Spring Chenoa Cooper''', July 6, 1980) is an American academic and author.  

==Career==
Cooper finished her PhD in 2006 at [[Pennsylvania State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbh.hhdev.psu.edu/alumni/pr_robbins.html|title=Biobehavioral Health Alumni Profile: Spring Chenoa Cooper Robbins, Ph.D.|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She worked for a year at Penn State in the office for Health Promotion and Wellness.  Since then she completed a postdoc at [[George Washington University]], a postdoc at the [[University of Sydney]], and then began working as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/cancer-research/members/profiles/scooper.php|title=Dr Spring Cooper|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2015, Dr. Cooper is an associate professor for the City University of New York,  School of Public Health.

==Books==
Cooper has written a children's book that is available for purchase from Amazon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Period-Spring-Chenoa-Cooper/dp/1480052779 |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129115615/http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Period-Spring-Chenoa-Cooper/dp/1480052779 |archivedate=November 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; either in paper or Kindle form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Period-Spring-Cooper-ebook/dp/B009Q15CZC |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129115612/http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Period-Spring-Cooper-ebook/dp/B009Q15CZC |archivedate=November 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is "The Secret. Period." and chronicles the story of two sisters as the eldest gets her first period.  When the older sister gets her first period, she keeps it secret from her little sister and the little sister feels left out and lonely, but she doesn't know why her sister isn't talking to her.  The story offers a brief explanation of menstruation, but is more broadly a book that has menstruation as part of the story, thus giving parents and older siblings a way to break taboos around menstruation and converse about it more openly.

==Media==
Cooper has written several articles for ''The Conversation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/profiles/spring-chenoa-cooper-4582|title=Spring Chenoa Cooper|work=The Conversation|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online forum that is an intersection of academia and the popular press.  She has also been interviewed by several radio shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2ser.com/component/k2/item/10366-the-big-o|title=The Big O|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic publications==
Her expertise is in sexual health, specifically adolescent sexual health.  She does both quantitative and qualitative research, and specializes in conducting focus groups with adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/cancer-research/members/profiles/scooper.php#publications|title=Dr Spring Cooper|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has worked extensively in social research about HPV vaccination in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Iq4T9PzS_w|title=Getting youth involved in health decisions - Dr Spring Chenoa Cooper - 20 September 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a large  educational research project for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220718/http://takechargehpv.org/] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''St. Mary's Hospital''' is a private, non-for-profit hospital in the west end of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. It is a 391-bed hospital and serves the Central Virginia community and beyond.  St. Mary's is affiliated with the [[Bon Secours Health System (USA)|Bon Secours]] Richmond Health System and the [[Sisters of Bon Secours]].

==History==
Under the guidance of the [[Sisters of Bon Secours]], St. Mary's opened its doors in 1966.  Over the years, the hospital expanded to help serve the community, growing from an initial size of 169 beds and only 250 employees.  Today, St. Mary's has evolved into a state-of-the-art 391-bed facility.  The hospital continues to serve the community with the philosophy of good help to those in need, especially the poor and dying.

==Honors and awards==
St. Mary's has received a variety of awards for its quality of care.  Highlights include being the first community hospital in Richmond to achieve [[Magnet Recognition Program|Magnet Recognition]] by the American Nurses Credentialing Center for nursing excellence, in 2008.  St. Mary's was named a Top 50 Cardiovascular Hospital in the nation by Thomson Reuters and was recognized by [[HealthGrades]] for being ranked among the Top 5% in the nation for emergency medicine, critical care, stroke, gastrointestinal care, and prostatectomy.  St. Mary's was also awarded the HealthGrades 2012 Patient Safety Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bon Secours St. Mary's|title=Awards and Honors|url=http://www.bonsecours.com/find-a-facility-st-marys-hospital-honors-and-awards.html|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
St. Mary's offers a number of specialized services to the Richmond community.  The hospital is accredited by The [[Joint Commission]] for having centers of excellence in heart failure, heart attack, and hip and knee joint replacement, and for its primary stroke center. It's also a center of excellence for surgical weight loss surgery and breast imaging.  Additionally, St. Mary's has been designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the [[American College of Surgeons]].

St. Mary's is well known in Richmond for its birthing center, with ''Style Magazine'' readers voting it the "Best Place in Richmond to Have a Baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bon Secours Richmond|title=Birth and Parenting|url=http://richmond.bonsecours.com/our-services-bon-secours-for-women-birth-and-parenting.html|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the hospital has introduced a Pediatric Emergency Department to better serve the community.  In 2014, the Evelyn D. Reinhart Guest House was opened to help serve patients and caregivers who live far from the hospital. The Guest House was built largely thanks to donations and is located within walking distance of St. Mary's.  Patients and caregivers who live far away from the hospital are referred and stay in this "home away from home" to help begin the healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cao|first1=Angela|title=Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital Opens Guest House|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/local/companies/bon-secours/bon-secours-st-mary-s-hospital-opens-guest-house/article_2c07dd07-78cc-5abb-ad66-42cbb5c52f0d.html|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamil Nadu Agriculture University]] (TNAU) concentrates on the upscaling of water saving technologies in [[rice]] and major garden land crops. The total out lay for TNAU is Rs.88.90 [[crore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P090768/tamil-nadu-irrigated-agriculture-modernization-water-bodies-restoration-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects : IN Tamil Nadu Irrig Agr Moderniz Water-Bodies Restor Management&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The World Bank|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The focal technologies are systems of rice intensification (Rajarajan 1000), improved production technologies (IPT) on garden pulses, [[cotton]], [[maize]], [[sunflower]], [[groundnut]] and [[gingelly]]. Promotion of new crops such as thornless [[bamboo]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] intercropping in [[coconut]] is also programmed. Precision farming with drip [[fertigation]] is also demonstrated with [[sugarcane]], [[banana]], vegetables, [[tapioca]], [[coconut]] and flowers. The concept of an [[organic farming]] seed village is promoted in the sub basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/04/19417142/india-tamil-nadu-irrigated-agriculture-modernization-water-bodies-restoration-management-project-p090768-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-14|title=Page Not Found|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-velanmai technology will be tested on a pilot basis. Labour saving implements such as a tractor drawn [[seed drill]], maize husker cum sheller and sunflower thresher will be introduced. A mini [[dhal]] mill is introduced. Implements such as a coconut shredder will be introduced under waste recycling. Vermi bag – a cost effective portable unit will be demonstrated.

==Statistics==
The project covers 6.17 Lakh [[Hectare]]s of Ayacut areas in four phases. 55 sub basins were covered in year 2013 with an outlay of Rs.2547 crores.

While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be [[Benign tumor|benign]], [[precancerous condition|precancerous]], or [[Malignancy|malignant]].&lt;/ref&gt; Vulvar neoplasms are divided into cystic or solid lesions and other mixed types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Benign%20Neoplasms%20of%20the%20Vulva/item/4|title=Benign Neoplasms of the Vulva {{!}} GLOWM|website=www.glowm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulvar cancers are  those [[Malignancy|malignant]] neoplasms that originate from vulvar epithelium, while vulvar sarcomas develop from non-epithelial cells such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/vulvar-cancer/about/what-is-vulvar-cancer.html|title=What Is Vulvar Cancer?|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithelial and mesenchymal tissue are the origin of vulvar tumors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Malignant vulvar neoplasms makes up 6% of all reproductive organ cancer and 0.7% of the total cancers in women in the United States. One out of every 333 women will develop vulvar cancer. In the United States, vulvar cancer accounts for nearly 6% of cancers of the female reproductive organs and 0.7% of all cancers in women.  In 2018, there will be 6,190 women diagnosed with cancer of the vulva with 1,200 women dying from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/vulvar-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|title=Key Statistics for Vulvar Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malignant vulvar tumors can develop in the inner edges of the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris or in the Bartholin glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in preventing vulvar cancers includes investigations into the use of [[Oncogene|oncogenes]], tumor suppressor genes, drug treatments, [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[lymph node]] mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/vulvar-cancer/about/new-research.html|title=What's New in Vulvar Cancer Research and Treatment?|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS)''' was established in August 1993 to investigate the impact and progression of [[HIV]] disease in women.  The WIHS enrolls both [[HIV-positive]] and HIV-negative women.  The core portion of the study includes a detailed and structured interview, physical and gynecologic examination, and laboratory testing. The WIHS participants are also asked to enroll in various sub-studies, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and neurocognition. New proposals for WIHS sub-studies are submitted for approval by various scientific investigators from around the world.

==Funding==

The WIHS is funded primarily by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ (NIAID)], with additional co-funding from the ''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/ (NICHD)], the National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/ (NCI)], the National Institute on Drug Abuse [http://www.nida.nih.gov/ (NIDA)], and the National Institute on Mental Health [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml/ (NIMH)]. Targeted supplemental funding for specific projects is also provided by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/ (NIDCR)], the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/ (NIAAA)], the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders [http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx/ (NIDCD)], and the NIH Office of Research on Women’s Health [http://orwh.od.nih.gov/ (ORWH)].  WIHS data collection is also supported by UL1-TR000004 (UCSF CTSA) and UL1-TR000454 (Atlanta CTSA).

==Clinical sites==

WIHS clinical sites are located in and around 10 cities in the United States and are headed by Principal Investigators: Bronx, NY (Kathryn Anastos); Brooklyn, NY (Howard Minkoff, Deborah Gustafson); Washington, DC (Seble Kassaye); San Francisco, CA (Ruth Greenblatt, Bradley Aouizerat, Phyllis Tien); Chicago, IL (Mardge Cohen); Miami, FL (Margaret Fischl, Lisa Metsch); Chapel Hill, NC (Ada Adimora); Atlanta, GA (Igho Ofotokun, Gina Wingood); Birmingham, AL (Michael Saag, Mirjam-Colette Kempf); and Jackson, MS (Deborah Konkle-Parker).  The WIHS Data Management and Analysis Center (Stephen Gange, Elizabeth Golub) is located in Baltimore, MD.  Each consortium is affiliated with local research institutes to see study participants and has its own [https://statepiaps.jhsph.edu/wihs/index-ncab.htm Community Advisory Board].

==Recruitment==

WIHS has been funded in five cycles to date:
*WIHS I: November 1, 1992 – October 31, 1997
*WIHS II: November 1, 1997 – October 31, 2002
*WIHS III: November 1, 2002 – December 31, 2007
*WIHS IV: January 1, 2008 – December 31, 2012
*WIHS V: January 1, 2013 - December 31, 2017

Initial enrollment into the WIHS occurred between October 1994 and November 1995. The total initial enrollment for the WIHS was 2,056 [[HIV-positive]] women and 569 HIV-negative women.&lt;ref&gt;Barkan, et al. The Women's Interagency HIV Study. WIHS Collaborative Study Group. ''Epidemiology'' 1998; 9:117-125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since WIHS recruited its initial population, several new trends developed as the [[HIV]] [[epidemic]] evolved, all of which argued for an expansion of the WIHS [[cohort study|cohort]]. First, despite careful follow-up of the cohort, the inevitable course of [[illness]] and time had led to [[wikt:attrition|attrition]] and [[death]].  Additionally, increased sample sizes were needed because the effectiveness and consequences of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) added new strata to many key analyses, and decreased the incidence of clinical outcomes. And finally, as the original cohort continued to age, it became less able to support studies of risk behaviors, [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and reproductive function. Thus, WIHS funding was augmented in 2001 to empower the study to efficiently and precisely meet the study’s specific aims through the recruitment of additional women. Total enrollment in 2001-02 (WIHS visits 15 and 16) was 738 [[HIV-positive]] and 403 HIV-negative participants.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, et al. The Women's Interagency HIV Study: an Observational Cohort Brings Clinical Sciences to the Bench. ''Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology'' 2005; 12:1013‐1019.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in January 2011, the WIHS opened enrollment again, in order to replace those women who had died during WIHS III and WIHS IV. Total enrollment in 2011-12 (WIHS visits 35-37) was 276 [[HIV-positive]] and 95 HIV-negative participants.  In the summer of 2013, the WIHS will begin enrolling approximately 800 women from the WIHS Southern sites (Atlanta, GA; Chapel Hill, NC; Miami, FL; Birmingham, AL; Jackson, MS).  All potential study participants undergo an initial screening to determine study eligibility. If the woman is willing to take part in the study and gives informed consent, she will participate in an in-depth interview, physical exam, and specimen collection.
