==Facts==
The plaintiff, [[Amar Nath Sehgal]] is a renowned artist and sculptor, who created a mural in the lobby of [[Vigyan Bhawan]], Delhi on the direction of appropriate authority. In the year 1957, the Government of India commissioned Mr. Sehgal for creating a bronze mural for Vigyan Bhavan, the most prominent International Convention Hall in Delhi. The Bronze sculpture so commissioned, of about 140&amp;nbsp;ft. span and 40&amp;nbsp;ft. sweep took five years to complete and was placed on the wall of the Lobby in the Convention hall. This embellishment on a national architecture became a part of the Indian art heritage. However, in 1979, the mural was pulled down and consigned to the store room of the Union without notice or permission or authorization of Amarnath. When Mr. Sehgal came to know of this ill treatment, he made representations to the government authorities for restoration of the mural, to no avail. As this act of destruction of the mural as it was improperly handled which cause minor damage to the sculpture. He filed a petition under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in the Delhi High Court praying for an apology from the defendants, a permanent injunction on the defendants to restrain them from distorting, mutilating or damaging the plaintiff’s mural and damages to the tune of Rs. 50 lacs.

==Judgment==
The Court termed the Moral rights as the soul of the author’s works. "The author has a right to preserve, protect and nurture his creations through his moral rights. A creative individual is uniquely invested with the power and mystique of original genius, creating a privileged relationship between a creative author and his work."

The Court elucidated on the moral rights that flow from art and literary work .They are Identification right or attribution right, right to dissemination, Right to integrity that is to maintain the purity of work and right to withdraw from the publication of the work .The language of the Section 57 makes it possible to legally protect the cultural heritage of India through the moral rights of the artist. "Intellectual property and knowledge are interconnected. Intellectual property embodies traditional thought and knowledge with value addition. Thus, physical destruction or loss of intellectual property has far reaching social consequence. Knowledge which has grown with it is also lost." Court ruled that moral rights in the work of art acquire the  status of the cultural heritage of the nation and India being a signatory to many conventions , it would be the obligation of the state to protect such work.

Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 includes destruction of a work of art as a ground as it is the extreme form of mutilation and reduces the volume of the author’s creative corpus and affects his reputation prejudicially as being actionable under said section. Further, in relation to the work of an author, subject to the work attaining the status of a modern national treasure, the right would include an action to protect the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation.

The Court held that the plaintiff has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in the defendants. It was further held that the defendants have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with the defendants henceforth and ordered the defendants to pay damages with costs.

==Significance of the Decision==
The decision taken by the single bench of the Delhi High Court was instrumental in determining the course of moral rights in the country. It also gave a broad construction to the term moral rights in the country, by not only providing for the right of the author in the case of any distortion, mutilation, modification or other act in relation to the work if such distortion etc. would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation but also ‘right of the author to receive the copyrighted work for the purposes of restoration and sell it’. It included within the moral right of integrity the right to protect an artistic work from outright destruction. 
The interim decision in the case, given by Justice Jaspal Singh, given in favour of the plaintiff, restricted the Indian Government from causing any further loss to the plaintiff by destroying the property. The interim ruling, given in 1992, established two central points about the ambit of moral rights within India. Firstly, that the moral right of integrity under Indian Law can in fact protect an artistic work from outright destruction and secondly, that the Government has a duty of care towards artworks in its possession.
This gave rise to amendments in the Copyright Act in 1994. Even though the purported primary motive of the Government was to bring the Indian Act in conformity with the Berne Convention, the wording of the amendment seemed to be a direct reaction to the interim ruling.  Under the amended Section 57, a legal claim by an author against unauthorized modifications to his work had to establish that the treatment of the work has been prejudicial to his honour or reputation. The revised Section 57 corresponded to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention and also provided that failure to display a work, or to display it in accordance with the wishes of the author, would not qualify as a violation of the author’s moral rights.

In light of this amendment in 1994, an important question that Justice Nandrajog needed to address was that of which law would be applicable to the final ruling, the pre amendment or post amendment Copyright Act. There were compelling arguments for both the sides, as the old provisions of the Copyright Act would apply because they governed the time when the acts of destruction occurred, and when the case was actually filed before the court. On the other hand, he could have said that the post amended provisions should apply because they reflected the currently policy of the Govt. and were actually in force at the time of the judgment. However, he sidestepped the question and chose neither of the paths, arguing that the law must be read to fulfil the higher objective of protecting our cultural heritage, in light of the many international treaties on cultural heritage that India is a signatory to. The artwork in question constituted an ‘outstanding work of art’ and in such cases there is an overriding obligation to protect their integrity, no matter which law is applied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">{{about||the 1989 film|Anecdote (film)|a comparison of anecdote with other kinds of stories|traditional story}}
An '''''anecdote''''' is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|title=Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, Third Ed.|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally [[humor]]ous, anecdotes differ from [[joke]]s because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke [[laughter]] but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific [[wikt:quirk|quirk]] or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Epstein|first=Lawrence|title=A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes|year=1989|publisher=Jason Aronson|location=Northvale, NJ|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote is "a story with a point."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1989|pp=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anecdotes may be real or fictional;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Kennedy |first=X. J.|title=Handbook of Literary Terms, Third Ed.|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuddon|1992|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |contributor-first=Jurgen |contributor-last=Heine |contribution=Die Anekdote |last=Knorrich |first=Otto |title=Formen der Literatur in Einzeldarstellugen |year=1981 |publisher=Alfred Kroner|location=Stuttgart|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident, involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place. In the words of Jurgen Heine, they exhibit "a special realism" and "a claimed historical dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heine|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied&lt;ref&gt;Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== Qualification as evidence ==
{{main|Anecdotal evidence}}
Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.

'''Azerbaijan Customs History Museum''' is a museum of [[State Customs Committee (Azerbaijan)|State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan]], located in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The museum was established by the State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan on March 23, 2006, with order No. 034. The work on the establishment of the Azerbaijan Customs History Museum was completed on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. On January 27, 2007, a section of the Museum of the History of Customs, the union of "Azerterminalcomplex" was opened.

In 2008 the Museum was accepted into the Azerbaijan National Committee of the International Council of Museums.&lt;ref name="createch-group.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museums.createch-group.net/about/museum/customs/|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası Dövlət Gömrük Komitəsinin muzeyləri|website=museums.createch-group.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2008 the museum is a member of the International Association of Customs Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://customs.gov.az/az/faydali/xeberler/102_azerbaycan-gomruyu-avrasiyanin-medeniyyet-muxtelifliyinin-astanasinda/|title=Azərbaycan gömrüyü Avrasiyanın mədəniyyət müxtəlifliyinin astanasında - Gömrük xidməti hər bir dövlətin müstəqilliyinin əsas atributlarından biridir.|first=|last=...|website=customs.gov.az}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the "Azerterminalcomplex" section transformed into a branch of the Museum of Customs History.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150405050515/http://museums.customs.gov.az/about/museum/customs/branch/ Gömrük Tarixi Muzeyinin filialı]&lt;/ref&gt; After confirmation from the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan]], the branch of the museum obtained its own fund and permanent exposition.

==Exhibition==
Most of the museum's collection is arranged of cultural, scientific, historical and artistic cultural assets seized by customs officers and seized by the judicial authorities. From time to time most of these examples of art have been donated to museums, scientific institutions, and religious organizations, churches and mosques in Baku.

Exhibits of the Customs Museum are exhibited mainly in [[Member state of the European Union|EU countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apa.az/print/267031|title=APA - Azərbaycan Gömrük Tarixi Muzeyinin eksponatları Budapeştdə nümayiş etdirilib|first=APA Information Agency, APA|last=Holding|website=apa.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of the museum is broadly focused on both thematic and regional aspects. The museum collection mainly consists of documents and photographs reflecting the customs history, as well as works of art created by various masters. The museum exhibition covers different periods, as well as exhibits exported for smuggling from Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan Customs History Museum, which exhibits various antique goods and other works of historical and artistic value, is evidence of the fight against smuggling of customs officials and serves as a sign of observance of national interests and moral values. Until 2006, customs officers were transferring all confiscated art objects to museums. Later they began to systematize the found antiques, which were tried to be exported abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://azertag.az/ru/xeber/VVEDENO_V_STROI_NOVOE_ADMINISTRATIVNOE_ZDANIE_VNESHNEEKONOMICHESKOGO_OBEDINENIYA_AZERBAIDZHANTERMINALKOMPLEKS_GOSUDARSTVENNOGO_TAMOZHENNOGO_KOMITETA-658297|title=ВВЕДЕНО В СТРОЙ НОВОЕ АДМИНИСТРАТИВНОЕ ЗДАНИЕ ВНЕШНЕЭКОНОМИЧЕСКОГО ОБЪЕДИНЕНИЯ "АЗЕРБАЙДЖАНТЕРМИНАЛКОМПЛЕКС" ГОСУДАРСТВЕННОГО ТАМОЖЕННОГО КОМИТЕТА|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gapp.az/news/354859-general-aydyin-aliev-spas-antikvariat|title=Генерал Айдын Алиев спас антиквариат|website=gapp.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of the branch of the Customs History Museum has a modern fine art department represented by painting, sculpture, art and crafts. The first millennium excavations, carpets, oriental sculptures, copper items, ancient coins, antique and ancient icons, jewelry, firearms, weapons of the 17th-19th centuries, Quran and Bible copies, that were confiscated while trying to be exported from Azerbaijan are kept in the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ru.sputnik.az/culture/20170618/410758232/drevnie-monety-kontrabanda-azerbajdzhan-tamozhnja.html|title=Наследие культуры и истории Азербайджана пытались вывезти из страны|first=|last=Sputnik|website=ru.sputnik.az}}&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the joint efforts of the museum and the Union of Artists of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="createch-group.net"/&gt;

Azerbaijan Customs History Museum exhibits confiscated historical and religious books, icons, other religious and religious rites and historical and cultural objects that have been confiscated as of today. For the first time, a museum was established by the State Customs Committee in 1999 for the transfer of religious books and icons confiscated by the Azerbaijani customs authorities in relevant religious assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ru.apa.az/novosti-azerbaydjana/proisshestvie-v-azerbaydjane/konfiskovannye-sotrudnikami-gtk-religioznye-knigi-podareny-evrejskim-obshinam-azerbajdzhana.html|title=Конфискованные сотрудниками ГТК религиозные книги подарены еврейским общинам Азербайджана|first=APA Information Agency, APA|last=Holding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://haqqin.az/news/102443|title=Генерал Айдын Алиев спас антиквариат - воскресное чтиво|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bereavement in Judaism''' ({{Hebrew Name 1|אֲבֵלוּת|avelut|[[mourning]]}}) is a combination of ''[[minhag]]'' and ''[[mitzvah]]'' derived from [[Judaism]]'s classical [[Torah]] and [[Rabbinical literature|rabbinic]] texts.  The details of observance and practice vary according to each [[Jews|Jewish]] community.

{{TOClimit|2}}

==Mourners==
In Judaism, the principal mourners are the first-degree relatives: parent, child, sibling, and spouse. There are some customs that are unique to an individual mourning a parent.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Isaac, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, Ktav Publishing House, 1979, page 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halachot]] concerning mourning do not apply to those under thirteen years of age. Also, ''halachos'' of mourning do not apply when the deceased is aged 30 days or less.&lt;ref name=silverman /&gt;

==Upon receiving news of the passing==
Upon receiving the news of the passing, the following blessing is recited:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;{{Hebrew paragraph|ברוך אתה [[Tetragrammaton|ה']] [[Elohim|אלוהינו]] מלך העולם, דיין האמת.}}&lt;/div&gt;
:Transliteration: ''Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu melekh ha'olam, dayan ha-emet.''
:Translation: "Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, the Judge of Truth [alt., the Just Judge]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer.htm|title=Judaism 101: Prayers and Blessings|work=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a custom of rending one's clothes at the moment one hears news of a passing. Another prevalent custom is to tear at the funeral so that the procedure is done properly.&lt;ref name="Klein, Isaac 1979, page 278"&gt;Klein, Isaac, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, Ktav Publishing House, 1979, page 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chevra kadisha==
The ''chevra kadisha'' (Hebrew: חברה קדישא "holy society") is a Jewish [[burial society]] usually consisting of volunteers, men and women, who prepare the deceased for proper Jewish burial.&lt;ref name=fG.Chev&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/chevra-kadisha.htm
|title=Jewish Funeral Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to ensure that the body of the deceased is shown proper respect, ritually cleansed, and shrouded.

Many local ''chevra kadishas'' in urban areas are affiliated with local [[synagogue]]s, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the ''chevra kadisha'' of their choice, so that when the time comes, the society will not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby [[Jewish cemetery]].

If no [[gravedigger]]s are available, then it is additionally the function of the male society members to ensure that graves are dug. In [[Israel]], members of ''chevra kadishas'' consider it an honor to not only prepare the body for burial but also to dig the grave for a fellow Jew's body, particularly if the deceased was known to be a righteous person.

Many burial societies hold one or two annual fast days, especially the 7th day of Adar, Yartzeit of Moshe Rabbeinu.&lt;ref name=fG.Chev/&gt; and organize regular study sessions to remain up to date with the relevant articles of Jewish law.  In addition, most burial societies also support families during the ''[[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]]'' (traditional week of mourning) by arranging [[Jewish services|prayer services]], preparing meals, and providing other services for the mourners.&lt;ref name=Syd.A&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.chevrakadishasydney.com |title=Sydney Chevra Kadisha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparing the body — Taharah===
There are three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (''rechitzah''), ritual purification (''taharah''), and dressing (''halbashah'').  The term ''taharah'' is used to refer both to the overall process of burial preparation, and to the specific step of ritual purification.

Prayers and readings from Torah, including [[Psalms]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] are recited.

The general sequence of steps for performing ''taharah'' is as follows.

# The body (''guf'') is uncovered (it has been covered with a sheet awaiting ''taharah'').
# The body is washed carefully. Any bleeding is stopped and all blood is buried along with the deceased. The body is thoroughly cleaned of dirt, body fluids, and solids, and anything else that may be on the skin. All jewelry is removed. The beard (if present) is '''not''' shaved.
# The body is purified with water, either by immersion in a ''[[mikveh]]'' or by pouring a continuous stream of 9 kavim (usually 3 buckets) in a prescribed manner.
# The body is dried (according to most customs).
# The body is dressed in traditional burial clothing (''[[tachrichim]]''). A sash (''avnet'') is wrapped around the clothing and tied in the form of the Hebrew letter ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]],'' representing [[Shaddai (god)|one of the names of God]].
# The casket (''aron'') (if there is one) is prepared by removing any linings or other embellishments. A winding sheet (''sovev'') is laid into the casket. Outside the Land of Israel, if the deceased wore a prayer shawl (''[[tallit]]'') during their life, one is laid in the casket for wrapping the body once it is placed therein. One of the corner fringes (''[[tzitzit]]'') is removed from the shawl to signify that it will no longer be used for prayer and that the person is absolved from having to keep any of the ''mitzvot'' (commandments).
# The body is lifted into the casket and wrapped in the prayer shawl and sheet. Soil (''afar'') from [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]], if available, is placed over various parts of the body and sprinkled in the casket.
# The casket is closed.

After the closing of the casket, the ''chevra'' asks forgiveness of the deceased for any inadvertent lack of honor shown to the deceased in the preparation of the body for burial.

There is no viewing of the body and no open casket at the funeral. Sometimes the immediate family pay their final respects before the funeral.
In [[Israel]] caskets are not used at all, with the exception of military and state funerals. Instead, the body is carried to the grave wrapped in a ''tallit'' and placed directly in the earth. In the Diaspora, in general, a casket is only used if required by local law.

From death until burial, it is traditional for guards or [[Shemira|watchers]] (''shomrim'') to stay with the deceased. It is traditional to recite [[Psalms]] (''tehillim'') during this time.

==Funeral service==
The Jewish funeral consists of a burial, also known as an interment. Cremation is forbidden. Burial is considered to allow the body to decompose naturally, therefore [[embalming]] is forbidden. Burial is intended to take place in as short an interval of time after death as possible. Displaying of the body prior to burial does not take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm |title=Death &amp; Mourning: The Basics}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soultalk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282505/jewish/Soul-Talk.htm |title=Death &amp; Mourning: Soul Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers are usually not found at a traditional Jewish funeral but may be seen at statesmen's or heroes' funerals in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oztorah.com/2013/08/flowers-on-graves-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Flowers on graves - Ask the Rabbi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, the Jewish funeral service usually commences at the burial ground. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the funeral service commences either at a [[funeral home]] or at the [[cemetery]]. Occasionally the service will commence at a [[synagogue]]. In the case of a prominent individual, the funeral service can begin at a synagogue or a [[yeshivah]]. If the funeral service begins at a point other than at the cemetery, the entourage accompanies the body in a procession to the cemetery. Usually the funeral ceremony is brief and includes the recitation of psalms, followed by a eulogy, or ''hesped'' and finishes with a traditional closing prayer, the El Moley Rachamim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shermanschapel.com/the-jewish-funeral-ceremony.html|title=The Jewish Funeral Ceremony - Brooklyn Funeral Home|website=www.shermanschapel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, the procession accompanying the body to the place of burial, and the burial, are referred to by the word ''levayah,'' meaning "escorting." ''Levayah'' also indicates "joining" and "bonding." This aspect of the meaning of ''levayah'' conveys the suggestion of a commonality among the souls of the living and the dead.&lt;ref name=soultalk /&gt;

[[Yemenite Jews]], prior to their immigration to the land of Israel, maintained an ancient practice during the funeral procession to halt at at least seven stations before the actual burial of the dead, beginning from the entrance of the house from whence the bier is taken, to the graveyard itself.  This has come to be known as ''Ma'amad u'Moshav'', (lit. "Standing and Sitting"), or "seven standings and sittings," and is mentioned in [[Tosefta]] ''Pesahim'' 2: 14-15, during which obsequies only men and boys thirteen years and older took part, but never women. At these stations, the bier is let down by the pallbearers upon the ground, and those accompanying will recite "''Hatzur Tamim Pe'ulo''," etc. "''Ana Bakoach''," etc., said in a doleful dirge-like melody, and which verses are followed by one of the party reading certain Midrashic literature and liturgical verse that speaks about death, and which are said to eulogize the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (3rd edition), [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 1982, pp. 250–251; cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Megillah'' 26a), the words of Rabbi Menahem, the son of Rabbi Yosi, ibid. See also [[Tosefta]] ''Megillah'' 4:14, where it states: "They do not perform [the solemn obsequies of] ''Ma'amad u'Moshav'' with less than ten persons, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Keriah''===
The mourners traditionally make a tear (''keriah'' קריעה) in an outer garment before or at the funeral.&lt;ref name="Klein, Isaac 1979, page 278"/&gt; The tear should be on the left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters&lt;ref name=silverman&gt;{{cite book |title=Prayers of Consolation |first=Morris |last=Silverman |publisher=Media Judaica Inc. |year=1984 |isbn=0-87677-062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;), children, and spouses (and does not need to be visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the ''keriah'' in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.funeralwise.com/customs/jewish"
|title=Jewish Funeral Customs - Funeralwise.com
|accessdate=2017-02-08}} - says "The service .. begins with the cutting of a black ribbon"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://secure.whctemple.org/site/usermedia/application/7/guide-for-jewish-funeral-practices.pdf
|title=Guide for Jewish Funeral Practices - Washington Hebrew Congregation
|accessdate=2017-02-08}} says - "Among Conservative and Reform Jews, a black ribbon is..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the instance when a mourner receives the news of the death and burial of a relative after an elapsed period of 30 days or more, there is no ''keriah'', or tearing of the garment, except in the case of a parent. In the case of a parent, the tearing of the garment is to be performed no matter how long a period has elapsed between the time of death and the time of receiving the news.&lt;ref name=silverman /&gt;

If a child of the deceased needs to change clothes during the ''[[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]]'' period, s/he must tear the changed clothes. No other family member is required to rend changed clothes during ''shiva''. Children of the deceased may never sew the rent clothes, but any other mourner may mend the clothing 30 days after the burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=281558 |title=Death &amp; Mourning: Keriah |first=Maurice |last=Lamm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eulogies===
A ''hesped'' is a [[eulogy]], and it is common for several people to speak at the start of the ceremony at the funeral home, as well as 
prior to burial at the gravesite.

"and [[Abraham]] came to eulogize [[Sarah]]." Gen. 23:2 uses the word "Lispod" from which is derived the Hebrew term Hesped.

There is more than one purpose for the eulogy.

Some people specify in their wills that nothing should be said about them.

====Days of "no eulogy"====
Eulogies are forbidden on certain days; likewise on a Friday afternoon.

Some other times are:
* each month's Jewish New Moon ([[Rosh Chodesh]])
* the four days between [[Yom Kippur]] and [[Sukkot]]
* ''[[Chol HaMo'ed]]'' ("intermediate days" of [[Jewish holiday]]s)
* during the month of [[Nisan]]

A more general guideline is that when the [[Tachanun]] (supplication prayer) is omitted, it is permitted to deliver a brief eulogy emphasizing only the praise of the departed; the extensive eulogy is postponed, and may be said at another time during the year of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/eulogy.htm|title=Jewish Funeral Guide - Jewish Funeral Services - לוויה - Eulogy - הספד|website=www.jewish-funeral-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
[[File:Karczewski Jewish funeral.jpg|thumb|''Jewish funeral in Vilnius'' (1824), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

''Kevura'', or burial, should take place as soon as possible after death. The ''[[Torah]]'' requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] 21:23&lt;/ref&gt; Burial is delayed "for the honor of the deceased," usually to allow more time for far-flung family to come to the funeral and participate in the other post-burial rituals, but also to hire professionals, or to bury the deceased in a cemetery of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin]] 47a&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect for the dead can be seen from many examples in the ''[[Torah]]'' and ''[[Tanakh]]''. For example, one of the last events in the ''Torah'' is the death of [[Moses]] when [[Names of God in Judaism|God himself]] buries him: "[God] buried him in the depression in the land of [[Moab]], opposite Beth Peor. No man knows the place that he was buried, even to this day."&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=34&lt;/ref&gt;

In many traditional funerals, the casket will be carried from the hearse to the grave in seven stages. These are accompanied by seven recitations of [[Psalm 91]]. There is a symbolic pause after each stage (which are omitted on days when a eulogy would also not be recited.)

When the funeral service has ended, the mourners come forward to fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or participate in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of [[death]] to [[life]] and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.

Some have the custom to initially use the shovel "backwards" for the first few shovelfuls. Even within those who do it, some limit this to just the first few participants.

When someone is finished, they put the shovel back in the ground, rather than handing it to the next person, to avoid passing along their [[grief]] to other mourners.  This literal participation in the burial is considered a particularly good [[mitzvah]] because it is one for which the beneficiary&amp;nbsp;— the deceased&amp;nbsp;— can offer no repayment or gratitude and thus it is a pure gesture.

Some have a custom, once the grave is filled, to make a rounded topping shape.&lt;ref&gt;Tzuras ..&lt;/ref&gt;

After burial, the [[Tziduk Hadin]] prayer may be recited affirming that [[Divine Judgment]] is righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zalman |last=Goldstein|title=The Burial|website=chabad.org|url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/368092/jewish/The-Burial.htm|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of deceased may then be comforted by other mourners with the formula:
:הַמָּקוֹם יְנַחֵם אֶתְכֶם בְּתוֹךְ שְׁאָר אֲבֵלֵי צִיּוֹן וִירוּשָׁלָיִם
:Hamakom y'nachem etkhem b'tokh sha'ar avelei tziyon viyrushalayim.
:[[Names of God in Judaism|The Omnipresent]] will comfort you (pl.) among the mourners of [[Zion]] and [[Jerusalem]].

==Mourning==

===''Aninut''===
[[Image:Yiskor for Herzl.jpg|thumb|Yiskor for Herzl, by [[Boris Schatz]].]]

The first stage of mourning is ''aninut'', or "intense mourning." ''Aninut'' lasts until the burial is over, or, if a mourner is unable to attend the funeral, from the moment he is no longer involved with the funeral itself.

An ''onen'' (a person in ''aninut'') is considered to be in a state of total shock and disorientation. Thus the ''onen'' is exempt from performing [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]] that require action (and attention), such as [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|praying and reciting blessings]], wearing ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), in order to be able to tend unhindered to the funeral arrangements. However the ''onen'' is still obligated in commandments that forbid an action (such as not violating the Shabbat).

===''Avelut''===
''Aninut'' is immediately followed by ''avelut'' ("mourning"). An ''avel'' ("mourner") does not listen to [[music]] or go to [[concert]]s, and does not attend any joyous events or parties such as [[Jewish view of marriage|marriages]] or [[B'nai Mitzvah|Bar or Bat Mitzvahs]], unless absolutely necessary. (If the date for such an event has already been set prior to the death, it is strictly forbidden for it to be postponed or cancelled.)

''Avelut'' consists of three distinct periods.

====''Shiva'' – Seven days====
{{main|Shiva (Judaism)}}
The first stage of ''avelut'' is ''shiva'' ({{Hebrew Name 1|שבעה||"seven"|nobold}}), a week-long period of grief and [[mourning]]. Observance of ''shiva'' is referred to by [[Jewish English languages|English-speaking Jews]] as "sitting ''shiva''". During this period, mourners traditionally gather in one home and receive visitors.

When they get home, the mourners refrain for a week from showering or bathing, wearing leather shoes or jewelry, or shaving. In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since they should not be concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being "brought low" by the grief. The meal of consolation ([[Seudah#Seudat Havraah|''seudat havra'ah'']]), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled [[egg (food)|eggs]] and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of [[Jacob]] purchasing the birthright from [[Esau]] with stewed [[lentils]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 25:34);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0125.htm|title=Genesis 25 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|work=mechon-mamre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is traditionally stated that Jacob was cooking the lentils soon after the death of his grandfather [[Abraham]]. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them ("''shiva'' calls").

It is considered a great ''[[mitzvah]]'' (commandment) of kindness and compassion to pay a home visit to the mourners. Traditionally, no greetings are exchanged and visitors wait for the mourners to initiate conversation. The mourner is under no obligation to engage in conversation and may, in fact, completely ignore his/her visitors.

Visitors will traditionally take on the hosting role when attending a Shiva, often bringing food and serving it to the mourning family and other guests. The mourning family will often avoid any cooking or cleaning during the Shiva period; those responsibilities become those of visitors.

There are various customs as to what to say when taking leave of the mourner(s). One of the most common is to say to them:
:הַמָּקוֹם יְנַחֵם אֶתְכֶם בְּתוֹךְ שְׁאָר אֲבֵלֵי צִיּוֹן וִירוּשָׁלָיִם
:''Hamakom y'nachem etkhem b'tokh sha'ar avelei tziyon viyrushalayim'':
:"[[Names of God in Judaism|The Omnipresent]] will comfort you (pl.) among the mourners of [[Zion]] and [[Jerusalem]]"

Depending on their community's customs, others may also add such wishes as: "You should have no more ''tza'ar'' (distress)" or "You should have only ''simchas'' (celebrations)" or "we should hear only ''besorot tovot'' (good tidings) from each other" or "I wish you a long life".

Traditionally, [[Jewish services|prayer services]] are organized in the house of mourning. It is customary for the family to lead the services themselves.

====Commencing and calculating the seven days of mourning====
If the mourner returns from the cemetery after the burial before sundown, then the day of the funeral is counted as the first of the seven days of mourning.  Mourning generally concludes in the morning of the seventh day.  No mourning may occur on [[Shabbat]] (the Jewish Sabbath), nor may the burial take place on Shabbat, but the day of Shabbat does count as one of the seven days. If a [[Jewish holiday]] occurs after the first day, that curtails the mourning period. If the funeral occurs during a festival, the start of the mourning period is delayed to the end of the festival. Some holidays, such as [[Rosh Hashanah]], cancel the mourning period completely.

====''Shloshim'' – Thirty days====
The thirty-day period following burial (including ''shiva'')&lt;ref&gt;''od 23 yamim'' (page 330, Pnai Baruch) = "an additional 23 days"&lt;/ref&gt; is known as ''shloshim'' ({{Hebrew Name 1|שלושים||"thirty"|nobold}}). During ''shloshim'', a mourner is forbidden to marry or to attend a ''[[seudat mitzvah]]'' (religious festive meal). Men do not shave or get haircuts during this time.

Since Judaism teaches that a deceased person can still benefit from the merit of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (commandments) performed in their memory, it is considered a special privilege to bring merit to the departed by [[Torah study|learning Torah]] in their name. A popular custom is to coordinate a group of people who will jointly study the complete [[Mishnah]] during the ''shloshim'' period. This is due to the fact that "Mishnah" (משנה) and "Neshamah" (נשמה), soul, have the same (Hebrew) letters.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Yehoyada to Sanhedrin 42a and Aruch HaShulchan, Yoreh Deah, 376:13&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Shneim asar chodesh'' – Twelve months====
Those mourning a parent additionally observe a twelve-month period ({{Hebrew Name 1|שנים  עשר חודש|shneim asar chodesh|"twelve months"|nobold}}), counted from the day of death. During this period, most activity returns to normal, although the mourners continue to recite the [[Kaddish#Mourners.27 Kaddish|mourner's kaddish]] as part of synagogue services for eleven months. In Orthodox tradition, this is an obligation of the sons (not daughters)&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Maurice Lamm uses the phrase "the son's recitation of kaddish" in the middle of page 158 and then again in the middle of page 159 of the original/pre-2000 edition; the latter is now available online at http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281541/jewish/The-Jewish-Way-in-Death-and-Mourning.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artscroll has substantiation, including not carrying out a father's wish when there are daughters and not sons, on pp.359-360 of {{cite book
|title=Mourning in Halachah |isbn=0-89906-171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;	as mourners. There remain restrictions on attending festive occasions and large gatherings, especially where live music is performed.

==''Matzevah'' (Unveiling of the tombstone)==
A [[headstone]] (tombstone) is known as a ''matzevah'' (monument). Although there is no [[Halakhic]] obligation to hold an unveiling ceremony (the ritual became popular in many communities toward the end of the 19th century), there are varying customs about when it should be placed on the grave. Most communities have an unveiling ceremony a year after the death. Some communities have it earlier, even a week after the burial. In Israel it is done after the ''shloshim'' (the first 30 days of mourning). There is no universal restriction about the timing, other than the unveiling cannot be held during Shabbat, (work-restricted) Jewish holidays, or [[Chol HaMoed|Chol Ha'Moed]].&lt;ref&gt;Mourning in Halacha, 42:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is also a known restriction regarding the month of Nisan:
{{cite web
|url=http://5tjt.com/visiting-cemeteries-in-nissan |title=Visiting Cemeteries In Nissan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ceremony, a cloth or shroud covering that has been placed on the headstone is removed, customarily by close family members. Services include reading of several psalms. [[Gesher HaChaim]] cites (chapters) "33, 16, 17, 72, 91, 104, and 130; then one says Psalm 119 and recites the verses that spell the name of the deceased and the letters of the word ''Neshama''.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/18/Q2
|title=What happens at an "Unveiling"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another possible list is: (1, 23, 24, 103). Different communities have different customs.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (if a ''[[minyan]]'' is available), and the prayer "[[El male rachamim|El Malei Rachamim]]". The service may include a brief eulogy for the deceased.

===Monuments===
Originally, it was not common practice to place names on tombstones. The general custom for engraving the name of the deceased on the monument is a practice that goes back (only) "the last several hundred years."&lt;ref&gt;Gesher HaChaim,Ch.28 {{cite web
|url=http://www.pikholz.org/Hevron/Gesher.html  |title=From GESHER HAHAYYIM, Chapter 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yemenite Jews|Jewish communities in Yemen]], prior to their immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban [[Shimon ben Gamliel II|Shimon ben Gamliel]] who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!”&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Sheqalim'' 7a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mishne Torah of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'', ed. [[Yosef Qafih]], Jerusalem, s.v. ''Hil. Avel'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and [[Halachic decisor]], [[Maimonides]], likewise, ruled that it is not permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''[[Mishne Torah]]'', ''Hil. Avel'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the more recent custom of [[Spanish Jews|Spanish Jewry]], following the teachings of the [[Yitzhak Luria|Ari z”l]] (''Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi''), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet]] (RASHBA) wrote that it is a way of showing honor to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Questions &amp; Responsa of Rabbi Shelomo ben Aderet'', ''responsum'' # 375&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and [[Ashkenaz]]. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.

==Annual remembrances==

==={{anchor|Yahrtzeit|Yartzeit|Yahrzeit}}Yahrtzeit===
{{redirect|Yahrzeit|the CSI: NY episode|Yahrzeit (CSI: NY)}}
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
''Yahrtzeit'', יאָרצײַט, means ''"Time (of) Year"'' in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=139&amp;letter=J |title=Jahrzeit |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative spellings include ''yortsayt'' (using the [[YIVO]] standard [[Yiddish orthography]]), ''Jahrzeit'' (in German), ''Yohr Tzeit'', ''yahrzeit'', and ''yartzeit''.  The word is used by Yiddish speaking Jews, and refers to the anniversary of the day of death of a relative. Yahrtzeit literally means "time of [one] year".

===Nachala===
The commemoration is known in [[Hebrew]] as ''nachala'' ("legacy," or "inheritance").  This term is used by most Sephardic Jews, although some use the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] terms ''meldado'' or less commonly, ''anyos'' ("years").&lt;ref name=SephRel&gt;{{cite book |title=Sephardi Religious Responses|first=Norman A. |last=Stillman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT8AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12 |isbn=9781134365494 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesjewishmuseum.org/ssb/ATimeToWeep.pdf |title=Meldado |publisher=Rhodes Jewish Museum |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely observed, and based on the Jewish tradition that mourners are required to commemorate the death of a relative.

===Commemorating===
Jews are required to commemorate the death of parents, siblings, spouses, or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/death.htm|title=Judaism 101: Life, Death and Mourning|work=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#When an immediate relative (parent, sibling, spouse or child) initially hears of the death of a relative, it is traditional to express one's grief by tearing their clothing and saying "Baruch Dayan HaEmet" (Blessed is the True Judge).
#Shiva is observed by parents, children, spouses and siblings of the deceased, preferably all together in the deceased's home.The main ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the ''[[Kaddish]]'' prayer at least three times, ''[[Maariv]]'' at the evening services, ''[[Shacharit]]'' at [[Jewish services|morning services]], and ''[[Mincha]]'' at the afternoon services. The customs are first discussed in detail in ''Sefer HaMinhagim'' (pub. 1566) by [[Rabbi]] [[Isaac Tyrnau]].

The ''Yahrtzeit'' usually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/yahrzeit-date.htm|title=Jewish Funeral Guide - Remembrance - Yahrzeit Date Calculation|work=jewish-funeral-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; falls annually on the Hebrew date of the deceased relative's death according to the [[Hebrew calendar]].  There are questions that arise as to what the date should be if this date falls on Rosh Chodesh or in a leap year of the Hebrew calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281636/jewish/Yahrzeit-Memorial-Anniversary.htm Yahrzeit: Memorial Anniversary] on [http://chabad.org Chabad.org] as part of a series "The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning" by Maurice Lamm, author of a book by the same title.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, there are a few permutations, as follows:

Yahrzeit is done each year, for a full day on the date of death according to the Hebrew calendar. The Synagogue notifies members of the secular date.

The main ''halachic'' obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the ''[[Kaddish]]'' prayer three times (evening of the previous day, morning, and afternoon), and many attend synagogue for the evening, morning, and afternoon services on this day.

During the morning prayer service the mourner's Kaddish is recited at least three times, two that are part of the daily service and one that is added in a house of mourning.  Both there and in the synagogue, another Kaddish, the Rabbi's Kaddish, is also said in the morning service once in Nusach Ashkenaz and twice in Sfard/Sfardi.

As a widely practiced [[Minhag|custom]], mourners also light a special candle that burns for 24 hours, called a [[yahrtzeit candle|"''Yahrzeit'' candle"]].

Lighting a [[yahrtzeit candle]] in memory of a loved one is a ''minhag'' ("custom") that is deeply ingrained in Jewish life honoring the memory and souls of the deceased.

Some Jews believe that strict Jewish law requires that one should fast on the day of a parent's Yahrzeit;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://rabbikaganoff.com/fasting-and-feasting-on-a-yahrtzeit/ rabbikaganoff.com] where Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff Shlita finds references to this in [[Sefer Hasidim]] and the writings of [[Moses Isserles]].&lt;/ref&gt; although most believe this is not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting on the day of the ''Yahrtzeit'', or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jews it has become customary to make a [[siyum]] by completing a tractate of [[Talmud]] or a volume of the [[Mishnah]] on the day prior to the ''Yahrtzeit'', in the honor of the deceased. A ''halakha'' requiring a ''siyum'' ("celebratory meal"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.

Many synagogues will have lights on a special memorial plaque on one of the synagogue's walls, with names of synagogue members who have died. Each of these lights will be lit for individuals on their ''Yahrzeit'' (and in some synagogues, the entire Hebrew month).&lt;ref&gt;".. during the month of the Yahrzeit. (Chabad of Commerce) {{cite web
|url=https://www.jewishcommerce.org/memorial-wall  |title=MEMORIAL WALL}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the lights will be lit for a ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]]'' service.&lt;ref&gt;"At the side of each nameplate, there is a Memorial Light, which is lit each year 
on the Yahrzeit and for all Yizkor commemorations." {{cite web
|url=http://ohrkodesh.org/jewish-living/life-cycle-events/memorial-plaque |title=Memorial Plaque}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some synagogues will also turn on all the lights for memorial days, such as ''[[Yom Ha'Shoah]]''.

===Visiting the gravesite===
[[File:Grave of Shlomo Carlebach.jpg|thumb|The grave of rabbi-singer [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] in Jerusalem is piled with stones left by visitors.]]

Some have a custom to visit the cemetery on fast days ([[Shulchan Aruch]] Orach Chayim 559:10) and before [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]] (581:4, 605), when possible, and for a ''Yahrzeit.''  During the first year the grave is often visited on the shloshim, and the yartzeit (but may be visited at any time).

Even when visiting Jewish graves of someone that the visitor never knew, the custom is to place a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, and is also a way of participating in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to tend the grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of [[cairn]]), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated the existence of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli, Masechet Moe'ed Katan&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WITTENBERG, CJN Staff Reporter|first1=Ed|title=Remembering the Lubavitcher Rebbe On 20th yahrzeit, Rabbi Schneerson still making an impact in world|url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local/article_a42334e4-fc7e-11e3-9082-0019bb2963f4.html|agency=Cleveland Jewish News|date=June 27, 2014|quote="This Jewish tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient... said Chabad of Cleveland has planned a series of events to commemorate Schneerson’s 20th yahrzeit.

==Memorial through prayer==

===Mourner's Kaddish===
{{main|Kaddish}}
Kaddish Yatom (''[[Hebrew Language|heb.]]'' [[w:he:קדיש יתום|קדיש יתום]] ''lit. "Orphan's Kaddish"'') or the "Mourner's" Kaddish, is said at all [[Jewish services|prayer services]], as well as at funerals and memorials.  Customs for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities.  In many [[Ashkenazi]] synagogues, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] ones, it is customary that everyone in the synagogue stands.  In Sephardi synagogues, most people sit for most sayings of Kaddish.&lt;ref&gt;The following or similar wording appear in several religious sources: "The prevalent practice among Sepharadim is to sit during Kaddish '''unless one had been standing when Kaddish began. Many have the custom to stand during the half-kaddish recited during the Friday night prayer service, given the significant spiritual benefits that one can receive at that time. It is proper for a Sephardic Jew praying in an Ashkenazic minyan to stand for Kaddish and Barechu (Rav David Yosef, Halachah Berurah (56:17).''' (emphasis added). This quote is from a widely circulated Sephardic periodical, Community Magazine, http://www.communitym.com/article.asp?article_id=103875&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ben Ish Chai, a widely respected Sephardic source, refers to "the congregation rises slightly" regarding Barchu, a similar situation, as noted in the prior quote regarding "to stand for Kaddish and Barechu." {{cite web
|url=http://halachayomit.co.il/en/Default.aspx?HalachaID=3544&amp;PageIndex=44
|title=The Obligation to Stand While Kaddish and Barechu are Recited}} As for Orthodox Ashkenaz practice, "Some rise partially when the words Amen, yehei shemei rabba are said." {{cite web
|url=https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/mm/publications/MadrichEnglish.pdf
|title=Guide to Minhag Ashkenaz - Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz}} These agree with a TALK PAGE comment regarding saying "Amen, YeHay ShMay...," that there are those who  ''"elevate"'' - meaning that they are not actually fully sitting, but neither are they standing.&lt;/ref&gt; In many non-Orthodox Ashkenaz ones, the custom is that only the mourners themselves stand and chant, while the rest of the congregation sits, chanting only responsively. &lt;!-- In [[Spanish and Portuguese]] [[esnogas]]/[[synagogues]] there is no Mourner's Kaddish and the [[Hazzan]] recites it while the congregants follow him. --&gt;

===Hashkabóth===
In many Sephardic communities, Hashkabóth ("remembrance") prayers are recited for the deceased in the year following death, on the deceased's death anniversary ("nahalah" or "años"), and upon request by the deceased's relatives.  Some Sephardic communities also recite Hashkabóth for all their deceased members on Yom Kippur, even those who died many years before.

===Yizkor===
[[File:Joods monument gedenksteen.JPG|thumb|Remembrance plaque in [[Tiel]].]]

''Yizkor'' ("remembrance") prayers are recited by those that have lost either one or both of their parents. These may additionally says Yizkor for other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;The Artscroll Siddur specifically mentions other titles, "Mitzad Avi.. MiTzad Imi" = on my father's side, on my mother's side&lt;/ref&gt; Some might also say Yizkor for a deceased close friend.&lt;ref name=Yizk.Chabad&gt;Chabad mentions this at {{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/371509/jewish/Yizkor-The-Memorial-Prayer.htm|title=Yizkor - The Memorial Prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary in many communities for those with both parents alive to leave the synagogue during the Yizkor service&lt;ref name=Yizk.Chabad/&gt; while it is said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimonapisdorf.com/yizkor-a-four-part-guide|title=Yizkor: A four part guide - Shimon Apisdorf|website=www.shimonapisdorf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The OU is more detailed but ends on "one should follow one’s own family minhag or the practice of one’s community."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yizkor prayers are recited four times a year, and are intended to be recited in a synagogue with a [[minyan]]; if one is unable to be with a minyan, one can recite it without one. These four Yizkor services are held on [[Yom Kippur]], [[Shemini Atzeret]], on the last day of [[Passover]], and on [[Shavuot]] (the second day of Shavuot, in communities that observe Shavuot for two days).

The ''[[El Malei Rachamim]]'' prayer, in which  God is asked to remember and grant [[wiktionary:repose|repose]] to the souls of the departed, is recited as the primary prayer of the ''Yizkor'' services.&lt;ref name="BJC33"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birnbaum|first1=Philip|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|date=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York|page=33|edition=Revised|chapter=El Male Rahamim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yizkor is customarily not said within the first year of mourning, until the first ''[[yahrzeit]]'' has passed. This practice is a custom and historically not regarded to be obligatory.&lt;ref name=MLammBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamm|first=Maurice|title=The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning, Revised and Expanded|year=2000|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers, Inc.|location=Middle Village, NY|isbn=0-8246-0422-9|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] custom there is no Yizkor prayer, but the ''Hashkabóth'' serve a similar role in the service.

===Av HaRachamim===
{{main|Av HaRachamim}}
[[Av Harachamim]] is a Jewish memorial prayer that was written in the late 11th Century, after the destruction of the German Jewish communities around the [[Rhine river]] by Crusaders.&lt;ref name=JewTrad&gt;{{cite book |title=Jewish Traditions: A JPS Guide|first=Ronald |last=Eisenberg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_qGHi_9K154C&amp;pg=PA461 |page=461 |isbn=9780827610392 |date=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recited on many [[Shabbat]]ot before [[Musaf]], and also at the end of the Yizkor service.&lt;ref name=JewTrad /&gt;

==Communal responses to death==
Most Jewish communities of size have non-profit organizations that maintain cemeteries and provide ''chevra kadisha'' services for those in need. They are often formed out of a synagogue's women's group.

===''Zihui Korbanot Asson'' (ZAKA)===
{{main|ZAKA}}
ZAKA ([[Hebrew language|heb.]] [[w:he:זק"א|זק"א]] ''abbr. for Zihui Korbanot Asson lit. "Identifying Victims of Disaster"'' – [[w:he:חסד של אמת|חסד של אמת]] ''Hessed shel Emet lit. "True Kindness"'' – [[w:he:איתור חילוץ והצלה|איתור חילוץ והצלה]]), is a [[community emergency response team]] in the State of [[Israel]], officially recognized by the government. The organization was founded in 1989. Members of ZAKA, most of whom are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], assist [[ambulance]] crews, identify the victims of [[Palestinian political violence|terrorism]], road accidents and other disasters and, where necessary, gather body parts and spilled [[blood]] for proper burial. They also provide [[first aid]] and [[rescue]] services, and help with the search for missing persons. In the past they have responded in the aftermath of disasters around the world.

===''Hebrew Free Burial Association'' (HFBA)===
[[File:Triangle Fire Grave.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of victim of [[Triangle Shirtwaist Fire]] at the [[Hebrew Free Burial Association#Cemeteries|Hebrew Free Burial Association's Mount Richmond Cemetery]].]]
{{main|Hebrew Free Burial Association}}
The Hebrew Free Burial Association is a non-profit agency whose mission is to ensure that all Jews receive a proper Jewish burial, regardless of their financial ability.  Since 1888, more than 55,000 Jews have been buried by HFBA in their cemeteries located on [[Staten Island, New York]], Silver Lake Cemetery and Mount Richmond Cemetery.

===Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles===
Formed in 1854 for the purpose of "…procuring a piece of ground suitable for the purpose of a burying ground for the deceased of their own faith, and also to appropriate a portion of their time and means to the holy cause of benevolence…," the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles established the first Jewish cemetery in [[Los Angeles]] at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive&lt;ref&gt;The original cemetery land is at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive ({{coord| 34.0691|-118.2411|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Hebrew Benevolent Society - Site of first Jewish cemetery in LA}})&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chavez Ravine]] (current home to [[Dodger Stadium]]). In 1968, a plaque was installed at the original site, identifying it as [[California Historical Landmark]] #822.&lt;ref name="WSJH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|title=Early Jewish LA|url=http://www.wsjhistory.com/early_jewish_la.htm|publisher=Western States Jewish History|accessdate=2012-05-08|location=Vol #1, Issue #3|date=April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, because of poor environmental conditions due to the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in the area, it was proposed by Congregation B'nai B'rith to secure a new plot of land in what is now [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]], and to move the buried remains to the new site, with a continued provision for burial of indigent people. This site, the Home of Peace Memorial Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of Peace Memorial Park|url=http://www.homeofpeacememorialpark.com/|publisher=Home of Peace Memorial Park|accessdate=2012-05-08|location=4334 Whittier Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90023, Phone +1 323 261 6135, {{coord|34.022|-118.175|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Home of Piece Memorial Park}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; remains operational and is the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. The original society is now known as the "Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles".&lt;ref name="WSJH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles|url=http://www.jfsla.org|publisher=Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy following death==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

===Donating organs===
{{main|Organ donation in Jewish law}}
Being an organ donor is absolutely prohibited by some, and permitted, in principle, by others.&lt;ref&gt;That there is a card carried by some, stating "I do not give my permission to take from me, not in life or in death, any organ or part of my body for any purpose" supports this.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[Jewish denominations]], once death has been clearly established, provided that instructions have been left in a written [[living will]], donation may be done.  However, there are a number of practical difficulties for those who wish to adhere strictly to Jewish law. For example, someone who is dead by clinical standards may not yet be dead according to Jewish law. Jewish law does not permit donation of organs that are vital for survival from a donor who is in a near-dead state but who is not yet dead according to Jewish law. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews may need to consult their rabbis on a case-by-case basis.

Since 2001, with the founding of the [[Halachic Organ Donor Society]], organ donation has become more common in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|modern orthodox Jewish]] communities, especially with the support of rabbis like [[Moshe Tendler]] and [[Norman Lamm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berg |first1=Elaine |title=Beating the Organ Donor Taboo |url=https://forward.com/opinion/743/beating-the-organ-donor-taboo/ |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUNDREDS OF ORTHODOX RABBIS CARRY ORGAN DONOR CARDS - HODS |url=https://hods.org/about-hods/orthodox-rabbis/ |website=HODS |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish view of cremation===
[[Halakha]] (Jewish law) forbids [[cremation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yesodei Smachos (p. 38 in 1978 edition), citing Gesher HaChaim, 28:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient historian&lt;ref name=MLammBook/&gt;{{rp|56}}&lt;ref&gt;citing [[Tacitus]]&lt;/ref&gt; described as "a distinguishing characteristic" that 
"Jews buried, rather than burned, their dead." Judaism stresses burial in the earth (included entombment, as in caves) as a religious duty of laying a person's remains to rest.  This, as well as the belief that the human body is created in the image of the divine and is not to be vandalized before or after death, teaches the belief that it was necessary to keep the whole body intact in burial, in anticipation of the eventual resurrection of the dead in the messianic age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/09/cremation-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Cremation - Ask the Rabbi |first=Raymond |last=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, some Jews who are not religiously adherent, or who have attached to an alternative movement or religious stream that does not see some or all the laws of the Torah as binding upon them, have chosen cremation, either for themselves prior to death, or for their loved ones, a choice made in 2016 by more than 50% of non-Jews in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Chabad International |date=February 2017|title=The Jewish Way in Death and Burial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
{{main|Religious views of suicide#Judaism}}

As Judaism considers suicide to be a form of murder, a Jew who commits suicide is denied some important after-death privileges: No eulogies should be given for the deceased, and burial in the main section of the Jewish cemetery is normally not allowed.

In recent times, most people who die by suicide have been deemed to be the unfortunate victims of [[Clinical depression|depression]] or of a serious [[mental illness]]. Under this interpretation, their act of "self-murder" is not deemed to be a voluntary act of self-destruction, but rather the result of an involuntary condition. They have therefore been looked upon as having died of causes beyond their control.

Additionally, the [[Talmud]] (in Semakhot, one of the [[minor tractates]]) recognizes that many elements of the mourning ritual exist as much for the living survivors as for the dead, and that these elements ought to be carried out even in the case of the suicide.

Furthermore, if reasonable doubt exists that the death may not have been suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), the benefit of the doubt is given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] is considered a result of a lack of understanding ("da'at"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.

===Tattoos===
[[Halakha]] (Jewish law) forbids [[tattoo]]s, and there is a persistent myth that this prevents burial in a Jewish cemetery, but this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/print/69707/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115071205/http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/print/69707 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-15 |title=What's the truth about... |publisher=Orthodox Union |first=Ari |last=Zivotofsky }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishanswers.org/ask-the-rabbi-category/from-idolatry-to-conversion/?p=120 |title=Burying a Tattooed Person in a Jewish Cemetery |first=Azriel |last=Schreiber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/fashion/17SKIN.html |title=Skin Deep: For Some Jews, It Only Sounds Like ‘Taboo’
|date=July 17, 2008 |first=Kate |last=Torgovnick |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small minority of burial societies will not accept a corpse with a tattoo, but Jewish law does not mention burial of tattooed Jews, and nearly all burial societies have no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/533444/jewish/Can-a-person-with-a-tattoo-be-buried-in-a-Jewish-cemetery.htm|title=Can a person with a tattoo be buried in a Jewish cemetery?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the tattoo of a deceased Jew is forbidden as it would be considered ''damaging the body''.  This case has been one of public interest in the current generations due to the large population [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed]] in [[Nazi concentration camps]] between 1940 and 1945.  However, it must be noted that, since those tattoos were forced upon the recipients in a situation where any resistance could expect official murder or brutality, their presence is not in any way reflective of any violation of Jewish law on the part of both the living and deceased; rather under these circumstances it shows adherence to the positive command to preserve innocent life, including one's own, by passively allowing the mark to be applied.

===Death of an apostate Jew===
There is no mourning for an [[Jews in apostasy|Apostate Jew]] according to Jewish law.  (See that article for a discussion of precisely what actions and motivations render a Jew an "apostate.")

In the past several centuries, the custom developed among [[Ashkenazic]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] (including [[Hassidic]] and [[Haredi]] Jews), that the family would "[[Shiva (Judaism)|sit shiva]]" if and when one of their relatives would leave the fold of traditional Judaism.  The definition of "leaving the fold" varies within communities; some would sit ''shiva'' if a family member married a non-Jew; others would only sit ''shiva'' if the individual actually converted to another faith, and even then, some would make a distinction between those who chose to do so of their own will, and those who were pressured into conversion.  (In [[Sholom Aleichem]]'s [[Tevye]], when the title character's daughter converts to [[Christianity]] to marry a [[Christian]], Tevye sits ''shiva'' for her and generally refers to her as "dead.")  At the height of the [[Mitnagdim]] (anti-[[Hassidic]]) movement, in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, some [[Mitnagdim]] even sat ''shiva'' if a family member joined [[Hassidism]].  (It is said that when [[Leibel Eiger]] joined Hassidism, his father, Rabbi [[Shlomo Eiger]] sat ''shiva'', but his grandfather, the famed Rabbi [[Akiva Eiger]], did not. It is also said that [[Leibel Eiger]] came to be ''menachem avel'' [console the mourner]).  By the mid-twentieth century, however, [[Hassidism]] was recognized {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} as a valid form of [[Orthodox Judaism]], and thus the (controversial) practice of sitting ''shiva'' for those who realign to [[Hassidism]] ceased to exist.

Today, some [[Orthodox Jews]], particularly the more traditional ones (such as many [[Haredi]] and [[Hassidic]] communities), continue the practice of sitting ''shiva'' for a family member who has left the religious community.  More liberal Jews, however, may question the practice, eschewing it as a very harsh act that could make it much more difficult for the family member to return to traditional practice if/when s/he would consider doing so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">'''Building services engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that strives to achieve a safe and comfortable [[Indoor air quality|indoor environment]] whilst minimizing the [[environmental impact]] of a [[building]].

'''Alternative titles''': The term ''Building services engineering'' is also commonly known as ''Architectural engineering'', ''Technical building services'', ''Building engineering'', or ''Facilities and services planning engineering''. The term ''Building services engineering'' is widely used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (incl. [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]), but in the [[United States of America]], the field is also known as ''Building systems engineering'', ''[[Architectural engineering]]'' or ''[[Building engineering]]'', though the latter two disciplines generally have a broader scope, also encompassing elements of [[Structural engineering]] and more traditional architectural tasks such as room planning and material selection. In India the engineers are known as ''facilities planners''. In some counties, a ''building services architect'' is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services.

==Scope==
Building services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the technical services in buildings (including [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[public health system]]s, also known as [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), in order to ensure the safe, comfortable and [[environmentally friendly]] operation. Building services [[engineer]]s work closely with other construction professionals such as architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. Building services engineers influence the architectural design of building, in particular facades, in relation to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and indoor environment, and can integrate local energy production (e.g. façade-integrated [[photovoltaics]]) or community-scale energy facilities (e.g. [[district heating]]). Building services engineers therefore play an important role in the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings (including [[green building]]s, [[passive house]]s, and [[Energy-plus-house|Plus-houses]], and [[Zero-energy building]]s). With buildings accounting for about a third of all carbon emissions&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-energy-efficient-buildings-heating-and-cooling-equipment&lt;/ref&gt; and over a half of the global electricity demand,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; building services engineers play an important role in the move to a [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon society]], hence mitigate [[global warming]].

The career path of a building services engineer can take a very wide range of directions. Within the broad field of building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example specialization in [[renewable energy]], [[sustainability]], low-carbon technologies, energy management, [[building automation]], and [[Building information modeling|building information modeling (BIM)]]. Building services engineers increasingly seek status as accredited [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), [[BREEAM]] (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), or CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) auditors, in addition to their status as [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered]]/[[European Engineer|professional engineer]].

Building services engineering encompasses much more than just [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), but also the following:
* '''Mechanical''' services:
** [[Energy]] supply – [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
** [[Escalators]] and [[Elevator|lifts]]
** [[Heating]] including low-exergy (low-temperature) solutions
** [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. This includes clean-room solutions (e.g. hospitals, labs) and industrial ventilation (factory spaces and processes)
** [[Air conditioning]] and other applications of [[refrigeration]]
* '''Electrical''' services:
** [[Low voltage]] (LV) systems, [[distribution board]]s and [[switchgear]]
** Communication lines, telephones and IT networks ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]])
** [[Building automation]]
** [[Lightning]] protection
** [[Fire]] detection and protection
** [[Security]] and [[alarm]] systems
* '''Public health''' services:
** [[Plumbing]] solutions for [[water]] supply, both potable cold water and DHW (domestic hot water), 
** [[Drainage]] of waste water (sewage) from inside a building and drainage/treatment of external surface runoff around a building. Increasing use of grey-water recycling and solutions to delay runoff (e.g. green roofs and infiltration beds)
** Solutions for [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], including [[cleaning]], [[indoor air quality]], and health technology (e.g. isolation wards)
* '''Other''':

Examples of roles/duties a Building Services Engineer may have include:
* '''[[Consultant]] engineer''': Designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments. Design management is the business side of design, which aims to create the right environment to control and support a culture of creativity and innovation, and to embrace the iterative nature of design involving the many disciplines that, collectively, will deliver design solutions – and all at the same time as ensuring that an organisation’s commercial goals and objectives are achieved and that all is done in an ethically sound way. Typically the building services engineering installation is worth 30–60% of the total value of a contract. Design management is not the same as project management. Project management focuses on a wider range of administrative skills but is not normally sympathetic to the peculiarities of delivering a fully coordinated functioning design, taking into account its unique nature and dealing with the changing requirements of clients and the external factors over which there is little control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portman|first=Jackie|title=Building Services Design Management|date=July 2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford:UK|isbn=978-1118528129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[General contractor|Contractor]]''': Supervising the installation of the building services, commissioning systems. This includes tasks such as [[Testing, adjusting, balancing|TABS]].
* '''[[Facility management|Facilities manager]]''': Operation, servicing, and continuous commissioning of existing buildings and plant.

==Professional bodies==
The two most notable professional bodies are:
* The [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) was founded in 1894.
* The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) was founded in 1976, and received a Royal Charter in the [[United Kingdom]], and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession. Its objectives of the Institution are to: ''support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work.''

==Education==
Building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering, [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. The length of study for such a degree is usually 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) and 5–6 years for a [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng).

The list below includes accredited education programs. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers ([[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]]) accredits university degrees in Building Services Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cibse.org/membership/accredited-courses/list-of-accredited-courses&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[ABET]] accredits degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx Search All Accredited Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817205746/http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building services engineering software==
Many tasks in building services engineering involve the use of engineering software, for example to design/model or draw solutions. The most common types of tool are whole building energy simulation&lt;ref&gt;K. Mahmud, U. Amin, M.J. Hossain, J. Ravishankar, "Computational tools for design, analysis, and management of residential energy systems", Applied Energy, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] (traditionally 2D) or the increasingly popular [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM) which is 3D. 3D BIM software can have integrated tools for Building Services calculations such sizing ventilation ducts or estimating noise levels. Another use of 3D/4D BIM is that empowers more informed decision making and better coordination between different disciplines, such as [[collision detection|'collision testing']].

'''Charles Haros''' was a [[geometer]] ([[mathematician]]) in the French [[Bureau du Cadastre]] at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century.

== Haros' conversion table ==

One of the primary tasks of the Bureau du Cadastre was the accurate [[map]]ping of [[France]] for the purpose of [[taxation]] but from time to time the bureau also provided computational services to other parts of the government.

One of the changes instituted by the [[French revolution]] was to convert France to the [[metric system]] and this necessitated changing from a fractional to a decimal representation of [[rational numbers]].  While Haros was involved many computation projects at the Bureau du Cadastre including the computation of de Prony’s tables of [[logarithms]] and the preparation of the French [[ephemeris]], [[Connaissance des Temps]], he is best known for a small table he prepared to convert fractions to their decimal equivalents.

Haros’ [[conversion table]] appeared in a tract, ''Instruction Abrégée sur les nouvelles Mesures qui dovient étre introduites dans toute république, au vendémiaire an 10; avec tables de rapports et reductions'', that was presented to the Mathematics Section of the [[Institut de France]] and subsequently abstracted in [[Journal de l'École Polytechnique]] under the title ‘’Tables pour évaluer une fraction ordinaire avec autant de decimals qu’on voudra; et pour trouver la fraction ordinaire la plus simple, et qui approche sensiblement d’une fraction décimale.‘’

In preparing his table Haros needed to create the list of all 3,003 [[Irreducible fraction|irreducible (vulgar) fractions]]  with denominators less than 100.  In order to make sure he got them all he harnessed an [[algorithm]] elucidated by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] some one-hundred and fifty years earlier.  Chuquet called it his ‘’règle des nombres moyens‘’.  Today we call it the [[Mediant (mathematics)|mediant]].  The mediant is the fraction between two fractions a/c and b/d whose [[numerator]] is the sum of the numerators, a+b, and whose [[denominator]] is the sum of the denominators, c+d.  That is, the mediant of the fractions a/c and b/d is the fraction (a+b)/(c+d).

In his paper Haros demonstrated that the mediant is always irreducible and, more importantly for this purposes, if you start with the sequence of fractions

:1/99, 1/98, 1/97, … , 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6,…, 96/97, 97/98, 98/99

and just keep applying the rule, only keeping the result if the denominator is less than one-hundred, then you generate all 3,003.

== A curious property ==

Roughly fifteen years later in [[England]], [[Henry Goodwyn]] set out to create a much more ambitious version of Haros’ table.  In particular, Goodwyn wanted to tabulate the decimal values for all [[irreducible fraction]]s with denominators less than or equal to 1,024.  There are 318,963 such fractions.  As a warm up and a test of the commercial market for such a table in 1816 he published for private circulation The First Centenary of a Series of Concise and Useful Tables of all the Complete Decimal Quotients, which can arise from dividing a unit, or any whole Number less than each Divisor by all Integers from  1 to 1024.

[[John Farey, Sr.|John Farey]] observed the mediant property in this table and mused in a letter to The [[Philosophical Magazine]] and Journal as follows:

:“I am not acquainted, whether this curious property of vulgar fractions has been before pointed out?; or whether it may admit of any easy or general demonstration ?; which are points on which I should be glad to learn the sentiments of some of your mathematical readers; …”

== (Mis)naming of the Farey sequence ==

[[Augustin Cauchy]] read Farey’s letter and published a paper “Démonstration d’un Théorème Curieux sur les Nombres” reproving Haros’ results without acknowledgement.  In his paper Cauchy referred to the mediant as “a remarkable property of ordinary fractions observed by M. J. Farey.”  Thus, an ordered sequence of all vulgar fractions with denominators less than a given value became known as a [[Farey sequence]] rather than perhaps more rightfully as either a Chuquet sequence or a Haros sequence.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2007}}

'''Commerce''' relates to "the exchange of [[goods and services]], especially on a large scale."&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite web
|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/commerce
|title=commerce 
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|quote = commerce [...] NOUN [...] ''[mass noun]'' [...] 1 The activity of buying and selling, especially on a large scale.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological [[system]]s that operate in any country or [[international trade|internationally]].

==Etymology==
The English-language word ''commerce'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''commercium'', from ''cum'' ("together") and ''merx'' ("merchandise").&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite EB1911
|wstitle= Commerce |volume= 6 |page= 766
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Caduceus.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|The [[caduceus]] - used today as the symbol of commerce,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Biedermann, James Hulbert (trans.), ''Dictionary of Symbolism - Cultural Icons and the Meanings behind Them'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and traditionally associated with the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], patron of commerce, trickery and thieves.]]

Some commentators{{which?|date=August 2018}} trace the origins of commerce to the very start of [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s in [[prehistoric]] times. Apart from traditional [[self-sufficiency]], [[trade|trading]] became a principal [[Faculty (disambiguation)|facility]] of prehistoric people, who [[barter]]ed what they had for goods and services from each other (the barter system was popular in ancient times where one could get goods and services by offering the other person some other good and service according to their need instead of paying with monetary systems, which developed later). Historian [[Peter Watson (business writer) |Peter Watson]] and Ramesh Manickam date the [[History of international trade| history of long-distance commerce]] from [[circa]] 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Watson, Peter | title= Ideas : A History of Thought and Invention from Fire to Freud | publisher= HarperCollins | year= 2005| isbn= 0-06-621064-X}} Introduction......./&lt;/ref&gt;

In historic times, the introduction of [[currency]] as a standardized [[money]] facilitated the wider exchange of goods and services. [[Numismatist]]s have collections of tokens, which include [[coin]]s from some Ancient-World large-scale societies, although initial usage involved unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gold]] served especially commonly as a form of early [[money]], as described in [http://www.ex.ac.uk/~RDavies/arian/origins.html "Origins of Money and of Banking"] - {{cite book | author= Davies, Glyn | title= Ideas: A history of money from ancient times to the present day | publisher= University of Wales Press | year= 2002| isbn= 0-7083-1717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation of a standardized currency provides a method of overcoming the major disadvantage to commerce through use of a [[barter (economics)|barter]] system, the "[[double coincidence of wants]]" (which means if someone wants something from a person, that person should also be in need of a thing or a service which they can provide), necessary for barter trades to occur. For example, if a person who makes pots for a living needs a new house, he/she may wish to hire someone to build it for him/her. But he/she cannot make an equivalent number of pots to equal this service done for him/her, because even if the builder could build the house, the builder might not want many or any pots. Also, the barter system had a major drawback in that whatever goods a person get as payment may not necessarily store for long amounts of time. For example: if a person has got dozens of fruits as his payment, he/she can't store fruit for long or they may rot - which means a person will have to bear a huge loss. Currency solved this problem by allowing a society as a whole to assign [[Value (economics) | values]]{{citation needed|date= November 2013}} and thus to collect goods and services effectively and to store them for later use, or to split them among minions.

During the [[Middle Ages]], commerce developed in Europe through the trading of luxury goods at trade [[fair]]s. Some [[wealth]] became converted into movable wealth or [[Capital (economics)|capital]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} [[Banking system]]s developed where money on account was transferred{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} across national boundaries.&lt;ref name="Howell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author= Martha C.

{{As of |2007 |alt=Today}} commerce includes as a subset of itself a complex system of [[corporation|companies]] which try to maximize their profits by offering [[product (business) |product]]s and [[Service (economics) |services]] to the [[Market (economics) |market]] (which consists both of individuals and groups and other companies or institutions) at the lowest [[production cost]]. A system of [[international trade]] has helped to develop the world economy; but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower [[tariff]]s or to achieve [[free trade]], has sometimes harmed [[Third World| third-world markets]] for local products (see [[Globalization]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10669">The '''CIOB Complex Projects Contract''' '''2013''' was a form of construction and engineering contract, developed by the [[Chartered Institute of Building]] (CIOB). Its formal name was the 'Contract for Use with Complex Projects, First Edition 2013'.

In November 2015, the Complex Projects Contract was updated by the Chartered Institute of Building in response to feedback from the industry. Despite effectively being a second edition, it was renamed the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 (abbreviated to TCM15) to reflect the core strengths of the contract.

== Launch ==
Based upon extensive research carried out by the [[Chartered Institute of Building|CIOB]],&lt;ref&gt;"Managing the Risk of Delayed Completion in the 21st Century" http://www.ciob.org/time-management&lt;/ref&gt;  the contract was formally launched on 23 April 2013. The contract was billed as the world’s first contract specifically aimed at the management of time in complex construction and engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;"The CIOB Complex Projects Contract 2013, by Keith Pickavance " http://www.thenbs.com/pdfs/NBS-NationlC&amp;LReport2013-single.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also stated that it was the first form to follow the Society of Construction Law Delay and Disruption Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;"The Society of Construction Law Delay and Disruption Protocol, 2002" {{cite web |url=http://www.scl.org.uk/scl-delay-and-disruption-protocol |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507001236/http://www.scl.org.uk/scl-delay-and-disruption-protocol |archivedate=2014-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was also the first standard form contract to cater for [[Building Information Modelling]] (BIM) and the future of collaborative design.

==Purpose==
It is suited for works of high value or complexity, major real estate projects and engineering or infrastructure projects. It is not suited to simpler works, those of short duration or with inexperienced clients /contractors. It anticipates Special Conditions for the particular requirements of each project and if using construction management as the procurement method, it cannot be used without the appropriate terms being included in the Special Conditions.

CPC2013 is designed for use by companies and public authorities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and in any other country where works comprise complex building and / or engineering, which cannot reasonably be expected to be managed intuitively. It can be used where the contractor is expected to construct only that designed by or under the direction of the client with traditional drawings, specification and/or [[bills of quantities]], or BIM, or on projects which require a contractor’s design in part, or for [[design-build]] projects in which the contractor designs the whole of the works with or without an employer’s reference design.

The contract requires a collaborative approach to the management of design, quality, time and cost. The working schedule, planning method statement and progress records (which are to be inspected and accepted by a competent project time manager and independently audited for [[quality assurance]]) are at the core of management. They are the tools by which all time and time-related cost issues are to be determined and are to conform with the standards required by the conditions, appendices and the CIOB’s Guide to Good Practice in the Management of Time in Complex Projects.&lt;ref&gt;"The Guide to Good Practice in the Management of Time in Complex Projects", Chartered Institute of Building, Wiley Blackwell 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4443-3493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration==
In order to promote collaboration and to ensure transparency of data, schedule and database submittals are to be made in native file format either by maintenance of the material in a common data environment or transfer by a [[file transfer protocol]] to all having a continuing design, administrative, or supervisory role, who are identified as Listed Persons. The contract also requires the appointment of a Contract Administrator to carry out administrative functions during the course of construction, a Project Time Manager to advise on time related matters, a Valuer to advise on cost matters, a Design Coordination Manager to manage the integration of the Contractor's design, and a Data Security Manager to supervise and maintain the integrity and security of digital communications.

==Risk management==
Central to the philosophy of the Complex Projects Contract is its approach to transparency in risk management. CPC2013 provides for both the owner and contractor each to identify one or more time [[contingency allowance]], which each can use as it wishes to manage its own risks. Unusually for a standard form construction contract, it defines [[Float (project management)|"float]]"  and provides that if either party creates free float or total float as a result of its own improvement of progress, that party may keep the created float as its own contingency. Additional powers are provided in CPC2013 to enable the construction project's developer, following consultation, to instruct acceleration, recovery and changes in resources sequences and logic in order to manage its risks contemporaneously.

==Time management==

CPC2013 is distinctive in taking a prescriptive approach to the management of time and associated cost risk and combining [[critical path method|critical path]] network techniques with resource-based planning. The time model, referred to as the Working Schedule, combines a high-density, short-term look-ahead similar in concept to that used in [[agile software development]] with medium and long-term lower density schedule along the lines of that used in the [[waterfall model]] planning technique, the whole being revised regularly on the [[Rolling Wave planning]] principle. In the short-term look-ahead, the logic is to be resource and location-related, instead of activity based, as it is in waterfall. The agile part of the schedule is to have its activity durations calculated by reference to the resources to be applied and their expected productivity.

==Cost management==
The activities in the Working Schedule are also to be valued so that the Working Schedule also functions as the [[pricing schedule]] to predict current value for the purposes of interim payment and the ultimate out-turn cost for cost risk management purposes.

==Progress records==
Progress is required to be recorded in a [[database]] identifying, at specified intervals, the resources used, productivity achieved and [[earned value]]. Apart from being the source data for subsequent progress update of the schedule, the database also serves for [[benchmarking]] productivity achievable for quality assurance of the schedule and future planning.

==Dispute resolution==
The emphasis of CPC2013 is on contemporaneous Issue Resolution by an appropriate [[expert]]. CPC2013 it also provides for an escalating Dispute Resolution procedure, embracing [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], [[adjudication]] and [[arbitration]]. Where issues are required to be determined by Issue Resolution within a certain timescale, if the procedure is not invoked there are deeming provisions which determine the outcome of an issue. If Dispute Resolution is required, the expert, adjudicator or arbitrator are either those named in the contract or, in default, they are appointed by the Academy of Experts in London&lt;ref&gt; http://www.academyofexperts.org/ &lt;/ref&gt; or the CIOB. The default adjudication rules are those of the Scheme for Construction Contracts&lt;ref&gt; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2333/contents/made&lt;/ref&gt; and the default arbitration procedure is that of the [[London Court of International Arbitration]].

==Ancillary publications==
A back-to-back Consultancy Appointment and Subcontract, both of which followed the same principles of time and cost risk management, were published in November 2015 as part of the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 suite.

== Industry reception ==
A number of reviews and commentaries have been written on the subject of the Complex Projects Contract. Some have criticized the complexity of the contract itself .&lt;ref&gt;"Complex Projects Contract 2013 - A complex solution for a complex problem" http://www.nabarro.com/Downloads/Construction-newsletter-October-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14142">The cultural influence of the [[September 11 attacks]] (9/11) has been profound and long-lasting.  The impact of 9/11 has extended beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of [[American flags]].&lt;ref name="Carducci2009b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernardo J. Carducci|title=The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gJPXv5wQbIC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=2012-01-16 |date=February 20, 2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3635-8|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative or thematic elements in [[List of audiovisual entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks|film, television, music and literature]]. Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected [[post-9/11]] cultural concerns.&lt;ref name=popCultureGuid&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Quay | first1 = Sara | last2 = Damico | first2 = Amy | title = September 11 in Popular Culture: A Guide | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | date = September 14, 2010 | isbn = 978-0-313-35505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- "STOP. Before expanding or removing 9/11 conspiracy theories, please note that the verbiage being used was arrived at after months of discussion and consensus-building. If you think something should be changed, please start a discussion on the article talk page. Thank you." --&gt; [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from scientists, engineers, and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=9/11 conspiracy theories won't stop|first=Joshua|last=Norman|date=September 11, 2011|journal=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/11/national/main20104377.shtml|publisher=CBS Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  9/11 has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals; for some it strengthened, to find [[consolation]] to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely, because they [[problem of evil|could not reconcile it]] with their view of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/29/september-11-challenged-faith_n_941017.html|title=After 9/11, Some Run Toward Faith, Some Run The Other Way|author=Huffington Post|date=August 29, 2011|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/faith/questions/god.html|title=Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero – The Question of God|author= PBS Frontline|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of the United States succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as [[paranoia]] and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200201/anxiety-after-911 |title=Anxiety After 9/11 |author=Brad Schmidt, Ph.d. |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the significance of the attacks, media coverage was extensive, including disturbing live pictures, and prolonged discourse about the attacks in general, resulting in [[iconography]] and greater meaning associated with the event. [[Don DeLillo]] called it "the defining event of our time".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The attacks spawned a number of catchphrases, terms, and slogans, many of which continue to be used more than a decade later.

==Media response==
Through an endless reproductions in [[mass media]] and [[popular culture]] the attacks have an important cultural meaning for many people: "The attacks percolate as a central theme or historical backdrop in countless works of art, which bear witness to the complexity of 9/11 as historical, political, and media event, and contribute to the negotiation of its cultural meaning." &lt;ref&gt;Bauder-Begerow, Irina; Stefanie Schäfer. "Learning 9/11." ''Learning 9/11''. Ed. Bauder-Begerow, Irina; Stefanie Schäfer. Memmingen: Winter Verlag, 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-8253-5941-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the attacks of 9/11 and [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] Arthur G. Neal said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"[W]e create the world through our perceptions of it and seek to maintain that world in a manner consistent with our beliefs about it. It is through such symbolic constructions that we are provided with usable frameworks for shaping our memories and organizing them into coherent systems of meaning."''&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Arthur G. ''National Trauma and Collective Memory: Extraordinary Events in the American Experience''. M.E. Sharpe: London, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0765615824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Influence on Comic Books ===
American comic books have always carried patriotic tones, especially during the cold war—perhaps the most notable example is the character [[Captain America]]. 9/11 shifted the political climate and with it re-centered the public's attention on Muslims. Perhaps the most mainstream example of the influence 9/11 had on comic books is Iron Man, who was previously an anti-communist crusader; his canon was rewritten in comics after 9/11 and in the widely popular 2008 film [[Iron Man]]. In the film billionaire [[Tony Stark]] learns his weapons were sold without his knowledge to various terrorist groups after he was kidnapped and tortured in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Pumphrey, N 2016, 'Avenger, Mutant, or Allah: A Short Evolution of the Depiction of Muslims in Marvel Comics', Muslim World, 106, 4, pp. 781-794, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, viewed 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The September 11 attacks gained an iconographic meaning. This was due to the fact that the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] were portrayed as symbolic buildings representing American financial power, and [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]] was portrayed as a symbolic building representing American military power. Backed up by the media and literature, many people see 9/11 as an attack on the economic and military power of America.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, Marcel. ''Die Traumatisierte Nation?''. Transcript Verlag: Bielefeld, 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-8376-1742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the attacks are often pictured as a symbol for an era of war and terrorism.

==Jargon inspired by 9/11==
;Nine-eleven or 9/11: in the U.S. date notation for September 11.  The practice of referring to ominous dates through this shorthand has continued, for example, with 7/7 for the [[2005 London bombings]].&lt;ref name="bingi_images"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=nine-eleven|title=nine-eleven - Bing Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="librarypoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.librarypoint.org/taxonomy/term/3023|title=Nine Eleven|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107010756/http://history.librarypoint.org/taxonomy/term/3023|archivedate=2015-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="911forum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911forum.org.|title=911forum.org|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119154711/http://911forum.org/|archivedate=2015-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="911commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9-11commission.gov/|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/9-11-the-10th-anniversary | location=London | work=The Guardian | date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in English-speaking countries which typically use a different date format to The U.S. "month/day/year", the event is still commonly referred to as "Nine-eleven". For example, "Nine-eleven" will tend to be used in everyday speech in the United Kingdom, despite how British people would otherwise write September 11th as "11/09".
;Pre-9/11 and [[Post-9/11]]: Terms used to describe the period of time and the state of the world before and after the attack, regarding 9/11 as an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. They are often used to denote foreign policy and domestic security measures as they existed before or after the attacks.
;[[Ground zero|Ground Zero]]: ''Ground zero'' is a generic term for the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation. Capitalized, it is shorthand for the World Trade Center site; used, for example, in "Ground Zero mosque", a pejorative for the [[Park51|Cordoba House or Park51]] Islamic center.
;The Bathtub:the excavated foundations of the World Trade Center. Although not a new term, it gained prominence during rescue, cleanup and ongoing reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5837791/how-new-york-city-built-a-massive-underground-transit-station-in-the-wtcs-footprints|title=How New York City Built a Massive $3.8 Billion Underground Transit Station in the WTC's Footprints|author=Andrew Tarantola|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Jumper (suicide)|Jumper]]:A [[jumper (suicide)|jumper]] is someone who commits [[suicide]] by jumping from a height. It is unclear which of the "jumpers" seen falling from the WTC had jumped and which fell while trying to climb to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035720/9-11-jumpers-America-wants-forget-victims-fell-Twin-Towers.html|title=9/11 jumpers: America wants to forget victims who fell from Twin Towers|last=Leonard|first=Tom|date=11 September 2011|work=[[Mail Online]]|accessdate=20 November 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical examiner's office ruled [[homicide]] for [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks#World Trade Center|all bodies]], unable to distinguish jumpers from those who died inside the towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-02-jumper_x.htm|title=Desperation forced a horrific decision|last=Cauchon|first=Dennis|author2=Martha Moore |date=2 September 2002|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Falling Man]]" is an iconic photograph of a jumper.
;"[[Let's roll]]": reported to have been uttered by [[United Airlines Flight 93|Flight 93]] passenger [[Todd Beamer]] shortly before he and fellow passengers apparently rushed the cockpit.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;[[Let's roll]]  (Note: Wikipedia is not ordinarily used as a reference; however this article is well-referenced and ''its references'' support the statement here.)&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Force Protection Condition|FPCON Delta]]: the highest state of terrorist alert issued by the [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]]

=== Media slogans ===
Various slogans and captions were employed by media outlets to [[brand]] coverage of the September 11th terrorist attack, its after effects, and the [[United States|U.S.]] government response. The slogans for American media were typically positioned on the bottom third of television broadcasts, or as banners across the top of newspaper pages. Designs typically incorporated a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] red, white, and blue motif, along with an explicit graphic of the American flag. Examples include:

* "America Attacked", "A Nation United" ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]])
* "Attack on America" ([[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]])
* "A Nation Challenged", "Day of Terror", "Portraits of Grief" ([[The New York Times]])
* "America's New War", "War Against Terror", "America under Attack" ([[CNN]])
* "War on Terror" ([[Fox News]])
* "America on Alert", "America under Attack" ([[MSNBC]])
* "The Second Pearl Harbor" ([[Honolulu Advertiser]])

'''Dangerous Mathematicians''' is an American fashion business founded by Karen Patwa in 2005 and based in Brooklyn, New York.  The company designs and sells lesbian wedding suits which blend the masculine elements of a tuxedo with the feminine qualities of a dress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weddingprideny.com/stories/2013/3/wp_suits_2013_bk_2013_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerous Mathematicians’ name is based on Patwa’s career as a math and physics instructor.&lt;ref&gt;http://thebrooklynink.com/2010/03/23/9392-the-most-dangerous-designer-in-brooklyn/&lt;/ref&gt; Geometric principles from math and science serve as sources of inspiration for Dangerous Mathematicians designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://50.56.218.160/archive/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=33744|title=Designer Brings Math-Inspired Clothing Home to Brooklyn|website=50.56.218.160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dangerous Mathematicians first opened its store in 2006 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The company originally offered ready made and bespoke professional attire options for “smart women.” &lt;ref&gt;http://authenticorganizations.com/harquail/2010/04/06/capturing-authenticity-in-your-business-name-dangerous-mathematicians/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2008/52925/index5.html|title=24. Because Our Schoolteachers Are Such Prim Homebodies|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Rivington Street location frequently hosted themed parties for its clientele featuring photoshoots, fashion shows and math contests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brynmawr.edu/alumnae/bulletin/nov10/cf.html&lt;/ref&gt; Patwa designed her first women’s wedding suit in 2007.

In 2010, the company relocated to Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, in an area where there are many small boutiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704852004575258583234726118 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sushil | last=Cheema | title=Boerum Hill Packs Variety in a Leafy Pocket | date=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an increase in demand for wedding suits after [[Same-sex marriage in New York|the legalization of gay marriage in New York]] in June 2012, Dangerous Mathematicians' head designer Patwa created a line exclusively geared towards lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/happy-anniversary-article-1.1119445 |title=Happy anniversary! |publisher=NY Daily News |date= 2012-07-22|accessdate=2013-10-30 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Dangerous Mathematicians has evolved to focus exclusively on bespoke women’s suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell |first=Andy |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/boerum_hill_has_new_place_to_get_GG4oqYVnM1lVcqxUYafGBK |title=Boerum Hill has a new place to get suited up &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and Competitors==

Dangerous Mathematicians has been featured in a variety of gay-oriented publications such as Wedding Pride, Rainbow Wedding Network, and Huff Post Gay Voices. More recently, other women’s suit businesses have introduced themselves to the market, such as Fourteen, Tomboy Tailors, and St. Harridan.

'''Facilitated communication''' ('''FC'''), '''supported typing''' or '''hand over hand''', is a discredited technique&lt;ref name="Autism Wars"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Autism Wars: Science Strikes Back |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/autism_wars_science_strikes_back |website=Skeptical Inquirer Online |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; used by some caregivers and educators in an attempt to assist people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The technique involves providing an alphabet board, or keyboard. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move their hand and amplify their gestures.

Some promoters of the technique have countered that FC cannot be clearly disproven by testing, since a testing environment might feel confrontational and alienating to the subject.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (1993)" /&gt; Because the [[scientific consensus]] is that FC is a [[pseudoscience]] which causes great risk and emotional distress to people with communication disabilities, their families, and their caregivers, the technique is now rejected outside a few fringe groups and organizations, including [[Syracuse University]] in the United States.

Facilitated communication is promoted as a means to assist people with severe communication disabilities in pointing to letters on an alphabet board, keyboard or other device so that they can communicate independently.

The person with disabilities, who is often not able to rely on speech to communicate, is referred to as the ''communication partner''. The caregiver, educator or other provider offering physical support to the person with disabilities is called the ''facilitator''. The facilitator holds or gently touches the communication partner's elbow, wrist, hand, sleeve or other parts of the body&lt;ref name="Biklen, Douglas (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biklen|first1=Douglas|title=Communication Unbound: Autism and Praxis|journal=Harvard Educational Review|date=1990|volume=60|pages=291–314|doi=10.17763/haer.60.3.013h5022862vu732|issue=3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 18, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while the communication partner points to letters of the alphabet printed on a piece of paper or laminated cardboard,&lt;ref name="Schwiegert, Mary Beth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwiegert|first1=Mary Beth|title=Will to succeed Lititz man battles autism - and goes to college|work=Lancaster New Era|date=28 December 2000|location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania|page=D-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; letters on an alphabet board, laptop, keyboard or mobile communication device such as an iPad.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Marshall, Todd, Shane (2015)" /&gt;

Proponents of FC claim that motor issues (e.g., the [[Neurological disorder|neurological condition]] of [[apraxia]]) prevent people with autism from communicating effectively. Although this claim is unsubstantiated (many people with autism have no difficulty pointing to or picking up objects independently, but do exhibit severe communication difficulties characteristic of the disorder),&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Marshall, Todd, Shane (2015)" /&gt; proponents argue that physical support and touch are necessary components of communicating through FC. Candidates for FC, presumably, "lack confidence in their abilities"&lt;ref name="Biklen, Douglas (1990)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt; and physical support, purportedly, helps them overcome this obstacle to communication.

The role of the facilitator is depicted by proponents as integral to helping the person with disabilities point to letters (by holding his or her finger or hand), reducing or eliminating uncontrollable arm movements (shaking or flapping), avoiding mistakes in typing, controlling the initiation of movement,&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Mulick, Schwartz (1995)" /&gt; and speaking words aloud.&lt;ref name="Schwiegert, Mary Beth" /&gt; As well as physical support in typing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support.&lt;ref name="Mangiacasale, Angela"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mangiacasale|first1=Angela|title=New voice: system lets disabled communicate|work=The Ottawa Citizen|issue=Final Edition|date=January 23, 1992|page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mostert, Mark (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mostert|first1=Mark P.|authorlink=Mark Mostert|title=Facilitated Communication: The empirical imperative to prevent further professional malpractice|journal=Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention|date=18 June 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1080/17489539.2012.693840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Tetzchner|first1=Stephen|title=Historical issues in intervention research: hidden knowledge and facilitating techniques in Denmark|journal=European Journal of Disorders of Communication|date=1997|volume=32|pages=1–18|doi=10.3109/13682829709021453|pmid=9135710|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenbaum, Kurt (1992)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenbaum|first1=Kurt|title=Autistic Method Disputed Researcher Says Child Not Helped|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=September 27, 1992|location=Fort Lauderdale, Florida|page=8B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with human touch, the facilitator's belief in their communication partner's ability to communicate is seen to be a key component of the technique.&lt;ref name="Kim, Rose (1992)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Rose|title=The magic touch keyboard technique helps severely disabled students learn to communicate|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-17/news/mn-480_1_severely-disabled-students|accessdate=March 18, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|issue=Home Edition|date=17 June 1992|location=Los Angeles, California|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Gina|title=An ecobehavioral interpretation of the facilitated communication phenomenon|journal=Psychology in Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities|date=Fall 1995|volume=21|issue=2|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Libman, Gary (1992)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Libman|first1=Gary|title=A controversial technique may be the key to providing sufferers with a way to communicate unlocking autism|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-17/news/vw-788_1_facilitated-communication|accessdate=March 18, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|issue=Home Edition|date=17 November 1992|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostert of Regent University School of Education in Virginia Beach, Virginia, reported in the second of his comprehensive reviews of peer-reviewed literature investigating FC that "Facilitated Communication (FC) had largely been empirically discredited as an effective intervention for previously uncommunicative persons with disabilities, especially those with autism and related disorders. Key empirical findings consistently showed that the facilitator and not the client initiated communication."&lt;ref name="Mostert, Mark P. (2010)" /&gt;

Many people believed FC had passed its peak,&lt;ref name="Oswald, Donald P.

Such assumptions increasingly morph FC into a valid intervention among readers who are unaware of the empirical dismissal of the intervention and who might not be skilled in distinguishing solid from suspect research. In this regard, it is likely that FC will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners. These perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the Facilitated Communication Institute at Syracuse University, a fairly wide acceptance of FC internationally, and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful.&lt;ref name="Mostert, Mark P.

==RPM==
{{Main|Rapid prompting method}}
Facilitated communication is closely related to the [[rapid prompting method]] (RPM), although proponents of RPM deny similarities with FC because the aide or facilitator in RPM holds the letter board but "does not touch the person typing"&lt;ref name="Chandler, Michael (March 2017)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandler|first1=Michael Alison|title=The key to unlock their autistic son's voice|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-washington-post/20170301/281487866131617|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=March 1, 2017|location=Washington, D.C.|page=A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the prompts are "nonspecific."&lt;ref name="Beach, Patrick (January 2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beach|first1=Patrick|title=Understanding Tito|work=Austin Statesman|date=January 20, 2008|location=Austin, Texas|page=J.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics of RPM point out that subtle cuing takes place during RPM that makes it "highly susceptible to facilitator influence."&lt;ref name="Chandler, Michael (March 2017)"/&gt;

Other similarities between RPM and FC include: reluctance or refusal to test facilitator/client pairs in controlled settings (purportedly because the process breaks the trust between the pair), presumed competence, reliance on anecdotal accounts as proof of efficacy, maintenance of practices, techniques and claims that are inconsistent with the known body of work around the behavior and communication skills of individuals with developmental disabilities or proven remediation techniques, claims of extraordinary literacy or intellectual breakthroughs, unconscious verbal or physical cuing by facilitators to obtain the expected responses, inadequate or non-existent protocols to fade supported or facilitated prompts.&lt;ref name="Tostanoski et al (August 2014)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tostanoski|first1=Amy|last2=Lang|first2=Russell|last3=Raulston|first3=Tracy|last4=Carnett|first4=Amarie|last5=Davis|first5=Tonya|title=Voices from the past: Comparing the rapid prompting method and facilitated communication|journal=Developmental Neurorehabilitation|date=August 2014|volume=17|issue=4|pages=219–223|doi=10.3109/17518423.2012.749952|pmid=24102487|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd, James (Rapid Prompting)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Todd|first1=James|title=Rapid Prompting|journal=Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders|pages=2497–2503|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_1896|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4419-1697-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The question of authorship==
[[File:Anne McDonald Centre.jpg|thumb|The Anne McDonald Centre, a centre for FC use in Melbourne directed by [[Rosemary Crossley]].]]
One of the central questions regarding facilitated communication is who is really doing the communicating.&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Mulick, Schwartz (1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Libman, Gary (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter, Kayla" /&gt; The ultimate goal of using such a technique, as suggested by Stephen Von Tetzchner, professor of psychology at the University of Oslo, is ''genuine ''communication'', in which the messages obtained through FC originate from the person with disabilities'' and are not, in any way, influenced by the facilitator. However, as von Tetzchner also points out, there are two other potential outcomes of FC: 
# ''automatic communication'', in which the messages are produced by the facilitator without the communication partner's awareness (similar to [[automatic writing]]); and
# ''false communication'', in which the messages are consciously produced by the facilitator to further his or her own goals.&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)" /&gt;

===Proponents===
Facilitators using the technique reported unexpected literacy skills in people otherwise thought to be nonverbal, illiterate and incapable of learning more than basic life skills.&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim, Rose (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballon, Diana (1992)" /&gt; They proposed that FC unlocked the thoughts and feelings of moderately to severely impaired individuals inaccessible by traditional means.&lt;ref name="Dineen, Janice (1991)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballon, Diana (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, Molly T.

===Critics===
People more critical of the technique noticed that, while the facilitators were intent on watching the letter board, their communication partners were often distracted, staring off into space, rolling around on the floor while facilitating,&lt;ref name="Greenbaum, Kurt (1992)" /&gt; falling asleep,&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt; or otherwise not paying attention.&lt;ref name="Schwiegert, Mary Beth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stengle, Bernice" /&gt;  Sometimes the communication partners spoke words that conflicted with the words being typed.  The language structures and vocabulary used by children being facilitated often exceeded what would normally be considered appropriate for their age and experience.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (1993)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palfreman |first1=Jon |authorlink1=Jon Palfreman |title=Frontline: Prisoners of Silence|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1202.html|website=PBS.org|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|accessdate=March 18, 2015|date=October 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly highly competent individuals gave wrong answers to simple questions or information that should have been readily known (e.g. the name of the family dog, the names of family members, the spelling of their own name).&lt;ref name="Biklen, Douglas (1990)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MH021692&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Heinrichs|title=Suffering at the hands of the protectors|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/suffering-at-the-hands-of-the-protectors-20090821-esuq|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=The Sunday Morning Herald|date=February 16, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others questioned why people with autism who exhibit excellent fine motor skills needed to have physical support from facilitators in order to point to a keyboard while many people with autism type independently.&lt;ref name="Healey, Michelle (2011)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Healey|first1=Michelle|title=New film gives voice to a nearly silent minority|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2011-04-07-autism07_ST_U.htm|accessdate=March 18, 2015|work=Gannett News|date=6 April 2011|page=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While proponents insist that FC "should never involve guiding a person as he or she attempts to point or type,"&lt;ref name="Gardner, Martin" /&gt; facilitators can and do influence facilitated movements without realizing it. Gina Green, director of research for the New England Center for Autism in Massachusetts, E.K. Shriver Center for Mental Retardation, and Northeastern University,&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillow, Gordon (1993)" /&gt; stated: "Very subtle influence can affect people's behavior. It doesn't even have to be touch. It can be the slightest sound, the slightest visual cue." And, in regards to videotapes in which it appears the person with autism is typing independently, "You can edit videotape and show whatever you want. They'll show you a close-up of the finger moving across the keyboard...but you're not getting what else is going on."&lt;ref
name="Mann, Lisa Barrett (2005)" /&gt;

Researchers James Mulick, John Jacobson and Frank Kobe states that the medical community can offer "a bewildering ... and conflicting information" to "parents who hear that their child has a significant disability... the anguish is profound". A "miracle cure from Australia" such as FC can use this stress and grief to promote a belief in FC. The only evidence of success are "transcripts of apparent conversational content". These families are used "... (to) stroke their hopes with empty promises, regardless of their sincerity, while reaping personal or political rewards and working hard to prevent systematic verification of their claims". The researchers go on to say that "people with handicaps can be valued members of their families and communities without resorting to appeals to miracle cures". Scientific and genuine help are available, "advances in treatment and understanding come at the price of rigorous training, dedication to accuracy and scientific standards, and objective verification of all treatment claims".&lt;ref name="Mulick et all"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulick|first1=James|last2=Jacobson|first2=John|last3=Kobe|first3=Frank|title=Anguished Silence and Helping Hands: Autism and Facilitated Communication|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1993|volume=17|issue=3|pages=270–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Mirenda, professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology and Special Education at the University of British Columbia and co-author David R. Beukelman, Barkley Professor of Communication Disorders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, decided not to include FC in revised versions of their textbook ''Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs. ''Earlier versions of the textbook are quoted in pro-FC literature. In 2015, Mirenda stated, "I came to recognize (painfully, to be honest) that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what I saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible (e.g., subtle prompting, resulting in an ideomotor effect), and that, even if independent typing did occur subsequent to FC exposure, only correlational—but definitely not causal—evidence exists with regard to its relationship to FC. In short, I do not endorse FC as a communication or instructional technique, and I do not support its use."&lt;ref name="Mirenda, Pat (2015)" /&gt;

Calculator of the University of New Hampshire, an early proponent of FC who also distanced himself from the movement because he could not replicate claims of independent communication in his own research studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calculator|first1=S|last2=Hatch|first2=E|title=Validation of facilitated communication: A case study and beyond.|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|date=1995|volume=4|pages=49–58|issn=1058-0360|doi=10.1044/1058-0360.0401.49|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; summed up the importance of determining the extent of facilitator influence: "The consequences of falsely attributing messages to communicators, rather than facilitators, continue to have significant financial, social and moral ramifications. Facilitators must take extraordinary precautions to assure that they are not unduly influencing messages and thereby impinging on communicators' freedom of speech.

Janyce Boynton, who at one time was a strong proponent of the use of FC, is now one of FC’s leading critics.  In the early 1990s, Ms. Boynton was the facilitator for a non-speaking high school girl with autism who, through FC with Ms. Boynton, described having been sexually abused by her parents, resulting in the girl and her brother being removed from the parents' home.   Systematic testing by [[Howard Shane]] revealed, however, that the girl was incapable of being the author of the messages (see The Wheaton Case below and the description of the case in the 1993 PBS [[Frontline]] documentary “Prisoners of Silence”). Unlike many in the FC-proponent community (e.g., [[Douglas Biklin]]), Ms. Boynton accepted the clear evidence from this testing (and from other well controlled scientific studies) that indicated that FC was not a valid assisted communication technique. She stopped using FC, convinced her school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use, and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with. More recently, she has maintained a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about FC, and has served as one of the leaders of a group of professionals who successfully convinced the University of Northern Iowa to cease their sponsorship of an annual workshop that had included instruction in FC.&lt;ref name="Vyse 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Autism Wars: Science Strikes Back |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/autism_wars_science_strikes_back |website=CSI online |publisher=Center for Scientific Inquiry |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by another member of that group (Stuart Vyse), “this is just the beginning. There are a number of other universities and governmental organizations that tacitly or explicitly endorse FC and/or its related techniques, and Ms. Boynton and her allies have their eyes on a number of these future targets”, including the University of Syracuse (home to the FC-supporting Institute on Communication and Inclusion).&lt;ref name="Vyse 1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=An Artist with a Science-Based Mission |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_artist_with_a_science-based_mission |website=CSI Online |publisher=Center for Inquiry |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying in the Anna Stubblefield court case, psychology professor James Todd stated in court (FC) "It's become the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities." Every "methodologically sound" study of FC has shown it invalid.&lt;ref name=Wichert/&gt; Writing about that case in the journal "Disability and Society", Mark Sherry voiced similar concerns about FC's lack of scientific validity, calling it a "sham", "hoax" and a "fraud." Sherry's was the first article published in a Disability Studies journal which thoroughly critiqued Stubblefield's actions—a noteworthy contribution because Stubblefield had also been in Disability Studies and had previously published about FC in the journal ''Disability Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1729|title=Sound and Fury: When Opposition to Facilitated Communication Functions as Hate Speech|date=25 October 2011|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|volume=31|issue=4|doi=10.18061/dsq.v31i4.1729 | last1 = Stubblefield | first1 = Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherry suggested that some of the defenders of Stubblefield (and FC more broadly) are either her personal friends or work in institutions which receive substantial income from providing FC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09687599.2016.1218152 | volume=31 | issue=7 | title=Facilitated communication, Anna Stubblefield and disability studies | year=2016 | journal=Disability &amp; Society | pages=974–982 | last1 = Sherry | first1 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editorial for the [[Syracuse University]] newspaper called it "inexcusable" and "embarrassing" that the University continues to support FC after over 25 years of research has discredited it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Editorial Board|title=Syracuse University's reinforcement of facilitated communication inexcusable, concerning|url=http://dailyorange.com/2016/04/syracuse-universitys-reinforcement-of-facilitated-communication-inexcusable-concerning/|website=The Daily Orange|publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=13 April 2016|date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Stuart Vyse writes that in some cases of autism, parents reject the autism diagnosis and "claim their children have a physical -- rather than a developmental -- disability". With FC or RPM their diagnosis is confirmed. Their child with the help of a facilitator communicates with the parent revealing that they can speak oftentimes at levels beyond their age. Vyse states that the "overwhelming evidence ... shows that it is the adult facilitator... communicating ... It is a Ouija-like phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=The Enduring Legend of the Changeling |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=23–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests of authorship===

Mostert wrote in 2001, "FC proponents must be encouraged to subject their claims to further scientific verification, the claims of anecdotal evidence notwithstanding.

(1993)" /&gt; As Julie Riggot wrote in an article for ''[[Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice]]'', "Sometimes, the influence of the facilitator is less obvious, because the facilitator might not hold the person's hand, but support an arm or touch a shoulder--or even simply observe the typing."&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt; Because cueing is often subtle and is not possible to observe the influence of the facilitator in all instances where it might occur, naked-eye, informal observations and facilitator reports have proven unreliable in determining authorship.&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt; Many facilitators deny they are in any way influencing their communication partners' movements, even when faced with evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt;

In 2006, [[Rom Houben]] was initially hailed by Belgian neurologist [[Steven Laureys]] for his ability to type out thoughts on a keypad, via the help of his facilitator Linda Wouters. However, "when concerns were raised regarding the veracity of his messages, independent tests were carried out: Houben was shown a range of objects and asked to name them. When Houben was unable to name any of the objects shown to him when Wouters had not been in the room, Laureys accepted that Houben had not been responsible for any of the messages, and conceded that FC – in all its flawed promise and false hope – was responsible for Houben’s apparent cogency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Michael|authorlink1=Michael Marshall (skeptic)|last2=French|first2=Christopher|authorlink2=Chris French|title=Why communication from a 'locked-in' child is a miracle we must question|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/feb/05/why-communication-from-a-locked-in-child-is-a-miracle-we-must-question|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1992)" /&gt; stories of FC's purported success were reported (and continue to be reported) in magazines such as ''[[Reader's Digest]]'',&lt;ref name="Gardner, Martin" /&gt; in movies&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann, Lisa Barrett (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Healey, Michelle (2011)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray, Steve"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Steve|title=The world of autism as seen from the inside|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|issue=Home Edition|date=May 21, 2005|page=Living; 3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe, Bruce (1994)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCabe|first1=Bruce|title=Autism and feelings|work=Boston Globe|issue=City Edition|date=16 October 1994| location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shales, Tom"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shales|first1=Tom|title=Third-place CBS hauls out yet another lame movie on Sunday|work=Buffalo News|issue=City Edition| date=14 October 1994|location=Buffalo, New York|page=C10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays,&lt;ref name="Ruth, Jim (2001)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruth|first1=Jim|title=Will to survive Autistic man's struggle mirrors a new drama|work=Sunday News| date=January 2001|location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania|page=H-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on television shows such as ABC's [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']] Prime Time Live with [[Diane Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mostert, Mark (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ECE/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman, Brian J.

Of FC's rapid rise in popularity, particularly in the United States, doctors John W. Jacobson, James A. Mulick, and Allen A. Schwartz wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The general acceptance of FC by the public and segments of the professional community has called into question the rigor with which educational and therapeutic interventions are evaluated in publicly funded programs and the ability of many professionals to critically assess the procedures they use. As such, FC serves as a case study in how the public and, alarmingly, some professionals, fail to recognize the role of science in distinguishing truth from falsity and its applicability to assessing the value of treatment modalities.&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Mulick, Schwartz (1995)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[James Randi]], a magician familiar with the [[ideomotor effect]] commonly attributed to [[dowsing]] and later linked to FC,&lt;ref name="Spitz, Herman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess, et al (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Burgess|first1=Cheryl A.|last2=Kirsch|first2=Irving|last3=Shane|first3=Howard C.| last4=Niederauer|first4=Kristen L.|last5=Graham|first5=Steven M.|last6=Bacon|first6=Alyson| title=Facilitated Communication as an Ideomotor Response|journal= Psychological Science| date=January 1998|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–74| doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00013}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 19, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; put it more succinctly when he called facilitated communication "a crock that does more harm than good by raising false hopes among families of autistic children" after he was called in to investigate the technique at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1992.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum, Kurt (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner, Martin" /&gt; The [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] has offered a million-dollar prize "to a valid demonstration of facilitated communication." In 2009, Randi responded in an interview for the [[Rom Houben]] case, where it was shown that messages from a Belgian man who was believed to be in a coma for 23 years were generated by the facilitator, "Our prize is still there."&lt;ref name="Keim, Brandon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keim|first1=Brandon|title=Reborn Coma Man's Words May Be Bogus|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/11/houben-communication/|journal=Wired|accessdate= March 19, 2015|date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
This issue of testing the messages obtained through FC has, historically, been problematic for those in the FC community who support its use. Proponents claim that testing is demeaning to the disabled person,&lt;ref name="Biklen, Douglas (1990)" /&gt; that the testing environment creates performance anxiety,&lt;ref name="Goldman, Daniel (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kogan, Rick (1993)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=The FC Movement Treatment for autism looks dim on 'Frontline'|work=Chicago Tribune|issue=North Sports Final Edition| date=19 October 1993|location=Chicago, Illinois|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that those being facilitated may purposely produce nonsense, refuse to respond or give wrong answers to counteract the negative attitudes of those who are skeptical of the technique.&lt;ref name="Crossley, Remington-Gurney (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crossley|first1=Rosemary|last2=Remington-Gurney|first2=Jane| title=Getting the words out: Facilitated communication training|journal=Topics in Language Disorders| date=August 1992|volume=12|issue=4|pages=29–45|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ451558|accessdate=March 19, 2015|doi=10.1097/00011363-199208000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations by researchers attending an FC class in 1993 were that the "client" did not always look at the keyboard, and that ''physical force'' was used to "prevent movement of the learner's hand away from the keyboard" eventually, they learned the "patient" through FC "will thank you for doing so" and only open ended questions were asked, never factual questions. They were told that "one should just be receptive to what is produced".&lt;ref name="Mulick et all"/&gt; In 1992, when FC was fairly new to the United States, Douglas Biklen was quoted in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as saying he "welcomed scientific studies", but the reporter, Amanda Spake, went on to explain: &lt;blockquote&gt;he doesn't want to do them. He's an educator, not a psychiatrist, and like other educators who have written about facilitated communication, he is comfortable with the fact that there is often a lag time between the application of a new method and its scientific validation.&lt;ref name="Spake, Amanda (1992)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in arguing against suggestions that FC may be difficult or impossible to objectively test, James T. Todd, psychologist from [[Eastern Michigan University]], wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;the determination of authorship in FC involves a straightforward application of basic experimental methods described comprehensively by Mill (1843) more than a century and half ago, but understood for millennia. We are not speaking of obscure or controversial techniques. We are speaking of authorship validation by selectively presenting different information to two people then observing what is produced.&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Double-blind testing===
Despite the FC community's reluctance to participate in testing, researchers outside the community did set up double-blind testing in an attempt to identify in a controlled way who was doing the communicating. Some testing was conducted as a direct response to a growing number of cases involving sexual abuse allegations that have plagued users of FC, including Crossley, made through the use of facilitated communication against parents, teachers, and caregivers of people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickerson, Brian (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shane, Kearns (1994)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shane|first1=Howard C.|last2=Kearns|first2=Kevin|title=An Examination of the Role of the Facilitator in "Facilitated Communication"|journal=American Journal of SpeechLanguage Pathology|date=September 1994|volume=3|pages=48–54| url=http://ajslp.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1774447|accessdate=March 19, 2015|doi=10.1044/1058-0360.0303.48|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twachtman-Cullen"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Twachtman-Cullen|first1=Diane|title=A Passion to Believe|date=August 1997| publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0-813-39098-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twachtman-Cullen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seebach, Linda (2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seebach|first1=Linda| title=Charlatans to the rescue|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122212979072465559|accessdate= March 19, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|issue=Eastern Edition|date=23 September 2008|location=New York, New York|page=A.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of controlled evaluations of FC were conducted by clinicians, researchers, and program administrators who were considering the use of FC, but wanted an objective, empirical basis for deciding what role, if any, FC would have in their programs.&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;

The O.D. Heck Center in Schenectady, New York was one of the first in the United States to go public with their findings,&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;  which were that their clients produced meaningful responses through facilitated communication only when their facilitators had access to the correct responses.&lt;ref name=ECE/&gt; The report went on to virtually rule out issues of confidence or skepticism on the part of the evaluators. All twelve participants (people with disabilities) were chosen for the evaluation because their facilitators believed in their ability to communicate through FC. The study demonstrated that the communication partners were "systematically and unknowingly" being influenced by their facilitators. The researchers wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced, but was controlled and determined by the facilitators. To all appearances, these participants had been producing thoughtful communication, and several had consistently engaged in interactive conversations using facilitated communication. Many people serving these individuals believed that this output reflected the valid expressions of the participants.&lt;ref name="Boodman, Sandra (1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Jacobson, Paglieri, Schwartz (1993)"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jacobson|first2=John W.|last3=Paglieri|first3=Raymond A.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Allen A.|date=February 1993|title=An experimental Assessment of Facilitated Communication|journal=American Association on Mental Retardation|volume=31|issue=1|pages=49–60|pmid=8441353|last1=Wheeler|first1=Douglas L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The result of the O.D. Heck study seemed so startling, especially in light of the positive response FC was getting in the popular press, that ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' featured the story in its 1993 "Prisoners of Silence".&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific Review (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuff, John Haslett (1993)" /&gt; In 1993, Genae A. Hall, research director for the Behavior Analysis Center for Autism, wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called "facilitator influence," which seems to be a misnomer. "Facilitator influence" suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior, and the facilitator is exerting partial control (or "influence") over that behavior. Although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs, such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of FC. Rather than influencing the typed messages, the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages. Thus, the focus of analysis is shifted from the disabled person's behavior to the facilitator's behavior.&lt;ref name="Hall, Genae (1993)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The O.D. Heck study was not the only double blind research study to receive such results. In fact, multiple studies had been conducted to determine authorship before or around the same time as the O.D. Heck study.&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt; Whenever conditions were adequately controlled to prevent the facilitator from knowing the answers to questions presented to the disabled communication partner, the results revealed facilitator influence, if not direct authorship.&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich, Paul (February 1992)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heinrich|first1=Paul|title=State 'tortured' family - Landmark case finds experts' naivety 'tragic'|work=Sunday Age|issue=Late Edition| date=February 16, 1992|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Thistledown Regional Centre in Ontario, Canada conducted an internal study of 20 people with autism and stopped using FC when the results showed facilitator influence was "contaminating the messages being produced."&lt;ref name="Papp, Leslie (1996)" /&gt; By 1995, these results had been replicated by researchers worldwide in at least 24 studies in credible, peer-reviewed research journals using "a variety of methods to see what happens when the facilitator doesn't know or can't guess the message that is expected or doesn't look at the letter display."&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt;

In 1997, reflecting on the trajectory FC has taken in several countries, including Denmark, the U.S. and Australia, von Tetzchner wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the struggle to keep up to date with an increasing number of published papers, both researchers and practitioners tend to forget history. In order to avoid making the same mistakes over again, the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques--as well as other intervention methods--in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews. When an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears, the likely reason is lack of positive results.&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;By 2005, more than 50 controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted, in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases. The studies consistently showed "without a doubt" that the messages obtained through facilitated communication were controlled by the facilitators and not their communication partners.&lt;ref name="Riggott, Julie" /&gt;

==Support from University of Northern Iowa==

In October 2018, Provost Jim Wohlpart disclosed the [[University of Northern Iowa]] (UNI) would stop supporting a conference on facilitated communication it had hosted for the last five years, following representations from scientists and academics arguing the practice had long been discredited.&lt;ref name=Gazette2&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/university-of-northern-iowa-drops-controversial-conference-20181113|title=University of Northern Iowa drops controversial conference|last=Miller|first=Vanessa|date=November 13, 2018|work=The Gazette|access-date=November 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114014955/https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/university-of-northern-iowa-drops-controversial-conference-20181113|archive-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of over thirty researchers and academics around the globe had called for the University of Northern Iowa to cancel the fifth Midwest Summer Institute held June 18–19, 2018, because the conference promotes Facilitated Communication. The conference was co-sponsored by Waverly-based Inclusion Connection and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse University’s]] Institute on Communication and Inclusion, formerly called the Facilitated Communication Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailyorange.com/2018/06/su-co-host-conference-discredited-communication-method-drawing-criticism-academics/|title=SU to co-host conference on discredited communication method, drawing criticism from academics - The Daily Orange - The Independent Student Newspaper of Syracuse, New York|website=dailyorange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18|date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Stephen |title=Consumer Health Digest #18-24 |url=https://www.ncahf.org/digest18/18-24.html |website=National Council Against Health Fraud |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{R|Forbes}} The "30-plus academics and professionals — from [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Emory University]], the [[University of Melbourne]] in Australia, the [[University of London]] in England, and three UNI professors — have sent a letter to UNI College of Education Dean Gaetane Jean-Marie asking her to reconsider supporting the event and its promotion of 'this invalidated and demonstrably harmful practice.'" The letter sent to the University stated that this "practice was 'thoroughly discredited over 25 years ago.'"&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; According to ''[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]'' article from June 15, 2018, the UNI had not responded to questions about money, attendance or students receiving college credit for the class. Mark Sherry, a spokesman for the critics, stated that "I would like the university to come out and be consistent with the scientific academic community and disavow facilitated communication" continuing he emphasized: “This is not even debatable. Study after study after study for 30 years has found that the messages are offered by the facilitator." FC supporter and workshop speaker Marilyn Chadwick said that she has seen people's lives change for the good once they can communicate, but "Maybe the typing will lead to talking, and maybe the talking will lead to independence".

An article by [[Forbes]] published on June 18, 2018 was highly critical of the University of Northern Iowa's support of Facilitated Communication. The article featured comments from former facilitator Janyce Boynton who was quoted as saying "By the mid-1990s, the scientific community had proved over and over again that it was the facilitator—not the disabled communication partner—who was typing the messages. Every time. Full stop."&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |last1=Salzberg |first1=Steven |title=Facilitated Communication Has Been Called An Abuse Of Human Rights.

In a statement issued on the second day of the 2018 conference UNI spokesman Scott Ketelsen acknowledged that concerns about the practices presented at the event had been raised and said that UNI will be reevaluating its sponsorship of the Midwest Summer Institute. "We regularly evaluate UNI’s sponsorship of conferences and events to ensure that we are supporting high-quality programming consistent with the mission of the university. As part of this regular review, we will be convening a group of faculty experts from across campus to discuss the practices presented at this conference."&lt;ref name="gazette2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Vanessa |title=University of Northern Iowa will review involvement in 'facilitated communication' conference |url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/university-of-northern-iowa-college-facilitated-communication-conference-uni-disabled-20180619?template=amphtml&amp;__twitter_impression=true |website=The Gazette |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==
The concept and technique of facilitated communication is one that has been increasingly debated over the last few decades with the vast majority of evidence indicating that it is not scientifically valid. However, this information has not stopped many individuals from using this technique under various circumstances and furthermore, advocating for its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/syracuse_apple_and_autism_pseudoscience ''Syracuse, Apple, and Autism Pseudoscience''. Skeptical Inquirer. April 28, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of evidence from studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that the likely explanation for any "positive" results—that is, anything indicating that facilitated communication has worked—can be attributed to the facilitators themselves. Be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or the creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating. Further examination into this technique has discovered various examples in which the disabled individual using facilitated communication could correctly respond to simple questions only when the facilitator was in the room to hear the questions.&lt;ref name="APA FC statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included asking the facilitator to leave and then proceeding to show the disabled individual a picture of an animal. Next, the facilitator would return to the room and be asked to help the individual answer the question: "what animal did I just show you?" In all of these cases, the questions were answered incorrectly. However, when asked questions while the facilitator was in the room, the correct response would be made. Shockingly, this technique has also led to a series of false sexual abuse cases in which the facilitator would indicate that the disabled individual revealed that they had been sexually abused. Unsurprisingly, these cases were later dismissed upon the discovery that these false accusations were actually a result of the facilitator fabricating these stories.

Finally, even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.&lt;ref name="APA FC statement" /&gt;

==Sexual abuse allegations and facilitator misconduct==
There have been instances in which a person, through facilitated communication, seems to disclose experiences of sexual or physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Spake, Amanda (1992)" /&gt; Often, the alleged abuse is sexual and contains "extensive, explicit, pornographic details."&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shane|editor1-first=Howard C.|title=Facilitated Communication: The Clinical and Social Phenomenon|date=June 1994|publisher=Singular Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-565-93341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While facilitators are taught to expect their communication partners to reveal sensitive, personal issues,&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt; it is not known whether FC generates more abuse allegations than other suggestive techniques.&lt;ref name="Hall, Genae (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Scott O. (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O.|title=Psychological Treatments that Cause Harm|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=1|pages=53–70| url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/2/1/53.abstract|accessdate=March 19, 2015|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00029.x|pmid=26151919|citeseerx=10.1.1.531.9405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers suspect that facilitators involved in this type of case may, mistakenly, believe there is a link between early abuse and autism or, for other reasons, suspect familial abuse.&lt;ref name="Hall, Genae (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Scott O. (2007)" /&gt; As Green wrote in a 1995 article:&lt;blockquote&gt;suggestions about sexual abuse permeate the culture. Just watch [[Oprah]] or [[Phil Donahue|Phil [Donahue]]] almost any time or scan the pop psychology section at your local bookstore. Couple that with mandatory abuse reporting laws, mix in a little bit of crusading zeal to "save" people with disabilities from mistreatment, and you have a potent set of antecedents for facilitators to produce allegations.&lt;ref name="Green, Gina (1995)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1993, ''Frontline''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s "Prisoners of Silence" featured the story of Gerry Gherardi of North Carolina who was accused, through FC-generated messages, of sexually abusing his son. Despite protestations of innocence, Gherardi was forced to stay away from his home for six months.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (1993)" /&gt; The charges were dropped when court-ordered double-blind tests showed that Gherardi's son could not write.&lt;ref name="Koehler, Robert (1993)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koehler|first1=Robert| title=TV Review 'Prisoners' Puts Autism Technique to the Test|work=Los Angeles Times|issue=Home Edition|date=19 October 1993|location=Los Angeles, California| page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Rimland reported in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that he knew of about 25 cases where families were accused through facilitated communication of sexually abusing their children.&lt;ref name="Goldman, Daniel (1993)" /&gt;

By 1995, there were five dozen known cases,&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Scott O. (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Margolin, K.N. (1994)"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Margolin|first1=K.N.|editor1-last=Shane|editor1-first=Howard C.|title=Facilitated Communication: The Clinical and Social Phenomenon|date=1994|publisher=Singular Publishing| location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-565-93341-5|pages=227–257| chapter=How Shall Facilitated Communication be Judged? Facilitated Communication and the Legal System}}&lt;/ref&gt; with untold numbers of others settled without reaching public visibility. Since then, the number of cases continues to increase. In addition to accusations of sexual abuse, facilitators, reportedly, have fallen in love with their communication partners and, relying on FC for consent, initiated sexual, physical contact with people in their care,&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Marshall, Todd, Shane (2015)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundstrom, Kathy (2014)" /&gt; raising serious ethical and legal problems for facilitators, protective service agencies, law enforcement, court officials, educators, and family members alike.&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt;

===The "Carla" case===
About the same time FC was gaining popularity in the United States in the early 1990s, the Guardianship and Administration Board in Melbourne, Australia, was reviewing a landmark case involving allegations of sexual abuse and facilitated communication. The 1990 case involved a 28-year-old woman (pseudonym "Carla") with severe disabilities who was removed, twice, from her home by state authorities because of messages obtained through FC that she was being sexually abused at home.

Nine facilitators, including Crossley, one of Australia's leaders in FC movement, over a course of nine months, obtained messages through FC that, allegedly involved incest, rape and other sexual depredations. Crossley had assessed Carla in August 1998, indicating that her ability to spell was very good and expressing amazement at the extent of Carla's vocabulary and perceptions during the evaluation. Officials removed Carla from the home when one of the facilitators, through another facilitated session, indicated Carla threatened suicide if she was not removed from her home.&lt;ref name="Heinrich, Paul (February 1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich, Paul (February 1992b)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heinrichs|first1=Paul|title=Suffering at the hands of the protectors|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/suffering-at-the-hands-of-theprotectors-19920215-esuq.html|accessdate= March 19, 2015|work=Sunday Age|issue=Late Edition| date=February 16, 1992|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-month custody battle ensued, during which Carla was subjected to over 100 hours of psychological and other testing. In the end, the Guardianship Board concluded that Carla was severely intellectually disabled, unable to differentiate between letters of the alphabet, and could not have authored the messages. The double-blind testing, conducted by psychologist Tony Cantanese, demonstrated that the only meaningful responses obtained through FC were when the facilitator knew the questions being asked of Carla. The court determined that Carla and her family were "victims" and admonished the facilitators: "the one step that would have prevented the case occurring--prior verification that the woman could communicate with facilitated communication--had not been done." All charges were dropped and custody was granted to Carla's family.&lt;ref name="Spake, Amanda (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich, Paul (February 1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich, Paul (February 1992b)" /&gt;

===The Storch case===
In 1991, Mark Storch from Shokan, New York, was charged with abusing his daughter after the Department of Social Services received reports that his daughter, Jenny, a 14-year-old with autism, had, through facilitated communication, disclosed recurring sexual assaults, including 200 vaginal and anal rapes. Storch's wife, Laura, was charged with neglect. Despite no physical evidence of abuse, inconsistencies in the facilitated testimony, and questions about the facilitator's troubling personal history, officials pressed charges, which led to a costly, 10-month legal battle. The case was dropped because FC lacked sufficient testing and acceptance in the scientific community.

Bennett Leventhal, head of [[pediatric psychology]] at the University of Chicago, testified in the Storch's defense, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The obligation of an investigator into a new technique is to show how it works. With FC, there's this basic assumption of "What can it hurt?" The Storch trial is living proof of how dangerous it is to embrace new science before it has been tested.&lt;ref name="Chideya, Farai (1993)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chideya| first1=Farai|title=The language of suspicion with an adult's hand gently supporting hers, an autistic child who'd never spoken could type messages on a keyboard.

===The Wheaton case===
In 1992, the parents of Betsy Wheaton, a 16-year-old nonspeaking person with autism, were, through facilitated communication, falsely accused of sexually abusing their daughter. The facilitator, Janyce Boynton, who was trained in FC at the University of Maine,&lt;ref name="Facilitated Communication—what harm it can do: Confessions of a former facilitator" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How facilitators control words" /&gt; interpreted Betsy's hitting and scratching during facilitated sessions as reenactments of abuses occurring at home. Boynton reported these incidents to the Department of Human Services, and Betsy and her brother were removed from the home. The brother was also implicated. The parents' attorney hired [[Howard Shane]] of Boston Children's Hospital to conduct testing of authorship. It was determined through double blind testing that Boynton, not Betsy, was authoring the messages obtained through facilitation. Boynton, unlike many other facilitators who have undergone testing, accepted the results, stopped using FC, and persuaded the school system to stop using FC as well.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="von Tetzchner, Stephen (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post (1995)"&gt;{{cite news| title=Allegations by FC of Sexual Abuse Have Been Challenged|work=The Washington Post|issue=Final Edition|date=17 January 1995|location=Washington, D.C.| page=z12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back on her training, Boynton could see that it had been inadequate. She had not worked with anyone who was nonverbal, and she was pronounced "good to go" after only two days of mostly lectures. She knew that disabled people suffer relatively high levels of abuse, was taught that there was a strong affinity between patient and facilitator, so, she has stated, "you get this sense in your head that you're the only one this person trusts... And then you get overly protective and you have that thought in your head that maybe they've been abused." She describes the process of facilitating as '"everything happening at once.... you're so distracted by other things." Until she was tested, she fully believed that she was protecting Betsy. Howard Shane states: 'You're expected to believe (the person has been abused) and then, bam, the accusation happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Michael|title=How facilitators control words typed in facilitated communication without realizing|url=http://dailyorange.com/2016/04/how-facilitators-control-words-typed-in-facilitated-communication-without-realizing/|website=The Daily Orange|publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=13 April 2016|date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Wheaton case, Todd wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The real responsibility for the Wheaton tragedy lies with Rosemary Crossley, Douglas Biklen, and their acolytes. Despite all of their advanced degrees, professional credentials, and university appointments, they failed in their professional and ethical responsibility to show that FC was safe and effective before foisting it on the world. Having donned the trappings of expertise and put themselves out as authorities, they incurred what [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] called "the moral obligation to be intelligent." Long before they even thought to put pen to paper and write their extravagant tales of extra-ordinary awakenings, they should have heeded not just the technical lessons of [[Clever Hans]], but the findings of more than a century of scientific and practical investigations of [[automatic writing]], [[experimenter bias]], mental telepathy, unconscious influence, [[subjective validation]], [[stimulus leakage]], expectancy effects, deception and self-delusion. Had they exercised due scientific diligence, the developers of FC would have quickly realized that they had done nothing better than turn pliant arms into [[Ouija planchette]]s and reinvent the seance.&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Cracchiolo case===
In 1993, Gregory Cracchiolo, a teacher of students with severe developmental disabilities in Whittier, California, was accused of sexually assaulting four of his students, with facilitated communication being the only source of evidence. The student making the allegation was unable to communicate by speech to verify these claims. Cracchiolo lost his job and faced 11 felony counts of forcible sodomy and forced oral copulation. He faced a maximum sentence of 88 years in prison. While authorship testing was not done, the charges were dropped after a month, because FC lacked the scientific evidence to determine its efficacy. The prosecutor continued to believe the abuses occurred. Cracchiolo's career as an educator was ruined.&lt;ref name="Dillow, Gordon (1993)" /&gt;

===The Lehman case===
In 1993, David and Jean Lehman of Newmarket, Ontario, were charged with sexually abusing their 20-year-old son, Derek, based solely on evidence obtained through facilitated communication. At birth, Derek had been diagnosed with autism and severe mental retardation and, at the time of the allegations, lived in a group home. He was not able to speak but could use two hand signals: "please" and "toilet". He was not able to recognize numbers beyond three and was not aware of his own sex or that of others.

During authorship testing, conducted by Mary Konstantareas, psychology professor at the [[University of Guelph]], Derek was not able to name an object that he had seen but his facilitators had not. After a year-long court battle, the charges were proven unfounded and dropped. The ordeal left the Lehmans in debt, nearly losing their business, and drove David Lehman to nearly committing suicide. The Lehmans filed an $8.5 million civil suit and accepted a settlement for an undisclosed amount. They were also granted custodianship of their son.&lt;ref name="Papp, Leslie (1996)" /&gt;

===The New York case===
In 1997, a New York couple, who had lost custody of their daughter, was awarded $750,000 by a federal jury when jurors concluded that the officials in the case "knew or should have known the girl's facilitated allegations of abuse were bogus."&lt;ref name="Dickerson, Brian (March 2008)"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Dickerson|first1=Brian|title=Brian Dickerson Column: A legal horror show tears Oakland Co. family apart|work=McClatchy-Tribune Business News|date=March 17, 2008|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The England case===
In 1999, a 50-year-old business man from the south of England was accused, through FC, of abusing his 17-year-old son. The son, reportedly, had severe autism and [[epileptic fit]]s&lt;ref name="The Times (London) (2000)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facilitated communication not reliable as evidence|work=The Times|date=July 26, 2000|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was not able to speak. Dame [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss|Elizabeth Butler-Sloss]], President of the High Court Family Division, ruled on the first case of its kind in England,&lt;ref name="Rumbelow, Helen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumbelow|first1=Helen|title=Autistic son's language aid led to abuse charge|work=The Times|date=13 July 2000|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying FC was "dangerous" and should not be used by UK courts to "back up or dismiss allegations of abuse."&lt;ref name="Gardner, Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Law Report (2000)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Report: Case Summaries - 9 October 2000|work=The Independent|date=October 9, 2000|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also indicated the court was "entirely satisfied the allegations were unfounded",&lt;ref name="Allen, Richard (2000)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Richard|title=Discredited test let to child abuse nightmare for father|work=The Evening Standard|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd.|date=12 July 2000|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there was no evidence that the father or anyone else was a perpetrator, or that the abuse had ever occurred.&lt;ref name="The Times (London) (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rumbelow, Helen" /&gt;

===The Wendrow case===
In 2007, Julian Wendrow of West Bloomfield, Michigan, was charged with sexually abusing his daughter, Aislinn, and placed in jail for 80 days.&lt;ref name="Wisely, Brasier (March 2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wisely|first1=John|last2=Brasier|first2=L.L.|title=Dad of autistic Westbloomfield girl nearly free of rape charges: She won't testify, so case collapses| work=McClatchy-Tribune Business News|date=March 11, 2008|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Tali, was accused of severely mentally and emotionally abusing her children and was forced to wear an electronic tether.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt; Their 13-year-old son was also named as a perpetrator. Both children were placed in foster care.

The allegations resulted from messages obtained via FC at school while an aide helped guide the girl's hand.&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt; The case was a "virtual rerun" of the 1992 Betsy Wheaton case.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld, Marshall, Todd, Shane (2015)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfreman, Jon (2012)" /&gt; When lawyers questioned the girl without the facilitator present, she was unable to answer questions, including "What color is your sweater?" and "Are you a boy or a girl?"&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; The case fell apart due to lack of physical evidence of abuse and facilitated testimony that contained information inconsistent with the Wendrow's family, lifestyle and living arrangements: relatives that did not exist, Christian theology attributed to observant Jewish parents, nonexistent rooms and photos.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)" /&gt;

Aislinn testified, through FC, that she was afraid of her father because of a gun. Police found no guns in the home.&lt;ref name="Wisely, Brasier (April 2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wisely|first1=John|last2=Brasier|first2=L.L.|title=Oakland fumbles sex case charges: overeager prosecutions can ruin lives, some say| work=McClatchy-Tribune Business News|date=April 27, 2008|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the charges were dropped and the children returned to their parents. Prosecutors continued to believe the girl was afraid of her father.&lt;ref name="Wisely, Brasier (March 2008)" /&gt; A wrongful arrest suit was settled for $1.8 million, which, according to the attorney representing the Police Department, was a business decision made by the insurance company and was not an admission of wrongdoing or liability.&lt;ref name="Wisely, Brasier (January 2011)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wisely| first1=John|last2=Brasier|first2=L.L.|title=Dad's arrest in sex case results in $1.8 million settlement|work=Gannet News Service|date=13 January 2011|page=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gigi Jordan case ===
On February 3, 2010, Gigi Jordan of New York was found by police in [[the Peninsula New York]] hotel. She was incoherent from a drug overdose. Jude Mirra, her 8-year-old son, was also found, dead from a mixture of painkillers and anti-inflammatories which Jordan force-fed him. Jordan, at the time, was under the impression Mirra wanted to die because of alleged sexual abuse typed out during sessions involving FC. Despite testifying that she was "by Jude's side at all hours of the day", Jordan believed the biological father, her ex-husband, had been abusing the boy for years and that Mirra's diagnosis of autism was actually a catatonic [[psychosis]] brought on by the alleged abuse. To Jordan, the killing was "altruistic [[filicide]]"; a mercy killing.&lt;ref name="Sanchez, Remizowski (2014)"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Sanchez|first1=Ray|last2=Remizowski|first2=Leigh|title=New York businesswoman guilty of manslaughter in son's death|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/05/justice/new-york-autistic-death-trial/| accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=CNN|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashan, Yoni (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bashan|first1=Yoni|title=Trial Begins for Gigi Jordan, accused of murdering her son with pills; the former Manhattan executive's lawyer said she killed her son out of "fierce love and devotion"|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trialbegins-for-former-new-york-city-executive-gigi-jordan-accused-of-murdering-her-son-with-pills-atthe-peninsula-hotel-1410397598|accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=September 10, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirra, who was diagnosed with autism, was not able to speak. Jordan indicated that Mirra, through FC, had told her "I need a lot of drugs to die peacefully" and "I wish you do it soon." Although Jordan and Mirra communicated by typing together on a Blackberry, no witnesses ever observed Mirra type by himself. In reviewing typed messages provided by Jordan of her son's disclosures, court officials questioned whether Mirra had the capacity to understand or spell words like "aggressively" and "sadistic".&lt;ref name="Sanchez, Remizowski (2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashan, Yoni (October 2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bashan|first1=Yoni|title=Gigi Jordan describes last moments with her son; testifies about details in a Peninsula Hotel Room, says she tried to revive Mirra| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gigi-jordan-describes-last-moments-with-her-son-1412902984| accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc.|date=October 9, 2014|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan also believed her second ex-husband, a pharmaceutical executive, was stealing millions of dollars from her and wanted her killed. Both men denied the accusations. No evidence of any crimes committed in connection with the case were found against either of the two men.&lt;ref name="Sanchez, Remizowski (2014)" /&gt; In November, 2014, the jury accepted Jordan's claim of extreme emotional disturbance and found her guilty of first-degree [[manslaughter]] in the death of her son.&lt;ref name="Sanchez, Remizowski (2014)" /&gt;

===The Wales case===
In 2012, the parents of a young woman with severe intellectual disabilities, autism and profound communication problems were reunited with their daughter after the [[Public Services Ombudsman for Wales]] concluded they had been wrongfully arrested on suspicion of serious sexual assault obtained via FC. The family had been separated for six months. No charges were brought against the parents. Rowan Wilson, a [[psychiatrist]], had, on November 8, 2010, assessed the woman's mental capacity using FC,&lt;ref name="Shipton, Martin (2012)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shipton|first1=Martin|title=Parents wrongly accused of sexually abusing daughter; lawyers consider next step| work=The Western Mail|issue=Edition 1; National Edition|date=November 9, 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he, admittedly, had no knowledge or experience of the system.&lt;ref name="Devine, Darren (2012)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devine|first1=Darren|title=Daughter taken from parents after unproven abuse claims; Doctor used wrong method to question autistic woman| work=The Western Mail|issue=Edition 1; National Edition|date=13 November 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also failed to consider the discrepancy between the woman's language fluency with and without FC.&lt;ref name="Devine, Darren (2012)" /&gt; The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Services ruled that Wilson was still fit to practice because "he had shown remorse and insight into the errors he was highly unlikely to repeat." Wilson participated in further training in autism.&lt;ref name="Devine, Darren (2012)" /&gt;

===Anna Stubblefield case===
In 2015, Anna Stubblefield, a [[Rutgers University–Newark]] philosophy professor, was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault against a man with severe mental disabilities. Stubblefield stated that the two of them had a mutually consenting relationship established through facilitated communication. At the time the investigation began in 2011, Stubblefield was the chair of Rutgers-Newark's philosophy department, whose professional work centered on ethics, race, and disability rights. She was married and had a family.&lt;ref name=NYTM102015/&gt;

Stubblefield was indicted in January 2013. The victim was identified as D.J., a 33-year-old African-American man with severe mental disabilities, whom Stubblefield met in 2008 through D.J.'s brother, a student of hers and one of D.J.'s [[legal guardian]]s. D.J. cannot speak, has [[cerebral palsy]] and is unable to stand independently or accurately direct movements of his body. Based on evidence of mental disability, his mother and brother were appointed his legal guardians.&lt;ref name=NYTM102015&gt;{{cite news|author1=Daniel Engber|title=The Strange Case of Anna Stubblefield|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/the-strange-case-of-anna-stubblefield.html|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=October 20, 2015|quote=...the judge ruled that facilitated communication failed New Jersey’s test for scientific evidence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stubblefield, a proponent of facilitated communication, used the technique with D.J., and stated that she had successfully communicated with him, determining he was of normal intelligence. She subsequently brought him to conferences where she "held him out as a success story". Speaking with the assistance of Stubblefield using facilitated communication, D.J. is quoted, by Stubblefield, in the chapter "Living a Good Life...in Adult-Sized Diapers" in ''Disability and the Good Human Life'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to communication is the right to hope....I am jumping for joy knowing I can talk, but don't minimize how humiliating it can be to know people jump to the conclusion I am mentally disabled.

On Memorial Day in 2011, Stubblefield revealed to D.J.'s mother and brother that she had had sexual relations with D.J. and that they were in love. She attributed consent to messages received while facilitating. Testing of D.J. by family members failed to establish the ability to communicate, Stubblefield was thanked, but denied further access to D.J. However, she continued to attempt to maintain contact with D.J. and began challenging control of D.J.'s legal guardians over him.&lt;ref name=NYTM102015/&gt; In August 2011, the family went to the Rutgers police, who contacted [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] prosecutors.&lt;ref name="Wichert, Bill (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wichert|first1=Bill|title=New Jersey: Judge OKs document detailing Rutgers professor's sexual relations with mentally disabled man|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2015/01/judge_approves_document_use_in_trial_of_rutgers_professor_accused_of_sexually_assaulting_mentally_di.html|accessdate=21 March 2015|work=NJ Advance Media|publisher=New Jersey Online LLC|date=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szteinbaum, Sabrina"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Szteinbaum|first1=Sabrina|title=Former RutgersNewark philosophy department chairwoman to appear in court for alleged sexual abuse of mentally handicapped man|url=http://www.dailytargum.com/article/2014/04/former-rutgers-newark-philosophydepartment-chairwoman-to-appear-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-abuse-o|accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=The Daily Targum|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey}} Dead link as of October 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite 20 years of psychological testing, which concluded that D.J. is severely mentally disabled, Stubblefield considered D.J. mentally capable, having the capacity to understand questions, communicate using facilitated communication, and give consent to sex.

===The Martina Susanne Schweiger case===
In 2014, Martina Susanne Schweiger of Queensland, Australia, received an 18-month suspended jail sentence for two counts of indecent dealing with a 21-year-old client with severe autism with whom she worked at a disability services home. The client required 24-hour support and was not able to speak, write or use manual sign-language.

Schweiger believed the client expressed love for her through FC, the purported feeling that she claimed to reciprocate. She also believed the client, again through FC, indicated a desire to have sex. On one occasion, Schweiger removed her clothes in front of her client. On another, she "play wrestled" with him, touching his penis with her hands and mouth. She confessed her actions to her employer. After hearing reports from Alan Hudson, psychology professor at [[RMIT University]], that FC "did not work for the young man", Judge Gary Long of [[Maroochydore]] District Court found Schweiger guilty of the charges, indicating that FC was neither reliable nor accurate as a method of communication.&lt;ref name="Sundstrom, Kathy (2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundstrom, Kathy (2014b)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sundstrom|first1=Kathy|title=Mother angered by suspended sentences| url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/mother-angered-by-suspended-sentences/2422829/| accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=17 October 2014|location=Queensland, Australia|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hialeah Case===
In 2018, Jose Cordero spent 35 days in jail and was barred from seeing his family for months after he was accused of abusing his 7-year-old son with [[autism]]. The accusations arose through the child's teacher using the "hand-over-hand" method of FC. [[Miami-Dade]] prosecutors grew suspicious when, through the facilitator the boy made even more outlandish claims and language not typical for someone that age. After being paired with a different teacher and specialist the child was no longer able to reproduce a single word. Coupled with negative [[DNA testing]] this resulted in the charges being dropped. According to a final State Attorney report, "Due to significant inconsistencies within the victim’s disclosures coupled with controversial means by which the disclosure was obtained, and a lack of corroborating witnesses, the state would be unable to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt at this time."&lt;ref name = Ovalle/&gt;

The case raises questions about whether or not the teacher, Saul Fumero, made up the allegations and whether the district was aware he was using a discredited communication method. Fumero acknowledged that he has had no formal training in FC. A Miami-Dade Schools spokeswoman did not say whether the district would review Fumero's actions, but noted that teachers are required by law to immediately report allegations of abuse. The spokeswoman, Daisy Gonzalez-Diego, added that the district "does not endorse the facilitated communication method and does not provide training" for it because it is not accepted by those working in the field of "augmentative and alternative communication."&lt;ref name = Ovalle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ovalle|first1=David|last2=Kyra|first2=Gurney|title=How a teacher's 'junk science' landed a dad in jail on charge of raping his autistic son|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article204034704.html|website=miamiherald.com|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fake or Fortune?''''' is a [[BBC One]] television series which examines the [[provenance]] and attribution of notable [[art]]works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-west-england-awards-2016|title=RTS West of England Awards 2016 {{!}} Royal Television Society|website=rts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first series aired in 2011, ''Fake or Fortune?'' has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz |title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=4 December 2016 |work=The Times |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest for an arts show in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/fake-or-fortune|title=Fake or Fortune|website=www.bbcstudios.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Title            = Lautrec
| DirectedBy    = Rachel Jardine
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|26|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| Title             = A Double Whodunnit
| DirectedBy        = Francis Welch
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|02|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

| Title            = Alberto Giacometti

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|09|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = Answering the programme's call for works of art other than paintings, Philip and Fiona investigate what appears to be a [[plaster cast|plaster]] sculpture of [[Alberto Giacometti]]'s early work ''Tete qui regarde'' or ''[[Gazing Head]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-set-to-appear-in-the-new-series-of-the-fake-or-fortune-television-show-1-4970438|title=Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts set to appear in the new series of the Fake or Fortune? television show|first=Emma|last=Knights|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti"&gt;https://twitter.com/philipmould/status/1038857131821281281&lt;/ref&gt; The object shows signs of extensive damage, and a [[CT scan]] reveals it has been stapled, stitched and glued back together several times. Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

==Reception==
{{update|section|reason=reviews and coverage of later series|date=August 2017}}
Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery. But I couldn't entirely shift the suspicion that some of it was just a little too good to be true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|title=The Weekend's TV: ''Fake or Fortune?''

Reviewing an episode of the seventh season, Michael Hogan of The Telegraph wrote "Arts programming is an increasingly endangered beast on prime time television.

The [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] team [[Fantastic Four]] featured in [[Marvel Comics]] publication has appeared in four live-action films since its inception. The plots deal with four main characters, known formally as [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], and how they adapt to the superpowers they attain.

[[Constantin Film]] bought the film rights for the characters in 1986. A [[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|low-budget film]] was produced in 1992 by New Horizon Studios owned by [[Roger Corman]]. In 2004, with a distribution deal from [[20th Century Fox]], a second ''Fantastic Four'' film entered production. ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' was released in 2005 and the sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' was released in 2007. Both films received mixed to negative reviews from critics, yet earned a combined {{USD|619 million}} worldwide at the [[box office]]. Due to 20th Century Fox's disappointment with the box-office return of ''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer'', a potential third ''Fantastic Four'' film and a Silver Surfer spin-off film were canceled.

In 2009, the development for a reboot was announced. Directed by [[Josh Trank]], ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' was released on August 7, 2015 and received negative reviews from both critics and public, and Trank himself. A sequel to the reboot was scheduled to be released on June 9, 2017, but it was removed from Fox's upcoming slate.

===''The Fantastic Four'' (1994)===
{{Main|The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)}}
The story of the film focused on four astronauts that were bombarded with cosmic rays from a comet while on an experimental space craft. In the process, they acquired extraordinary abilities.

In 1986, [[Bernd Eichinger]] of [[Constantin Film]] acquired the film rights of the [[Fantastic Four]] from [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; In 1992, Eichinger hired [[Roger Corman]] to produce a low-budget film in order to keep the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', had its [[film trailer|trailer]] released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an [[ashcan copy]], meaning it was only made to keep the license.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/fan.four.html|title=The Fantastic Four Movie You'll Never See|work=Wired|date=September 1994|accessdate=June 18, 2009|first=Sheila|last=Muto}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Lee]] and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/movies/fantasticfour_1994/ |title=Fantastic Four (1994) |publisher=[[UGO]] |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105195549/http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/movies/fantasticfour_1994/ |archivedate=November 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so [[20th Century Fox]] could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_kw=Comics+Scene+34+Superman+Fantastic+Four|title=Comics Scene 34 Superman Fantastic Four - eBay|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' gave negative reviews to the ''Fantastic Four'' films directed by Tim Story. Regarding ''Rise of the Silver Surfer'', he stated, "Story does the same sort of efficient, impersonal job he did on the first film, keeping things at such a basic, almost childish level that it seems the movie is aimed squarely, if not exclusively, at the 12-and-under set."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ae.miami.com/entertainment/ui/miami/movie.html?id=895597&amp;reviewId=22501 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623044747/http://ae.miami.com/entertainment/ui/miami/movie.html?id=895597&amp;reviewId=22501 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 23, 2007 |title=Fantastic Four: Rise of Silver Surfer film review |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |author=Rodriguez, Rene }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Roger Moore of ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave Story's ''Fantastic Four'' films good reviews. He called the first film as a "popcorn popper" and a "cinematic sugar buzz" and the second film an "entertaining film that doesn't overstay its welcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-db-moviereviews-searchresults,0,3279701,results.formprofile?turbine_cdb_lib__cdb_01_txt=Fantastic%20Four&amp;Find+it%21=Submit+Query |title=Roger Moore Review: Fantastic Four |date=July 8, 2005 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |author=Moore, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-db-moviereviews-searchresults,0,3279701,results.formprofile?turbine_cdb_lib__cdb_01_txt=Fantastic%20Four:%20Rise%20of%20the%20Silver%20Surfer&amp;Find+it%21=Submit+Query |title=Roger Moore Review: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer |date=June 13, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |author=Moore, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 ''Fantastic Four'' film was the weakest reviewed of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story. Josh Trank, who directed the film, was himself not satisfied, posting a message on [[Twitter]] stating he had envisioned a better version of the film, but it was ruined by Fox; he later deleted the message.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/07/fantastic-four-josh-trank-tweet | title=Why did Fantastic Four director Josh Trank slam his own movie? | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=August 7, 2015 | accessdate=August 7, 2015 | last=Breznican | first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gallup's most admired man and woman poll''' is an annual poll that [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] has conducted at the end of most years since 1948. Americans are asked, without prompting, to say what man and woman "living today in any part of the world, do [they] admire most?"&lt;ref name="g07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103462/hillary-edges-oprah-most-admired-woman-07.aspx |title=Hillary Edges Out Oprah as Most Admired Woman in ‘07 |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is published as a top ten list. Most years the most admired man is the sitting [[President of the United States]] and the most admired woman is or has been the [[First Lady of the United States]].
{{tocright}}
==Trends and top finishers==
Sitting U.S. presidents have captured the top spot for men in 58 out of 70 years.&lt;ref name="g13"&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/166646/obama-clinton-continue-reign-admired-man-woman.aspx |title=Obama, Clinton Continue Reign as Most Admired |publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through 2016, evangelist [[Billy Graham]] had 60 appearances in the top 10, the most of anyone,&lt;ref name="g13"/&gt;{{update-inline|date=August 2018}} with eight second-place finishes. The second most is [[Ronald Reagan]] with 31, and [[Jimmy Carter]] with 28 and [[Pope John Paul II]] with 27 follow.&lt;ref name="g13"/&gt; The sitting pope has finished in the top ten in every year since 1977.&lt;ref name="g13"/&gt;

Among women, the poll has shown [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] as U.S. First Ladies with the most appearances on the list. The high mark for top 10 appearances belongs to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with 48 through 2016.&lt;ref name="g11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1678/most-admired-man-woman.aspx |title=Most Admired Man and Woman |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high mark for most appearances at number 1, the most admired woman in the world, belongs to Hillary Clinton who served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State]] from 2009 to 2013, [[United States Senator]] representing [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2001 to 2009, [[First Lady of the United States]] during the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]] from 1993 to 2001, and First Lady of Arkansas from 1983 to 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1372">'''General Amusement Corporation''' (GAC) was an international [[Talent agent|talent booking agency]] that was acquired by [[ICM Partners]] in 1974. In the 1940s, GAC's name was changed to '''General Artists Corporation''' to avoid confusion with a registered coin-machine company. General Artists Corporation, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, evolved first into a larger agency called Creative Management Associates, and then, in 1974, into ICM Partners.

GAC was founded in the early 1930s as a partnership between Thomas G. Rockwell (–1958) and Francis "Cork" O'Keefe (1900–1990). It was called the Rockwell-O'Keefe Theatrical Agency. Their clients, then, included [[Bing Crosby]] and the newly formed [[Dorsey Brothers]] band.  In 1939, when O'Keefe retired, Rockwell reorganized the firm and changed the name to General Amusement Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"T.G.

[[File:Signed Hinomaru flag of Eihachi Yamaguchi.JPG|thumb|right|Signed Hinomaru of Eihachi Yamaguchi]]
The '''Good Luck Flag''', known as {{nihongo||寄せ書き日の丸|yosegaki hinomaru}} in the [[Japanese language]], was a traditional gift for Japanese servicemen deployed during the military campaigns of the [[Empire of Japan]], though most notably during [[World War II]].  The flag given to a soldier was a [[flag of Japan|national flag]] signed by friends and family, often with short messages wishing the soldier victory, safety, and good luck.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Nila and Robert Rolfe, Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces 2006 Osprey Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] call their country's flag ''[[hinomaru]]'', which translates literally to "sun's circle", referencing the red circle on a white field.  When the ''hinomaru'' was signed, the Japanese [[kanji|characters]] were usually written vertically, and radiated outward from the edge of the red circle.  This practice is referenced in the second term, ''yosegaki'', meaning "sideways-writing".  The phrase ''hinomaru-yosegaki'' can be interpreted as "To write sideways around the red sun", describing the appearance of the signed flag.{{sfn|Bortner|2008}}

==History==
The ''hinomaru yosegaki'' was traditionally presented to a man prior to his induction into the Japanese armed forces or before deployment.  Generally, relatives, neighbors, friends, and co-workers of the person receiving the flag would write their names, good luck messages, exhortations, or other personal messages on the field of the flag.  The writing usually flowed out sideways in a rayed pattern away from the red sun.  However, if the messages became crowded, well-wishers improvised and wrote wherever they could squeeze in a message.{{sfn|Bortner|2008}}
[[File:Japanese personal flag.jpg|left|thumb|Japanese soldiers often carried personal flags, signed by friends and neighbors, as a patriotic symbol. This flag was captured during the Battle for Guam. Donated by Mr. Ralph Phipps.]]
[[File:1939 Family photo from Nagano.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A family gathers around a young boy in a military uniform, surrounded by banners and flags. Some of the children also hold flags.|1930s photo of a military enrollment. The ''Hinomaru'' is displayed on the house and held by several children.]]
[[File:Kaiapit flags 057510.jpg|right|thumb|More captured Japanese Flags.26 September 1943 Soldiers from the 2/6th Independent Company display Japanese flags they captured during the battle of Kaiapit between 19 and 20 September 1943. AWM photo 057510]]

Normally, some kind of exhortation such as ''Bu un Chou kyu'' is written across the top within the white field.  Loosely translated into English, ''Bu un Chou kyu'' means "May your military fortunes be long lasting."  Dark, medium-sized characters may normally be seen that run vertically down the right or left hand margin of the flag.  These usually occur in one, two or three columns and are generally the names of the man receiving the flag, and the name of the individual or organization presenting the gift to him.  The ''[[kanji]]'' characters were typically written with a [[Japanese calligraphy#Tools|calligraphy brush]] and ink.  While it was normally the custom to sign only around the red center of the flag, some examples may be found with characters written upon the red center as well.{{sfn|Bortner|2008}}

When the custom of writing on flags began is up for debate.  Some sources indicate that signed flags became part of the military man's off-to-war gear, along with a "Thousand-stitch sash" (''[[senninbari]]''), during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894-1895.)  Any good luck flags that pre-date the [[Manchurian Incident]] (1931) should be considered rare.  It is generally agreed that most ''hinomaru yosegaki'' seen today come from just before or during the period of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945.){{sfn|Bortner|2008}}

For the military man stationed far away from home and loved ones, the ''hinomaru yosegaki'' offered communal hopes and prayers to the owner every time the flag was unfolded.  It was believed that the flag, with its many signatures and slogans would provide a combined force or power to see its owner through tough times.  Furthermore, it reminded him in a material way to do his duty.  The performance of that duty meant that the warrior was not expected to return home from battle.  Often, the departing serviceman left clipped fingernails and hair behind so that his relatives would have something of him in which to hold a funeral.  Great honor was brought upon the family of those whose sons, husbands, brothers, and fathers died in the service of country and Emperor.  The belief of self-sacrifice was a central one within Japanese culture and was much exalted during [[World War II]].  Culturally, the Japanese believed that in doing one's duty, the soldier, sailor, or aviator must offer up his life freely to the Emperor just as the [[sakura|cherry blossoms]] fall freely from the tree at the height of their beauty.{{sfn|Bortner|2008}}  As part of the [[samurai]] or [[bushido]] code (Way of the Warrior), this worldview was brought forward into twentieth-century Japan from the old warring days of feudal Japan and was impressed upon twentieth-century soldiers, most of whom descended from non-samurai families.

In [[Sidney Phillips|Sid Phillips]]'s book, ''You'll Be Sor-ree'', he describes the role of Japanese flags played in the Pacific War, "Every Jap seemed to have a personal silk flag with Jap writing all over it and a large meatball in the center."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Sid   ''You'll Be Sor-ree''  Copyright 2010 Valor Studios, INC.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous books describing these souvenirs taken home by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and [[U.S. Army]] [[Infantry]]. Another example is [[Eugene Sledge]]'s book ''[[With the Old Breed]]'', "The men gloated over, compared, and often swapped their prizes. It was a brutal, ghastly ritual the likes of which have occurred since ancient times on battlefields where antagonists have possessed a profound mutual hatred."&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, Eugene B. ''With the Old Breed'' 1981 [[Presidio Press]] Trade Paperback Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article of the ''Monroe News'', a World War II veteran talked about the flag brought from the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]].  He said he did not search every Japanese soldier he shot, as there was usually not enough time. He found the flag while fighting on the island of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]]. He said soldiers did not take large souvenirs, such as a [[katana]] (sword), for fear that someone would steal it; a flag could be easily concealed. The flag was being returned to Japan through Dr. Yasuhiko Kaji who searches for the owner and/or their family.&lt;ref name="Monroe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monroenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080707/NEWS01/647675358/-1/NEWS |title=Vet Returning Japanese Flag from WWII |last=Cousino |first=Dean |date=8 July 2010 |work=The Monroe Evening News |accessdate=21 December 2013 |location=[[Monroe, MI]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324215018/http://www.monroenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080707%2FNEWS01%2F647675358%2F-1%2FNEWS |archivedate=24 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effort to return flags ==
OBON SOCIETY (formerly OBON 2015) is a non-profit affiliate organization with the mission to return "good luck flags" to their families in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://obonsociety.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://obon2015.com/english/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.returningyosegakihinomaru.com&lt;/ref&gt; The American Embassy in Tokyo wrote a letter to OBON 2015 declaring; "OBON 2015 continues President Kennedy's spirit of reconciliation and friendship."&lt;ref&gt;http://obon2015.com/english/a-letter-from-the-embassy.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, OBON SOCIETY's efforts were acknowledged by the Japanese government when Rex and Keiko Ziak, founders of OBON SOCIETY traveled to Japan with a group of U.S. veterans and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  With the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, OBON SOCIETY's work has been recognized by Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs as an important symbol of reconciliation, mutual understanding, and friendship between our two countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattle.us.emb-japan.go.jp/files/000126778.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017 they have returned 108 flags and have more than 295 other flags they are currently working on returning.&lt;ref&gt;http://obon2015.com/id/&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2017, OBON SOCIETY arranged Marvin Strombo, 93 years old WWII Veteran a trip to Japan to return his flag back to the family (Tatsuya Yasue, 89 years old younger brother) in their village.&lt;ref&gt;http://obonsociety.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/15/former-us-marine-returns-flag-took-fallen-japanese-soldier-wwii/|title=Former US Marine returns a flag he took from a fallen Japanese soldier during WWII|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published news stories and interviews indicate that the effort to return the flags is seen as a humanitarian act which can provide closure for the family members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-flags-of-their-fathers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://democratherald.com/albany/video-a-peaceful-return/youtube_5fd5cc4a-94f8-5330-a317-d4a4478616b7.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyastorian.com/Free/20170313/wwii-vet-hopes-japanese-flag-can-be-given-to-owners-family&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://democratherald.com/news/a-final-healing-act/article_17eaef45-5f58-5617-be6c-dac6ee297272.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://koin.com/2015/03/23/oregon-ww2-vets-return-japanese-flags-to-families/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nwnewsnetwork.org/post/aging-us-veterans-seek-return-captured-wwii-flags-japan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opb.org/radio/programs/thinkoutloud/segment/returning-world-war-ii-combat-souvenirs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/obon-2015-returning-hinomaru-yosegaki/5411242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=75615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-1Z-pJByQQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R27BG5sXVso&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation and restoration ==
The United States' [[National World War II Museum]] publishes a preservation guide with a list of recommendations for storing and preserving synthetic materials such as flags. Such artifacts should be stored in climate-controlled areas, never in attics or basements, and should also be kept away from bright light such as sunlight and fluorescent lights which have large amounts of [[UV rays]]. If intended for display, a flag or any textile artifact should be supported by a backing, never allowed to hang by its own weight. If storing in a box, make sure the textile is flat with no creases. Do not use sealed plastic bags; however, muslin bags can be used. Direct Human contact may cause damage to these artifacts as well, since hands can transfer oils, sweat, or make-up to the artifact and cause damage. Wear clean cotton or nylon gloves when handling heirloom textiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalww2museum.org/exhibitions/preservation-of-artifacts.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bortner|2008}}

{{nihongo|'''''Ico'''''|イコ|Iko|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|k|oʊ}}}} is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[SCE Japan Studio]] and [[Team Ico]], and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], released for the [[PlayStation 2]] video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions. It was designed and directed by [[Fumito Ueda]], who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept. Originally planned for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], ''Ico'' took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]].

The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.

''Ico'' introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom lighting]], and [[key frame]] animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. It has been called one of the [[greatest games of all time]], and is often brought up in discussions about [[video games as an art form]]. It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', the [[spiritual successor]] to ''Ico''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Ico gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Ico (right) calls out to Yorda (left) while she waits on the ruined castle. The game's graphics feature [[soft light]] techniques.&lt;ref name="1up bittersweet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3144548|title=Bittersweet Symphony|last=Mielke|first=James|date=2005-10-15|publisher=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629175726/http://www.1up.com/features/retroactive-ico|archivedate=2012-06-29|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/09/two-classic-games-get-facelifts-and-a-playstation-3-release/|title=Two Classic Games Get Facelifts and a PlayStation 3 Release|first=Dave|last=Banks|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2012-08-27|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Ico'' is primarily a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[platform game]]. The player controls Ico from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda.&lt;ref name="g4tv review"/&gt; The camera is fixed  in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also [[Panning (camera)|pan]] the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt; The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; 

These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt; Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open.&lt;ref name="g4tv review"/&gt;

Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex.&lt;ref name="g4tv review"/&gt; While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a [[Save-state|save point]]. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt; In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | url = http://waxebb.com/writings/ico.html | title = Interactivity in Ico: Initial Involvement, Immersion, Investment. | first = Drew | last = Davidson | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2010-09-14 | conference = ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Vol. 38 - Proceedings of the second international conference on Entertainment computing | publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{nihongo|Ico|イコ|pronounced "Ee-ko"}}, a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a [[sarcophagus|stone coffin]] to be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ico|developer=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment|date=2001-09-24|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Ico''': They... They tried to sacrifice me because I have horns. Kids with horns are brought here.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across {{nihongo|Yorda|ヨルダ|Yoruda}}, a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ico|developer = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment|date = 2001-09-24 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = '''Queen''': That girl you're with is my one and only beloved daughter. Stop wasting your time with her. She lives in a different world than some boy with horns! ''[...]'' Yorda, why can't you understand?  You cannot survive in the outside world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it slips up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.

Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned to stone]] by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ico|developer=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| date = 2001-09-24 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = '''Queen''': My body has become too old and won't last much longer. But Yorda's going to grant me the power to be resurrected. To be my spiritual vessel is the fulfilment of her destiny.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt; She wakes up and smiles at Ico.

== Development ==
[[File:Kaido Kenji And Fumito Ueda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenji Kaido]] and [[Fumito Ueda]], the creative team behind ''Ico'']]

Lead designer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for ''Ico'' in 1997, envisioning a "boy meets girl" story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt; Ueda's original inspiration for ''Ico'' was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the [[manga]] series ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'' (1977–1981), where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The PlayStation 2 Interview: Fumita Ueda|magazine=[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK|Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]|issue=19|date=April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited his work as an animator on [[Kenji Eno]]'s [[Sega Saturn]] game ''[[Enemy Zero]]'', which influenced the animation work, [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cinematic]] [[cutscene]]s, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glixel.com/interviews/the-last-guardian-creator-talks-first-game-job-kenji-eno-w459337|title='The Last Guardian' Creator Ueda on His First Game Job and the Late Kenji Eno|website=Glixel|date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ueda was also inspired by the video game ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' (''Outer World'' in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any [[head-up display]] elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog.&lt;ref name="ueda interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/04/03/103,1175597139,69535,0,0.html | title = 5 days straight! 　Hiroshi famous game creators say that!

[[File:Ico north american cover.jpg|thumb|upright|The cover used for the North American release of ''Ico''. It has been called one of the worst video game covers, in contrast to the cover used in other regions, and considered a contribution to weak sales of the game in North America.]]
Ueda began working with producer [[Kenji Kaido]] in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the [[PlayStation]].&lt;ref name="hg101"/&gt;  ''Ico''{{'}}s design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt;  This was achieved through the use of "subtracting design"; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt;  This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors.&lt;ref name="beta video"/&gt;  Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the "subtracting design", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt;  Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as [[Team Ico]].&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hg101"/&gt;  On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with ''Shadow of the Colossus''.&lt;ref name="method development"/&gt;

After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options.

''Ico'' received strong [[game critic|reviews]], becoming a [[cult following|cult]] hit among [[video game player|gamers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141616 | title = Top 10 Cult Classics | publisher = ''[[1UP.com|1UP]]'' | date = 2005-06-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/ico | title = Ico (ps2: 2001) | publisher = ''[[Metacritic]]'' | accessdate = 2008-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Famitsu"&gt;{{cite news | title = プレイステーション2 - ICO (PlayStation 2 - Ico) | work = [[Famitsu]] | date = 2006-06-30 | page = 90 | volume = 915 | issue = 2 | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' ranked ''Ico'' as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/edges-top-100-games-of-all-time?page=0%2C0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803214313/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/edges-top-100-games-of-all-time?page=0%2C0 |archivedate=2008-08-03 |title=Edge's Top 100 Games of All Time |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-10-09 |publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[IGN]] ranked the game at number 18 in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/index.html |title=IGN's Top 100 Games |publisher=''IGN'' |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227082124/http://top100.ign.com/2005/index.html |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at number 57 in 2007.&lt;ref name="ign top 100 2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://top100.ign.com/2007/index.html | title = The Top 100 Games of All Time! | publisher = ''IGN'' | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141121172504/http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_57.html | archive-date = 2014-11-21 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ico'' has been used as an example of a [[Video games as art|game that is a work of art]].&lt;ref name="telegraph art"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D81F38F936A25752C1A9679C8B63 | title = Game Theory; To Play Emperor or God, or Grunt in a Tennis Skirt  | first = Charles | last = Herold | date =2001-11-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/october01/ico/index.shtm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081021085522/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/october01/ico/index.shtm | archivedate = 2008-10-21 | title = Reviews: ICO | publisher = ''[[GameSpy]]'' | first = Andrei | last =  Alupului  |date=October 2001 | accessdate = 2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance ''Ico'' from conventional video games due to the negative image that video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title.&lt;ref name="wired interview"/&gt;

Some reviewers have likened ''Ico'' to older, simpler adventure games such as ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' or ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player;&lt;ref name="telegraph art"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358016/Why-videogamers-are-artists-at-heart.html | title = Why videogamers are artists at heart | publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | date = 2008-07-26 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | first = Tom | last = Hoggins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge review"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Ico |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=104 |pages=80–81 |date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]{{'}}s David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was "near indescribable."&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/164/164833p1.html | title = Ico | first = David | last = Smith | date= 2001-09-25 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | publisher = ''IGN''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that "The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it."&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;  Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects.&lt;ref name="g4tv review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;  ''Ico''{{'}}s ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. [[Charles Herold]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' summed up his review stating that "Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments."&lt;ref name="nytimes review"/&gt; Herold later commented that ''Ico'' breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but ''Ico'' creates the sense of "trust and childish fragility" around Yorda, and that these leads to the character being "the game's entire focus".&lt;ref name="wellplayed"&gt;{{cite book | title = Well Played 1.0: Video Game, Value and Meaning | isbn = 978-0-557-06975-0 | editor = Drew Davidson | year = 2009 | first = Charles | last = Herold | chapter = Ico: Creating an Emotional Connection with a Pixelated Damsel | publisher = ETC Press | url = http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/ico-charles-herold | display-editors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160321223055/http://press.etc.cmu.edu/content/ico-charles-herold | archivedate = 2016-03-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is noted for its simple combat system that would "disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth", as stated by [[GameSpot]]{{'}}s Miguel Lopez.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/ico/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title = Ico for PlayStation 2 Review | first = Miguel | last = Lopez | publisher = ''[[GameSpot]]'' | date = 2001-09-26 | accessdate = 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own;&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; Kristen Reed of [[Eurogamer]], for example, said that "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_icorereview_ps2 | title = Ico Review | date = 2006-02-17 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | first = Kristen | last = Reed | publisher = ''[[Eurogamer]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ico'' is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which [[Game Revolution]] calls "painfully short" with "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges".&lt;ref name="gamerev review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/ps2/ico | title = 'Ico' (PS2) Review | publisher = ''[[Game Revolution]]'' | date = 2001-10-09 | accessdate = 2009-05-25 | first = Johnny | last = Liu }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Matthew Keil, however, felt that "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings".&lt;ref name="g4tv review" /&gt;  The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title.&lt;ref name="g4tv review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' notes that "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Parish, "Best Buddies &amp; Foul-weathe Friends: A history of co-op games, good and bad", ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 234 (November 2008): 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States.&lt;ref name="tlg name"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/last-guardian-game-named-for-us-europe-kobayashi | title = Last Guardian game 'named for US, Europe' - Kobayashi | publisher = ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'' | date = 2009-09-17 | accessdate = 2009-09-17 | first = Phil | last = Elliot }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bulk in PAL regions,&lt;ref name="hg101"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/icosotc/ico.htm | title = Hardcore Gaming 101: ICO / Shadow of the Colossus | first = David | last = DeRienzo | work=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate = 2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as ''Ico'' lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.&lt;ref name="wired influence"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/09/ico/ | title = The Obscure Cult Game That's Secretly Inspiring Everything | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date =2013-09-12 | accessdate = 2013-09-13 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ico'' received several gaming acclamations from the video gaming press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as ''[[Halo (video game)|Halo]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.&lt;ref name="ign top 100 2007"/&gt; The game received three [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] in 2002, including "Excellence in Level Design", "Excellence in Visual Arts", and "Game Innovation Spotlight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate = 2005-03-10 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050310040732/http://www.igda.org/awards/pr_2002_0322.htm | url = http://www.igda.org/awards/pr_2002_0322.htm | title = Game Developers Choice Awards Recipients Named | publisher = ''[[International Game Developers Association]]'' | date = 2002-03-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game won two [[Interactive Achievement Awards]] from the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2002 for "Art Direction" and "Character or Story Development", and was nominated for awards of "Game of the Year", "Game Design", "Level Design" and "Sound Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.interactive.org/awards/2002_5th_awards.asp | title = 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards | publisher = ''[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]]'' | date =2002-02-25 | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''Ico'' is stated by Chris Kohler of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' to have influenced numerous other video games, borrowing from its simple and visual design ideals.&lt;ref name="wired influence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ico/ | title = THE OBSCURE CULT GAME THAT'S SECRETLY INSPIRING EVERYTHING | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = 2013-09-12 | accessdate = 2015-06-20 | first = Chris | last = Kohler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several game designers, such as [[Eiji Aonuma]], [[Hideo Kojima]], and [[Jordan Mechner]], have cited ''Ico'' as having influenced the visual appearance of their games, including ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'', and ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="hg101"/&gt;  [[Marc Laidlaw]], [[Screenwriter|scriptwriter]] for the [[Half-Life series|''Half-Life'' series]], commented that, among several other more memorable moments in the game, the point where Yorda attempts to save Ico from falling off the damaged bridge was "a significant event not only for that game, but for the art of game design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131227/marc_laidlaw_on_story_and_narrative.php | title = Marc Laidlaw On Story And Narrative In Half-Life | first = Simon | last = Carless | date = 2008-10-08 | accessdate= 2017-12-21 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naughty Dog]] team used ''Ico'' as part of the inspiration for developing ''[[Uncharted 3]]''.&lt;ref name="wired influence"/&gt; Vander Caballero credits ''Ico'' for inspiring the gameplay of ''[[Papo &amp; Yo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/08/papo-and-yo-review | title = Review: Autobiographical Story of Child Abuse Papo &amp; Yo Pushes Games Forward, Awkwardly | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = 2012-08-27 | accessdate = 2012-08-28 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Fish used the design by subtraction approach in developing the title ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]''.&lt;ref name="wired influence"/&gt; The developers of both ''[[Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons]]'' and ''[[Rime (video game)|Rime]]'' have ''Ico'' as a core influence on their design.&lt;ref name="wired influence"/&gt; [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], creator and director of the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series, cited ''Ico'' as a key influence to him becoming involved in developing video games, stating that ''Ico'' "awoke me to the possibilities of the medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Parkin | first1=Simon | title=Bloodborne creator Hidetaka Miyazaki: 'I didn't have a dream.

=== Other Team Ico games ===
{{main article|Shadow of the Colossus|The Last Guardian}}

{{nihongo|''Shadow of the Colossus''|ワンダと巨像|Wanda to Kyozō|''Wander and the Colossus''}}, released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in October 2005 in Japan and North America, was developed by the same team that developed ''Ico''. The game features similar graphics, gameplay, and storytelling elements as ''Ico''. The game was referred by its working title "Nico" ("Ni" being Japanese for the number 2") until the final title was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/532/532276p1.html | title = NICO Semi-Confirmed | first = Ed | last = Lewis | date = 2004-07-10 | accessdate = 2008-10-07 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ueda, when asked about the connection between the two games, stated that ''Shadow of the Colossus'' is a [[prequel]] to ''Ico''.&lt;ref name="wired interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70286 | title = Behind the Shadow: Fumito Ueda | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = 2006-03-09 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | publisher = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Ico's third game, ''[[The Last Guardian]]'', was announced as a [[PlayStation 3]] title at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]]. The game centers on the connection between a young boy and a large [[griffin]]-like creature that he befriends, requiring the player to cooperate with the creature to solve the game's puzzles. The game fell into [[development hell]] due to hardware limitations and the departure of Ueda from Sony around 2012, along with other Team Ico members, though Ueda and the other members continued to work on the game via consulting contracts. Development subsequently switched to the [[PlayStation 4]] in 2012, and the game was reannounced in 2015 and released in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/847/847426p1.html | title = Team ICO's Next | date = 2008-01-24 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | first = Chris | last = Roper | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2008/08/28/yoshida-team-icos-ps3-game-will-be-shown-soon/ | title = Yoshida: Team ICO's PS3 game will be shown "soon" | date= 2008-07-28 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | publisher = Video Gaming 24/7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ueda has stated that "the essence of the game is rather close to ''Ico''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58706 | title = Early Trailer for Team Ico's 'Project Trico' Leaked? | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date =2009-05-19 | accessdate = 2009-05-19 | publisher = [[Shacknews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HD remaster===
{{Further information|The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection}}
''Ico'', along with ''Shadow of the Colossus'', received a high-definition remaster for the PlayStation 3 that was released worldwide in September 2011. In addition to improved graphics, the games were updated to include support for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3D]] and PlayStation Trophies. The ''Ico'' port was also based on the European version, and includes features such as Yorda's translation and the two-player mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30451/TGS_Reawakening_The_Last_Guardian.php | title = TGS: Reawakening The Last Guardian | first = Christian | last=  Nutt | date = 2010-09-16 | accessdate =2010-09-16 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America and Europe/PAL regions, the two games were released as a single retail collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/09/15/ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection-hits-ps3-spring-2011-with-3d/0 | title = Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Collection hits PS3 Spring 2011 with 3D | first = Sid | last = Shuman | date = 2010-09-16 | accessdate = 2010-09-16 | publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, they were released as separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/112/1120651p1.html | title = Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Remakes Confirmed |date  =2010-09-14 | accessdate = 2010-09-14 | publisher = IGN | first  = Anoop | last =Gantayat }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both games have since been released separately as downloadable titles on the PlayStation Network store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/12/shadow-of-the-colossus-and-ico-coming-to-psn | title = Shadow of the Colossus and ICO Coming to PSN | first = Colin | last = Moriarty | date = 2012-01-12 | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patch 1.01 for the digital high-definition Ico version added the [[Remote Play]] feature, allowing the game to be played on the [[PlayStation Vita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/366164/ico-hd-playable-on-vita-with-remote-play-update/ | title = Ico HD playable on Vita with Remote Play update | first = Tamoir | last = Hussain | date = 2012-09-04 | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202055621/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/366164/ico-hd-playable-on-vita-with-remote-play-update/# | archive-date = 2014-12-02 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual cover''' is a usually negative term for sophisticated arguments provided by members of the intelligentsia to bolster a particular viewpoint, and thereby help it gain respectability. Usually the viewpoint is one that a supporter (e.g. a politician) leaned toward anyway, but needed arguments to help him justify to others. The implication is that the supporter is not really interested in the truth but is just looking for an excuse to hold a certain position. For instance, it has been alleged that [[free market economics]] serve as intellectual cover for a "predator state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/MacKenzie15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers into the characteristics of minorities have been accused of providing intellectual cover for bigots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination|author=Nelson, Todd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Testament]] scholar [[Gerhard Kittel]] was accused of offering intellectual cover to the [[Nazi]]s' [[genocidal]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=99|number=4|date=Fall 2009|issn=1553-0604|author=Levenson, Alan T.|title=The Mismeasure of the Jew|publisher=Jewish Quarterly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">The '''International Women's Writing Guild''' (IWWG) was founded in 1976. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit writing organization. Its mission is to "empower women writers personally and professionally through writing."

The IWWG has been an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with special consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5|title=List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 1 September 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=undocs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The IWWG collects an annual membership fee from registered members. It offers workshops in person and online through its Digital Village. 

== Programs ==
The IWWG sponsors an annual week-long writing conference for women writers every summer, as well as a variety of regional events throughout the year.  The summer conference centers around 30 different workshops, open readings for participants, and an art studio.  Regional volunteers time to organize round table discussions in their local areas and offer mentoring to other writers.  There are also day long retreats that take place around the country. No portfolio or experience is needed for these retreats. 

While IWWG accepts members, writers do not need to be a member in order to attend these conferences and events.  The membership does give access to discounts to the events, as well as opportunities to network and sell published work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iwwg.org/join/?|title=Join - The International Women's Writing Guild|work=The International Women's Writing Guild|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''KOS-MOS'''|コスモス|lead=yes}} ([[recursive acronym]] for '''K'''osmos '''O'''bey '''S'''trategical '''M'''ultiple '''O'''peration '''S'''ystem) is a fictional character from the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' [[role-playing video game]] series by [[Monolith Soft]] and [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]. KOS-MOS also appears as a major character in the anime ''[[Xenosaga: The Animation]]'' and in several crossover video games.

==Appearances==
===In the ''Xenosaga'' series===

KOS-MOS is an armored female [[android (robot)|android]] developed by the interstellar conglomerate, Vector Industries. She is made entirely of mechanical parts and [[nanomachines]].&lt;ref name="Top 25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/japanese-rpg-characters/?cur=kos-mos|title=Top 25 Japanese RPG Characters|work=Games|publisher=UGO|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is programmed based on the tenets of [[logic]], [[probability]], and the completion of her assigned mission. However, threats to the physical safety of her co-creator, [[Shion Uzuki]], cause KOS-MOS to temporarily ignore these parameters. She is equipped with a "Simulated Personality [[Operating System|OS]]" to aid in communication, although she appears incapable of [[emotion]].

KOS-MOS has significant powers believed to be superior to all other party members. In addition to superhuman strength and speed, the nanomachines her body is formed from allow her to morph parts of her body (specifically her arms) into various energy projectile and melee weapons. Her body is also able to self-repair and is very durable though not indestructible, and she is also protected by a force-shield. She also possesses the ability to summon weapons such as the F-GSHOT chainguns and her famous F-SCYTHE and equipment from another location via U.M.N. transport. She also has a long-range sensory array, the D.S.S.S. system and CPU that exceeds even those possessed by Observational Realians. She also possesses a Hilbert Effect projector whose power is thousands of times greater than that achieved by even the largest spaceships.

KOS-MOS possesses several [[black box]] components left behind by Kevin Winnicot. Each of these black box features are found in each of her skeletons, Version 1, Version 2, Version 3 and Version 4. One of these is her potent X-BUSTER weapon, a powerful burst of energy beams from her abdomen that absorb the Gnosis.  Others are related to her "simulated personality" OS and her self-awareness. KOS-MOS also has some form of energy manipulation tied to the Zohar.  KOS-MOS has another weapon system called the "Tertiary Weapon System", which is seen periodically throughout the series. They consist of a set of energy wings, a pair of energy cannons and other attachments meant to be fitted onto her. While she is programmed to protect Vector personnel unconditionally, her highest priority is to protect Shion specifically.&lt;ref name="Top 25"/&gt;

An almost human alternate persona tends to come out from time to time in the form of a blue-eyed KOS-MOS.  This blue-eyed KOS-MOS is far more powerful than red-eyed KOS-MOS and talks in a more empathetic human-sounding voice.  This alternate KOS-MOS is in fact KOS-MOS' true personality that partially awakens at times when Shion is in extreme danger.

The '''Kurgan hypothesis''' (also known as the '''Kurgan theory''' or '''Kurgan model''') or '''steppe theory''' is the most widely accepted proposal to identify the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]] from which the [[Indo-European languages]] spread out [[Indo-European migrations|throughout Europe]], Eurasia and [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|parts of Asia]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Kurgan solution is attractive and has been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists, in part or total. It is the solution one encounters in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and the ''Grand Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse''.{{sfn|Mallory|1989|p=185}} }}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The single most popular proposal is the Pontic steppes (see the Kurgan hypothesis)..."{{sfn|Strazny|2000|p=163}} }} It postulates that the people of a [[Kurgan culture]] in the [[Pontic steppe]] north of the [[Black Sea]] were the most likely speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE). The term is derived from the Russian ''[[kurgan]]'' ({{lang|ru|курга́н}}), meaning [[tumulus]] or burial mound.

The Kurgan hypothesis was first formulated in the 1950s by [[Marija Gimbutas]], who used the term to group various cultures, including the [[Yamnaya]], or Pit Grave, culture and its predecessors. [[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]] instead uses the core Yamnaya culture and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference.

Marija Gimbutas defined the Kurgan culture as composed of four successive periods, with the earliest (Kurgan I) including the [[Samara culture|Samara]] and [[Seroglazovo culture|Seroglazovo]] cultures of the [[Dnieper]]–[[Volga]] region in the [[Copper Age]] (early 4th millennium BC). The people of these cultures were [[Eurasian nomads|nomadic pastoralists]], who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into [[Eastern Europe]].{{sfn|Gimbutas|1985|p=190}}

Three genetic studies in 2015 gave partial support to Gimbutas's Kurgan theory regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]]. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian and Ukrainian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages; they also detected an [[autosome|autosomal]] component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name="biorxiv.org"&gt;{{cite bioRxiv |biorxiv=013433 |title=Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe |last=Haak |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/full/nature14507.html |title=Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia |author=Allentoft |display-authors=etal |year=2015 |journal=Nature |volume=522 |pages=167–172 |doi=10.1038/nature14507|bibcode=2015Natur.522..167A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite bioRxiv |biorxiv=016477 |title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe |last=Mathieson |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Predecessors===
Arguments for the identification of the Proto-Indo-Europeans as steppe nomads from the Pontic–Caspian region had already been made in the 19th century by German philologists [[Theodor Benfey]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Benfey, ''Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft und orientalischen Philologie in Deutschland seit dem Anfange des 19. Jahrhunderts, mit einem Rückblick auf die früheren Zeiten'' (Munich: J.G. Cotta, 1869), 597–600.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Schrader, ''Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte'', vol. 2. Jena, Ger.: Hermann Costanoble, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydberg |first1=Viktor |title=Teutonic Mythology |date=1907 |volume=1 |publisher=Norrœna |location=London, UK |pages=19 |url=http://www.vaidilute.com/books/norroena/rydberg-01.html#european |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121042030/http://www.vaidilute.com/books/norroena/rydberg-01.html |archivedate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his standard work&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', vol. 1.1, Strassburg 1886, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; about PIE and to a greater extent in a later abbreviated version,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Kurze vergleichende Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', vol. 1, Strassburg 1902, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Brugmann]] took the view that the [[urheimat]] could not be identified exactly at that time, but he tended toward Schrader's view. However, after [[Karl Penka]]'s 1883&lt;ref&gt;Karl Penka, ''Origines Ariacae: Linguistisch-ethnologische Untersuchungen zur ältesten Geschichte der arischen Völker und Sprachen'' (Vienna: Taschen, 1883), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; rejection of non-European origins, most scholars favoured a Northern European origin. The view of a Pontic origin was still strongly favoured, e.g., by the archaeologists [[Vere Gordon Childe|V. Gordon Childe]]&lt;ref&gt;Vere Gordon Childe, ''The Aryans: A Study of Indo-European Origins'' (London: Kegan Paul, 1926).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernst Wahle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Wahle (1932). ''Deutsche Vorzeit'', Leipzig 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Wahle's students was [[Jonas Puzinas]], who in turn was one of Gimbutas's teachers. Gimbutas, who acknowledges Schrader as a precursor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gimbutas|first1=Marija|title=The Balts|date=1963|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London, UK|page=38|url=http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-02.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030062207/http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-02.html|archivedate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; was able to marshal a wealth of archaeological evidence from the territory of the Soviet Union (and other countries then belonging to the eastern bloc) not readily available to scholars from western countries,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nLIufwC4szwC&amp;pg=PA18 18, 495]}} enabling her to achieve a fuller picture of prehistoric Europe.

===Overview===
When it was first proposed in 1956, in ''The Prehistory of Eastern Europe'', Part 1, [[Marija Gimbutas]]'s contribution to the search for Indo-European origins was an [[interdisciplinary]] synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins identifies the Pontic–Caspian steppe as the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) [[urheimat]], and a variety of late PIE dialects are assumed to have been spoken across the region. According to this model, the Kurgan culture gradually expanded until it encompassed the entire Pontic–Caspian steppe, Kurgan IV being identified with the Yamnaya culture of around 3000 BC.

The mobility of the Kurgan culture facilitated its expansion over the entire region, and is attributed to the [[domestication of the horse]] and later the use of early [[chariot]]s.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=blenchspriggsIII181|Parpola in {{Harvcoltxt|Blench|Spriggs|1999|p=181}}. "The history of the Indo-European words for 'horse' shows that the Proto-Indo-European speakers had long lived in an area where the horse was native and/or domesticated {{Harvcol|Mallory|1989|pp=161–63}}. The first strong archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from the Ukrainian Srednij Stog culture, which flourished ''c.'' 4200–3500 BC and is likely to represent an early phase of the Proto-Indo-European culture ({{Harvcolnb|Anthony|1986|pp=295f.}}; {{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989|pp=162, 197–210}}). During the [[Pit Grave]] culture (''c.'' 3500–2800 BC), which continued the cultures related to Srednij Stog and probably represents the late phase of the Proto-Indo-European culture – full-scale pastoral technology, including the domesticated horse, wheeled vehicles, stock breeding and limited horticulture, spread all over the Pontic steppes, and, ''c.'' 3000 BC, in practically every direction from this centre (Anthony [[Kurgan hypothesis#CITEREFAnthony1986|1986]], [[Kurgan hypothesis#CITEREFAnthony1991|1991]]; {{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989|loc=vol. 1}}).}} The first strong archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from the [[Sredny Stog culture]] north of the [[Azov Sea]] in [[Ukraine]], and would correspond to an early PIE or pre-PIE nucleus of the 5th millennium BC.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=blenchspriggsIII181}} Subsequent expansion beyond the steppes led to hybrid, or in Gimbutas's terms "kurganized" cultures, such as the [[Globular Amphora culture]] to the west. From these kurganized cultures came the immigration of [[Proto-Greeks]] to the [[Balkans]] and the nomadic [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] cultures to the east around 2500 BC.

==Kurgan culture&lt;!--'Kurgan Culture' and 'Kurgan culture' redirect here--&gt;==

===Cultural horizon===
Gimbutas defined and introduced the term "'''Kurgan culture'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" in 1956 with the intention of introducing a "broader term" that would combine [[Sredny Stog culture|Sredny Stog II]], [[Pit Grave]], and [[Corded ware]] horizons (spanning the 4th to 3rd millennia in much of Eastern and Northern Europe).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Gimbutas (1970) page 156: "The name ''Kurgan culture'' (the Barrow culture) was introduced by the author in 1956 as a broader term to replace and [[Pit-Grave]] (Russian ''Yamnaya''), names used by Soviet scholars for the culture in the eastern Ukraine and south Russia, and [[Corded ware|Corded Ware, Battle-Axe]], [[Ochre-Grave]], [[Single-Grave]] and other names given to complexes characterized by elements of [[Kurgan]] appearance that formed in various parts of Europe"}} The model of a "Kurgan culture" brings together the various cultures of the Copper Age to Early Bronze Age (5th to 3rd millennia BC) Pontic–Caspian steppe to justify their identification as a single [[archaeological culture]] or cultural horizon, based on similarities among them. The eponymous construction of [[kurgan]]s (mound graves) is only one among several factors. As always in the grouping of archaeological cultures, the dividing line between one culture and the next cannot be drawn with hard precision and will be open to debate.

Cultures that Gimbutas considered as part of the "Kurgan culture":
*[[Bug–Dniester culture|Bug–Dniester]] (6th millennium)
*[[Samara culture|Samara]] (5th millennium)
*[[Khvalynsk culture|Khvalynsk]] (5th millennium)
*[[Dnieper–Donets culture|Dnieper–Donets]] (5th to 4th millennia)
*[[Sredny Stog]] (mid-5th to mid-4th millennia)
*[[Maikop culture|Maikop]]–[[Dereivka]] (mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia)
*[[Yamnaya|Yamnaya (Pit Grave)]]: This is itself a varied cultural horizon, spanning the entire Pontic–Caspian steppe from the mid-4th to the 3rd millennium.
*[[Usatovo culture]] (late 4th millennium)

===Stages of culture and expansion===
[[File:Kurgan map.png|350px|thumb|right|Overview of the Kurgan hypothesis]]
Gimbutas's original suggestion identifies four successive stages of the Kurgan culture:
* '''Kurgan I''', [[Dnieper]]/[[Volga]] region, earlier half of the 4th millennium BC. Apparently evolving from cultures of the Volga basin, subgroups include the [[Samara culture|Samara]] and [[Seroglazovo culture|Seroglazovo]] cultures.
* '''Kurgan II–III''', latter half of the 4th millennium BC. Includes the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Maykop culture]] of the northern [[Caucasus]]. [[Stone circle]]s, [[anthropomorphic]] stone stelae of deities.
* '''Kurgan IV''' or [[Pit Grave]] culture, first half of the 3rd millennium BC, encompassing the entire steppe region from the [[Ural River|Ural]] to [[Romania]].

In other publications{{sfn|Bojtar|1999|p=57}} she proposes three successive "waves" of expansion:
* '''Wave 1''', predating Kurgan I, expansion from the lower Volga to the Dnieper, leading to coexistence of Kurgan I and the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]]. Repercussions of the migrations extend as far as the [[Balkans]] and along the [[Danube]] to the [[Vinca culture|Vinča]] culture in [[Serbia]] and [[Lengyel culture|Lengyel]] culture in [[Hungary]].
*'''Wave 2''', mid 4th millennium BC, originating in the [[Maykop culture]] and resulting in advances of '''"kurganized"''' hybrid cultures into northern Europe around 3000 BC ([[Globular Amphora culture]], [[Baden culture]], and ultimately Corded Ware culture). According to Gimbutas this corresponds to the first intrusion of Indo-European languages into western and northern Europe.
*'''Wave 3''', 3000–2800 BC, expansion of the Pit Grave culture beyond the steppes, with the appearance of the characteristic pit graves as far as the areas of modern Romania, Bulgaria, eastern Hungary and Georgia, coincident with the end of the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] and [[Trialeti culture]] in Georgia (c. 2750 BC).

===Timeline===
*4500–4000: '''Early PIE'''. Sredny Stog, Dnieper–Donets and [[Samara culture|Samara]] cultures, [[domestication of the horse]] ('''Wave&amp;nbsp;1''').
*4000–3500: The Pit Grave culture (a.k.a. Yamnaya culture), the prototypical [[kurgan]] builders, emerges in the steppe, and the [[Maykop culture]] in the northern [[Caucasus]]. [[Indo-Hittite]] models postulate the separation of [[Anatolian languages|Proto-Anatolian]] before this time.
*3500–3000: '''Middle PIE'''. The Pit Grave culture is at its peak, representing the classical reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European society]] with [[Ukrainian stone stela|stone idols]], predominantly practicing [[animal husbandry]] in permanent settlements protected by [[hillfort]]s, subsisting on agriculture, and fishing along rivers. Contact of the Pit Grave culture with late [[Neolithic Europe]] cultures results in the "kurganized" [[Globular Amphora culture|Globular Amphora]] and [[Baden culture|Baden]] cultures ('''Wave&amp;nbsp;2'''). The Maykop culture shows the earliest evidence of the beginning [[Bronze Age]], and Bronze weapons and artifacts are introduced to Pit Grave territory. Probable early [[Satemization]].
*3000–2500: '''Late PIE'''. The Pit Grave culture extends over the entire Pontic steppe ('''Wave&amp;nbsp;3'''). The [[Corded Ware culture]] extends from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Volga]], corresponding to the latest phase of Indo-European unity, the vast "kurganized" area disintegrating into various independent languages and cultures, still in loose contact enabling the spread of technology and early loans between the groups, except for the Anatolian and Tocharian branches, which are already isolated from these processes. The [[centum and satem languages|centum–satem]] break is probably complete, but the phonetic trends of Satemization remain active.

===Further expansion during the Bronze Age===
{{Main|Indo-European migrations}}
The Kurgan hypothesis describes the initial spread of Proto-Indo-European during the 5th and 4th millennia BC.&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th edition, 22:587–588&lt;/ref&gt; As used by Gimbutas, the term "kurganized" implied that the culture could have been spread by no more than small bands who [[Stratum (linguistics)|imposed themselves]] on local people as an elite. This idea of the PIE language and its daughter-languages diffusing east and west without mass movement proved popular with archaeologists in the 1970s (the ''pots-not-people'' paradigm).&lt;ref&gt;[[Razib Khan]], [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/facing-the-ocean/ Facing the ocean], ''Discover Magazine'', 28 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of further Indo-Europeanization of Central and Western Europe, Central Asia and Northern India during the [[Bronze Age]] is beyond its scope, far more uncertain than the events of the Copper Age, and subject to some controversy. The rapidly developing field of [[archaeogenetics]] and [[genetic genealogy]] since the late 1990s has not only confirmed a migratory pattern out of the Pontic Steppe at the relevant time,&lt;ref name="biorxiv.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it also suggests the possibility that the population movement involved was more substantial than anticipated.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}

Gimbutas believed that the expansions of the Kurgan culture were a series of essentially hostile military incursions where a new warrior culture imposed itself on the peaceful, matrilinear (hereditary through the female line), matrifocal, though egalitarian cultures of "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", replacing it with a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[warrior]] society,{{sfn|Gimbutas|1982|p=1}} a process visible in the appearance of fortified settlements and hillforts and the graves of warrior-chieftains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The process of Indo-Europeanization was a cultural, not a physical, transformation. It must be understood as a military victory in terms of successfully imposing a new administrative system, language, and religion upon the indigenous groups.{{sfn|Gimbutas|Dexter|Jones-Bley|1997|p=309}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In her later life, Gimbutas increasingly emphasized the authoritarian nature of this transition from the egalitarian process of the nature/earth [[mother goddess]] ([[Gaia]]) to a patriarchal society and the worship of the father/sun/weather god ([[Zeus]], [[Dyaus]]). This supposed egalitarian, mother-goddess-worshipping society is not the same as a [[matriarchy]] in Gimbutas's view. Matriarchal hierarchy structures in Gimbutas's opinion are the same as a patriarchal society, not the actual opposite: an egalitarian society without hierarchy.

[[J. P. Mallory]] (in 1989) accepted the Kurgan hypothesis as the ''de facto'' standard theory of Indo-European origins, but he recognized criticism of any alleged, but not actually stated, "radical" scenario of military invasion; the slow accumulation of influence through coercion or extortion – Gimbutas's actual main scenario – was often taken as general and immediate raiding and then conquest:
{{quote|One might at first imagine that the economy of argument involved with the Kurgan solution should oblige us to accept it outright. But critics do exist and their objections can be summarized quite simply: Almost all of the arguments for invasion and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference to Kurgan expansions, and most of the evidence so far presented is either totally contradicted by other evidence, or is the result of gross misinterpretation of the cultural history of Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe.{{sfn|Mallory|1991|p=185}}}}

===Alignment with Anatolian hypothesis (2000s)===
{{Main|Anatolian hypothesis}}

Alberto Piazza and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza have tried in the 2000s to align the Anatolian hypothesis with the Steppe theory. According to Alberto Piazza, writing in 2000, "[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey."{{sfn|Cavalli-Sforza|2000}} According to Piazza and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] (2006), the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism.&lt;ref&gt;Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza: "...if the expansions began at 9,500 years ago from Anatolia and at 6,000 years ago from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region, then a 3,500-year period elapsed during their migration to the [[Volga River|Volga]]-[[Don River (Russia)|Don]] region from Anatolia, probably through the Balkans. There a completely new, mostly pastoral culture developed under the stimulus of an environment unfavorable to standard agriculture, but offering new attractive possibilities. Our hypothesis is, therefore, that Indo-European languages derived from a secondary expansion from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region after the Neolithic farmers, possibly coming from Anatolia and settled there, developing pastoral nomadism.&lt;ref&gt;Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}} Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is "''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East."{{sfn|Wells|2002}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wells: "... while we see substantial genetic and archaeological evidence for an Indo-European migration originating in the southern Russian steppes, there is little evidence for a similarly massive Indo-European migration from the Middle East to Europe. One possibility is that, as a much earlier migration (8,000 years old, as opposed to 4,000), the genetic signals carried by Indo-European-speaking farmers may simply have dispersed over the years. There is clearly ''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East, as Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues showed, but the signal is not strong enough for us to trace the distribution of Neolithic languages throughout the entirety of Indo-European-speaking Europe."{{sfn|Wells|2002}}}} Nevertheless, the Anatolian hypothesis is controversial.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

===Anthony's revised steppe theory (2007)===
[[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]]'s ''[[The Horse, the Wheel and Language]]'' describes his "revised steppe theory". David Anthony considers the term "Kurgan culture" so lacking in precision as to be useless, instead using the core [[Yamnaya culture]] and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference.&lt;ref name="DA306"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|2007|pp=306–307}}, "Why not a Kurgan Culture?"&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that 
{{quote|The Kurgan culture was so broadly defined that almost any culture with burial mounds, or even (like the Baden culture) without them could be included.&lt;ref name="DA306" /&gt;}}

He does not include the [[Maykop culture]] among those that he considers to be IE-speaking, presuming instead that they spoke a Caucasian language.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=297}}

'''lebenslaute''' (motto: "classical music – political action") is an open [[direct action]] group that combines concerts of [[classical music]] with [[civil disobedience]], mostly by [[Open air concert|open-air]] protest concerts in unexpected locations. ''lebenslaute'' organizes several nonviolence performances per year on both national and regional levels in Germany.

In 2014, ''lebenslaute'' was awarded the renowned [[Peace Prize of Aachen]], Germany, together with the American organization [[Code Pink|Code Pink – Women for Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachener-friedenspreis.de/preistraeger/archiv/jahr-2014.html CodePink and Lebenslaute to be awarded the Peace Prize of Aachen] (de), ''aachener-friedenspreis.de'', 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded in the [[Aula Carolina]] in the city of [[Aachen]] each year on 1 September, the date on which [[International Day of Peace]] is celebrated in Germany, warningly commemorating the day on which [[Nazi Germany]] started [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939.

Since 1986, ''lebenslaute'' has been turning up in places where classical concerts are least expected, with group sizes between three and over one hundred and in professional black outfit. Locations are chosen in the eye of by-laws that would prohibit any activity of this kind in this spot, so political confrontation is consciously sought. Where possible, lebenslaute gives support to and cooperates with local civil disobedience groups. Direct action is deployed in places that are threatening to people or that design and manufacture objects used for killing, with the aim to protest against the official function of such organizations and locations in principle and in practise: any government agency where people are threatened, e.g. [[refugee]]s, any business of the [[arms industry]], any [[airport]] or [[prison]] used for [[deportation]], any [[nuclear power plant]], any [[military base]] and any other location that may have the aim of preparing for or conducting [[warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from http://www.lebenslaute.net, main page, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Every lebenslaute activity is prepared in groups and decisions are taken accordance in [[Grassroots democracy]]. [[Nonviolence]] as a principle is followed inside the groups, too: None of the activists is asked to do more than they want to. In case of legal proceedings following suit, individuals can be sure to be shown solidarity by other group members and by the group itself in cooperation with allied organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from [http://www.lebenslaute.net?page_id=17 About us], ''lebenslaute.net'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political action by ''lebenslaute'' took place in 1986 when a huge classical orchestra blocked the entrance to the US military base of [[Pershing II]] [[ballistic missile]]s near the town of [[Mutlangen]] in a rural area of [[Baden-Württemberg]], South-Western Germany.

"'''Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]] of the animated sitcom, ''[[Futurama]]'' and is the 99th episode in production and broadcast order. It aired on [[Comedy Central]] on August 26, 2010.  In the episode, the ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]] experiences marriage trouble with his queen, Ndnd.  He departs for Earth, invading it in an attempt to overcome his [[mid-life crisis]] and reignite his marriage.

The episode was written by [[Patric M. Verrone]] and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson and guest stars ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'''s [[Katee Sackhoff]] and cartoonist [[Sergio Aragonés]].  Series creators and producers [[Matt Groening]] and [[David X. Cohen]] make cameos in the episode.

== Plot ==
On his birthday, Ndnd becomes fed up with [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]]'s lack of motivation to conquer other worlds.  He reluctantly invades Earth.  However, he arrives during [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] and is mistaken for a costume contest participant and leaves dejected.  Concurrently, [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] attempts to author a [[superhero]] [[American comic book|comic book]] featuring himself as the superhero saving a captured [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] from a malevolent alien.  The crew is unimpressed with the comic, with the exception of the back page of [[novelty item|novelty toy advertisements]], including the [[Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor]]'s disintegration guns, which are actually only [[teleportation]] guns. Leela's criticism leaves Fry to figure out how to make the story more compelling.

Back on Omicron Persei 8, Ndnd learns of Lrrr's failure and kicks him out of their home. Lrrr returns to Earth, seeking shelter at the Planet Express building. The crew diagnoses Lrrr and his marriage problems as symptomatic of a [[mid-life crisis]]. Leela encourages Lrrr to recommit himself to his marriage with Ndnd, but he listens instead to Bender and gets plastic surgery, flashy new clothes, and goes out to a club to meet new women. There he meets an attractive female Omicronian named Grrrl. While on a date with her, she reveals that she is actually a human woman from the Comic-Con wearing an Omicronian costume. Though she is very attracted to real Omicronians, Lrrr rejects her and seeks Leela's advice on how to win back Ndnd.

Leela and the crew help Lrrr stage an invasion of Earth using a fake broadcast with the help of the head of [[Orson Welles]] à la the 1938 ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. Ndnd is fooled, but so are the Earthican army, who surrender Earth immediately to Lrrr. Leela scolds Lrrr, demanding that he end the charade and tell Ndnd the truth, but he hesitates due to Ndnd's renewed romantic interest and forces the citizens of Earth into slavery. While enslaved, Leela constantly nags Lrrr about telling Ndnd the truth, which causes Ndnd suspicion about their relationship.  She confronts Lrrr, demanding to know if he is having an affair. Grrrl reappears, announcing that she loves Lrrr and will fight for him, brandishing a disintegration ray. Ndnd quickly takes the weapon and shoots Grrrl. Ndnd reveals that she is not upset that Lrrr may have been minutely romantically involved with Grrrl, but that Lrrr allowed Leela to nag him, which Ndnd feels is her role as his wife. Lrrr is reluctantly forced to prove his love for Ndnd by shooting Leela, whom he values as a friend, with the disintegration ray.

As he fires, Fry leaps in front of Leela, sacrificing his life. Ndnd is moved by Lrrr's demonstration of love and the two happily depart back to Omicron Persei 8.  Leela is devastated by Fry's sacrifice. However, as the Omicronians depart, Grrrl reappears, shocking the crew. She reveals that the disintegration gun is merely one of the Professor's novelty teleportation guns that she purchased from an advertisement in the back of a comic book. Realizing that Fry is alive, the crew find him back at Planet Express, putting the finishing touches on his comic.  Inspired by his own heroic actions, his super hero counterpart attempts to rescue "Leela" from the malevolent alien by leaping in front of its ray gun. Leela is pleased with the new ending and commends the comic book, giving Fry a kiss on the cheek.

Merrill Barr of [[Film School Rejects]] gave the episode a positive review, stating, "Like some other episodes this season, everything worked. There wasn't a single joke that fell flat, and I'm glad to see Futurama running at 100% capacity."&lt;ref name="FilmSchoolRejects"/&gt; Sean Gandert of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' gave the episode a mixed review with an overall rating of 7.2. Gandert notes that after the recent run of excellent episodes his expectations made this episode a letdown.&lt;ref name="PasteReview"/&gt; Zack Handlen of [[The A.V.

The '''Manaul''' bird is a creature of [[Philippine folklore]]. There are three existing stories regarding Manaul. Each are different from each other and should not be storied in phases. The "Manaul" mentioned in the three stories are different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/role-birds-serpents-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panay Manaul==
A ''Manaul'' bird was mentioned in the [[Code of Kalantiaw]], a sacred code from the island of [[Panay]]. According to this document, the killing of this bird is punishable by death. It is highly believed that the belief surrounding the said Manaul originated during the dominance of the [[Madja-as|Confederation of Madja-as]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Morrow | first =Paul | title =The Fraudulent Legal Code of Kalantiaw | url =http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/kalant.htm | accessdate =2008-06-20 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153401/http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/kalant.htm | archivedate =2008-05-10 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tagalog Manaul==
In Tagalog folklore, it is said that [[Bathala]] sent a [[tigmamanukan]] omen bird he named "''Manaul''" to peck on the bamboo. Manaul flew from right to left and landed on the bamboo. When Manaul pecked on the bamboo, it opened in half and released the first man, Malakas, and first woman, Maganda. Manaul afterwards flew from right to left again, signalling a ''labay'', or a good omen to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/role-birds-serpents-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44966">In the [[philosophy of language]], the nature of '''meaning''', its [[definition]], elements, and types, was discussed by [[philosophers]] [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to them "meaning is a relationship between two sorts of things: ''signs'' and the kinds of things they ''mean'' (intend, express or signify)". One term in the relationship of meaning necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. In other words: "a sign is defined as an [[entity]] that indicates another entity to some agent for some purpose". As Augustine states, a sign is "something that shows itself to the senses and something other than itself to the mind" (''Signum est quod se ipsum sensui et praeter se aliquid animo ostendit''; ''De dial.'', 1975, 86).

The types of meanings vary according to the types of the thing that is being represented. Namely:
# There are the things in the world, which might have meaning;
# There are things in the world that are also signs of other things in the world, and so, are always meaningful (i.e., natural signs of the physical world and ideas within the mind);
# There are things that are always necessarily meaningful, such as words, and other nonverbal symbols.

All subsequent inquiries emphasize some particular perspectives within the general AAA framework.

The major contemporary positions of meaning come under the following partial definitions of meaning:
*''Psychological theories'', exhausted by notions of [[thought]], [[intention]], or [[understanding]];
*''Logical theories'', involving notions such as [[intension]], cognitive content, or [[sense]], along with [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], reference, or denotation;
*Message, content, [[information]], or [[communication]];
*[[Truth]] conditions;
*Usage, and the instructions for usage; and
*[[Measurement]], computation, or operation.

==Truth and meaning==
{{main|Truth}}
The evaluation of meaning according to each one of the five major substantive theories of meaning and truth is presented below. The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered to truthfully denote meaning, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories listed below. Each theory of meaning as evaluated by these respective theories of truth are each further researched by the individual scholars supporting each one of the respective theories of truth and meaning.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, p572-573 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | chapter = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–330 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both hybrid theories of meaning and alternative theories of meaning and truth have also been researched, and are subject to further assessment according to their respective and relative merits.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories of meaning===

====Correspondence theory====
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements of meaning correspond to the actual state of affairs and that associated meanings must be in agreement with these beliefs and statements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p223 (Macmillan, 1969) Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223-224 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." An example of correspondence theory is the statement by the Thirteenth Century philosopher/theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: ''Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus'' ("Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect"), a statement which Aquinas attributed to the Ninth Century [[neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p224, Macmillan, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/index.html Summa], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1.htm I], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Q.16], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article2 A.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality"&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], (citing De Veritate Q.1, A.1&amp;3; cf. Summa Theologiae Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth and meaning are a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225-226, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226-227, "Ramsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228-229, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969). See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coherence theory====
For coherence theories in general, the assessment of meaning and truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity of meaning and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130-131 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–133, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternatives may be found among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that meaning and truth are constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture along with their meaning were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom{{spaced ndash}}''verum ipsum factum''{{spaced ndash}}"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like  many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that meaning and truth are whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is  the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. PART III, pp 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' and meaning were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that meaning and truth are verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–720 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of meaning and truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James|William James's]] version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but  more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed meanings and truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth and its meaning always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, NEW YORK: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, LCCCN 66-23155&lt;/ref&gt; James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe meaning and truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated theories and commentaries===
Some have asserted that meaning is nothing substantially more or less than the [[truth condition]]s they involve. For such theories, an emphasis is placed upon [[reference]] to actual things in the world to account for meaning, with the caveat that reference more or less explains the greater part (or all) of meaning itself.

====Logic and language====
The [[logical positivists]] argued that the meaning of a statement arose from [[The verifiability theory of meaning|how it is verified]].

====Gottlob Frege====
In his paper  ''Über Sinn und Bedeutung'' (now usually translated as ''On Sense and Reference''), [[Gottlob Frege]] argued that proper names present at least two problems in explaining meaning.

#Suppose the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to. ''Sam'', then, means a person in the world who is named Sam.  But if the object referred to by the name did not exist—i.e., ''Pegasus''—then, according to that theory, it would be meaningless.
#Suppose  two different names refer to the same object.  ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorus'' were the names given to what were considered distinct celestial bodies. It was later shown that they were the same thing (the planet Venus).  If the words meant the same thing, then substituting one for the other in a sentence would not result in a sentence that differs in meaning from the original.  But in that case, "Hesperus is Phosphorus" would mean the same thing as "Hesperus is Hesperus".  This is clearly absurd, since we learn something new and unobvious by the former statement, but not by the latter.

Frege can be interpreted as arguing that it was therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to.  Instead, the meaning must be something else&amp;mdash;the "sense" of the word.  Two names for the same person, then, can have different senses (or meanings): one referent might be picked out by more than one sense. This sort of theory is called a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege argued that, ultimately, the same bifurcation of meaning must apply to most or all linguistic categories, such as to quantificational expressions like "All boats float".  It is now accepted by many philosophers {{who|date=May 2013}} as applying to all expressions ''but'' proper names .{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

====Bertrand Russell====
Logical analysis was further advanced by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]  in their groundbreaking ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which attempted to produce a formal language with which the truth of all mathematical statements could be demonstrated from first principles.

Russell differed from Frege greatly on many points, however.  He rejected Frege's sense-reference distinction. He also disagreed that language was of fundamental significance to philosophy, and saw the project of developing formal logic as a way of eliminating all of the confusions caused by ordinary language, and hence at creating a perfectly transparent medium in which to conduct traditional philosophical argument. He hoped, ultimately, to extend the proofs of the ''Principia'' to all possible true statements, a scheme he called [[logical atomism]]. For a while it appeared that his pupil [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] had succeeded in this plan with his "[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]".

Russell's work, and that of his colleague [[G. E. Moore]], developed in response to what they perceived as the nonsense dominating British philosophy departments at the turn of the 20th century, which was a kind of [[Idealism|British Idealism]] most of which was derived (albeit very distantly) from the work of [[Hegel]].  In response Moore developed an approach ("Common Sense Philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Moore, ''[http://www.ditext.com/moore/common-sense.html A Defence of Common Sense]'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;) which sought to examine philosophical difficulties by a close analysis of the language used in order to determine its meaning. In this way Moore sought to expunge philosophical absurdities such as "time is unreal".  Moore's work would have significant, if oblique, influence (largely mediated by [[Wittgenstein]]) on [[Ordinary language philosophy]].

====Other truth theories====
The Vienna Circle, a famous group of [[logical positivists]] from the early 20th century (closely allied with Russell and Frege), adopted the [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist theory of meaning]]. The verificationist theory of meaning (in at least one of its forms) states that to say that an expression is meaningful is to say that there are some conditions of experience that could exist to show that the expression is true. As noted, Frege and Russell were two proponents of this way of thinking.

A [[semantic theory of truth]] was produced by [[Alfred Tarski]] for [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. According to Tarski's account, meaning consists of a recursive set of rules that end up yielding an infinite set of sentences, "'p' is true if and only if p", covering the whole language. His innovation produced the notion of [[propositional function]]s discussed on the section on [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]] (which he called "sentential functions"), and a [[model-theoretic]] approach to semantics (as opposed to a [[proof-theoretic]] one). Finally, some links were forged to the [[correspondence theory of truth]] (Tarski, 1944).

Perhaps the most influential current approach in the contemporary theory of meaning is that sketched by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his introduction to the collection of essays ''Truth and Meaning'' in 1967.  There he argued for the following two theses:
* Any learnable language must be statable in a finite form, even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions—as we may assume that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way then it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language which could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms.
* Giving the meaning of a sentence, he further argued, was equivalent to stating its ''truth conditions''.  He proposed that it must be possible to account for language as a set of distinct grammatical features together with a lexicon, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences built up from these.

The result is a theory of meaning that rather resembles, by no accident, Tarski's account.

Davidson's account, though brief, constitutes the first systematic presentation of [[truth-conditional semantics]]. He proposed simply translating natural languages into [[first-order predicate calculus]] in order to reduce meaning to a function of truth.

====Saul Kripke====
[[Saul Kripke]] examined the relation between sense and reference in dealing with possible and actual situations. He showed that one consequence of his interpretation of certain systems of [[modal logic]] was that the reference of a proper name is ''necessarily'' linked to its [[referent]], but that the sense is not. So for instance "Hesperus" necessarily refers to Hesperus, even in those imaginary cases and worlds in which perhaps Hesperus is not the  evening star. That is, Hesperus is necessarily Hesperus, but only contingently the morning star.

This results in the curious situation that part of the meaning of a name&amp;nbsp;— that it refers to some particular thing&amp;nbsp;— is a necessary fact about that name, but another part&amp;nbsp;— that it is used in some particular way or situation&amp;nbsp;— is not.

Kripke also drew the distinction between speaker's meaning and semantic meaning, elaborating on the work of ordinary language philosophers [[Paul Grice]] and [[Keith Donnellan]]. The speaker's meaning is what the speaker intends to refer to by saying something; the semantic meaning is what the words uttered by the speaker mean according to the language.

In some cases, people do not say what they mean; in other cases, they say something that is in error. In both these cases, the speaker's meaning and the semantic meaning seem to be different. Sometimes words do not actually express what the speaker wants them to express; so words will mean one thing, and what people intend to convey by them might mean another. The meaning of the expression, in such cases, is ambiguous.

====Critiques of truth-theories of meaning====
[[W.V. Quine]] attacked both verificationism and the very notion of meaning in his famous essay, "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]". In it, he suggested that meaning was nothing more than a vague and dispensable notion. Instead, he asserted, what was more interesting to study was the synonymy between signs. He also pointed out that verificationism was tied to the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] statements, and asserted that such a divide was defended ambiguously. He also suggested that the unit of analysis for any potential investigation into the world (and, perhaps, meaning) would be the entire body of statements taken as a collective, not just individual statements on their own.

Other criticisms can be raised on the basis of the limitations that truth-conditional theorists themselves admit to. Tarski, for instance, recognized that truth-conditional theories of meaning only make sense of statements, but fail to explain the meanings of the lexical parts that make up statements. Rather, the meaning of the parts of statements is presupposed by an understanding of the truth-conditions of a whole statement, and explained in terms of what he called "satisfaction conditions".

Still another objection (noted by Frege and others) was that some kinds of statements don't seem to have any truth-conditions at all. For instance, "Hello!" has no truth-conditions, because it doesn't even attempt to tell the listener anything about the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] in the world. In other words, different propositions have different [[grammatical moods]].

[[Deflationary theory of truth|Deflationist]] accounts of truth, sometimes called 'irrealist' accounts, are the staunchest source of criticism of truth-conditional theories of meaning. According to them, "truth" is a word with no serious meaning or function in discourse. For instance, for the deflationist, the sentences "It's true that Tiny Tim is trouble" and "Tiny Tim is trouble" are equivalent. In consequence, for the deflationist, any appeal to truth as an account of meaning has little explanatory power.

The sort of truth-theories presented here can also be attacked for their [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] both in practice and principle. The principle of formalism is challenged by the [[informalism|informalists]], who suggest that language is largely a construction of the speaker, and so, not compatible with formalization. The practice of formalism is challenged by those who observe that formal languages (such as present-day quantificational logic) fail to capture the expressive power of natural languages (as is arguably demonstrated in the awkward character of the quantificational explanation of definite description statements, as laid out by Bertrand Russell).

Finally, over the past century, forms of logic have been developed that are not dependent exclusively on the notions of truth and falsity. Some of these types of logic have been called [[modal logic]]s. They explain how certain logical connectives such as "if-then" work in terms of necessity and [[Logical possibility|possibility]]. Indeed, modal logic was the basis of one of the most popular and rigorous formulations in modern semantics called the [[Montague grammar]]. The successes of such systems naturally give rise to the argument that these systems have captured the natural meaning of connectives like if-then far better than an ordinary, truth-functional logic ever could.

==Usage and meaning==

Throughout the 20th century, English philosophy focused closely on analysis of language. This style of [[analytic philosophy]] became very influential and led to the development of a wide range of philosophical tools.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein===

The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was originally an artificial language philosopher, following the influence of Russell and Frege. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' he had supported the idea of an ideal language built up from atomic statements using logical connectives. However, as he matured, he came to appreciate more and more the phenomenon of natural language. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', published after his death, signalled a sharp departure from his earlier work with its focus upon ordinary language use. His approach is often summarised by the aphorism "the meaning of a word is its use in a language". However, following in Frege's footsteps, in the ''Tractatus'', Wittgenstein declares: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |year=1999 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work would come to inspire future generations and spur forward a whole new discipline, which explained meaning in a new way. Meaning in a natural language was seen as primarily a question of how the speaker uses words within the language to express intention.

This close examination of [[natural language]] proved to be a powerful philosophical technique. Practitioners who were influenced by Wittgenstein's approach have included an entire tradition of thinkers, featuring [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Paul Grice]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[R. S. Peters]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]].

===J. L. Austin===

At around the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was re-thinking his approach to language, reflections on the complexity of language led to a more expansive approach to meaning. Following the lead of [[George Edward Moore]], [[J. L. Austin]] examined the use of words in great detail. He argued against fixating on the meaning of words. He showed that dictionary definitions are of limited philosophical use, since there is no simple "appendage" to a word that can be called its meaning. Instead, he showed how to focus on the way in which words are used in order to do things. He analysed the structure of utterances into three distinct parts: [[Figure of speech|locutions]], [[illocutionary act|illocutions]] and [[perlocutionary act|perlocutions]]. His pupil [[John Searle]] developed the idea under the label "[[speech act]]s". Their work greatly influenced [[pragmatics]].

===Peter Strawson===

Past philosophers had understood reference to be tied to words themselves. However, Sir [[Peter Strawson]] disagreed in his seminal essay, "On Referring", where he argued that there is nothing true about statements on their own; rather, only the uses of statements could be considered to be true or false.

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of the ordinary use perspective is its insistence upon the distinctions between meaning and use. ''"Meanings"'', for ordinary language philosophers, are the ''instructions'' for usage of words&amp;nbsp;— the common and conventional definitions of words. ''Usage'', on the other hand, is the actual meanings that individual speakers have&amp;nbsp;— the things that an individual speaker in a particular context wants to refer to. The word "dog" is an example of a meaning, but pointing at a nearby dog and shouting "This dog smells foul!" is an example of usage. From this distinction between usage and meaning arose the divide between the fields of [[Pragmatics]] and [[Semantics]].

Yet another distinction is of some utility in discussing language: "mentioning". ''Mention'' is when an expression refers to itself as a linguistic item, usually surrounded by quotation marks. For instance, in the expression "'Opopanax' is hard to spell", what is referred to is the word itself ("opopanax") and not what it means (an obscure gum resin). Frege had referred to instances of mentioning as "opaque contexts".

In his essay, "Reference and Definite Descriptions", [[Keith Donnellan]] sought to improve upon Strawson's distinction. He pointed out that there are two uses of definite descriptions: ''[[attributive use|attributive]]'' and ''[[referential use|referential]]''. Attributive uses provide a description of whoever is being referred to, while referential uses point out the actual referent. Attributive uses are like mediated references, while referential uses are more directly referential.

===Paul Grice===

The philosopher [[Paul Grice]], working within the ordinary language tradition, understood "meaning"&amp;nbsp;— in his 1957 article&amp;nbsp;— to have two kinds: ''natural'' and ''non-natural''. ''Natural meaning'' had to do with cause and effect, for example with the expression "these spots mean measles". ''Non-natural'' meaning, on the other hand, had to do with the intentions of the speaker in communicating something to the listener.

In his essay, ''Logic and Conversation'', Grice went on to explain and defend an explanation of how conversations work. His guiding maxim was called the ''cooperative principle'', which claimed that the speaker and the listener will have mutual expectations of the kind of information that will be shared. The principle is broken down into four maxims: ''Quality'' (which demands truthfulness and honesty), ''Quantity'' (demand for just enough information as is required), ''Relation'' (relevance of things brought up), and ''Manner'' (lucidity).  This principle, if and when followed, lets the speaker and listener figure out the meaning of certain implications by way of inference.

The works of Grice led to an avalanche of research and interest in the field, both supportive and critical. One spinoff was called [[Relevance theory]], developed by [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] during the mid-1980s, whose goal was to make the notion of ''relevance'' more clear. Similarly, in his work, "[[Universal pragmatics]]", Jürgen Habermas began a program that sought to improve upon the work of the ordinary language tradition. In it, he laid out the goal of a valid conversation as a pursuit of mutual understanding.

===Inferential role semantics===

{{main|Inferential role semantics}}

[[Michael Dummett]] argued against the kind of [[truth-conditional semantics]] presented by Davidson. Instead, he argued that basing semantics on ''assertion conditions'' avoids a number of difficulties with truth-conditional semantics, such as the transcendental nature of certain kinds of truth condition.  He leverages work done in [[proof-theoretic semantics]] to provide a kind of inferential role semantics, where:
* The meaning of sentences and grammatical constructs is given by their assertion conditions; and
* Such a semantics is only guaranteed to be coherent if the inferences associated with the parts of language are in [[logical harmony]].
A semantics based upon assertion conditions is called a [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist]] semantics: cf. the verificationism of the Vienna Circle.

This work is closely related, though not identical, to one-factor theories of [[conceptual role semantics]].

===Critiques of use theories of meaning===

Sometimes between the 1950-1990s, cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] said that use theories (of the Wittgensteinian kind) seem to assume that language is solely a public phenomenon, that there is no such thing as a "private language". Fodor thinks it is necessary to create or describe the ''[[language of thought]]'', which would seemingly require the existence of a "private language".

In the 1960s, [[David Kellogg Lewis]] described meaning as use, a feature of a social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]&lt;!-- (see also [[convention (philosophy)]])--&gt; and conventions as regularities of a specific sort. Lewis' work was an application of [[game theory]] in philosophical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla, Michael, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/#Lew "Convention"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2011 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Conventions, he argued, are a species of [[Coordination game|coordination]] [[Nash equilibrium|equilibria]].

==Idea theory of meaning&lt;!--'Idea theory of meaning' and 'Ideational theory of meaning' redirect here--&gt;==

The '''idea theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''ideational theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are [[mental representation]]s provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "ideas" is used to refer to either mental representations, or to mental activity in general. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of mind than the latter. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of meaning than the latter.

Each idea is understood to be necessarily ''about'' something external and/or internal, real or imaginary. For example, in contrast to the abstract meaning of the [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] "dog", the [[referent]] "this dog" may mean a particular real life chihuahua. In both cases, the word is about something, but in the former it is about the class of dogs as generally understood, while in the latter it is about a very real and particular dog in the real world.

===Stronger idea theories===
[[John Locke]], considered all ideas to be both imaginable objects of sensation and the very ''un''imaginable objects of reflection. Locke said in his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', that words are used both as signs for ideas—but also to signify the lack of certain ideas. [[David Hume]] held that thoughts were kinds of imaginable entities. (See Hume's ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', section 2). Hume argued that any words that could not call upon any past experience were without meaning.

Nonetheless, [[George Berkeley]] and  [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] held, in contrast to Locke and Hume, that ideas alone are unable to account for the different variations within a general meaning. For example, any hypothetical image of the meaning of "dog" has to include such varied images as a chihuahua, a pug, and a Black Lab; and this seems impossible to imagine, all of those particular breeds looking very different from one another. Another way to see this point is to question why it is that, if we have an image of a specific type of dog (say of a chihuahua), it should be entitled to represent the entire concept.

Another criticism is that some meaningful words, known as non-lexical items, don't have any meaningfully associated image. For example, the word "the" has a meaning, but one would be hard-pressed to find a mental representation that fits it. Still another objection lies in the observation that certain linguistic items name something in the real world, and are meaningful, yet which we have no mental representations to deal with. For instance, it is not known what Newton's father looked like, yet the phrase ''"Newton's father"'' still has meaning.

Another problem is that of composition&amp;nbsp;— that it is difficult to explain how words and phrases combine into sentences if only ideas were involved in meaning.

===Weaker idea theories===
[[File:Prototype membership.gif|thumb|Memberships of a graded class]]

[[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[George Lakoff]] advanced the theory of [[prototype (linguistics)|prototypes]], which suggests that many lexical categories, at least on the face of things, have "radial structures". That is to say, there are some ideal member(s) in the category that seem to represent the category better than other members. For example, the category of "birds" may feature the ''robin'' as the prototype, or the ideal kind of bird. With experience, subjects might come to evaluate membership in the category of "bird" by comparing candidate members to the prototype and evaluating for similarities. So, for example, a penguin or an ostrich would sit at the fringe of the meaning of "bird", because a penguin is unlike a robin.

Intimately related to these researches is the notion of a ''psychologically basic level'', which is both the first level named and understood by children, and "the highest level at which a single mental image can reflect the entire category". (Lakoff 1987:46) The "basic level" of cognition is understood by Lakoff as crucially drawing upon "image-schemas" along with various other cognitive processes.

The philosophers ([[Ned Block]], [[Gilbert Harman]], H. Field) and the cognitive scientists (G. Miller and P. Johnson-Laird) say  that the meaning of a term can be found by investigating its role in relation to other concepts and mental states. They endorse a view called "[[conceptual role semantics]]". Those proponents of this view who understand meanings to be exhausted by the content of mental states can be said to endorse "one-factor" accounts of conceptual role semantics. and thus  fit within the tradition of idea theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2793">The '''Old Church Slavonic Institute''' ({{lang-hr|Staroslavenski institut}}) is [[Croat]]ian  public [[institute]] founded in 1952 by the state for the purpose of scientific research on the language, literature and paleography of the mediaeval literary heritage of the Croatian vernacular and the Croatian recension of [[Church Slavonic]].

==History==
The institute presents the continuation of the Old Church Slavonic Academy that was founded in [[Krk]] in 1902 and incorporated into the Croatian Theological Academy in Zagreb as its Old Church Slavonic department in 1928. In 1948 Msgr. [[Svetozar Ritig]] succeeded to revive the Old Church Slavonic Academy in Zagreb, the result of which was the renaming of the Academy into Institute.

==Research==

For the purpose of its research, the Old Church Slavonic Institute has created a specialized library containing prints and microfilms of all relevant [[Glagolitic]] manuscripts the originals of which are kept in various institutions in Croatia and around the world. Its work is primarily channeled into the following publications:
* [[Slovo (publication)|Slovo]] 1 (1952) - 54-55 (2006), published annually
* [[Radovi Staroslavenskog instituta]] 1 (1952) – 9 (1988), published periodically

The Institute has published numerous facsimiles and transliterations of the Glagolitic codices, fragments and reprinted Glagolitic books. Its active research projects include creating the grammar and the dictionary of [[Croatian Church Slavonic]] in the period of 12 - 16th century.

==List of directors==

'''Partners for Democratic Change International (PDCI)''' is a global partnership of [[Partners for Democratic Change|Partners for Democratic Change (Partners)]] and the nineteen independent, local organizations Partners founded in Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa that work to advance [[civil society]], [[good governance]] and a culture of change and [[conflict management]] worldwide.

==Organisation==

===PDCI's history===
Partners for Democratic Change was established in 1989. Responding initially to the monumental changes in Central and Eastern Europe, Partners established Centers across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa in this way generating and supporting sustainable capacity and local competences to address governmental, business, and civil society disputes, conflicts, and change issues through mediating processes and programs.

Now independent NGOs with unique specializations, the organizations share common core competencies, enabling them to train citizens, government officials, non-government activists, and business leaders through in-country and regional training initiatives, and to apply their mediating and collaborative expertise and methodologies to public disputes and issues.

As early as 1998, a next-generation network of the strong and well-established organizations founded by Partners for Democratic Change came into view. PDCI’s early incarnations included coordination mechanisms and intra-network exchanges. In 2001, the members signed the PDCI Charter, began a tradition of meeting thrice a year and extorting contributions for a “PDCI Fund”.

===The network secretariat in Brussels===
In 2006 the members founded PDCI, a non-profit association under Belgian law, with a commitment to sharing their knowledge, expertise, and skills to strengthen one another, advancing their national, regional and international work, and forming an alliance that will enable others to be enriched by their peace, justice and civil society work locally.

A secretariat was established in Brussels in mid-2007.

===USA===
'''[http://www.partnersglobal.org Partners for Democratic Change]''': was established in 1989. After leaving [[Community Boards]] [[Raymond Shonholtz]] established Partners for Democratic Change dedicated to building sustainable local capacity to advance civil society and a culture of change and conflict management worldwide. In the promising atmosphere following the downfall of [[Communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe, American and other foreign consultants flooded in with short-term training programs and policy recommendations. Partners took a different development path. Appreciating that democratic change and civil society building required new and acculturated skills and methods, Partners established from 1991 to 1994 six national Centers led by trained, local professionals, whose expertise over time would exceed the need of expatriate consultants. Today, Partners is the largest and only global change and conflict management institutional building organization. What began as an experiment within academic institutions is now an expanding, innovative international organization with 18 Centers, a hub in Brussels and one in Washington, DC, as well as Center and Partners programs in another 20 countries. Centers are among the preeminent institutions in their home countries, supporting civil society, inter-ethnic relations, network building, anti-corruption reform, [[family mediation]], youth and women’s leadership, local government reform, and a host of other initiatives. Partners, the Centers, and PDCI are in a close partnership, pursuing a common mission while maintaining individuality and local independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partnersglobal.org/who/history |title=History — Partners for Democratic Change |publisher=Partnersglobal.org |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''Reader's Digest National Word Power Challenge''' was an annual [[vocabulary]] competition in the [[United States]] for youth in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade.  It was sponsored by [[Reader's Digest]] magazine.

== Competition ==
=== Levels ===
==== School ====
Competition began at school level.  Typically, teachers gave students 25-question [[multiple choice|multiple-choice]] tests.  Classroom winners then competed with other classroom winners from the same grade to determine the school-wide grade-level champion.  The school champion then took a multiple-choice test which determined the top 100 students in the state.

==== State ====
The top 100 students were invited to a state competition, where they were given 25 multiple-choice questions to determine the top ten.  The top ten then went through a few rounds of questions to determine the state champion.  The state champion advanced to national competition.

==== National ====
Students from every state, Washington, D.C., and one student from a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school got to compete at national level.  The students took a 25-question multiple-choice test, with the top ten scorers going on to compete in a nationally televised event.  The moderator was a celebrity; [[Al Roker]] was a regular.

=== Prizes ===
* All students at the state level received treat bags.
* The top 10 students at the state level received Reader's Digest books.
* All students at the national level received treat bags.
* All state winners were offered free trips to the location of the national competition (usually Florida).
* [[Scholarship]]s were awarded at the national level:
** First place: $25,000
** Second place: $15,000
** Third place: $10,000

== Current status ==
In 2007, the RDNWPC website stated that the competition would not be held for the 2007-2008 year.  The Reader's Digest website no longer mentions the RDNWPC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.com/nwpc/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503022316/http://www.rd.com/nwpc/ |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=June 2016}}
The '''Red Jews''' ({{Lang-de|Rote Juden}}), a legendary [[Jew]]ish nation, appear in vernacular sources in [[Germany]] during the [[medieval]] era, from the 13th to the 15th century. These texts portray the Red Jews as an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]al threat to [[Christendom]], one which would invade Europe during the [[Christian eschatology| tribulations]] leading to the end of the world.

[[Andrew Gow]] studied the original [[German-language]] texts and concluded that the legend of the Red Jews conflated three separate traditions: the [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophet]]ic references to [[Gog and Magog]], the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel, and an episode from the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), in which [[Alexander the Great]] encloses a race of heathens [[Gates of Alexander|behind a great wall]] in the [[Caucasus]]. These traditions had some overlap already; Gog and Magog are among the nations trapped behind the wall in the ''Alexander Romance'', and the only ones named in the version of the story appearing in [[Qur'an]] [[Sura]] [[al-Kahf]] (The Cave) 18:89, while the 14th-century work [[John Mandeville | ''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'']] explicitly associates the confined nations with the Ten Lost Tribes.

Many pamphlets circulated interpreting such events as the rise of [[Ottoman Empire| Turkish]] power in the context of the legendary Red Jews. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] (1497–1560), for example, claimed that the [[Ottoman Turks]] and [[Muslims]] were the ''Red Jews''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Kevin Alan Brook, among others, speculated, but could not conclusively prove, that the legend of the Red Jews was actually based on misremembered accounts of the [[Khazars]] ({{fl.}} 7th century to the 10th century). Indeed, in his 9th-century ''[[Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam]]'', [[Christian of Stavelot]] refers to the Khazars as [[Huns|Hunnic]] descendants of Gog and Magog, as well as having been "enclosed" by Alexander, but having since escaped, demonstrating that the Khazars were indeed conflated with two of the three elements making up the legend of the Red Jews. Other medieval sources consider various connections with the Lost Tribes, and they are described in [[Arabic]] sources{{which?|date=October 2018}} as having [[red hair]], a trait associated{{bywhom?|date=October 2018}} with the [[Devil]] in medieval Germany and possibly the source of the term "Red Jews".

[[File:Contantinople Christian sarcophagus circa 400.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Constantinople]] Christian sarcophagus with [[XI monogram]], c. 400]]

A '''sarcophagus''' (plural '''sarcophagi''') is a box-like funeral receptacle for a [[cadaver|corpse]], most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word "sarcophagus" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Wiktionary:σάρξ|σάρξ]] ''sarx'' meaning "flesh", and [[Wiktionary:φαγεῖν|φαγεῖν]] ''phagein'' meaning "to eat", hence ''sarcophagus'' means "flesh-eating"; from the phrase ''lithos sarkophagos'' ([[Wiktionary:λίθος|λίθος]] [[Wiktionary:σαρκοφάγος|σαρκοφάγος]]). Since ''lithos'' is Greek for "stone", ''lithos sarcophagos'' means "flesh-eating stone". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of [[limestone]] that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/520/?letter=C&amp;spage=19 WordInfo etymology.] As a noun the Greek term was further adopted to mean "[[coffin]]" and was carried over into [[LATIN]], where it was used in the phrase ''lapis sarcophagus'', "flesh-eating stone", referring to those same properties of limestone.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/text_links/burialpractices.html Columbia University Department of Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Worms sarcophagi.jpg|right|thumb|Roman-era sarcophagi at [[Worms, Germany]]]]

Sarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. In Ancient Egypt, a sarcophagus acted like an outer shell.

The [[Hagia Triada sarcophagus]] is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in [[fresco]]; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in [[Klazomenian sarcophagi]], produced around the Ionian Greek city of [[Klazomenai]], where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge [[Lycia]]n [[Tomb of Payava]], now in the [[British Museum]], is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.

[[Ancient Roman sarcophagi]]—sometimes metal or plaster as well as [[limestone]]—were popular from about the reign of [[Trajan]],&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and often elaborately carved, until the early [[Christian burial]] preference for interment underground, often in a limestone [[sepulchre]], led to their falling out of favor.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; However, there are many important [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] from the 3rd to 4th centuries.
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|left|thumb|The limestone relief on this [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sarcophagus, c.&amp;nbsp;AD 190, depicts the ''Triumph of [[Dionysus]]''. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]], Maryland.]]
Most Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three of the sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the [[High Middle Ages]] often had a recumbent [[tomb effigy]] lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts, of which the most famous examples include the [[Habsburg]] [[Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.

In the [[early modern period]], lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.

==United States==
[[File:Warner in Laurel Hill.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Warner Tomb in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania]]
Sarcophagi, usually "false", made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, "it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veit|first=Richard Francis|title=New Jersey Cemeteries and Tombstones: History in the Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press/Rivergate Books|isbn=978-0813542362|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included 8 pages of them, broken down into [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Classical architecture|Classical]] detail, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] adaptation, and a [[Modern architecture|Modern]] variant.&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt; Shown on the right are sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by [[Alexander Milne Calder]] (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.

==Asia==
In the [[Mekong Delta]] in southwestern [[Vietnam]], it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of [[Veneration of the dead#Vietnam|ancestor worship]].

In [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], [[waruga]] are a traditional form of sarcophagus.

==India==
Nearly 140 years after British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed a sarcophagus from the hillocks of Pallavaram in Tamil Nadu, an identical artifact dating back by more than 2,000 years has been discovered in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/asi-unearths-2300-year-old-terracotta-coffin-at-pallavaram/articleshow/64754538.cms |title=ASI finds 2,300-year-old sarcophagus in Tamil Nadu |first=Yogesh |last=Kabirdoss |date=28 June 2018 |access-date=29 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Times of India]] |publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8398">A '''self-destruct''' is a mechanism that can cause an object to destroy itself after a predefined set of circumstances has occurred.

Self-destruct mechanisms are typically found on devices and systems where malfunction could endanger large numbers of people.

==Uses==

===Landmines===
Some types of modern [[land mine]]s are designed to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of friendly casualties during the conflict or civilian casualties after the conflict's end.  The Amended Protocol II to the [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] (CCW), amended in 1996, requires that [[anti-personnel land mine]]s deactivate and self-destruct, and sets standards for both.&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groves|first1=Steven|last2=Bromund|first2=Ted R.|title=Obama Says No to Landmines: The president is denying the U.S. armed forces a crucial weapon.|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388807/obama-says-no-landmines-steven-groves-ted-r-bromund|accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=National Review|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Landmines currently used by the [[United States military]] are designed to self-destruct between 4 hours and 15 days depending upon the type.&lt;ref name=USState&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/landmines/FactSheet_FAQ_NewUSLandminePolicy_2-27-04.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions on the New United States Landmine Policy|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=February 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The landmines have a battery and when the battery dies, the landmine self-destructs.&lt;ref name=USState /&gt;  The self-destruct system never failed in over 67,000 tested landmines in a variety of conditions.&lt;ref name=USState /&gt;  Not all self-destruct mechanisms are absolutely reliable,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and most landmines that have been laid throughout history are not equipped to self-destruct. Landmines can also be designed to self-deactivate, for instance by a battery running out of a charge, but deactivation is considered a different mechanism from self-destruction.&lt;ref name=USState /&gt;

===Rocketry===
The [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s were equipped with explosive charges so that the boosters could be destroyed in the event that control was lost on launch and a populated area was in danger.
Physically, this is done by [[detonation cord]]s running along the booster. As they are set off, they cut open the booster's casing. This not only causes the solid rocket fuel to burn up rapidly by exposing a large reaction surface, the cut-open casing also allows combustion gases to escape sideways instead through the [[nozzle]]. Therefore, the booster no longer produces a significant thrust.

This feature can be seen in videos of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].  After the initial disintegration of the shuttle, the two solid rocket boosters continued firing until they exploded simultaneously 37 seconds later. This occurred when the [[Range Safety Officer]] decided that the separated boosters had the potential to endanger those on the ground and activated the self-destruct system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission report| title=Rogers Commission report, Volume I, chapter 9, Range Safety Activities, January 28, 1986| year=1986| url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch9.htm| accessdate=July 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military ships===
Another form of a self-destruct system can be seen in the [[Navy|naval]] procedure of [[scuttling]], which is used to destroy a ship or ships to prevent them from being seized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scapa Flow Scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet|url=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/scuttle.html|work=World War 1 Naval Combat|publisher=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scuttling the Navy August 29, 1943: August 29, 1943 - the turning point|url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/english/history/1939_1945/us_safari.htm|work=Danish Naval History|publisher=Johnny E.

===Deep sea oil drilling===
A form of self-destruct system can be observed in deep-sea oil drilling. In the event of an oil well becoming disconnected from its oil rig, a [[dead man's switch]] may trigger activation of a [[blowout preventer]] blind shear ram which cuts the drill pipe and permanently seals the well to prevent an oil leak.

===Data storage===
Self-destruct mechanisms are sometimes employed to prevent an apparatus or information from being used by unauthorized persons in the event of loss or capture. For example, they may be found in high-security [[data storage device]]s (e.g. [[IronKey]]), where it is important for the data to be destroyed to prevent compromise.

=== Pranking ===
Some artworks may have mechanisms in them to destruct themselves in front of many eyes watching. An example is the painting [[Love is in the Bin]] by [[Banksy]], which shredded itself right after a £1 million auction at [[Sotheby's]] London on 5 October 2018.

==Use in fiction==
Self-destruct mechanisms are frequent plot devices in [[science fiction]] stories, such as those in the ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek]]'' fictional universe, or the ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' universe. They are applied to [[military base|military installations]] and [[starship]]s which would be too valuable to allow an enemy to capture. An [[artificial intelligence]] may invoke self-destruct due to [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5715101/all-the-greatest-scenes-where-someone-talks-a-computer-into-self-destructing|title=All the greatest scenes where someone talks a computer into self-destructing|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many such stories, such a mechanism causes massive destruction in a large area, obliterating the object protected by the device. Often the characters have a limited amount of time to escape the destruction or to disable the mechanism, creating story tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matthewwatchesyoutube.blogspot.com/2014/09/alien-nostromo-self-destruct-sequence.html|title=Matthew Watches YouTube: Alien: Nostromo Self-Destruct Sequence (1979)|last=Dovey|first=Matthew|date=2014-09-11|website=Matthew Watches YouTube|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[Mission Impossible]]'', sensitive intelligence or equipment is shown to self-destruct in order to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fiftiesweb.com/tv/mission-impossible/|title=Classic TV Shows - Mission Impossible with Peter Graves {{!}} FiftiesWeb|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the self-destruct sequence is lengthy and complex, as in ''Alien'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/|title=Alien|date=2014-12-01|website=Typeset In The Future|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or requires multiple officers aboard the ship with individual passcodes to initiate the process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-deaths-uss-enterprise-906645|title='Star Trek': The Many Deaths of the USS Enterprise|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with countdown timers that can allow characters to escape. Passwords in 1970s and 1980s movies are noticeably unfit for purposes of such major impact, considering accounts with even low level security in modern times have far more complex password requirements, as the writers of the era did not anticipate the complexity level of computer generated brute-force attacks and security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.agilebits.com/2013/05/08/star-trek-worst-passwords-self-destruct/|title=The top 6 worst passwords from the Star Trek universe [Updated]|last=Chartier|first=David|date=2013-05-08|website=AgileBits Blog|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-framing metal buildings''' are a form of [[pre-engineered building]] which utilizes [[roll formed]] roof and wall panel diaphragms as significant parts of the structural supporting system.  Additional structural elements may include mill or cold-formed elements to stiffen the diaphragm perimeters, transfer forces between diaphragms and provide appropriate.  As with most pre-engineered buildings, each building will be supplied with all necessary component parts to form a complete building system.

==Design criteria==
Regardless of project site location, buildings must be designed in accordance with appropriate engineering due diligence. Buildings should be designed for all applicable loads including the following:

* Dead (self-weight) loads including mechanical and electrical components.
* Vertical [[live load]] of the building will be not less than (per local code) pounds per square foot applied on the horizontal projection of the roof.
* [[Wind load]] of the building will not be less than (per local code) miles  per hour and will be distributed and applied in accordance with Chapter 16 of the [[International Building Code]].
* All combining and distribution of auxiliary equipment loads imposed on the building system will be done in accordance with Chapter 16 of the "International Building Code".
*Seismic force magnitudes are not normally the controlling forces but North American building codes,&lt;ref&gt;International Building Code&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Building Code of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; require seismic analysis and assembly details to meet specific requirements regardless of force levels.

== In the United States ==
Engineered structural design must comply with the applicable sections of the latest edition of the "Specification for Structural Steel Buildings" of the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (AISC) and the "Specification for the Design of [[Cold Formed Steel]] Structural Members" of the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI).

Many areas of the [[United States]] require the use of state or local building codes which may differ from the "International Building Code". Building codes such as the "International Building Code" and [[Uniform Building Code]] (UBC) are markedly different from each other and are often revised at the local level.

== In Canada ==
Self-framing buildings are within the scope of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) as adopted and modified by each Province and Territory. For steel structures, NBCC references CAN/CSA S16 Design of Steel Structures and CAN/CSA S136 North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.

Manufacturers are required to be certified in accordance with CSA A660 Certification of Manufacturers of Steel Building Systems. Among other requirements, the manufacturer must supply drawings and documents sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the province or territory of the project site. A Certificate of Design and Manufacturing Conformance, duly completed by an engineer knowledgeable with the design and manufacturing, must be provided to the owner and submitted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)with the permit application.

The building code requires documents to be adequate to allow a review of the structural competence of the building (e.g. NBCC Part 4). The Authority Having Jurisdiction will usually require drawings expressing architectural aspects (e.g. Parts 3, 5 and 11). Due to the limited complexity and size of self-framed buildings, the manufacturer's drawings are frequently accepted for this purpose but the owner should be aware that this may not always be the case.

==Roof and wall panels==
Exterior roof panels are usually a single continuous length from [[eave]] to [[ridge]] line for [[gable]] style buildings or from low eave to high eave on single slope or [[shed]] style buildings. Many manufacturers provide minimum 24 gauge (nominal: 0.0239 inch; 0.61&amp;nbsp;mm) thick sheet steel in self-framing roof designs.

Exterior wall panels are usually a single continuous length from the base channel to the eave of the building except where interrupted by wall openings. Many manufacturers provide minimum 24 gauge (nominal: 0.0239 inch; 0.61&amp;nbsp;mm) thick sheet steel in self-framing wall designs.

Diaphragm or racking strength of the wall and roof systems are dependent on issues such as the manufacturer's panel lap seam assembly and should be qualified by full-scale testing. Openings reduce the local structural capacity of the wall or roof assembly and should be considered in the original structural design. the manufacturer may provide guidance for limited field modifications for additional openings.

==Dimensions==
Building width: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Width is primarily limited by the capability of the roof panel to support the applied gravity loads (e.g. self-weight, snow) and wind uplift loads. In taller buildings, the wall panel may be a limiting factor to width due to buckling of the unsupported wall panel length.

Building length: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Length is primarily limited by the ability of the load path to transfer loads to a vertical brace system (e.g. gable endwall). Building length can be extended with added discrete brace systems (e.g. roof level horizontal brace, portal frame, diagonal brace, interior partition shear wall).

Building height: 2.5 m (8' +/-) to 7.5 m (24' +/-) is common. Height is primarily limited by the capability of the wall panel to support the wind load. Height may be limited in narrow buildings due to shear capacity limit in the gable endwalls.

Many manufacturers publish tables relating loads to building dimensions and limitations (e.g. ratio of partial height panels to full height panels where wall openings are required).

==Delivery==
Typically, self-framed buildings will be shipped to site in knocked-down condition with all parts and hardware. Smaller self-framed buildings may be fully assembled at the manufacturer's facility and transported to site.

==Project professionals and manufacturer-designed buildings==
The project architect, sometimes called the Architect of Record, is typically responsible for aspects such as aesthetic, dimensional, occupant comfort and fire safety. When a pre-engineered building is selected for a project, the architect accepts conditions inherent in the manufacturer's product offerings for aspects such as materials, colours, structural form, dimensional modularity, etc. Despite the existence of the manufacturer's standard assembly details, the Architect remains responsible to ensure that the manufacturer's product and assembly is consistent with the building code requirements (e.g. continuity of air/vapour retarders, insulation, rain screen; size and location of exits; fire rated assemblies) and occupant or owner expectations.

Many jurisdictions recognize the distinction between the project engineer, sometimes called the Engineer of Record, and the manufacturer's employee or subcontract engineer, sometimes called a specialty engineer. The principal differences between these two entities on a project are the limits of commercial obligation, professional responsibility and liability.

The structural Engineer of Record is responsible to specify the design parameters for the project (e.g. materials, loads, design standards, service limits) and to ensure that the element and assembly designs by others are consistent in the global context of the finished building.

The specialty engineer is responsible to design only those elements which the manufacturer is commercially obligated to supply (e.g. by contract) and to communicate the assembly procedures, design assumptions and responses, to the extent that the design relies on or affects work by others, to the Engineer of Record – usually described in the manufacturer's erection drawings and assembly manuals. The manufacturer produces an engineered product but does not typically provide engineering services to the project.

In the context described, the Architect and Engineer of Record are the designers of the building and bear ultimate responsibility for the performance of the completed work. A buyer should be aware of the project professional distinctions when developing the project plan.

'''''Sitting Pretty''''' is a 1948 American [[comedy film]] which tells the story of a family who hires [[Lynn Aloysius Belvedere|Lynn Belvedere]], a man with a mysterious past, to babysit their children. It stars [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]], [[Maureen O'Hara]], and [[Clifton Webb]]. The film was adapted by [[F. Hugh Herbert]] from the comic novel ''Belvedere'' (1947) by Gwen Davenport. It was directed by [[Walter Lang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sitting Pretty|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film135348.html|website=[[FilmAffinity]]|publisher=filmaffinity.com|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Belvedere proved so popular, Webb reprised his role in two more movies: ''[[Mr. Belvedere Goes to College]]'' (1949), and ''[[Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell]]'' (1951).

== Plot ==
Lawyer Harry ([[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]]) and his wife Tacey King ([[Maureen O'Hara]]) have trouble retaining a nanny for their three young rambunctious boys. When the latest in a string of servants quits, Tacey advertises and hires Lynn Belvedere sight unseen, only to find out that Lynn is a dapper older man ([[Clifton Webb]]), one with many skills and achievements. Despite their misgivings (and Belvedere's declaration that he detests children), the Kings reluctantly agree to a trial period. Belvedere quickly wins over the kids, but his superior attitude annoys Harry.

When Harry has to go away on a business trip, Tacey agrees to take the baby and sleep over each night at the home of their friends, fellow lawyer Bill Philby ([[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]]) and his wife Edna ([[Louise Allbritton]]), just to squelch any possibility of scandal in their suburban community of Hummingbird Hill. Late that night, however, one of the boys becomes sick. Tacey rushes over. It turns out to be just a stomach ache, but nosy neighbor Clarence Appleton ([[Richard Haydn]]) notices the lights on and comes over to investigate. He starts spreading scandalous rumors linking Belvedere and Tacey romantically. The gossip eventually reaches Horatio J. Hammond ([[Ed Begley, Sr.|Ed Begley]]), Harry's boss. When Harry returns triumphant from his trip, Hammond tells him that Tacey is endangering the law firm's reputation. Though Harry does not believe the stories, he still thinks it would be best if Belvedere found other employment, but is persuaded by his wife and children to change his mind.

Later, Tacey and Edna attend a night lecture. Afterward, they go for a snack in a fancy restaurant. There they encounter Belvedere on his day off. Belvedere invites Tacey to dance. They are spotted dancing cheek to cheek by Appleton and his equally inquisitive mother, and the malicious rumors start again. This time, Harry is not so understanding. Insulted, Tacey quarrels with him and leaves for her parents.

Then, Belvedere's novel (described as "a screaming satire on suburban manners and morals") is published and becomes a national bestseller. It contains thinly veiled accounts of the unseemly behavior of Hummingbird Hill's residents, upsetting everyone. Tacey rushes home and is reconciled with her husband. Hammond fires Harry and then Bill when he comes to defense of his friend. He decides to sue Belvedere, who is pleased, as he expects the action to increase already skyrocketing sales of his book. He hires Harry and Bill to defend him, then reveals the source of much of his information: Appleton. The informant flees, with Hammond and others in hot pursuit. Despite his new fame, Belvedere agrees to keep his job as the novel is only the first volume of a trilogy.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther wrote in ''The New York Times'' that while "The screen plays from Mr. Herbert are not conspicuous for their tax upon the brain", "Light in substance, but solid in humor, this material is handled dexterously by all who come anywhere near it - and especially, as we say, by Mr. Webb".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Clifton Webb Plays Baby Expert in 'Sitting Pretty', Fox Film Now at Roxy Theatre |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 11, 1948 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950CE1DF143DE03ABC4952DFB5668383659EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young "delightfully clever".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

== Awards==
* Clifton Webb was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the 1949 Academy Awards.
* F. Hugh Herbert won the Writers Guild of America, Best Written American Comedy in 1949.
* The movie won a Gold Medal at the Photoplay Awards 1948.

==Adaptions==
A radio adaptation was presented by ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' on February 14, 1949. The film also inspired the television series ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]'', starring [[Christopher Hewett]], which first aired in 1985.

'''''The Legend of Georgia McBride''''' is a 2015 American play written by Matthew Lopez.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/theater/review-the-legend-of-georgia-mcbride-from-elvis-impersonator-to-drag-queen.html?_r=0|title=Review: ‘The Legend of Georgia McBride,’ From Elvis Impersonator to Drag Queen|authorlink=Charles Isherwood|author=Isherwood, Charles|date=September 9, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-legend-georgia-mcbride-review-20170413-story.html|title=Pull off the wig and falsies, and 'Georgia McBride' hits its groove|authorlink=Charles McNulty|author=McNulty, Charles|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Casey, a young [[Elvis Presley]] impersonator barely making a living, finds a path to prosperity by becoming a [[lip sync|lip-syncing]] [[drag queen]]. He’s young, he’s broke, his landlord’s knocking at the door, and he’s just found out his wife is pregnant. To make matters even more desperate, Casey is fired from his gig as an Elvis impersonator in a run-down, small-town Florida bar. When the bar owner brings in a B-level drag show to replace his act, Casey finds that he has a whole lot to learn about show business—and himself.

==Productions==
The Legend of Georgia McBride premiered at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Center for the Performing Arts|url=https://www.denvercenter.org/|website=Denver Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2014.

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Tripods''''' is a series of [[Young adult fiction|young adult novels]] written by [[John Christopher]], beginning in 1967. The first two were the basis of a [[The Tripods (TV series)|science fiction TV series]], produced in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

==Synopsis==
The story of ''The Tripods'' is a variation on [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] literature, wherein humanity has been enslaved by "Tripods"&amp;nbsp;— gigantic three-legged walking machines, piloted by unseen alien entities (later identified as "[[#Masters|Masters]]"). Human society is largely pastoral, with few habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is conducted under the watchful presence of the Tripods. Lifestyle is reminiscent of the [[Middle Ages]], but small artefacts from the [[Modern history|Modern Age]] are still used, such as [[watch]]es.

Humans are controlled from the age of 14 by implants called "Caps", which suppress curiosity and creativity. Some people, whose minds are broken by the Caps, become vagrants. According to ''The City of Gold and Lead'', Masters begin to believe that humans should be capped at an earlier age "because some humans, in the year or two before they are Capped, become rebellious and act against the masters", but this cannot be done, because Capping must wait until the [[Neurocranium|braincase]] has stopped growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christopher|first=John|title=The City of Gold and Lead|year=2003|publisher=Simon Pulse|location=NY|isbn=0-689-85666-0|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==

===''The White Mountains'' (1967) ===
Life goes on largely as it had in the [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial era]], excepting that all adult humans are subject to Tripod control. Protagonist Will, a thirteen-year-old boy living in the (fictional) English village of Wherton, is looking forward to the next "Capping Day", until a chance meeting with a mysterious fake-capped man named Ozymandias&lt;ref&gt;In antiquity, Ozymandias was a Greek name for the [[Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]].&lt;/ref&gt; prompts him to discover a world beyond the Tripods' control. He is accompanied by his cousin Henry and a French teenager named Jean-Paul Deliet, nicknamed "Beanpole". The novel climaxes with Henry and Beanpole discovering that earlier, when Will had been captured by a Tripod, he had been unknowingly implanted with a tracking device. When Henry and Beanpole remove the device, a nearby Tripod attacks them, but the boys defeat the Tripod and eventually join the resistance, located in the eponymous White Mountains.

===''{{Visible anchor|The City of Gold and Lead}}'' (1968)===
After a year in the White Mountains, the resistance charges Will, Beanpole, and a German boy, Fritz, to infiltrate a Tripod city by competing in a regional sporting exhibition. Will, a boxer, and Fritz, a runner, win their respective contests, while Beanpole fails to win in the jumping events.

The winners are taken to the Tripod city in a pressurised dome astride a river. Inside the city, the boys discover the Tripods' operators, whom they refer to as the "Masters". Human males are slaves inside the cities, while beautiful females are killed and preserved for the Masters to admire. Slaves are furnished with breathing masks to survive the aliens' atmosphere, but are rapidly exhausted by the stronger artificial gravity and must therefore be periodically replaced. Although Fritz is abused by his Master, Will is treated as a privileged pet by his. Eventually, Will's Master reveals a plan to replace the Earth's atmosphere with the Masters' toxic air to enable full control of the Earth. When the Master finds Will's diary, Will kills him to maintain the secret. With the assistance of Beanpole, Will escapes, and they return to the White Mountains. The story's title refers to the gold colour prevalent in the Masters' cities, as well as the [[lead]]en weight of the increased gravity on the human slaves.

===''{{Visible anchor|The Pool of Fire}}'' (1968)===
Will and Fritz travel to Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Middle East to organize resistance against the Tripods. The resistance, having ambushed a Tripod and captured a Master, discover that alcohol has a strong [[sleep|soporific]] effect on them, and use this knowledge to simultaneously attack their cities. Having introduced alcohol into the aliens' city water systems, two raiding groups kill the Masters by forcing open airlocks and exposing the unconscious aliens to Earth's atmosphere; but the attack on the last city (located in [[Central America]]) fails. A secondary plan is undertaken using hot air balloons and newly developed [[Aerial bomb|bombs]]. The attack is initially unsuccessful as the timers on the bombs cause them to detonate either before making contact with the dome of the city, or after the bomb has fallen clear. Henry jumps from his balloon onto the city's domed roof and holds the bomb in place, killing himself but shattering the dome. Earth's atmosphere kills the Masters, and Henry is remembered as a hero.

Several years later The Masters' atmosphere-seeding spaceship arrives and destroys the remains of their cities, presumably to prevent the humans from [[reverse engineering]] their technology&amp;nbsp;— although Beanpole notes that they have already learned much from the cities&amp;nbsp;— then leaves. Modern human technology, which was halted during the Masters' rule is rediscovered rapidly, including the theory of space travel. The saga ends with the Resistance leader Julius being deposed, and as a result the alliance built during the resistance falls apart, with nationalistic hostilities appearing, each country going their separate ways in contrast to Julius' efforts to unite the world.

===''{{Visible anchor|When the Tripods Came}}'' (1988)===
''When the Tripods Came'' is a prequel written twenty years after the publication of the original trilogy. The plot follows the description of the conquest given in the second book of the main trilogy. Fearing the technological potential of humanity, the so-called "Masters", unable to defeat humanity in a conventional war, hypnotise people through a television show called ''The Trippy Show'', later using Caps to control them permanently. As in the original trilogy, the narrator of ''When the Tripods Came'' is a young English boy. As society slowly falls under the control of the Masters, he and his family escape to [[Switzerland]], which has mounted the longest-lasting resistance. When the Swiss are eventually enslaved, the narrator and his family establish the "White Mountains" resistance movement of the original trilogy.

=={{Visible anchor|Masters}}==
The "Masters" are first mentioned and seen in chapter 6 of ''[[#The City of Gold and Lead|The City of Gold and Lead]]''.

===Biology===
According to Will, the chief [[protagonist]]:

:"They stood much taller than a man, nearly twice as tall, and broad in proportion. Their bodies were wider at the bottom than the top, four or five feet around I thought, but tapered up to something like a foot in circumference at the head. If it ''was'' the head, for there was no break in the continuity, no sign of a neck. The next thing I noticed was that their bodies were supported not on two legs, but three, these being thick but short. They had matching them three arms, or rather [[tentacle]]s, issuing from a point halfway up their bodies. And their [[eye]]s&amp;nbsp;— I saw that there were three of those, too, set in a flattened triangle, one above and between the other two, a foot or so below the crown. In colour the creatures were green, though I saw that the shades differed, some being dark, the green tinged with brown, and other quite pallid. That, and the fact that their heights varied to some extent, appeared to be the only means of telling one from another. I felt it was a poor one.": "I thought the words issued from the mouth&amp;nbsp;— which I judged the lower of the two central orifices to be&amp;nbsp;— until I saw that it was the upper one which was quivering and open while the other remained closed and still. With the Masters, I was to discover, the organs of breathing and eating were not connected, as men's are: They spoke as well as breathed through one, ate and drank only through the lower, larger opening."

As well as physical differences to humans, the Masters display chemical ones. The air they breathe is thick and green, like a [[chlorine]] fog, although the precise composition of it is never revealed. The human [[Slavery|slaves]] of their city must wear specially provided [[Respirator|breathing apparatus]], although they are provided with their own atmosphere in cramped, but functional, living quarters. Unprotected exposure to the air of the city is quickly fatal, as is exposure to the Earth's atmosphere for the Masters. The apparatus provided for slaves depends on a kind of spongy cartridge that must be periodically replaced. Similarly, foods eaten by Masters and Slaves have nothing in common, with the exception of [[sugar]]s, although it is never revealed whether the Masters' food would be fatal to a human, or if the Masters are able to ingest normal Earth food.

''[[#The Pool of Fire|The Pool of Fire]]'' contained a subplot in which the capture and subsequent interrogation of a Master takes place. These events revealed that Masters can somehow sense harmful additions to their food, and will simply refuse to eat anything that contains [[drug]]s or [[poison]]s, with the exception of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]. It transpires that the Masters have a very low tolerance for this chemical, which later becomes an important plot point.

The Masters prefer high temperatures. Room temperature for them is somewhere around 40 degrees Celsius (about 105 degrees Fahrenheit). The pools in which they bathe are often extremely hot (described as "only just bearable"). This would indicate that their [[digestion|digestive]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] [[enzyme]]s are quite different from those found in terrestrial life.

A Master's preferred method of moving, described as a slapping hop on all three feet, is light and fast, completely untroubled by the incredible weight that their size must hold. As shown by this lightness in a heavy environment the Masters are, physically, extremely strong, able to easily lift a human male with just one of their three tentacles. Their skin is described as being damp, [[reptile|reptilian]] and leathery, thus very resilient to attack.

The Masters do have one crippling physical weakness. The area between their respiratory orifice and their ingestive orifice is extremely sensitive. A light brush to this area causes extreme pain. More forceful contact causes unconsciousness or death.

Only one form of disease appeared within the novels. This, called approximately "The Curse of the Skloodzi", evidently caused the Master sufficient discomfort as to preclude work; when Will's Master developed the ailment, he had Will retrieve him and return him to his home, where he used gas bubbles (see Technology) and his hot pool to at least ameliorate his discomfort. The ailment also caused his skin to discolour somewhat, becoming streaked with brown.

===Psychology===
The Masters are also different from human beings [[psychology|psychologically]]. They are completely incapable of lying, finding it difficult to tell the difference between a novel and a biography. As such they are extremely gullible, taking everything told to them as indisputable truth.

Their reaction to [[wiktionary:despair|despair]], as well, shows a marked difference. The Masters are incredibly tolerant of hardship and difficulty, to the point of becoming ill if they do not work hard. However, if they find themselves in a situation to which there is absolutely no escape, they die. It is unknown whether this is natural or some form of suicide. When the Masters' xenoforming ship turned back after discovering the success of the human rebellion, the last Master on Earth, a prisoner of the Freemen, died. It is not explained how it knew that it had been abandoned.

Masters have very little in the way of a social life. They spend most of their time in their own home. It is unlikely that Masters form any kind of [[nuclear family]]; throughout the books there is no mention of there being any more than one Master to an apartment.

On the rare occasions that they do meet with others, very little conversation or activity between the two takes place. There are various events and functions around their city&amp;nbsp;— communal baths, museums, and others that have no human equivalent&amp;nbsp;— but each Master will attend and enjoy these events on their own. Even when in close proximity to other Masters doing the same thing, they are unlikely to engage in any kind of social intercourse, and if they do then it will be short-lived and limited.

Several forms of recreation exist. One, The Sphere Chase, involves Masters in smaller versions of their Tripod vehicles chasing a glowing sphere, with the evident goal of directing it through an opening in the side of the arena. Others involve listening to strange (by human standards) sounds or watching strange lights.

Masters seem to appreciate alien beauty. They accept men and women into their cities, but only men serve as slaves. They kill and preserve the women, arranging them according to [[aesthetics]] of their own devising. In one exhibit, Will finds a girl he loved arranged with other women in the order of hair colour shades.

But this, and their habit of taking slaves generally, suggests that they do not hold life other than their own in high regard. Although some provision is made for slaves exhausted by heavy gravity to recover, slaves who become convinced they would not recover are programmed via their Caps (see Technology) to go to The Place of Happy Release. There, some form of energy kills them, and a moving belt carries the bodies to a furnace for incineration. The most profound indicator is their long term plan for Earth: en route from their home at the time of "The City of Gold and Lead" are spaceships containing components they cannot manufacture on Earth&amp;nbsp;— parts of great machines that will accept Earth's atmosphere and turn out an atmosphere like that found on the Masters' home and in their cities. Such a transformation would be eventually fatal to all life on Earth, except such few live specimens that the Masters are debating whether to house in zoos.

At least some Masters enjoy an [[Psychoactive drug|intoxicant]] they call (for the purposes of their slaves) a gas bubble. The master places the plastic bubble near his respiratory orifice, breaks it, and inhales the vapor. The effect is evidently mild; it takes several such bubbles to create personality changes noticeable to humans. Use of gas bubbles brings out latent personality traits in at least one Master.

The Masters are not of uniform character. Will's Master (the one whose personality is most explored in the trilogy) is something of an intellectual, constantly questioning and studying and learning. His reading of human literature awakens a loneliness, so he wishes to keep Will as a beloved pet. Fritz's Master, however, is a sadist, most interested in physical exertion as well as inflicting pain on whatever slave he happens to have at the moment. The captured prisoner, Ruki, the only Master to be named in the trilogy, is explored little. However, he is the only Master seen to display any understanding of humor and sarcasm.

===Technology===
The Masters power their city with a form of [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] that appears to uneducated and casual observers as a "pool of fire." This description lent itself to the title of the third novel. It is loosely inferred by the character Jean Paul (Beanpole) to be nuclear fusion. A concentric series of chambers located near the center of the city and below ground level house this apparatus; the various doors do not align, so it is necessary to travel around the perimeter of each chamber to the next entrance. Within the innermost chamber is a single lever that functions as a main breaker. Moving it from the operating position to the off position deactivates the mechanism, while moving it in the other direction reactivates it. Contact with this lever while the mechanism is operating proves instantly fatal to humans.

The most visible artefacts of the Masters are the Tripods, immense machines that walk the world outside their cities on three long legs. Described as hemispherical, with legs equidistant, the tripods can interact with the world using long, tentacle-like manipulators, each of which is capable of lifting and crushing a [[Challenger 1]] tank; this happens at their [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] meeting, as the tank plays the [[Anthem of Europe]]. At least some of these machines have chambers suited to Earth life, and can take individuals inside them for extended periods. When they reach age fourteen, individuals are taken inside a Tripod to be Capped: The machines visit larger towns, while people from smaller towns travel to nearby larger ones to be Capped. Tripods seem to follow a route consistently, but whether this is due to the psychology of their pilots or to some form of autopilot is never revealed. Among the facts inadvertently revealed to Will by his Master is the crew size&amp;nbsp;— four individuals.

Much of the Masters' industry appears highly [[automation|automated]]. Machines operating without supervision create everything from food and air to intoxicants. Among these are machines that create gravity at levels roughly twice that of Earth; this heaviness lent itself to the title of the second novel, "The City of Gold and Lead". According to Will's Master, this is less than the gravity enjoyed by the Masters on their home planet. It is not revealed if this is due to technical restrictions, energy saving, or because such extreme gravity would be very wearing on their human slaves.

The Masters' technology includes precision [[machining]] techniques. Their airlock doors fit so precisely that the seams are nearly invisible, and do not require gaskets or other flexible seals to compensate for imperfections.

They have the means to remove heat from objects, akin to air conditioning. Because of their water requirements, each of their cities straddles a major river. As part of treating the water before it leaves the city, mechanisms cool and filter it until it is very close to its original outside characteristics of temperature and composition.

Perhaps their greatest technological skill is in the area of [[mind control]]. They understand [[brain]] physiology to a high degree. In the fourth book, "[[#When the Tripods Came|When the Tripods Came]]" they capture at least one human for the purpose of [[dissection]]; the individual's corpse is discovered later, his brain neatly drained and removed. They later intercept broadcast [[television]] signals, and add their own additional signals to the feed; these signals contain hypnotic suggestions. While not universally effective, these suggestions affect sufficient numbers of people so that the Masters have a substantial base of support in their early invasion effort. Whatever the method, these signals can convey detailed technical data and some of the individuals under this control construct and distribute the first Caps.

Although their televised [[hypnosis]] is not permanent, control through a Cap evidently is, for as long as the Cap remains in place. Caps contain a fine mesh somewhat resembling an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The first versions resemble ordinary hats and can even be removed, although the individual wearing such a cap will never voluntarily remove it and will actively attempt to prevent others from doing so. Successful removal of a Cap sometimes causes the individual to react in bizarre ways, becoming irrational or breaking down in tears. In a later phase of the invasion, Tripods dispatched to various locations remove the temporary caps and replace them with Caps "married to the flesh" through some kind of [[Biological engineering|bioengineering]]. These Caps cannot be removed, although White Mountains resistance fighters eventually learn how to disable them by severing certain of the metal filaments. The Caps evidently depend on some form of transmission from within the cities of the Masters&amp;nbsp;— when resistance elements turn off the city power supplies, Capped individuals ceased to venerate and obey the masters. As earlier, some reacted irrationally to the loss of outside will, even to the point of [[suicide]].

Caps create a [[worship]]ful attitude toward the Masters, an unhesitating obedience so profound that the Masters do not fear bringing Capped humans into their cities, an overconfidence that eventually defeats them. According to "The White Mountains," about one person in twenty becomes a Vagrant due to some failure of the process. Will speculates that the Vagrants' brains attempt to resist the power of the Cap and eventually break under the strain. Vagrants are considered harmless (although this was not always true), but are generally unable to remain in one place for any length of time. Each community considers it a social responsibility to care for these unfortunates, who are unable to work, form families, or participate in most of society. Individuals seeking the resistance in the White Mountains are cautioned that if caught and Capped in a place where the natives spoke a different language, Vagrancy was almost certain, suggesting that each Cap receives and relays signals specific to expected thought processes of the wearer.

The Masters have a means of suppressing electrical activity at range. They disable a [[biplane]] attack on their [[Central America]]n city in this fashion.

===Home World===
Their Home World is briefly mentioned to Will by his Master as being larger and hotter than Earth, and consisting mostly of [[swamp]]s. Masters take care to bathe and wallow in water several times a day. The numerous pools in their domed cities compensate for this when the Masters are on Earth. Nothing is revealed about how much of the galaxy they have a hold on. The true name of their species is never revealed. The closest that is ever got to a name is "Skloodzi". Will comments that he is unsure whether this is his Master's name, his Master's family name, the name of his Master's race or the name of their species.

==Comic books==
Multiple graphic adaptations have been produced, notably including:

* ''[[Boys' Life]]'', The Boy Scouts of America magazine, serialised all three books in the trilogy from May 1981 to August 1986. Artist [[Frank Bolle]] drew the single page black and white proofs, which were then inked by another person.
* In 1985, the BBC initiated ''[[BEEB]]'', the [[BBC]] Junior Television Magazine, and started to present in picture strip form additional adventures of Will, Henry, and Beanpole on their way to the White Mountains, starting at some unspecified point during the fourth episode of the first BBC serial as the trio pass through ruined Paris, and then heading off at a tangent to the television version. From Issue 6, the boys were accompanied on their journey by a young woman named Fizzio, a character original to the strip. The strips were drawn by [[John M. Burns]] and in each issue, they consisted of three pages; the first two in colour and the third in black and white. The storyline was never concluded as ''BEEB'' ceased publication after only 20 issues.
* Masters were one of the species detailed in ''[[Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials]]''.

==Television series==
{{Main|The Tripods (TV series)}}
The television version of ''[[The Tripods (TV series)|The Tripods]]'' was jointly produced by the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Seven Network]] in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by [[Ken Freeman (composer)|Ken Freeman]]. The series was noted for being one of the first to feature computer generated graphics and special effects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Series one of ''The Tripods'', broadcast in 1984, which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the well-known author of many radio plays [[Alick Rowe]], covers the first book, ''The White Mountains''; the 12-episode second series (1985) covers ''The City of Gold and Lead''. Although a television script had been written for the third series, it never went into production.

The first series was released on both VHS and DVD. The BBC released ''Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2'' on DVD in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000R21294 |title=Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2 DVD |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |access-date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with the novels===
When the BBC made the television series of The Tripods in the 1980s, they departed from Christopher's description. The Masters somewhat resembled the Tripods they drove. This makes the Tripods seem much more like [[mecha]] than purely eccentric vehicles. In the BBC serial, the Masters did not need to eat, sleep or drink. Additionally, they were not the rulers of the city, but were, in turn, under the rule of beings made of pure energy, known as Cognoscs. The Masters came from a planet named Trion that was in the center of a [[Star system#Triple star systems|triple star system]].

The method by which the Masters name themselves is also different. Rather than having names, they are simply called by their address. Will's Master is called West Avenue 4, Sector 6, Level 8, or West 468.

The Masters in the BBC production did not breathe green air and did not prefer the high gravity and high temperature of those in the book, since these would have been extremely difficult or expensive to recreate onscreen at the time. Their treatment of the slaves, rather than being harsh and thoughtless, was reasonable to the point of being friendly, with luxuries provided for them.

To avoid an overuse of the mechanical Tripods, the producers invented a new faction, the "Black Guards", as a police force with the task to enforce the will of the masters. They served as a more immediate threat for Will, his friends and the resistance.

'''''Trancers''''' (also released as '''''Future Cop''''') is a 1984 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Charles Band]] and starring [[Tim Thomerson]], [[Helen Hunt]], and [[Art LaFleur]]. It is the first film in the [[Trancers (franchise)|''Trancers'' series]].

The film revolves around [[Jack Deth]] (Thomerson), a [[Philip Marlowe]]-esque police detective from the 23rd century who travels to the 1980s in order to bring his old nemesis to justice. The film portrays a unique method of [[time travel]]: People can travel back in time by injecting themselves with a [[drug]] that allows them to take over the body of an [[ancestor]].

==Plot==
Jack Deth ([[Tim Thomerson]]) is a police trooper in the year [[23rd century|2247]] who has been hunting down Martin Whistler, a criminal mastermind who uses [[psychic]] powers to turn people into mindless "trancers" and carry out his orders. Deth can identify a tranced individual by scanning them with a special bracelet. All trancers appear as normal humans at first, but once triggered, they become savage killers with twisted features.

Before he can be caught, Whistler escapes back in time using a drug-induced time-traveling technique. Whistler's consciousness leaves his body in 2247 and travels down his ancestral bloodline arriving in 1985 and taking over the body of an ancestor, a [[Los Angeles]] police [[detective]] named Weisling.

Once Deth discovers what Whistler has done, he destroys Whistler's body—effectively leaving him trapped in the past with no vessel to return to—and chases after him through time the same way. Deth ends up in the body of one of his ancestors: a journalist named Phil Dethton.

With the help of Phil's girlfriend—a [[punk rock]] girl named Leena ([[Helen Hunt]])—Deth goes after Whistler, who has begun to "trance" other victims. Whistler plots to eliminate the future governing council members of Angel City (the future name of [[Los Angeles]]), who are being systematically wiped out of existence by Whistler's murder spree of their own ancestors. Deth arrives too late to prevent most of the murders and can only safeguard Hap Ashby ([[Biff Manard]]), a washed-up former pro [[baseball]] player, who is the ancestor of the last surviving council member, Chairman Ashe ([[Anne Seymour (actress)|Anne Seymour]]).

Deth is given some high-tech equipment, which is sent to him in the past: his sidearm (which contains two hidden vials of time drugs to send him and Whistler back to the future), and a "long-second" wristwatch, which temporarily slows time, stretching one second to ten. The watch has only enough power for one use, but he later receives another watch to pull the same trick again.

During the end fight with Whistler, one of the drug vials in Jack's gun breaks, leaving only one vial to get home. Jack is forced to make a choice: kill the innocent Weisling (who is possessed by the evil Whistler), or use the vial to send Whistler back to 2247, which would strand Jack in the present. Jack chooses to inject Weisling with the vial, saving the lieutenant's life but condemning Whistler to an eternity without a body to return to. Jack then decides to remain with Leena in 1985, although observing him from the shadows is McNulty, his boss from the future, who has traveled down his own ancestral line, ending up in the body of a young girl.

A '''transporter''' is a fictional [[Teleportation#Star Trek|teleportation]] machine used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. Transporters convert a person or object into an [[energy]] pattern (a process called dematerialization), then "beam" it to a target, where it is reconverted into matter (rematerialization).  The term "transporter accident" is a catch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly.

According to ''The Making of Star Trek'', ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s original plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to land the starship itself. However, this would have required unfeasible and unaffordable sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while landing, taking off, etc.  The shuttlecraft was the next idea, but when filming began, the full-sized shooting model was not ready. Transporters were devised as a less expensive alternative, achieved by a simple [[fade (filmmaking)|fade-out/fade-in]] of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek: The Next Generation 365'' by Paula M. Block, Terry J. Erdmann&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete citation|date=September 2018}} Transporters first appear in the original pilot episode "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]". The transporter special effect, before being done using [[computer-generated imagery|computer animation]], was created by turning a slow-motion camera upside down and photographing some backlit shiny grains of aluminium powder that were dropped between the camera and a black background.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert F. Solow and Robert H. Justman, ''Inside Star Trek the real story'', 1996, {{ISBN|0-671-00974-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'', the three touch-sensitive light-up bars on the ''Enterprise''-D's transporter console were an homage to the three sliders used on the duotronic transporter console on the original ''Enterprise'' in ''The Original Series''.

In August 2008, physicist [[Michio Kaku]] predicted in ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' that a teleportation device similar to those in ''Star Trek'' would be invented within 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sledge, ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' Issue 3, {{ISSN|1793-5725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physics students at  University of Leicester  calculated that to "beam up" just the genetic information a single human cell, not the positions of the atoms, just the gene sequences, together with a "brain state" would take 4,850 trillion years assuming a 30 gigahertz microwave bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title=The trouble with teleportation: It could take quadrillions of years|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/trouble-teleportation-it-could-take-quadrillions-years-f6C10817487|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Eric Davis for the US Air Force Research Laboratory of speculative teleportation technologies showed that to dematerialize a human body by heating it up to a million times the temperature of the core of the sun so that the quarks lose their binding energy and become massless and can be beamed at the speed of light in the closest physics equivalent to the Star Trek teleportation scenario would require the equivalent of 330 megatons of energy. To meet the information storage and transmission requirements would require current computing capabilities to continue improve by a factor of 10 to 100 times per decade for 200 to 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Eric W.|title=Teleportation Physics Study - section 3.0 q-TELEPORTATION|url=https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf|pages=30 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction ==

=== History ===
According to dialogue in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' ("ENT") episode "[[Daedalus (Enterprise episode)|Daedalus]]", the transporter was invented in the early 22nd century by Dr. Emory Erickson, who also became the first human to be successfully transported. Although the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'' (NX-01)]] has a transporter, the crew does not routinely use it for moving biological organisms. (Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] once said that he wouldn't even put his [[Porthos (Star Trek)|dog]] through it.) Instead, they generally prefer using shuttlepods or other means of transportation unless no other means of transportation are possible or feasible. The capability is rare; in "[[The Andorian Incident]]", the [[Andorians]], technologically far superior to Starfleet in many regards, are explicitly stated not to possess the technology, and in "[[Chosen Realm]]", a group of alien religious extremists who hijack the ship is unaware of it to the point that when Archer, choosing himself after their leader insists on sacrificing a crew member, claims that the device disintegrates matter rather than teleporting it, he is unhesitatingly taken at his word.  The crew aboard the 23rd century [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] frequently use the transporter. By the [[24th century]], transporter travel was reliable and "the safest way to travel" according to dialogue in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') episode "[[Realm of Fear (TNG episode)|Realm of Fear]]".

According to the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Homefront (DS9 episode)|Homefront]]", [[Starfleet Academy]] cadets receive transporter rations, and the [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] family once used a transporter to move furniture into a new home.

Despite its frequent use, characters such as [[Leonard McCoy]] and [[Katherine Pulaski]] are reluctant to use the transporter, as the characters express in the ''Next Generation'' episodes "[[Encounter at Farpoint (TNG episode)|Encounter at Farpoint]]" and "[[Unnatural Selection (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unnatural Selection]]", respectively. [[Reginald Barclay]] expresses his outright fear of transporting in "[[Realm of Fear]]".

=== Capabilities and limitations ===
The television series and films do not go into great detail about transporter technology.  The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' claims that the devices transport objects in real time, accurate to the [[quantum realm|quantum level]]. The episode "Realm of Fear" specifies the length of a transport under unusual circumstances would last "... four or five seconds; about twice the normal time". This calculates the length of a typical transport as between 2 and 2.5 seconds and possibly less. Heisenberg compensators remove [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle|uncertainty]] from the subatomic measurements, making transporter travel feasible. Further technology involved in transportation include a computer pattern buffer to enable a degree of leeway in the process. When asked "How does the Heisenberg compensator work?" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, ''Star Trek'' technical adviser [[Michael Okuda]] responded: "It works very well, thank you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981892,00.html|title=Reconfigure the Modulators!|date=November 28, 1994|publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Original Series'' (''TOS'') writers' guide, the effective range of a transporter is 40,000 kilometers, although thick layers of rock can reduce this range (''TNG'': "[[Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Legacy]]"). The ''TOS'' episode "[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]" however, appears to indicate that the transporters' maximum range, during that time period in ''Star Trek'' history, is actually around 30,000 kilometers. Transporter operations have been disrupted or prevented by dense metals (''TNG'': "[[Contagion (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Contagion]]"), solar flares (''TNG'': "[[Symbiosis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Symbiosis]]"), and other forms of radiation, including electromagnetic (''TNG'': "[[The Enemy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Enemy]]"; ''TNG'': "[[Power Play (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Power Play]]") and nucleonic (''TNG'': "[[Schisms (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Schisms]]"), and affected by ion storms (''TOS'': "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]"). Transporting, in progress, has also been stopped by telekinetic powers (''TNG'': "[[Skin of Evil (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Skin of Evil]]") and by brute strength (''TNG'': "[[The Hunted (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Hunted]]"). The ''TNG'' episode "[[Bloodlines (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Bloodlines]]" features a dangerous and experimental "[[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] transporter" capable of interstellar distances and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] had the ability to transport over great distances (''DS9'': "[[Covenant (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Covenant]]").  The 40,000-kilometer limit is also referenced in ''ENT'': "[[Daedalus (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Daedalus]]".

[[Starfleet]] transporters from the ''TNG'' era onward include a device that can detect and disable an active weapon (''TNG'': "[[The Most Toys (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Most Toys]]"), and a bio-filter to remove contagious [[microbes]] or [[viruses]] from an individual in transport (''TNG'': "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", ''TOS'': "[[The Naked Time]]"). The transporter can also serve a tactical purpose, such as beaming a photon grenade or [[photon torpedo]] to detonate at remote locations (''TNG'': "[[Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Legacy]]", ''{{abbr|VOY|Star Trek: Voyager}}'': "[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]"), or to outright destroy objects (''TNG'': "[[Captain's Holiday]]").  The ''TOS'' episode "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]" mentions Vendikar materializing fusion bombs over targets of enemy planet Eminiar VII in the course of theoretical computer warfare.

Whenever a person or object is transported, the machine creates a memory file of the pattern.  This has been used at least once in every ''Star Trek'' series to revert people adversely affected by a transport to their original state.

Various episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' ("DS9") and ''Voyager'' ("VOY") have introduced two anti-transporter devices:  transport inhibitors and transporter scramblers.  Inhibitors prevent a transporter beam from "locking on" to whatever the device is attached.  Scramblers distort the pattern that is in transit, literally scrambling the atoms upon rematerialization, resulting in the destruction of inanimate objects and killing living beings by rematerializing them as masses of random tissue; this was gruesomely demonstrated in the ''DS9'' episode "[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]".

Transporter operations can also be curtailed when either the point of origin and/or the intended target site is moving at warp velocities.  In the ''TNG'' episode, "[[The Schizoid Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Schizoid Man]]", a "long-range" or "near-warp" transport was required as a transporter beam cannot penetrate a warp field. (In the 2009 ''Star Trek'' film Kirk and Scotty beam aboard while the ''Enterprise'' is traveling at warp, however, the movie takes place in an alternate continuity, thus not affecting the Prime Continuity used in all previous media and the ''Star Trek'' Online computer game.) To deposit an away team on the planet Gravesworld while at the same time responding to a distress signal, the ''Enterprise'' would only drop out of warp drive just long enough to energize the transporter beam.  [[Geordi La Forge]] personally performed the delicate operation, which involved compensating for the ship's relativistic motion.  After materializing, Deanna Troi commented that for a moment she thought she was trapped in a nearby wall, to which Worf replied, "For a moment, you were."  In later stories ("[[The Emissary (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Emissary]]" and "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]"), it was confirmed that the transporter would work at warp only if the sending and receiving sites were moving at equal velocities.

In his book ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'',  after explaining the difference between transporting information and transporting the actual atoms, Krauss notes that "The ''Star Trek'' writers seem never to have got it exactly clear what they want the transporter to do. Does the transporter send the atoms and the bits, or just the bits?" He notes that according to the canon definition of the transporter the former seems to be the case, but that that definition is inconsistent with a number of applications, particularly incidents, involving the transporter, which appear to involve only a transport of information, for example the way in which it splits Kirk into two versions in the episode "[[The Enemy Within (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Enemy Within]]" or the way in which Riker is similarly split in the episode "[[Second Chances (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Second Chances]]". Krauss elaborates that: "If the transporter carries both the matter stream and the information signal, this splitting phenomenon is impossible. The number of atoms you end up with has to be the same as the number you began 
with. There is no possible way to replicate people in this manner. On the other hand, if only the information were beamed up, one could imagine combining it with atoms that might be stored aboard a starship and making as many copies as you wanted of an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Krauss (1995), ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'',  Basic Books, {{ISBN|978-0465002047}}, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transporter accidents====
Aside from external influences causing disruptions in the normal operations of transporters, the technology itself has been known to fail on occasion, causing serious injury or usually death to those being transported. This was demonstrated in Star Trek's 1979 film debut, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' when a malfunction in the transporter sensor circuits resulted in insufficient signal being present at the ''[[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' end to successfully rematerialize the two subjects, and [[Starfleet]] was unable to pull them back to where they had dematerialized from. The transporter system attempted to rematerialize what little signal was available, and despite the efforts of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], the system failed and both subjects vanished from the transporter pad. Kirk, visibly shaken by what he had witnessed asked, "Starfleet, do you have them?", to which the response was made "''Enterprise'', what we got back didn't live long, fortunately".

By the time of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', transporter technology has advanced considerably, meaning that accidents are now remote, if not near impossible. In the episode "[[Realm of Fear]]", [[Geordi La Forge]] states that there have been no more than two or three transporter accidents in the preceding 10 years. Reference is also made to the advancement of transporter technology in the same episode, where [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Chief O'Brien]] states that each individual transporter pad has four redundant scanners whereby in the event a scanner fails the other three will take over, and that he has never lost anyone having been a transporter operator for over twenty years.

In "[[Rascals (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Rascals]]", several adult Enterprise crew members were beamed off a shuttle and re materialized as children still in their adult sized clothing, the incoming "matter stream" had a commensurate drop in mass, the operator had initially thought the reduction in mass meant "we may have lost one".

In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' episode "[[Tuvix]]", a transporter accident combines both the physical and behavioral aspects of [[Tuvok|Lt. Tuvok]] and [[Neelix]] into a single being wearing a melange of each other's clothing. Notably, Tuvix was of equal mass of both Tuvok and Neelix combined. When they were later separated, Neelix and Tuvok were both wearing Starfleet uniforms.

====Technological and scientific restrictions====
While several characters have asserted that transporters cannot transport through a ship's [[shields (Star Trek)|shields]] or planetary defense shields, there are instances of this "rule" being broken through a [[technobabble]] solution (''TNG'': "[[The Wounded (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Wounded]]", ''DS9'': "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]") or disregarded by the show's writers (''Voyager'': "[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]"). The non-canon ''TNG Technical Manual'' describes how a starship may create "windows" in the shield geometry through which a transporter beam may propagate at the expense of creating weak spots in the vessel's defensive field.

In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', [[Vice Admiral (Star Trek)|Vice Admiral]] [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Lieutenant (Star Trek)|Lieutenant]] [[Saavik]] carry on a conversation during rematerialization. In ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', Dr. Gillian Taylor jumps into Kirk's transporter beam during dematerialization, and rematerializes without any apparent ill effects. This is probably due to the "annular confinement beam", a component of the transporter mentioned in the various television episodes which serves to keep patterns separate from one another. In the same film, Mr. Spock is beamed onto a cloaked ship while walking.

According to the ''TNG Technical Manual'', the transporter cannot move [[antimatter]], but in the ''Voyager'' episode "[[Dark Frontier]]" ''Voyager'' transported a live photon torpedo equipped with antimatter onto a Borg ship. Also in ''TOS'' episode "[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]" Kirk and a fellow crewman beam down to the surface of a planet with an antimatter bomb. The ''TAS'' episode "[[One of Our Planets Is Missing]]" has the ''Enterprise'' beaming a chunk of antimatter into a stasis box.

[[Image:Transporter3.jpg|thumb|right|Transporter chamber and control console aboard USS ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]'']]
In the original series, beaming to and from the transporter chamber was a necessity. This is explained in the ''TOS'' episode "[[Day of the Dove]]". Spock and Scotty had said that doing a site-to-site transport, as they are referred to on the show, on board the ship could be risky. They could beam into a deck or other inanimate object and get stuck there. However, there are apparently safeguards in place to prevent people from being beamed into hostile environments such as under water and into lava pits, although it is possible to override this safety feature; for example, in the ''TOS'' episode "[[And the Children Shall Lead]]", two security guards are beamed into open space. In the following series, however, the transporter room seems to become mostly obsolete, the actual equipment notwithstanding. Characters are shown activating the transporter from ordinary consoles and beaming from place to place without apparent trouble. The main operator can likewise send those in transport anywhere with ease (for example, in the ''Voyager'' episode "[[In the Flesh (Star Trek: Voyager)|In the Flesh]]", a medical console is used to transport a body from the morgue to the surgical bay). A possible explanation for this is put forward in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual]]'', where such site-to-site transports would probably use twice as much energy as would be required for transport to or from the transporter room itself, since the subject would have to be beamed to the transporter, stored, then shunted to their destination. In addition, the six circles on the platform are generally used as targets for the subjects to stand on, but they do not appear to represent any limitation of the hardware to six or fewer people. People have been transported carrying others, in a coffin style transport, as well as animals, hay, and various inanimate objects.

Dialogue in ''Deep Space Nine'' indicates the existence of portable transporters, but these are never seen. The ''Next Generation'' episode "[[Timescape (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Timescape]]" features emergency transporter armbands, although these may have served only to activate a remote transporter. To confuse things more, ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' featured the prototype "emergency transport unit". Tom Paris uses a portable transporter in the  ''Voyager'' episode "[[Non Sequitur (Star Trek: Voyager)|Non Sequitur]]". However, in ''Star Trek: Into Darkness'', Khan Noonien Singh uses a portable transporter to beam from a helicopter to the Klingon home world.

For special effects reasons, in ''TOS'', people generally appear immobilized during transport, with the exception of Kirk in the episode "[[That Which Survives]]". However, by ''TNG'', characters can move within the confines of the transporter beam while being transported, although this is rarely shown. Persons being transported are at least sometimes able to perceive the functioning of the transporter while they are in transit. In the ''TOS'' episode "[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]", the ''Enterprise'' transporter malfunctions while transporting Scotty from the disabled USS ''Constellation'' to the ''Enterprise'' due to a power drain, and Scotty's pattern is nearly lost in transit. As soon as he successfully materializes, Scotty asks the transporter operator with concern, "What's the matter with that thing?" and orders the transporter to be taken offline for emergency repair.

Some species do not use transporter technology for a variety of reasons. In the first appearance of Trill in the ''TNG'' episode "[[The Host (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Host]]", Trill were unable to be transported, once joined with a symbiont. It seems that was due to the symbiont being detected and removed by the transporter technology as an infestation in the host. Odan, the Trill host in this episode, is reluctant to say why he will not travel this way, and it only becomes apparent that he is carrying a symbiont when he is later injured. All the crew of the ''Enterprise'' react as if they have had no contact with this species before. It later becomes apparent that joined Trill have been working in the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] for some time.

== In popular culture ==
The famous [[catchphrase]] "[[Beam me up, Scotty]]" refers to the transporter device, which was often operated by chief engineer [[Montgomery Scott]] during the original series. The phrase was never uttered by anyone in the original series, although the lines "Scotty, beam us up" and "Beam me up" were spoken by Captain Kirk in that series. "Scotty, beam me up" was spoken by Admiral Kirk in ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home''.  On the special edition DVD of ''Star Trek IV'', the text commentary provided by Michael and Denise Okuda (co-authors of ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'' and ''The Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future'') indicates that this was the closest anyone came to using that catchphrase in an official ''Star Trek'' production.

The '''Urdu movement''' was a socio-[[political movement]] aimed at making [[Urdu]] the universal language and symbol of the cultural and political identity of the [[Muslim]] communities of the South Asia during the [[British Raj]]. The movement began with the fall of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the mid-19th century, fuelled by the [[Aligarh Movement]] of [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]]. It strongly influenced the [[All India Muslim League]] and the [[Pakistan movement]].

==Hindi-Urdu controversy==
{{see also|Hindi-Urdu controversy|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan}}
[[Image:SAKhan.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sir Syed in his later years, wearing official decorations.]]
The [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] arose in 1867 when the British government prepared to accept the demand of the [[Hindu]] communities of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]) and [[Bihar]] to change the [[Perso-Arabic script]] of the official language to [[Devanagari]] and adopt [[Hindi]] as the second official language on demand of [[Hindutva|Hindu activist]]s. [[Muslim politician]] [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]] became the most vocal opponent of this change.&lt;ref name="Urdu"&gt;{{cite web

Having been developed by Muslim rulers of India, Urdu was used as a secondary language to [[Persian language|Persian]], the [[official language]] of the Mughal court.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the [[Scientific Society of Aligarh]] translated Western works only into Urdu.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; Sir Syed considered Urdu to be "a common legacy of Hindus and Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent, Yusuf Abbasi, 1981, page 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu-medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by [[Hindus]] was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India.&lt;ref name="SAAG9"&gt;{{cite web

Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that "Urdu was the language of [[gentry]] and of people of high social standing, whereas Hindi was to be the vulgar."&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders and advocates of Hindi. ".&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent, Yusuf Abbasi, 1981, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindus unified across the region to demand the recognition of Hindi. The success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of the Muslim intellectual and political class.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; His educational and political work grew increasingly centred on and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give it extensive official use and patronage.

==Urdu in Muslim politics==
{{see also|Aligarh Movement|Pakistan movement}}
Sir Syed's call for the adoption of Urdu as the language of Indian Muslims won extensive support from the [[Aligarh Movement]] and Muslim religious activists of the [[Deobandi]] and [[Wahabbi]] schools. Muslim religious and political leaders [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] developed organisations such as the [[Urdu Defence Association]] and the [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu]], committed to the perpetuation of Urdu.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; Sir Syed's protege [[Shibli Nomani]] led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the [[official language]] of the [[Hyderabad State]] and as the medium of instruction in the [[Osmania University]]. This political campaign was criticised for making the use of Urdu a political issue that served as a wedge between Muslims and Hindus, who saw Sir Syed's advocacy as an effort to re-establish Muslim hegemony.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yusuf"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu became an integral part of political identity and communal separatism. The division over the use of Hindi or Urdu would further fuel communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.&lt;ref name="Urdu" /&gt; The [[All India Muslim League]] and the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] projected Urdu as essential for the political and cultural survival of [[Islamic culture|Islamic society]] in India. Muslim politicians like [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] emphasised Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and political identity. The political cause of Urdu became a core issue at the heart of the ''[[Two-Nation Theory]]'', which advocated that Muslims and Hindus were irreconcilably separate nations. Advocates of the [[Pakistan movement]] sought to make Urdu a key argument in drawing distinctions with India's Hindu-majority population. Muslim religious leaders such as [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]] and [[Maulana Maududi]] emphasised the knowledge of Urdu as essential for ordinary and religious Muslims.

==Urdu in Pakistan and India==
[[Image:Shaheed minar Roehl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]], or the Martyr's monument, located near [[Dhaka Medical College]], commemorates the struggle for [[Bengali language]].]]
In Pakistan, Urdu has been so far, the [[National language]] and the [[Lingua franca]], while English holds the status of the [[official language]] of the state. However, this policy caused considerable political turmoil in [[East Bengal]], which was home to [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-speaking population who constituted the majority of the population of Pakistan. Jinnah, most West Pakistani politicians emphasised that only Urdu would be recognised officially. This intensified the cultural and political gulf between [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]]. The [[Awami League|East Pakistan Awami Muslim League]] (the predecessor of the [[Awami League]]), established by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]], [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] in 1949 would lead the demand for the recognition of Bengali. Intensifying protests and strikes led by political groups, unions and students groups would lead to the imposition of [[martial law]]. The killing of protesting students by police in 1952 triggered a massive wave of protests in the province, which would come to be known as the [[Bengali Language Movement]]. Although politicians like [[Khwaja Nazimudin]] supported the cause of Urdu, a vast majority of Bengali nationalists saw the government policy as a symbol of racial discrimination. This wedge in Pakistani society would ultimately lead to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and the establishment of [[Bangladesh]] in 1971.

Independent India adopted Urdu as one of its 23 scheduled languages although its counterpart, Hindi, enjoys the status of official language. Urdu is also officially recognised by the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], Uttar Pradesh, [[Telangana]], Bihar and [[Delhi]]. Urdu is widely used by Indian Muslims across the country and there are a large number of Urdu-medium schools, colleges and universities, including madrassahs, the [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] and the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. Urdu is also a part of popular culture, media and publications. Numerous Urdu language films have been produced, which include ''Umrao Jaan'', ''[[Shatranj Ke Khiladi (film)|Shatranj Ke Khiladi]]'' and ''[[Pakeezah]]''.

Despite being given the status of a scheduled language, there have been concerns that the Urdu language has largely been on a decline in India. This decline has been attributed to reasons such as lack of promotional policies by central language regulation boards, the promulgation and preference of Urdu's counterpart [[Hindi]] as the Indian union's official language since 1950, the higher number of Hindi-speakers in India leading to the suppression of Urdu, the partition of India and Urdu's national language status in Pakistan overshadowing the language's prospects in India, as well as the lack of many schools in India teaching Urdu as a medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/954-urdu-in-india-victim-of-Hindu-nationalism-Muslim-separatism-part-i|title=Urdu in India: victim of Hindu nationalism &amp; Muslim separatism – i|work=[[The Milli Gazette]]|first=Syed|last=Shahabuddin|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is influenced by the theories of [[Karl Marx]], and many other revolutionary activists and artists who have been struggling against the forces of [[capitalism]]. 

Rudd has been producing art for over twenty years. He was a musician, mostly as a drummer, bass guitarist and keyboardist in bands Cheezlekane (1993 to 2002), Seconds (2001 to 2007) and Granma (2005 to 2006). One of the first protest marches he attended was for Melbourne's public [https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/victorian-transport-workers-strike transport workers in 1997] with his younger brother, Rad.

For many of his younger years, he was involved in numerous creative projects with Rad including film making and acting. As a drummer, Rudd joined a Brisbane-based indie pop-rock band called Cheezlekane in the early 1990s with members Patrick Devery (lead vocals), Cameron Peterson (bass guitar) and Nick Stamford (guitar). They played many pub gigs in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne and gained interest from [[Geffen Records]] in 1998 due to their first 4-track produced album called Knee High Fidelity. With musician friends Iain Wilson, Ritchie Giliberto and Mark Buggy, Rudd formed the band Seconds with his brother Rad as lead singer. He also was a keyboardist in a band called Stalis Vetch with Rad. He has a partner and experienced youth worker of [[Chilean Australian|Chilean heritage]], Tania; daughter, Loyola; and son, Manolo.

== Finalist in Metro Art Competition (2004) ==
In 2004 Rudd was selected as a finalist in the 2004 [http://www.metrogallery.com.au/ Metro Art Competition] with a realist-style artwork depicting a combined version of paintings by Albert Tucker and Jeffery Smart .

== The Carriers Project (2004 to 2007) and Controversy ==
In 2004, as Rudd's paintings became more politicized, he decided that exhibiting his large paintings inside galleries wasn't going to reach large audiences, so he began carrying them in public. He was to call this [http://www.multiculturalarts.com.au/events2007/vanrudd.shtml The Carriers Project]. He entered the project in various festivals based in Melbourne including [[Melbourne Fringe Festival|Fringe]] and later the [[Big West Festival]], and it later culminated in a national tour of Australia through [http://www.multiculturalarts.com.au/events2007/vanrudd.shtml kultour]. Some of his paintings depicting 'exploding terrorists' created unease with authorities in [https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rudds-nephew-faced-arrest/news-story/a0a23fb65dddda105fec6f7ef0fb1802?sv=d3ff0b7a6fb98b42aac8f6fdf2957d94 Brisbane] and Perth. He claims he was adding valuable commentary about the anti-terror laws in Australia. It was a coincidence that, in 2007, while Rudd was in Perth completing his national tour, that his uncle Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister of Australia.  

== Pro-Palestinian Artwork Censored in Footscray (2006) ==
In 2006, Rudd created an artwork called 'Portrait of an Exploding Terrorist'. It was a combined painting and billboard piece in one. He carried the painting around the streets of Melbourne, while exhibiting a large piece on the public billboard at [http://www.trocaderoartspace.com.au/ Trocadero Art Space, Footscray.]It wasn't long before the local council demanded the billboard piece be removed, claiming it constituted litter. Gallery director Michael Brennan and Rudd were forced to remove the piece to avoid paying a large fine. The piece was critical of the State of Israel and argued that it inflicted terror upon the Palestinian people. 

==Hugo Chávez mural (2007)==
In 2007 Rudd created an artwork depicting a large mural on a gallery wall at Trocadero Art Space in Footscray with signatories of Australians who supported a visit to the country by [[Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]]. It was titled "Smells Like Sulphur: A Tribute to Venezuela and the Art of Telling Bush to Piss Off", referencing Chavez' [[UN General Assembly]] speech the previous year, when he called former [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] "the devil".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news.asp?sId=159968 Controversial petition a work of art] ''Arts Hub,'' 4 June 2007. Retrieved 21 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rudd submitted an oil painting titled '100 000 to 400 000' to the [https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize Sunshine Coast Art Prize]. The painting was awarded a second prize and artist Tony Albert won the main prize. The local media tried to whip up [https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/dont-tell-uncle-kev/328769/ controversy] around Rudd's painting because it showed a U.S flag burning. 

==Banksy homage (2008)==
In 2008 the [[City of Melbourne]] rejected a painting by Rudd depicting [[Ronald McDonald]] setting fire to [[Thích Quảng Đức]] with the Olympic torch. According to Rudd, the artwork was a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to British [[street art]]ist [[Banksy]] and a comment on [[human rights]] abuses in the run-up to the [[2008 Olympic Games]]. Rudd accused the City of Melbourne of political censorship which they denied, claiming he was solely picked to feature in the [[Ho Chi Minh City]] exhibition for his [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] heritage.&lt;ref name= Rudd /&gt;

==Connex controversy (2009)==
In 2009 Rudd made an artwork critical of [[Connex Melbourne|Connex]]'s parent company [[Veolia Environnement]]'s light rail contract which is to link [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[West Bank]] with [[Jerusalem]]. The artwork was displayed at [[Platform artists group|Platform Artists Group]]'s public gallery, adjacent to [[Flinders Street Station]], a major train station in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{

IN 2009 Rudd exhibited in Melbourne a used part from an Afghan civilian car, purportedly destroyed by an [[International Security Assistance Force]] missile in Southern [[Afghanistan]]. It accompanied a price tag of $1.2 billion. Rudd estimated the value based on what he believed was "the astronomical price paid by victims of war".

[[Image:Fast food 01 ebru.jpg|thumb|[[Fast food]] is a typical example of food consumed in standard American diet.]]

The '''Western pattern diet''' (WPD) or '''standard American diet''' (SAD) is a modern dietary pattern that is generally characterized by high intakes of [[red meat]], [[processed meat]], [[Convenience food|pre-packaged foods]], [[butter]], [[fried foods]], high-fat [[Dairy product|dairy products]], [[chicken eggs|eggs]], [[refined grain]]s, [[potatoes]], [[Maize|corn]] (and [[High-fructose corn syrup]]) and [[high-sugar drink]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid16469985 /&gt; The modern standard American diet was brought about by fundamental [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes following  the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and, later, the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Carrera&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrera-Bastos|first1=Pedro|last2=Fontes|last3=O'Keefe|last4=Lindeberg|last5=Cordain|title=The western diet and lifestyle and diseases of civilization|journal=Research Reports in Clinical Cardiology|date=March 2011|pages=15|doi=10.2147/RRCC.S16919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, a [[healthy diet]] has higher proportions of unprocessed fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole-grain foods, poultry, and fish.&lt;ref name="Hu2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Frank B|date=February 2002|title=Dietary pattern analysis: a new direction in nutritional epidemiology|journal=Curr Opin Lipidol|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–9|pmid=11790957|doi=10.1097/00041433-200202000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11124751" /&gt;

A review of eating habits in the United States in 2004 found that about 75% of restaurant meals were from [[Fast food restaurant|fast-food restaurants]]. Nearly half of the meals ordered from a menu were [[hamburger]], [[French fries]], or [[poultry]] &amp;mdash; and about one third of orders included a [[Soft drink|carbonated beverage drink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lobb |first=Annelena |title=Eating Habits -- A Look At the Average U.S. Diet |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 17, 2005 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112671039063140472 |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 2008, the per capita consumption of calories increased by nearly one-quarter in the United States and about 10% of all calories were from [[high-fructose corn syrup]].&lt;ref name="Grist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Philpott |first=Tom |title=The American diet in one chart, with lots of fats and sugars |work=Industrial Agriculture |publisher=Grist |date=April 5, 2011 |url=http://www.grist.org/industrial-agriculture/2011-04-05-american-diet-one-chart-lots-of-fats-sugars |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans consume more than 13% of their daily calories in the form of [[added sugar]]s. Beverages such as flavored water, soft drinks, and sweetened caffeinated beverages make up 47% of these added sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/#figure-2-3-desc-toggle|title=A Closer Look at Current Intakes and Recommended Shifts - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans ages 1 and above consume significantly more added sugars, oils, saturated fats, and sodium than recommended in the Dietary Guidelines outlined by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. 89% of Americans consume more sodium than recommended. Additionally, excessive consumption of oils, saturated fats, and added sugars is seen in 72%, 71%, and 70% of the American population, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/current-eating-patterns-in-the-united-states/#figure-2-1-desc-toggle|title=Current Eating Patterns in the United States - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers began turning to [[margarine]] due to concerns over the high levels of [[saturated fat]]s found in butter. By 1958, margarine had become more commonly consumed than butter, with the average American consuming 8.9 pounds of margarine per year.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2016/july/butter-and-margarine-availability-over-the-last-century/|title=USDA ERS - Butter and Margarine Availability Over the Last Century|website=www.ers.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margarine is produced by refining vegetable oils, a process that introduces trans elaidic acid not found naturally in food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordain|first=Loren|last2=Eaton|first2=S.

Vegetable consumption is low among Americans, with only 13% of the population consuming the recommended amounts. Boys ages 9 to 13 and girls ages 14 to 18 consume the lowest amounts of vegetables relative to the general population. Potatoes and tomatoes, which are key components of many meals, account for 39% of the vegetables consumed by Americans. 60% of vegetables are consumed individually, 30% are included as part of a dish, and 10% are found in sauces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/#figure-2-3-desc-toggle|title=A Closer Look at Current Intakes and Recommended Shifts - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole grains should consist of over half of total grain consumption, and refined grains should not exceed half of total grain consumption. However, 85.3% of the cereals eaten by Americans are produced with [[refined grains]], where the germ and bran are removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/#figure-2-3-desc-toggle|title=A Closer Look at Current Intakes and Recommended Shifts - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain refining increases shelf life and softens breads and pastries; however, the process of refining decreases its nutritional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/whole-grains/|title=Whole Grains|date=2014-01-24|work=The Nutrition Source|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==
Based on epidemiological studies, compared to a [[healthy diet]], the Western pattern diet is positively correlated with an elevated incidence of [[obesity]],&lt;ref name="pmid11124751" /&gt; death from heart disease, cancer (especially [[colon cancer]]),&lt;ref name="pmid16990408" /&gt; and other "Western pattern diet"-related diseases.&lt;ref name="Gary Taubes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18574045" /&gt; There is an evolutionary mismatch between the ancient physiology of humans and a Western pattern diet; this underlies [[diseases of civilization]], which include [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type II diabetes]], [[Epithelium|epithelial cell]] cancers, [[autoimmune disease]], [[osteoporosis]], [[hypertension]], [[coronary artery disease]], and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name=Carrera/&gt; There is also a correlation between a Western pattern diet and an increase in inflammatory diseases, which is particularly evident in relation to fiber and fat-content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorburn|first1=AN|last2=Macia|first2=L|last3=Mackay|first3=CR|title=Diet, metabolites, and "western-lifestyle" inflammatory diseases.|journal=Immunity|date=19 June 2014|volume=40|issue=6|pages=833–42|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2014.05.014|pmid=24950203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high level of [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s compared to [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s in the Western diet is believed to contribute to [[autoimmune]] and [[Inflammation|inflammatory diseases]], as well as [[cancer]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3181/0711-MR-311 |title=The Importance of the Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio in Cardiovascular Disease and Other Chronic Diseases |year=2008 |last1=Simopoulos |first1=Artemis P. |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |volume=233 |issue=6 |pages=674–88 |pmid=18408140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acne]] is one of the inflammatory diseases which is increased by the Western pattern diet, due to too much [[carbohydrate]]s with high [[glycemic load]] such as [[white sugar|refined sugars]] or [[refined grains|refined starches]], [[milk]] and [[dairy product]]s, and [[trans fat]]s and [[saturated fat]]s, along with a deficiency in [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Melnik |first1=Bodo C. |editor1-last=Weinberg |editor1-first=Jeffrey |title=Linking diet to acne metabolomics, inflammation, and comedogenesis: an update. |journal=[[Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology]] |date=July 15, 2015 |volume=2015:8 |pages=371-88 |doi=10.2147/CCID.S69135 |pmid=26203267 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26203267 |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=[[Dove Medical Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple studies associating the Western pattern diet with heart disease.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumgart|first=Daniel C|last2=Sandborn|first2=William J|title=Crohn's disease|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60026-9|journal=The Lancet|volume=380|issue=9853|pages=1590–1605|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(12)60026-9|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simopoulos|first=Artemis P.|date=2002-12-01|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=21|issue=6|pages=495–505|doi=10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248|issn=0731-5724|pmid=12480795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heidemann|first=Christin|last2=Schulze|first2=Matthias B.|last3=Franco|first3=Oscar H.|last4=van Dam|first4=Rob M.|last5=Mantzoros|first5=Christos S.|last6=Hu|first6=Frank B.|date=2008-07-15|title=Dietary patterns and risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes in a prospective cohort of women|journal=Circulation|volume=118|issue=3|pages=230–237|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.771881|issn=1524-4539|pmc=2748772|pmid=18574045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the INTERHEART study, funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research, concluded that risk of a [[myocardial infarction]] is 30% higher for individuals who consume a Western pattern diet than individuals who consume a prudent diet.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A second study conducted in 2008 by ''Circulation'' also concluded that the Western pattern diet increases the risk of [[cardiovascular]] mortality in healthy US women.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; With that, meta-analyses and surveys in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology have associated [[cardiovascular disease]] and/or [[Coronary Heart Disease|coronary heart disease]] with refined carbohydrates, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats, three major components of the Western pattern diet.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
The western-versus-eastern dichotomy has become less relevant as such a diet is no longer "foreign" to any global region (just as traditional East Asian cuisine is no longer "foreign" to the west), but the term is still a well-understood shorthand in medical literature, regardless of where the diet is found. Other dietary patterns described in the medical research include "drinker" and "meat-eater" patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid16990408" /&gt;  Because of the variability in diets, individuals are usually classified not as simply "following" or "not following" a given diet, but instead by ranking them according to how closely their diets line up with each pattern in turn. The researchers then compare the outcomes between the group that most closely follows a given pattern to the group that least closely follows a given pattern.

More recently, food processors began replacing sugar with [[high-fructose corn syrup]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The '''''Wild Cat''''' is a fictional green two-masted [[schooner]] that [[Captain Flint#In other works|Captain Flint]], the Swallows, the Amazons and Peter Duck sail to the [[West Indies]] in [[Arthur Ransome]]'s [[Swallows and Amazons series|Swallows and Amazons]] book ''[[Peter Duck]]''. She also appears in the opening chapters of ''[[Missee Lee]]''.
The ship would have been about 50 [[Foot (length)|ft]] (15 m) long. In the book and the illustrations there is no mention of a [[head (watercraft)|head]]. This is typical of Arthur Ransome's reticence on the issue. 

The name is taken from Wild Cat Island which features in all the [[Swallows and Amazons series|books]] set in the [[Lake District]]. She was converted from a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] trading [[schooner]] by decking over the hold to make a saloon with a long skylight and four double cabins opening into it. The deckhouse has a couple of bunks which are used by the adults, Captain Flint and Peter Duck, in the book ''Peter Duck''.&lt;ref&gt;Ransome, Arthur, ''Peter Duck'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Ransome's book ''[[Missee Lee]]'', the ship was burned to the waterline and sinks when Gibber, Roger's monkey, put a lighted cigar in the fuel (petrol) holding tank. In ''Peter Duck'', the ''Swallow'' is aboard and is used as one of the ship's boats. In ''Missee Lee'', both the ''Swallow'' and ''Amazon'' are aboard and used as lifeboats when she sinks.&lt;ref&gt;Ransome, Arthur, ''Missee Lee'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;
