The '''American Eurythmy School''' is a four-year [[eurythmy]] training in [[Weed, California]], near [[Mount Shasta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goetheanum.org/fileadmin/srmk/download/RbD32.pdf ''Rundbrief def Sektion für redende und musizierende Künste (Newsletter of the Section for Speech and Music)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720195834/http://www.goetheanum.org/fileadmin/srmk/download/RbD32.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}, [[Goetheanum]], Dornach, no. 32, Easter 2000, p. 56. Accessed November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1984 by Karen Sherman McPherson, who studied under Ilona Schubert in the 1970s in Dornach, Switzerland,&lt;ref name=ukiah&gt;[http://extras.ukiahdailyjournal.com/extras/05_may_2008/052208_UDJ_lowres.pdf The American Eurythmy School comes to Ukiah], ''The Ukiah Daily Journal'', vol. 150, no.43, A-3, May 22, 2008. Accessed November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the second largest four-year eurythmy training in North America. The first graduation from the four-year program was held in 1990. There are many graduates of the School teaching in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] and performing in the United States.&lt;ref name=ukiah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, a report of AES teachers performing and teaching eurythmy blocks: [http://watershedhs.org/newcurrent/Snippits/Snippets_2006-03-03.htm?PHPSESSID=c7a302f9156bf5e4b29e3e6f6027a07d A Eurythmy Performance from Inland Isle]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Snippets: WATERSHED High School'', March 3, 2006. Accessed November 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training program==
McPherson began her eurythmy training at the Eurythmy School at the [[Goetheanum]] in Switzerland and went on to train outside established training programs, under Ilona Schubert and Friedel Thomas, two of the original eurythmists who trained under [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie Steiner]].&lt;ref name=ukiah/&gt;

Unlike other eurythmy schools, the American Eurythmy School emphasizes the transformation of the thinking life by the student—something indicated by Rudolf Steiner as necessary for a strong foundation and healthy development of the eurythmist's artistic instrument. Study of [[anthroposophy]] and related subjects are equally emphasized along with the studies in eurythmy.

The American Eurythmy School maintains a position of independence from the general structures and leadership of the worldwide [[Anthroposophical Society]], as well as from other streams of eurythmy work in America. As a result, its four-year diplomas are not yet recognized by the Eurythmy Association of North America or the Artistic Section of the Anthroposophical Society in Dornach, Switzerland.

'''Banu Bargu''' is a U.S.-based political theorist and professor of [[History of Consciousness]] and [[Political Theory]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://histcon.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=bbargu|title=Directory|website=histcon.ucsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Bargu completed her B.A. at [[Bogazici University]] in 1997, where she also completed her M.A. in Political Science and International Relations in 2000. She then studied at [[Cornell University]], where she completed her Ph.D. in Government in 2008.

Bargu taught at The New School in [[New York City]] for a decade before entering the [[History of Consciousness]] department at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/Banu-Bargu/|title=Banu Bargu - Associate Professor of Politics - Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts|website=www.newschool.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2014 paper "Sovereignty as Erasure: Rethinking Enforced Disappearances" she discusses Kemal Birlik, who disappeared while in Turkish custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1353/phi.2017.0027| issn = 2155-0905| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 337–355| last = Islekel| first = Ege Selin| title = Absent Death: Necropolitics and Technologies of Mourning| journal = philoSOPHIA| date = 2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bargu published her first book, ''Starve and Immolate: The Politics of Human Weapons'' through [[Columbia University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/141181/human-shield-body-war/|title=Human Shields, a New Form of Life Worthy of Life Only as a Potential Death|first=Pramod K.|last=Nayar|website=thewire.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is about the Turkish Death Fast.&lt;ref name=terwiel&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1092-311X| volume = 19| issue = 1| last = Terwiel| first = Anna| title = The Politics of Human Weapons: Bargu's Starve and Immolate| journal = Theory &amp; Event| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bargu discusses what she calls the "weaponization of life", beginning with the imprisonment of leftist political prisoners in Turkey and then broadening her analysis to discuss [[Hamas]], [[PKK]], and other organizations. Hannah Gehl writes that "Bargu wishes to communicate that self-destructive acts and the use of human weapons is a logical and premeditated political statement against the asymmetric distribution of political power".&lt;ref&gt;Gehl, Hannah, and Banu Bargu. “Review of Middle East Studies.” Review of Middle East Studies, vol. 50, no. 2, 2016, pp. 221–222. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/26252264.&lt;/ref&gt; Bargu develops a concept of "necroresistance" which Anna Terwiel has described as "a new understanding of martyrdom as a radical challenge to the modern state".&lt;ref name=terwiel/&gt;  It received the First Book award by the [[American Political Science Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/starve-and-immolate/9780231163408|title=Starve and Immolate - The Politics of Human Weapons - Columbia University Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second book, ''Feminism, Capitalism, and Critique: Essays in Honor of Nancy Fraser'' is an edited collection examining the work of [[Nancy Fraser]].

'''Bernard Joseph Francis Lonergan''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]] [[Companion of the Order of Canada|CC]]}} (17 December 1904 – 26 November 1984) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Jesuit]] priest, [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[theology|theologian]], regarded by many as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Lonergan is considered by many intellectuals to be the finest philosophic thinker of the 20th century." ''Time,'' April 27, 1970, p. 10. Cf. Fellows of the Woodstock Theological Center, ''The Realms of Desire: An Introduction to the Thought of Bernard Lonergan'', (Washington: Woodstock Theological Center, 2011), pp. 3-6; in addition to recording their own estimate of Lonergan's importance, the authors cite the opinions of many others.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonergan's works include ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' (1957) and ''Method in Theology'' (1972), as well as two studies of Thomas Aquinas, several theological textbooks, and numerous essays, including two posthumously published essays on [[macroeconomics]]. A projected 25-volume Collected Works is underway with the University of Toronto Press. He held appointments at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], [[Regis College, Toronto]], as Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Boston College]], and as Stillman Professor of Divinity at [[Harvard University]].

==Aims==

Lonergan set out to do for human thought in our time what [[Thomas Aquinas]] had done for his own time. Aquinas had successfully applied Aristotelian thought to the service of a Christian understanding of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Grace and Freedom: Operative Grace in the Thought of St Thomas Aquinas'', Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan vol. 1, ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran (Toronto: University of Toronto, 2000), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Lonergan's program was to come to terms with modern scientific, historical, and hermeneutical thinking in a comparable way.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bernard J. F. Lonergan, "''Insight'' Revisited," in ''A Second Collection'', ed. William F.J. Ryan and Bernard J. Tyrrell (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974), pp. 263-278 at pp. 268, 277; idem, ''Method in Theology'' (New York: Seabury, 1972), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued this program in his two most fundamental works, ''Insight'' and ''Method in Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J.F . Lonergan, ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'', Collected Works vol. 3, ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran (Toronto: University of Toronto, 1992); idem, ''Method in Theology'' (New York: Seabury, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to Lonergan's project is "self-appropriation", that is, the personal discovery and personal embrace of the dynamic structure of inquiry, insight, judgment, and decision. By self-appropriation, one finds in one's own intelligence, reasonableness, and responsibility the foundation of every kind of inquiry and the basic pattern of operations undergirding methodical investigation in every field.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'', Collected Works vol. 3, ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran (Toronto: University of Toronto, 1992), pp. 11-24; idem, ''Method in Theology'' (New York: Seabury, 1972), pp. 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often associated with his fellow Jesuits [[Karl Rahner]], and [[Joseph Maréchal]] with "[[transcendental Thomism]]", i.e., a philosophy which attempts to combine [[Thomism]] with certain views or methods commonly associated with [[Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Muck, ''The Transcendental Method'' (New York: Herder and Herder, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lonergan did not regard this label as particularly helpful for understanding his intentions.&lt;ref&gt;''Method in Theology'', pp. 13-14 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Bernard Joseph Francis Lonergan was born on December 17, 1904, in [[Buckingham, Quebec]], Canada. After four years at [[Loyola College (Montreal)]], he entered the Upper Canada (English) province of the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1922, and made his profession of vows on the Feast of St [[Ignatius of Loyola]], July 31, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), pp. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; After two further years of formation and education, he was assigned to study scholastic philosophy at [[Heythrop College]], [[London]], in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lonergan respected the competence and honesty of his professors at Heythrop, but was deeply dissatisfied with their [[Suarezianism|Suarezian]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, "''Insight'' Revisited," in ''A Second Collection'', ed. William F.J. Ryan and Bernard J. Tyrrell (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974), pp. 263-278 at p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; While at Heythrop, Lonergan also took external degrees in mathematics and classics at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Crowe, ''Lonergan'' (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press, 1992) pp. 6-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 he returned to Canada where he taught for three years at Loyola College, [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Lonergan was sent for theological studies at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, "''Insight'' Revisited," in ''Second Collection'' pp. 263-278 at p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priesthood]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of Jesuit formation ("[[tertianship]]") in [[Amiens]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), pp. 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Lonergan returned to the Gregorian University in 1937 to pursue doctoral studies in theology. Due to the [[Second World War]], he was whisked out of Italy and back to Canada in May, 1940, just two days before the scheduled defence of his doctoral [[thesis|dissertation]]. He began teaching theology at College de l'Immaculee Conception, the Jesuit theology faculty in [[Montreal]] in 1940, as well as the Thomas More Institute in 1945-46. In the event, he would not formally defend his dissertation and receive his doctorate until a special board of examiners from the Immaculee Conception was convened in Montreal on December 23, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Grace and Freedom: Operative Grace in the Thought of St Thomas of Aquin,'' ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran, Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan vol. 1 (Toronto: University of Toronto, 2000), pp. xvii-xxii (Editors' Preface); Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), pp. 60-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonergan taught theology at [[Regis College, Toronto|Regis College]] from 1947 to 1953, and at the Gregorian University from 1953 to 1964. At the Gregorian, Lonergan taught Trinity and Christology in alternate years, and produced substantial textbooks on these topics. In 1964, he made another hasty return to North America, this time to be treated for lung cancer. He was appointed again to Regis College from 1965 to 1975, was Stillman Professor of Divinity at Harvard University in 1971-72, and Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Boston College]] from 1975 until 1983. He died at the Jesuit [[Hospital|infirmary]] in [[Pickering, Ontario]], on 26 November 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Crowe, ''Lonergan'' (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press, 1992) 1-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Lonergan names [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[John Henry Newman]] as major influences upon his early thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, "''Insight'' Revisited," in ''A Second Collection'', pp. 263–278 at p. 263; idem, ''Caring About Meaning,'' p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; J. A. Stewart's study of Plato's doctrine of ideas&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Stewart, ''Plato's Doctrine of Ideas'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1909).&lt;/ref&gt; was also influential.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Mark D. Morelli, ''At the Threshold of the Halfway House: A Study of Bernard Lonergan's Encounter with John Alexander Stewart'' (Boston: Lonergan Institute, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the epilogue to ''Insight'', Lonergan mentions the important personal transformation wrought in him by a decade's apprenticeship to the thought of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'', Collected Works vol. 3, ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran (Toronto: University of Toronto, 1992), p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; He produced two major exegetical studies of Thomas Aquinas: ''Grace and Freedom,'' and ''Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas''.

== Works ==
The [[University of Toronto Press]] is in the process of publishing Lonergan's work in a projected 25-volume series, ''Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan''. Archival materials are available at bernardlonergan.com.

===''Grace and Freedom''===
Lonergan's doctoral dissertation was an exploration of the theory of operative grace in the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His director, Charles Boyer, S.J., pointed him to a passage in the ''[[Summa theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' and suggested that the received interpretations were mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;Pierrot Lambert and Philip McShane, ''Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas'' (Vancouver: Axial, 2010), p. 62; Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Caring About Meaning: Patterns in the Life of Bernard Lonergan'', edited by Pierrot Lambert, Charlotte Tansey, and Cathleen Going (Montreal: Thomas More Institute, 1982), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of Thomas Aquinas on divine grace and human freedom was well-suited to his interest in working out a theoretical analysis of history.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, "''Insight'' Revisited," in ''A Second Collection'', pp. 263-278 at pp. 271-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissertation was completed in 1940; it was rewritten and published as a series of articles in the journal ''Theological Studies''&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lonergan, "St Thomas' Thought on ''Gratia Operans'', ''Theological Studies'' 2 (1941) 289-324, 3 (1942) 69-88, 375-402, 533-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles were edited into a book by J. Patout Burns in 1972, and both the revised and the original version of his study were subsequently published in his ''Collected Works'' as ''Grace and Freedom:  Operative Grace in the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard J. F. Lonergan, ''Grace and Freedom: Operative Grace in the Thought of St Thomas of Aquin,'' ed. Frederick E. Crowe and Robert M. Doran, Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan vol. 1 (Toronto: University of Toronto, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas''===
After his return from [[Rome]], Lonergan wrote a series of four articles for ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'' on the inner word in [[Thomas Aquinas]] which became highly influential in the study of St. Thomas' accounts of [[knowledge]] and [[cognition]].  The articles were later collected and published under the title ''Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas''.&lt;ref&gt;''Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas'', ed. F.E. Crowe and R.M. Doran, Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan vol. 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding''===
In 1945 Lonergan gave a course at the Thomas More Institute in Montreal that extended from September to April 1946 entitled "Thought and Reality," and the success of that course was the inspiration behind his decision to write the book Insight.  While teaching [[theology]] at Collegium Christi Regis, now [[Regis College, U of T|Regis College]] federated with the [[University of Toronto]], Lonergan wrote ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'', inaugurating the generalized [[empirical]] method (GEM).  GEM belongs to the movement of "[[transcendental Thomism]]" inaugurated by [[Joseph Maréchal]].  This method begins with an analysis of human knowing as divided into three levels – experience, understanding, and judgment – and, by stressing the objectivity of judgment more than [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had done, develops a Thomistic vision of [[Being]] as the goal of the dynamic openness of the human spirit.

===''Method in Theology''===
In 1973, Lonergan published ''Method in Theology'', which divides the discipline into eight "functional specialties." Method is a phenomenon which applies across the board in all disciplines and realms of consciousness.  Through his work on method, Lonergan aimed, among other things, to establish a firm basis for agreement and progress in disciplines such as [[philosophy]] and [[theology]].  Lonergan believed that the lack of an agreed method among scholars in such fields has inhibited substantive agreement from being reached and progress from being made; whereas, in the natural sciences, for example, widespread agreement among scholars on the [[scientific method]] has enabled remarkable progress.  The chaper on "Religious Commitment" in Method in Theology was delivered in a lecture at The Villanova University Symposium and published in: '''''The Pilgrim People: A Vision with Hope''''', Volume IV, edited by Joseph Papin (Villanova University Press, 1970). Karl Rahner, S.J., however, criticized  Lonergan's theological method in a short article entitled: "Some Critical Thoughts on 'Functional Specialties in Theology' where he states: "Lonergan's theological methodology seems to me to be ''so generic that it really fits every science'', and hence is not the methodology of theology as such, but only a very general methodology of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of Theology|last=McShane, S.J.|first=Philip|last3=|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonergan's thinking in ''Method'' was, indeed, inspirational in bringing theological and psychology together in a unique way, e.g. Bernard J.Tryrrell,  "Christotherapy: A Theology of Christian Healing and Enlightenment Inspired by the Thought of Thomas Hora and Bernard Lonergan" in '''''The Papin Festschrift: Wisdom and Knowledge, Essays in Honour of Joseph Papin, Volume II''''', edited by Joseph Armenti, Villanova University Press, 1976, pp. 293-329.

===Trinitarian theology===
While at the Gregorian University, Lonergan composed a two-volume Latin textbook, ''De Deo Trino'' (third edition, 1964). It has recently appeared in the Collected Works together with an interleaf English translation under the title ''The Triune God: Doctrines'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Collected Works, volume 11&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Triune God: Systematics'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Collected Works, volume 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Triune God: Doctrines'', Lonergan begins with an examination of the dialectical process by which the dogma of the Trinity developed in the first four centuries. This section was previously published in English as ''The Way to Nicea''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way to Nicea: The Dialectical Development of Trinitarian Theology'', trans. Conn O'Donovan (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The second section of the work advances dogmatic theses on (1) the [[consubstantiality]] of the Son with the Father, (2) the divinity of the Holy Spirit, (3) the distinction of the divine persons by relations of origin, and (4) the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son (the [[Filioque]]). The fifth and final thesis is that the Trinity is a theological mystery in the strict sense and can only be understood analogically. A concluding scholion presents New Testament evidence in favor of the "psychological" analogy of the [[Trinity]].

In ''The Triune God: Systematics'', Lonergan develops the theory of intelligible (or spiritual) emanations in God as propounded by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The volume begins with a discussion of the method of systematic theology which seeks an imperfect but highly fruitful understanding of the mysteries of faith by means of analogies. The following chapters develop an analogical conception of the divine processions (as intelligible emanations), relations, persons, and the two missions of the Word and Spirit.

===Christology===
Lonergan produced two textbooks in [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;On the development of Lonergan's Christology, cf. Frederick E. Crowe, ''Christ and History: The Christology of Bernard Lonergan from 1935 to 1982'' (Ottawa: Novalis, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 he produced a supplemental volume ''De Constitutione Christi Ontologica et Psychica''; the fourth and final edition of 1964 was presented in the Collected Works with an interleaf translation as ''The Ontological and Psychological Constitution of Christ'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Collected Works, volume 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Lonergan clarifies the metaphysical principles of Christ's constitution as one person in two distinct natures, and transposes that framework to address the consciousness of Christ as a single subject of two distinct conscious subjectivities.

Beginning with an edition of 1960, Lonergan introduced his own textbook for his Christology course, ''De Verbo Incarnato''. Subsequent editions were published in 1961 and in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Rome: Gregorian University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''De Verbo Incarnato'' is divided into four parts. The first part is an interpretation of the divinity and humanity of Christ as presented in the New Testament (thesis 1). The second part recapitulates the formation of the dogmatic theological tradition of Christology up through the [[monothelitism|monothelite]] controversy in the seventh century (theses 2-5). The third part, which covers much the same material as ''The Constitution of Christ'' but in a somewhat different manner, formulates what Lonergan calls "theological conclusions" from the [[hypostatic union]] regarding the ontological constitution of Christ as one person in two natures (theses 6-9), and his psychological constitution as a single subject of two subjectivities (thesis 10). The fourth part concerns "what belongs to Christ" (''de iis quae christi sunt''), including his grace, knowledge, sinlessness, and freedom (theses 11-14). The fifth and final section regards the redemptive work of Christ, in three theses: redemption in the New Testament (thesis 15), the satisfaction given by Christ (thesis 16), and "Understanding the Mystery: The Law of the Cross," presenting Lonergan's synthetic understanding of Christ's work (thesis 17).

He also produced a separate treatise on the Redemption, of uncertain date and never published.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Crowe, ''Christ and History'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise treats, in six chapters divided into 45 articles, good and evil, divine justice, the death and resurrection of Christ, the cross of Christ, the satisfaction given by Christ, and the work of Christ.

Among Lonergan's more noteworthy contributions to Christology include his theory about the ontological and psychological constitution of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lonergan, "Christ as Subject: A Reply," in ''Collection'', pp. 153-184; also Jeremy D. Wilkins, "The 'I' of Jesus Christ: Methodological Considerations," ''Josephinum Journal of Theology'' 12 (2005): 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; his interpretation of Christ's human knowing,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cf. Frederick E. Crowe, "Eschaton and Worldly Mission in the Mind and Heart of Christ," in idem, ''Appropriating the Lonergan Idea,'' (Washington, DC, 1989), pp. 193–234; Charles Hefling, "Another Perhaps Permanently Valid Achievement: Lonergan on Christ's (Self-) Knowledge," ''Lonergan Workshop,'' vol. 20 (Boston, 2008), pp. 127–64; Charles Hefling, "Revelation and/as Insight," in ''The Importance of Insight'' (Toronto, 2006), pp. 97–115; Gilles Mongeau, "The Human and Divine Knowing of the Incarnate Word," ''Josephinum Journal of Theology'' 12 (2005): 30–42; Guy Mansini, "Understanding St Thomas on Christ's Immediate Knowledge of God," ''Thomist'' 59 (1995): 91–124; and Jeremy D. Wilkins, "Love and Knowledge of God in the Human Life of Christ," ''Pro Ecclesia'' 21 (2012): 77-99.&lt;/ref&gt; and his interpretation of Christ's redemptive work.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lonergan, "Redemption," in ''Collection'', pp. 3-28; Charles Hefling, "A Perhaps Permanently Valid Achievement: Lonergan on Christ's Satisfaction," ''Method: Journal of Lonergan Studies'' 10(1992): 51-76 https://dx.doi.org/10.5840/method19921018; Paul J. LaChance, [http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2i_21LaChance.pdf "Understanding Christ's Satisfaction Today"], ''Saint Anselm Journal'' 2 (2004): 60-66; John Volk, [http://www.lonerganresource.com/pdf/contributors/20100917-John_Volk-What_is_Divine_Justice.pdf "What is Divine Justice?"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''De Verbo Incarnato'' and the supplement on Redemption are in preparation for the Collected Works. The plan is to present two volumes, ''The Incarnate Word'',&lt;ref&gt;Collected Works, volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; which would include theses 1-14 in Latin with an interleaf English translation, and ''The Redemption'',&lt;ref&gt;Collected Works, volume 9.&lt;/ref&gt; which would include theses 15-17 and the supplement on Redemption.

===Macroeconomics===
In the 1930s and early 40s, Lonergan developed an intense interest in macroeconomic analysis, but never published the manuscript he developed. In later life while teaching at [[Boston College]], Lonergan returned his attention to the economic interests of his younger days. The University of Toronto Press has published his two works on [[economics]]: ''For a New Political Economy'' and ''Macroeconomic Dynamics: An Essay in Circulation Analysis''.

== Philosophy: generalized empirical method ==
Lonergan described his philosophical program as a generalization of empirical method to investigate not only data given through exterior sensation, but also the internal data of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Insight'', pp. 95-96, 227-231; ''Method in Theology'', pp. 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, objects are known while considering the corresponding operations of the subject and vice versa, experiencing and the subsequent operations of the intellect being components of both knowing and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Henman, Robert (2015). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A15-01.pdf Generalized Empirical Method: A context for a discussion of language usage in neuroscience.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Method, for Lonergan, is not a technique but a concrete pattern of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Communication and Lonergan: Common Ground for Forging the New Age'', ed. Thomas J. Farrell and Paul A. Soukup (Kansas City, Missouri: Sheed and Ward, 1993), pp. 325-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonergan maintained what he called [[Theological critical realism|critical realism]]. By realism, he affirmed that we make true judgments of fact and of value, and by critical, he based knowing and valuing in a critique of [[consciousness]].  GEM traces to their roots in consciousness the sources of all the meanings and values that make up personality, social orders, and historical developments.  A more thorough overview of Lonergan's work is available at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Tad |last=Dunne |encyclopedia=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Bernard Lonergan |url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lonergan.htm |accessdate=30 April 2009 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonergan's ideas include [[Radical Unintelligibility]], [[Theological critical realism|GEM]], and Functional Specialization. Given the fact that no science can today be mastered by a single individual, Lonergan advocated sub-division of the scientific process in all fields. One of the leading voices in the effort to implement functional specialization is [[Philip McShane]].

== Hermeneutics ==
[[Frederick G. Lawrence]] has made the claim that Lonergan's work may be seen as the culmination of the postmodern [[hermeneutic]] revolution begun by [[Heidegger]]. Heidegger replaced Husserl's [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of pure perception with his own linguistic phenomenology. Gadamer worked out this seminal insight into his philosophical hermeneutics. According to Lawrence, however, Heidegger, and in a lesser way Gadamer, remained under the influence of Kant when they refused to take seriously the possibility of grace and redemption. Lawrence makes the observation that Heidegger – influenced also by Augustine's inability to work out a theoretical distinction between grace and freedom – conflated finitude and fallenness in his account of the human being. "Sin" is therefore absorbed into "fallenness," and fallenness is simply part of the human condition. Lonergan builds on the "theorem of the supernatural" achieved in medieval times as well as on the distinction between grace and freedom worked out by Thomas Aquinas, and so is able to remove all the brackets and return to the truly concrete, with his unique synthesis of "Jerusalem and Athens."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Frederick G. Lawrence, "Martin Heidegger and the Hermeneutic Revolution," "Hans-Georg Gadamer and the Hermeneutic Revolution," "The Hermeneutic Revolution and Bernard Lonergan: Gadamer and Lonergan on Augustine's Verbum Cordis - the Heart of Postmodern Hermeneutics," "The Unknown 20th Century Hermeneutic Revolution: Jerusalem and Athens in Lonergan's Integral Hermeneutics," ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1-2 (2008) 7-30, 31-54, 55-86, 87-118. For another approach to the development of Lonergan's hermeneutics, see Ivo Coelho, ''Hermeneutics and Method: The 'Universal Viewpoint' in Bernard Lonergan'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 1970 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].

In 1971, [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College]], one of [[Concordia University]]'s founding institutions, awarded the Loyola Medal to Lonergan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/alumni-friends/applause/great-concordians/bernard-lonergan.html|title=Bernard Lonergan|website=www.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concordia also awarded Lonergan an honorary doctorate in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archives.concordia.ca/lonergan|title = Honorary Degree Citation - Bernard Lonergan* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website = archives.concordia.ca|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences and journals ==
An annual Lonergan Workshop is held at Boston College, under the leadership of Frederick G. Lawrence. The proceedings of the Workshop are published under the same name, ''Lonergan Workshop'', edited by Frederick G. Lawrence. The Workshop began in Lonergan's lifetime and continued after his death. The West Coast Methods Institute sponsors the annual Fallon Memorial Lonergan Symposium at Loyola Marymount University. The Lonergan Symposium has been meeting for 32 years.

Boston College has a [[Lonergan Institute]], and also publishes the bi-annual ''Method: Journal of Lonergan Studies''. The journal was founded and edited until 2013 by Mark D. Morelli. The ''Lonergan Studies Newsletter'' is put out 4 times a year by the Lonergan Research Institute, Toronto; it provides the most up-to-date bibliographical information on the Lonergan movement. Recently, Seton Hall University has put out ''[[The Lonergan Review]]''.

Lonergan Centers have been set up in various places (see below, External Links). The Lonergan Research Institute at Toronto holds the Lonergan archives as well as a good collection of secondary material, including a complete collection of dissertations on Lonergan's work. Much of the primary archival material is available online at the Bernard Lonergan Archive (see below, External Links), and a site for secondary material has also been set up, thanks to the work of Robert M. Doran.

The '''Black Order''' or '''The Black Order of Pan Europa''' are a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] group formerly based in New Zealand. Political scientists [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] and Leonard Weinberg characterised the Black Order as a "[[Nazism|National Socialist]]-oriented Satanist mail order ministry".{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} However, in 1995, the anti-fascist [[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] organization, following an investigation, described it as part of a functioning international Occult-Fascist Axis.&lt;ref&gt;''David Myatt and the Occult-Fascist Axis'', Searchlight,  July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Black Order was founded in New Zealand by [[Kerry Bolton]] as a successor to his Order of the Left Hand Path.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Bolton had connections to other neo-Nazi Satanist groups, being the international distributor for the English-based [[Order of Nine Angles]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=229}}

According to Goodrick-Clarke, "in 1994 Bolton set up the Black Order, which claimed a global network of national lodges in Britain, France, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Germany, the United States and Australia, dedicated to fostering National Socialism, fascism, satanism, paganism and other aspects of the European Darkside".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=227}} Its quarterly membership bulletin ''The Flaming Sword'' and its successor [[zine]] ''The Nexus'' contained interviews with, among others, [[James Mason (neo-Nazi)|James Mason]], [[George Burdi|George Eric Hawthorne]], Michael Moynihan, [[David Myatt]] and [[Miguel Serrano]], and its articles included studies of Thulianism, Himmler's [[Wewelsburg]], tributes to old SS leaders, "a reprint of the ONA Mass of Heresy [and] contributions from David Myatt on the galactic empire, aeonic strategy and the cosmological magic of National Socialism".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=227-228}}

In 1996, a U.S. branch of the Black Order was established.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} In summer that year, they began publication of a magazine, ''Abyss''.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}} The U.S. group subsequently fell out with that in New Zealand over the latter's acceptance of homosexual members.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}} The U.S. group considered a name change to the White Order as a result of this schism.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}}

The name "Black Order" was then adopted by ideologically similar groups around the world which had no formal connection to Bolton's group.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Kaplan and Weinberg described the Black Order as "a remarkably influential purveyor of National Socialist-oriented occultism throughout the world".{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=144}}

In 2016 former members of The Black Order re-established the group with lodges in Australia, England, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theblackorder.org/index2.html|title=.:THE BLACK ORDER of Pan Europa:.|website=www.theblackorder.org|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A  '''chaordic organization''' refers to a [[system]] of organization that blends characteristics of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[:wikt:order|order]]. The term was coined by [[Dee Hock]], the founder and former CEO of the [[VISA]] credit card association.

The mix of chaos and order is often described as a harmonious coexistence displaying characteristics of both, with neither chaotic nor ordered behavior dominating. The chaordic principles have also been used as guidelines for creating human organizations -- [[business]], [[nonprofit]], [[government]] and hybrids—that would be neither centralized nor anarchical networks.

A '''conditional proof''' is a [[formal proof|proof]] that takes the form of asserting a [[Material conditional|conditional]], and proving that the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional necessarily leads to the [[consequent]]. 

==Overview==
The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the '''conditional proof assumption'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''CPA''').  Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion [[Logical consequence|necessarily follows]]. The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that ''if it were true'' it would lead to the consequent.

Conditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.

A famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory.  There are a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them. Similarly, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] has a large number of consequences already proven.

== Symbolic logic ==
As an example of a conditional proof in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], suppose we want to prove A → C (if A, then C) from the first two premises below:

{|
|-
|align=right| 1. || A → B&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || ("If A, then B")
|-
|align=right| 2. || B → C || ("If B, then C")
|-
|colspan=3| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
|align=right| 3. || A ||(conditional proof assumption, "Suppose A is true")
|-
|align=right| 4. || B || (follows from lines 1 and 3, [[modus ponens]]; "If A then B; A, therefore B")
|-
|align=right| 5. || C || (follows from lines 2 and 4, [[modus ponens]]; "If B then C; B, therefore C")
|-
|align=right| 6. || A → C || (follows from lines 3–5, conditional proof; "If A, then C")
|}

[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|right|thumb|From [[experiment]]s it is known that there is always – except in case of [[superfluidity]] – a drag force for a body placed in a steady fluid onflow. The figure shows the [[drag coefficient]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments. The dark line is for a sphere with a smooth surface, while the lighter line is for the case of a rough surface. The numbers along the line indicate several flow regimes and associated changes in the drag coefficient:&lt;br&gt;
•2: attached flow ([[Stokes flow]]) and [[steady flow|steady]] [[flow separation|separated flow]],&lt;br&gt;
•3: separated unsteady flow, having a [[laminar flow]] [[boundary layer]] upstream of the separation, and producing a [[vortex street]],&lt;br&gt;
•4: separated unsteady flow with a laminar boundary layer at the upstream side, before flow separation, with downstream of the sphere a chaotic [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[wake]],&lt;br&gt;
•5: post-critical separated flow, with a turbulent boundary layer.]]

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''d'Alembert's paradox''' (or the '''hydrodynamic paradox''') is a contradiction reached in 1752 by French mathematician [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1752).&lt;/ref&gt; D'Alembert proved that – for [[incompressible]] and [[Inviscid flow|inviscid]] [[potential flow]] – the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] is zero on a body moving with constant [[velocity]] relative to the [[fluid]].&lt;ref name=Grimberg2008&gt;Grimberg, Pauls &amp; Frisch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Zero drag is in direct contradiction to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to fluids, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high [[Reynolds number]]s. It is  a particular example of the [[reversibility paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkovich (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

D’Alembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] on flow drag, concluded: ''"It seems to me that the theory (potential flow), developed in all possible rigor, gives, at least in several cases, a strictly vanishing resistance, a singular paradox which I leave to future Geometers [i.e. mathematicians - the two terms were used interchangeably at that time] to elucidate"''.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in: Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1768).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[physical paradox]] indicates flaws in the theory.

Fluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split – between the field of [[hydraulics]], observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical [[fluid mechanics]] explaining phenomena which could not be observed – in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|Sir Cyril Hinshelwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author= M.J.

According to [[scientific consensus]], the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of [[viscosity]].  In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin [[boundary layer]]s by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces.  These viscous forces cause [[skin friction|friction drag]] on streamlined objects, and for [[:wiktionary:bluff|bluff]] bodies the additional result is [[flow separation]] and a low-pressure [[wake]] behind the object, leading to [[form drag]].&lt;ref name=LandauLifshitz_15&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz (1987), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Batchelor_264&gt;[[George Batchelor|Batchelor]] (2000), pp. 264–265, 303, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlichting_XIX&gt;

The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl.&lt;ref name=LandauLifshitz_15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Batchelor_264/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlichting_XIX/&gt;&lt;ref name=Veldman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewartson"&gt;Stewartson (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=R.P. | last=Feynman |authorlink1=R.

==Viscous friction: Saint-Venant, Navier and Stokes==

First steps towards solving the paradox were made by [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], who modelled [[viscosity|viscous]] fluid friction. Saint-Venant states in 1847:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Saint-Venant | first1=A. | author1-link=Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant | year=1847 | title=Mémoire sur la théorie de la résistance des fluides.

:''"But one finds another result if, instead of an ideal fluid – object of the calculations of the geometers of the last century – one uses a real fluid, composed of a finite number of molecules and exerting in its state of motion unequal pressure forces or forces having components tangential to the surface elements through which they act; components to which we refer as the friction of the fluid, a name which has been given to them since Descartes and Newton until Venturi."''
Soon after, in 1851, [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] calculated the drag on a sphere in [[Stokes flow]], known as [[Stokes' law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Stokes, G.G. |title = On the effect of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums | journal=Trans. Camb. Philos. Soc. | volume=9 | pages=8–106 | year=1851 |bibcode = 1851TCaPS...9....8S }}. Reprinted in {{citation |title=On the effect...|author=Stokes, G.G. | publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press | edition=2nd | volume=3 | work=Mathematical and Physical Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes flow is the low Reynolds-number limit of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] describing the motion of a viscous liquid.&lt;ref&gt;The Stokes flow equations have a solution for the flow around a sphere, but not for the flow around a circular cylinder. This is due to the neglect of the [[Navier–Stokes equations#Convective acceleration|convective acceleration]] in Stokes flow. Convective acceleration is dominating over viscous effects far from the cylinder (Batchelor, 2000, p. 245). A solution can be found when convective acceleration is taken into account, for instance using the [[Oseen equations]] (Batchelor, 2000, pp. 245–246).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the flow problem is put into a [[dimensional analysis|non-dimensional form]], the viscous Navier–Stokes equations converge for increasing Reynolds numbers towards the inviscid [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], suggesting that the flow should converge towards the inviscid solutions of [[potential flow]] theory – having the zero drag of the d'Alembert paradox. Of this, there is no evidence found in experimental measurements of drag and flow visualisations.&lt;ref name=Batchelor337&gt;Batchelor (2000), pp. 337–343 &amp; plates.&lt;/ref&gt; This again raised questions concerning the applicability of fluid mechanics in the second half of the 19th century.

==Inviscid separated flow: Kirchhoff and Rayleigh==

[[File:Cavity flow plate.svg|thumb|right|300px|Steady and separated incompressible potential flow around a plate in two dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (2000), p. 499, eq. (6.13.12).&lt;/ref&gt; with a constant pressure along the two free streamlines separating from the plate edges.]]

In the second half of the 19th century, focus shifted again towards using [[inviscid flow]] theory for the description of fluid drag—assuming that viscosity becomes less important at high Reynolds numbers. The model proposed by [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Assumptions applied to the wake region include: flow velocities equal to the body velocity, and a constant pressure. This wake region is separated from the potential flow outside the body and wake by [[vortex]] sheets with discontinuous jumps in the [[tangent]]ial velocity across the interface.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (2000), pp. 338–339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu_1972&gt;{{citation

In order to have a non-zero drag on the body, the wake region must extend to infinity.  This condition is indeed fulfilled for the Kirchhoff flow perpendicular to a plate. The theory correctly states the drag force to be proportional to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the velocity.&lt;ref name=Lamb_679&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In first instance, the theory could only be applied to flows separating at sharp edges. Later, in 1907, it was extended by [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]] to flows separating from a smooth curved boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

It was readily known that such steady flows are not stable, since the vortex sheets develop so-called [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability|Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities]].&lt;ref name=Wu_1972/&gt; But this steady-flow model was studied further in the hope it still could give a reasonable estimate of drag. Rayleigh asks ''"... whether the calculations of resistance are materially affected by this circumstance as the pressures experienced must be nearly independent of what happens at some distance in the rear of the obstacle, where the instability would first begin to manifest itself."&lt;ref name=Rayleigh_1876/&gt;

However, fundamental objections arose against this approach: [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] observed that if a plate is moving with constant velocity through the fluid (at rest far from the plate, except for the wake) the velocity in the wake is equal to that of the plate. The infinite extent of the wake—widening with the distance from the plate, as obtained from the theory—results in an infinite kinetic energy in the wake, which must be rejected on physical grounds.&lt;ref name=Lamb_679/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Moreover, the observed pressure differences between front and back of the plate, and resulting drag forces, are much larger than predicted: for a flat plate perpendicular to the flow the predicted [[drag coefficient]] is ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''=0.88, while in experiments ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''=2.0 is found. This is mainly due to suction at the wake side of the plate, induced by the unsteady flow in the real wake (as opposed to the theory which assumes a constant flow velocity equal to the plate's velocity).&lt;ref name=Batchelor_500&gt;Batchelor (2000), p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, this theory is found to be unsatisfactory as an explanation of drag on a body moving through a fluid.  Although it can be applied to so-called [[cavity flow]]s where, instead of a wake filled with fluid, a vacuum cavity is assumed to exist behind the body.&lt;ref name=Wu_1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_679/&gt;&lt;ref name=Batchelor_493&gt;Batchelor (2000), pp. 493–494.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thin boundary layers: Prandtl==
[[File:Flow pressure with friction.svg|thumb|right|300px|Pressure distribution for the flow around a circular cylinder. The dashed blue line is the pressure distribution according to [[potential flow]] theory, resulting in d'Alembert's paradox. The solid blue line is the mean pressure distribution as found in experiments at high [[Reynolds number]]s. The pressure is the radial distance from the cylinder surface; a positive pressure (overpressure) is inside the cylinder, towards the centre, while a negative pressure (underpressure) is drawn outside the cylinder.]]
The German physicist [[Ludwig Prandtl]] suggested in 1904 that the effects of a thin viscous [[boundary layer]] possibly could be the source of substantial drag.&lt;ref name=Prandtl1904&gt;Prandtl (1904).&lt;/ref&gt;  Prandtl put forward the idea that, at high velocities and high Reynolds numbers, a [[no-slip boundary condition]] causes a strong variation of the flow speeds over a thin layer near the wall of the body. This leads to the generation of [[vorticity]] and viscous [[dissipation]] of [[kinetic energy]] in the boundary layer. The energy dissipation, which is lacking in the inviscid theories, results for bluff bodies in [[Flow separation|separation]] of the flow. The low pressure in the [[wake]] region causes [[form drag]], and this can be larger than the friction drag due to the viscous [[shear stress]] at the wall.&lt;ref name=Batchelor337/&gt;

Evidence that Prandtl's scenario occurs for bluff bodies in flows of high Reynolds numbers can be seen in impulsively started flows around a cylinder. Initially the flow resembles potential flow, after which the flow separates near the rear [[stagnation point]]. Thereafter, the separation points move upstream, resulting in a low-pressure region of separated flow.&lt;ref name=Batchelor337/&gt;

Prandtl made the hypothesis that the viscous effects are important in thin layers – called boundary layers – adjacent to solid boundaries, and that [[viscosity]] has no role of importance outside.  The [[boundary-layer thickness]] becomes smaller when the viscosity reduces.  The full problem of viscous flow, described by the non-linear [[Navier–Stokes equations]], is in general not mathematically solvable.  However, using his hypothesis (and backed up by experiments) Prandtl was able to derive an approximate model for the flow inside the boundary layer, called ''boundary-layer theory''; while the flow outside the boundary layer could be treated using [[inviscid flow]] theory.  Boundary-layer theory is amenable to the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]] for deriving approximate solutions.  In the simplest case of a flat plate parallel to the incoming flow, boundary-layer theory results in (friction) drag, whereas all inviscid flow theories will predict zero drag.  Importantly for [[aeronautics]], Prandtl's theory can be applied directly to streamlined bodies like [[airfoil]]s where, in addition to surface-friction drag, there is also form drag. Form drag is due to the effect of the boundary layer and thin wake on the [[pressure]] distribution around the airfoil.&lt;ref name=Schlichting_XIX/&gt;&lt;ref name=Batchelor_302&gt;Batchelor (2000) pp. 302–314 &amp; 331–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open questions==

To verify, as Prandtl suggested, that a vanishingly small cause (vanishingly small viscosity for increasing Reynolds number) has a large effect – substantial drag —
may be very difficult.

The mathematician [[Garrett Birkhoff]] in the opening chapter of his book ''Hydrodynamics'' from 1950,&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Birkhoff, ''Hydrodynamics: a study in logic, fact, and similitude'', Princeton University Press, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  addresses a number of paradoxes of fluid mechanics (including d'Alembert's paradox) and expresses a clear doubt in their official resolutions:
:"''Moreover, I think that to attribute them all to the neglect of viscosity is an unwarranted oversimplification The root lies deeper, in lack of precisely that deductive rigor whose importance is so commonly minimized by physicists and engineers.''"&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff (1950) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, on d'Alembert's paradox, he considers another possible route to the creation of drag: instability of the potential flow solutions to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. Birkhoff states:
:"''In any case, the preceding paragraphs make it clear that the theory of non-viscous flows is incomplete. Indeed, the reasoning leading to the concept of a "steady flow" is inconclusive; there is no rigorous justification for the elimination of time as an independent variable. Thus though Dirichlet flows (potential solutions) and other steady flows are mathematically possible, there is no reason to suppose that any steady flow is stable.''"&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff (1950) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 review&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=James J. Stoker | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183516308 | title=Review: Garrett Birkhoff, Hydrodynamics, a study in logic, fact, and similitude | journal=Bull.

Stoker]] sharply criticizes the first chapter of the book:
:"''The reviewer found it difficult to understand for what class of readers the first chapter was written. For readers that are acquainted with hydrodynamics the majority of the cases cited as paradoxes belong either to the category of mistakes long since rectified, or in the category of discrepancies between theory and experiments the reasons for which are also well understood. On the other hand, the uninitiated would be very likely to get the wrong ideas about some of the important and useful achievements in hydrodynamics from reading this chapter.''"

In the second and revised edition of Birkhoff's ''Hydrodynamics'' in 1960, the above two statements no longer appear.&lt;ref&gt;Closest to the first quote comes, on page 5:
:"''...It is now usually claimed that such paradoxes are due to the differences between “real” fluids having small but finite viscosity, and “ideal” fluids having zero viscosity. Thus it is essentially implied that one can rectify Lagrange's claim, by substituting “Navier-Stokes” for “Euler”.  This claim will be discussed critically in Ch. II; it may well be correct in principle for ''incompressible'' viscous flow. However, taken literally, I think it is still very misleading, ''unless'' explicit attention is paid to the plausible hypotheses listed above, and to the lack of rigor implied by their use.  Though I do not know of any case when a deduction, both physically ''and'' mathematically rigorous, has led to a wrong conclusion, very few of the deductions of rational hydrodynamics can be established rigorously. The most interesting ones involve free use of Hypotheses (A)-(F)...''"
The Lagrange claim is given by Birkhoff on page 3:
:"''...One owes to Euler the first general formulas for fluid motion ... presented in the simple and luminous notation of partial differences ... By this discovery, all fluid mechanics was reduced to a single point of analysis, and if the equations involved were integrable, one could determine completely, in all cases, the motion of a fluid moved by any forces...''"
(Birkhoff, 1960, 2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance and usefulness of the achievements, made on the subject of the d'Alembert paradox, are reviewed by Stewartson thirty years later. His long 1981 survey article starts with:&lt;ref name="Stewartson"/&gt;
:"''Since classical inviscid theory leads to the patently absurd conclusion that the resistance experienced by a rigid body moving through a fluid with uniform velocity is zero, great efforts have been made during the last hundred or so years to propose alternate theories and to explain how a vanishingly small frictional force in the fluid can nevertheless have a significant effect on the flow properties. The methods used are a combination of experimental observation, computation often on a very large scale, and analysis of the structure of the asymptotic form of the solution as the friction tends to zero. This three-pronged attack has achieved considerable success, especially during the last ten years, so that now the paradox may be regarded as largely resolved.''"
For many paradoxes in physics, their resolution often lies in transcending the available theory.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the paradox of the constancy of the [[speed of light]] in all directions, was solved by the [[special theory of relativity]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of d'Alembert's paradox, the essential mechanism for its resolution was provided by Prandtl through the discovery and modelling of thin viscous [[boundary layer]]s – which are non-vanishing at high [[Reynolds number]]s.&lt;ref name=Prandtl1904/&gt;

==Proof of zero drag in steady potential flow==

===Potential flow===

The three main assumptions in the derivation of d'Alembert's paradox is that the [[steady flow]] is [[incompressible flow|incompressible]], [[viscosity|inviscid]] and [[irrotational]].&lt;ref&gt;This article follows the derivation in Section 6.4 of Batchelor (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
An inviscid fluid is described by the [[Euler equations]], which together with the other two conditions read
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0 &amp;&amp; \text{(incompressibility)} \\
&amp; \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}=0 &amp;&amp; \text{(irrotational)} \\
&amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \boldsymbol{u} + \left(\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\right) \boldsymbol{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \boldsymbol{\nabla} p &amp;&amp; \text{(Euler equation)}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where '''''u''''' denotes the [[flow velocity]] of the fluid, ''p'' the [[pressure]], ''ρ'' the [[density]], and '''∇''' is the [[gradient]] operator.

We have the second term in the Euler equation as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\right) \boldsymbol{u} = \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}\right) - \boldsymbol{u} \times \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \boldsymbol{u} = \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}\right) \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
where the first equality is a [[vector calculus identities|vector calculus identity]] and the second equality uses that the flow is irrotational. Furthermore, for every irrotational flow, there exists a [[velocity potential]] ''φ'' such that '''''u''''' = '''∇'''''φ''. Substituting this all in the equation for momentum conservation yields
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left( \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} + \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} + \frac p\rho \right) = \boldsymbol{0}. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the quantity between brackets must be constant (any ''t''-dependence can be eliminated by redefining ''φ''). Assuming that the fluid is at rest at infinity and that the pressure is defined to be zero there, this constant is zero, and thus
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} + \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} + \frac p\rho = 0, \qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]] for unsteady potential flow.

===Zero drag===

Now, suppose that a body moves with constant velocity '''''v''''' through the fluid, which is at rest infinitely far away. Then the velocity field of the fluid has to follow the body, so it is of the form '''''u'''''('''''x''''', ''t'') = '''''u'''''('''''x''''' − '''''v'''&amp;nbsp;t'', 0), where '''''x''''' is the spatial coordinate vector, and thus:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \left( \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \right) \boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{0}. &lt;/math&gt;
Since '''''u''''' = '''∇'''''φ'', this can be integrated with respect to '''''x''''':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = -\boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi + R(t) = -\boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} + R(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The force '''''F''''' that the fluid exerts on the body is given by the surface integral
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} = - \int_A p\, \boldsymbol{n}\; \mathrm{d} S &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' denotes the body surface and '''''n''''' the [[normal vector]] on the body surface. But it follows from (2) that
:&lt;math&gt; p = - \rho \Bigl( \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} + \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} \Bigr) = \rho \Bigl( \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} - \tfrac12 \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} - R(t) \Bigr), &lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} = - \int_A p\, \boldsymbol{n}\; \mathrm{d} S = \rho \int_A \left(\tfrac12 \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}\right) \boldsymbol{n}\; \mathrm{d} S, &lt;/math&gt;
with the contribution of ''R(t)'' to the integral being equal to zero.

At this point, it becomes more convenient to work in the [[vector component]]s. The ''k''th component of this equation reads
:&lt;math&gt; F_k = \rho \int_A \sum_i (\tfrac12 u_i^2 - u_i v_i) n_k \, \mathrm{d} S. \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''V'' be the volume occupied by the fluid. The [[divergence theorem]] says that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac12 \int_A \sum_i u_i^2 n_k \, \mathrm{d} S = - \frac12 \int_V \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} \left( \sum_i u_i^2 \right) \,\mathrm{d} V. &lt;/math&gt;
The right-hand side is an integral over an infinite volume, so this needs some justification, which can be provided by appealing to potential theory to show that the velocity '''''u''''' must fall off as ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; – corresponding to a [[dipole]] potential field in case of a three-dimensional body of finite extent – where ''r'' is the distance to the centre of the body. The integrand in the volume integral can be rewritten as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac12 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} \left( \sum_i u_i^2 \right) = \sum_i u_i \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i} = \sum_i \frac{\partial(u_iu_k)}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;
where first equality (1) and then the incompressibility of the flow are used. Substituting this back into the volume integral and another application of the divergence theorem again. This yields
:&lt;math&gt; - \frac12 \int_V \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} \left( \sum_i u_i^2 \right) \,\mathrm{d} V = -\int_V \sum_i \frac{\partial(u_iu_k)}{\partial x_i} \,\mathrm{d} V = \int_A u_k \sum_i u_i n_i \,\mathrm{d} S.&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting this in (3), we find that
:&lt;math&gt; F_k = \rho \int_A \sum_i (u_k u_i n_i - v_i u_i n_k) \, \mathrm{d} S. &lt;/math&gt;
The fluid cannot penetrate the body and thus '''''n''''' · '''''u''''' = '''''n''''' · '''''v''''' on the body surface. So &lt;math&gt; \sum_i n_i\, v_i = \sum_i n_i\, u_i&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt; F_k = \rho \int_A \sum_i (u_k v_i n_i - v_i u_i n_k) \, \mathrm{d} S. &lt;/math&gt;
Finally, the drag is the force in the direction in which the body moves, so
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{F} = \sum_k v_k F_k = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
Hence the drag vanishes. This is d'Alembert's paradox.

'''Dewi Zephaniah Phillips''' (24 November 1934 – 25 July 2006), known as '''D. Z. Phillips''', '''Dewi Z''', '''Dizzy''', or simply '''DZ''', was a Welsh philosopher. He was a leading proponent of [[Wittgensteinian]] philosophy of religion.  He had an academic career spanning five decades, and at the time of his death he held the Danforth Chair in [[Philosophy of religion]] at [[Claremont Graduate University]], California, and was Professor [[Emeritus]] of Philosophy at [[Swansea University]].

==Biography==
Dewi Zephaniah Phillips was born in [[Swansea]], South [[Wales]], on 24 November 1934. He was the youngest son of David and Alice Phillips, and one of three brothers. (He was predeceased by the Reverend Cadfan Phillips and Keri Phillips.) He attended the [[Bishop Gore School]], Swansea, and studied at [[Swansea University]] (1952–58) and the [[University of Oxford]] (St Catherine's Society) (1958–61).

From 1959 until 1961 he was Minister of Fabian’s Bay Congregational Church, Swansea.  In 1959 he married Margaret Monica Hanford. They would have three sons, Aled, Steffan and Rhys – and four grandchildren, [[Ceri Phillips|Ceri]], Bethan, Sian and Emyr.

Phillips began his academic career at Queen's College, Dundee, in 1961, before joining the [[University College of North Wales]], Bangor, in 1963.

In 1965 he returned to Swansea University, to take up a lectureship in the Department of Philosophy. Promoted to a senior lectureship in 1967, he became professor and head of department in 1971. He also served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts (1982–1985) and as a Vice-Principal (1989–1992).

In 1993 he was appointed Danforth Professor of Philosophy of Religion at the Claremont Graduate University in California, and thereafter divided his time between Claremont and Swansea where, in 1996, he became the Rush Rhees Professor Emeritus and Director of the Rush Rhees Archives and Peter Winch Archives based in Swansea University. He held both positions until his death in 2006. 

Phillips gave many endowed lectures during his tenure at California's [[Claremont Graduate University]]. These included the Cardinal Mercier Lectures (Leuven), [[Marett Lecture]] (Oxford), Riddell Lectures (Newcastle), McMartin Lectures (Carleton University, in Ottawa), Hintz Lecture (Tucson), the Aquinas Lecture (Oxford), and Vonhoff Lectures (Groningen).

His teachers at Swansea – J. R. Jones, R. F. Holland, [[Peter Winch]], and, most importantly, [[Rush Rhees]] inspired an untiring devotion to philosophy. His research interests included the [[philosophy of religion]], ethics, philosophy and literature, [[Simone Weil]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He contributed much to Swansea University's reputation as a centre of Wittgenstein's philosophy. Indeed, Phillips's distinctive contribution to philosophy, and a handful of other philosophers associated with Swansea, is recognised among professional philosophers as "the Swansea school" of philosophy.

The Swansea school of thought is, perhaps, most thoroughly articulated as a positive research program in Phillips' own book on the subject, "Philosophy's Cool Place" (1999), in which he argues for the merits of "contemplative philosophy." On this view, philosophy is an activity involving both inquiries about reality and elucidations of the various contexts in which people live and speak. In contrast to the New Wittgenstein school of thought, philosophy is not limited to purely "therapeutic" treatments and the removing of philosophical confusion. Here, Phillips is primarily indebted to the work of Rush Rhees. For Phillips, what gives philosophy its unique disciplinary feature is its primary concern with the question of the nature of reality: "How can philosophy give an account of reality which shows that it is necessary to go beyond simply noting differences between various modes of discourse, without invoking a common measure of 'the real' or assuming that all modes of discourse have a common subject, namely, Reality?"&lt;ref&gt;DZ Phillips, ''Philosophy's Cool Place'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside philosophy and academia, his commitment to the language and culture of Wales was clear. He was instrumental in the founding of the Taliesin Arts Centre on the university campus in Swansea, and promoted the use of the Welsh language in local schools. He was honoured by membership of the [[Gorsedd]] Circle of the National Eisteddfod.

Phillips died of a heart attack in Swansea University Library, on 25 July 2006. He was 71.

==Published works==
D. Z. Phillips was perhaps best known for his publications in the [[philosophy of religion]], but he has also published articles in ethics, philosophy and literature, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Welsh language]] publications in Welsh literature. He was editor of the journal Philosophical Investigations (Blackwells) and the Swansea Series in Philosophy (Palgrave), as well as the Claremont Studies in the Philosophy of Religion and Wittgensteinian Studies series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">'''Ernst Tugendhat''' (born March 8, 1930) is a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]]-born [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]].

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]], to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family that commissioned [[Mies van der Rohe]] with the [[Villa Tugendhat]] in Brno. In 1938 the family emigrated from Czechoslovakia to [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], and in 1941 travelled on to settle in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].

Tugendhat studied classics at [[Stanford]] from 1944 to 1949, and went on to do graduate work in philosophy and classics at the [[University of Freiburg]], receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] with a work on [[Aristotle]] in 1956. During the years 1956−1958 he did [[postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral research]] at the [[University of Münster]]. From then until 1964 he was an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Tübingen]], where, after spending 1965 lecturing at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], he gained his [[Habilitation]] in 1966 analyzing the concept of [[truth]] in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

Tugendhat became a professor at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]] (1966−1975). During the 1960s and 1970s, Heidelberg developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing [[German student movement|student protests in Germany]].&lt;ref name="Ruprecht12.7.1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathphys.fsk.uni-heidelberg.de/ruprecht2.html |title=Student protests at Heidelberg |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Ruprecht online - University of Heidelberg Homepage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215141632/http://mathphys.fsk.uni-heidelberg.de/ruprecht2.html |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }} from ''Ruprecht'', issue 37, 12.07.95&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[student movement]] and as a protest against the situation at German universities in the 1970s,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Tugendhat gave up his position and relocated to [[Starnberg]], where [[Jürgen Habermas]] was at the time.  In 1980 he moved to [[Berlin]], becoming, like his friend [[Michael Theunissen]], a Professor of Philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin]].  He was invited to give the 1988&amp;ndash;89 [[John Locke lectures]] at the [[University of Oxford]], but had to withdraw because of ill health.

Tugendhat retired in 1992, but was a visiting professor in philosophy at the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] (1992−1996), a researcher at the [[Institute for Human Sciences]], [[Vienna]] (1996), and visiting professor at [[Charles University]] in Prague, [[Czech Republic]] (1997−1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34835">The '''ethics of artificial intelligence''' is the part of the [[ethics of technology]] specific to [[robot]]s and other [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] beings. It is typically{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} divided into [[roboethics]], a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, construct, use and treat artificially intelligent beings, and [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial moral agents (AMAs).

==Robot ethics==
{{Main article|Robot ethics}}

The term "robot ethics" (sometimes "roboethics") refers to the morality of how humans design, construct, use and treat robots and other artificially intelligent beings.&lt;ref name=Veruggio2002&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.2810&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | title = The Roboethics Roadmap | page = 2 | author = Veruggio, Gianmarco | publisher = Scuola di Robotica | year = 2007 | accessdate = 28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers both how artificially intelligent beings may be used to harm humans and how they may be used to benefit humans.

===Robot rights===
"Robot rights" is the concept that people should have moral obligations towards their machines, similar to [[human rights]] or [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072 | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | publisher = Universidad Complutense Madrid | year = 2015 | accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that robot rights, such as a right to exist and perform its own mission, could be linked to robot duty to serve human, by analogy with linking human rights to human duties before society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/artificial-personal-autonomy-and-concept-of-robot-rights | title = Artificial Personal Autonomy and Concept of Robot Rights | last = Sheliazhenko | first = Yurii | authorlink = Yurii Sheliazhenko | publisher = European journal of law and political sciences | year = 2017 | accessdate = 10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could include the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression and equality before the law.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The issue has been considered by the [[Institute for the Future]]&lt;ref&gt;

Experts disagree whether specific and detailed laws will be required soon or safely in the distant future.&lt;ref name=TimesOnline/&gt; Glenn McGee reports that sufficiently humanoid robots may appear by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Another group of scientists meeting in 2007 supposed that at least 50 years had to pass before any sufficiently advanced system would exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080522163926/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-big-question-should-the-human-race-be-worried-by-the-rise-of-robots-446107.html The Big Question: Should the human race be worried by the rise of robots?], Independent Newspaper, 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition envisioned the possibility of robots having rights of their own:
&lt;blockquote&gt;61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules — Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2017, the android [[Sophia (robot)|Sophia]] was granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia, though some observers found this to be more of a publicity stunt than a meaningful legal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/ Saudi Arabia bestows citizenship on a robot named Sophia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of [[Sentientism]] grants degrees of moral consideration to all sentient beings, primarily humans and most non-human animals. If artificial or alien intelligences show evidence of being [[Sentience|sentient]], this philosophy holds that they should be shown compassion and granted rights.

===Threat to human dignity===
{{Main article|Computer Power and Human Reason}}
[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] argued in 1976 that AI technology should not be used to replace people in positions that require respect and care, such as any of these:
* A customer service representative (AI technology is already used today for telephone-based [[interactive voice response]] systems)
* A therapist (as was proposed by [[Kenneth Colby]] in the 1970s)
* A nursemaid for the elderly (as was reported by [[Pamela McCorduck]] in her book ''The Fifth Generation'')
* A soldier
* A judge
* A police officer
* A Barman
Weizenbaum explains that we require authentic feelings of [[empathy]] from people in these positions. If machines replace them, we will find ourselves alienated, devalued and frustrated. Artificial intelligence, if used in this way, represents a threat to human dignity. Weizenbaum argues that the fact that we are entertaining the possibility of machines in these positions suggests that we have experienced an "atrophy of the human spirit that comes from thinking of ourselves as computers."&lt;ref name=MWZ&gt;[[Joseph Weizenbaum]], quoted in {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=356, 374–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pamela McCorduck]] counters that, speaking for women and minorities "I'd rather take my chances with an impartial computer," pointing out that there are conditions where we would prefer to have automated  judges and police that have no personal agenda at all.&lt;ref name=MWZ/&gt; However, [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein stress that AI systems are only as smart as the data used to train them since they are, in their essence, nothing more than fancy curve-fitting machines: Using AI to support a court ruling can be highly problematic if past rulings show bias toward certain groups since those biases get formalized and engrained, which makes them even more difficult to spot and fight against.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] objects to the moralizing tone of Weizenbaum's critique. "When moralizing is both vehement and vague, it invites authoritarian abuse," he writes.

[[Bill Hibbard]]&lt;ref name="hibbard 2014"&gt;Hibbard, Bill (2014): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373 "Ethical Artificial Intelligence"].&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "Human dignity requires that we strive to remove our ignorance of the nature of existence, and AI is necessary for that striving."

===Transparency and open source===
[[Bill Hibbard]] argues that because AI will have such a profound effect on humanity, AI developers are representatives of future humanity and thus have an ethical obligation to be transparent in their efforts.&lt;ref name="AGI-08a"&gt;[http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/g/hibbard_agi_workshop.pdf Open Source AI.] Bill Hibbard. 2008 proceedings of the First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, eds. Pei Wang, Ben Goertzel and Stan Franklin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Goertzel]] and David Hart created [[OpenCog]] as an [[Open-source software|open source]] framework for AI development.&lt;ref name="AGI-08b"&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.366.621&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf OpenCog: A Software Framework for Integrative Artificial General Intelligence.] David Hart and Ben Goertzel. 2008 proceedings of the First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, eds. Pei Wang, Ben Goertzel and Stan Franklin.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[OpenAI]] is a non-profit AI research company created by [[Elon Musk]], [[Sam Altman]] and others to develop open source AI beneficial to humanity.&lt;ref name="OpenAI"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/ Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free] Cade Metz, Wired 27 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other open source AI developments.

==Weaponization of artificial intelligence==
{{Main article|Lethal autonomous weapon}}
Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref name="Call for debate on killer robots"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/08/robot-three-way-portends-autonomous-future/ Robot Three-Way Portends Autonomous Future], By David Axe wired.com, August 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as [[military robots]] become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"], by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L. Flatley engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One researcher states that [[autonomous robot]]s might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Within this last decade, there has been intensive research in autonomous power with the ability to learn using assigned moral responsibilities. "The results may be used when designing future military robots, to control unwanted tendencies to assign responsibility to the robots."&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1372020233&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] view, there is a chance that robots will develop the ability to make their own logical decisions on who to kill and that is why there should be a set moral framework that the A.I cannot override.

There has been a recent outcry with regard to the engineering of artificial-intelligence weapons that has included ideas of a robot takeover of mankind. AI weapons do present a type of danger different from that of human-controlled weapons. Many governments have begun to fund programs to develop AI weaponry. The United States Navy recently announced plans to develop [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|autonomous drone weapons]], paralleling similar announcements by Russia and Korea respectively. 
Due to the potential of AI weapons becoming more dangerous than human-operated weapons, [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Max Tegmark]] signed a "Future of Life" petition to ban AI weapons. The message posted by Hawking and Tegmark states that AI weapons pose an immediate danger and that action is required to avoid catastrophic disasters in the near future.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/humans-not-robots-are-the-real-reason-artificial-intelligence-is-scary/400994/|title=Why Artificial Intelligence Can Too Easily Be Weaponized - The Atlantic|author=Zach Musgrave and Bryan W. Roberts|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If any major military power pushes ahead with the AI weapon development, a global [[arms race]] is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow", says the petition, which includes [[Skype]] co-founder [[Jaan Tallinn]] and MIT professor of linguistics [[Noam Chomsky]] as additional supporters against AI weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/27/musk-hawking-warn-of-artificial-intelligence-weapons/|title=Musk, Hawking Warn of Artificial Intelligence Weapons|author=Cat Zakrzewski|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and Astronomer Royal [[Sir Martin Rees]] has warned of catastrophic instances like "dumb robots going rogue or a network that develops a mind of its own." [[Huw Price]], a colleague of Rees at Cambridge, has voiced a similar warning that humans might not survive when intelligence "escapes the constraints of biology." These two professors created the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] at Cambridge University in the hope of avoiding this threat to human existence.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

Regarding the potential for smarter-than-human systems to be employed militarily, the [[Open Philanthropy Project]] writes that these scenarios "seem potentially as important as the risks related to loss of control", but that research organizations investigating AI's long-run social impact have spent relatively little time on this concern: "this class of scenarios has not been a major focus for the organizations that have been most active in this space, such as the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] (MIRI) and the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] (FHI), and there seems to have been less analysis and debate regarding them".&lt;ref name="givewell"&gt;{{cite report |author=GiveWell |authorlink=GiveWell |coauthors= |date=2015 |title=Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |publisher= |page= |docket= |accessdate=11 October 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machine ethics==
{{Main article|Machine ethics}}
Machine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing [[Moral agency#Artificial moral agents|Artificial Moral Agents]] (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral.&lt;ref name=Andersonweb&gt;{{cite web | url= http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/anderson/MachineEthics.html | title= Machine Ethics | last= Anderson |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2011&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first= Michael |editor1-last= Anderson | editor2-first= Susan Leigh |editor2-last= Anderson  |date=July 2011 | title = Machine Ethics | isbn = 978-0-521-11235-2 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2006&gt;{{cite journal |date= July–August 2006 |title= Special Issue on Machine Ethics |journal= IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume= 21 |issue= 4 |pages= 10–63 |editor1-first= Michael |editor1-last= Anderson |editor2-first= Susan Leigh |editor2-last= Anderson |issn= 1541-1672 |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/mags/ex/2006/04/x4toc.htm |doi= 10.1109/mis.2006.70 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111126025029/http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/mags/ex/2006/04/x4toc.htm |archivedate= 2011-11-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2007&gt;{{cite journal  | first1= Michael | last1= Anderson | first2= Susan Leigh | last2= Anderson |date=Winter 2007 |title= Machine Ethics: Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent | journal= AI Magazine |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |pages= 15–26 |publisher= American Association for Artificial Intelligence |issn= 0738-4602 |url= http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[Rational agent|rational agency]], [[moral agency]], and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyles|first1=Robert James M.|title=Philosophical Signposts for Artificial Moral Agent Frameworks|journal=Suri|date=October 2017 |volume=6|issue=2|pages=92–109|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/BOYPSF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] considered the issue in the 1950s in his ''[[I, Robot]]''.  At the insistence of his editor [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], he proposed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] to govern artificially intelligent systems.  Much of his work was then spent testing the boundaries of his three laws to see where they would break down, or where they would create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances.&lt;ref name=Asimov2008&gt;{{Cite book | last = Asimov | first =  Isaac | year = 2008 | title = [[I, Robot]] | isbn = 0-553-38256-X | publisher = Bantam  | location = New York | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, during an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], robots that were programmed to cooperate with each other (in searching out a beneficial resource and avoiding a poisonous one) eventually learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other], Popular Science, August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One problem in this case may have been that the goals were "terminal" (i.e. in contrast, ultimate human motives typically have a quality of requiring never-ending learning).&lt;ref name=SantosLang2002&gt;{{cite web | url= http://santoslang.wordpress.com/article/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences-3iue30fi4gfq9-1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref name="Call for debate on killer robots"/&gt; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"], by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L. Flatley  engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.&lt;/ref&gt; They point to programs like the [[Language Acquisition Device (computer)|Language Acquisition Device]] which can emulate human interaction.

[[Vernor Vinge]] has suggested that a moment may come when some computers are smarter than humans. He calls this "[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]."&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"/&gt;  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; This is discussed by a philosophy called [[Singularitarianism]]. The [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] has suggested a need to build "[[Friendly AI]]", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html Article at Asimovlaws.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524150856/http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html |date=May 24, 2012 }}, July 2004, accessed 7/27/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference organized by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is one technology in particular that could truly bring the possibility of robots with moral competence to reality. In a paper on the acquisition of moral values by robots, [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] mentions the case of [[Neuromorphic engineering|neuromorphic]] chips, which aim to process information similarly to humans, nonlinearly and with millions of interconnected artificial neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-08-12/moral-code|title=The Moral Code|last=Al-Rodhan|first=Nayef|date=2015-08-12|work=Foreign Affairs|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots embedded with neuromorphic technology could learn and develop knowledge in a uniquely humanlike way. Inevitably, this raises the question of the environment in which such robots would learn about the world and whose morality they would inherit - or if they end up developing human 'weaknesses' as well: selfishness, a pro-survival attitude, hesitation etc.

In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'',&lt;ref name=Wallach2008&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Wendell | last1 = Wallach  | first2 = Colin | last2 = Allen |date=November 2008 | title = Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong | isbn = 978-0-19-537404-9 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = USA | ref = harv&lt;!--url=http://www.ttu.ee/public/m/mart-murdvee/Techno-Psy/Wallach_Allen_2008_Moral_Machines_-_Teaching_Robots_Right_from_Wrong.pdf--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that attempts to teach robots right from wrong will likely advance understanding of human ethics by motivating humans to address gaps in modern [[Normative ethics|normative theory]] and by providing a platform for experimental investigation. As one example, it has introduced normative ethicists to the controversial issue of which specific [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]] to use in machines. [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision tree]]s (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | authorlink1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | authorlink2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year=2011 | format= PDF | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chris Santos-Lang argued in the opposite direction on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable to criminal "[[Hacker culture|hackers]]".&lt;ref name=SantosLang2002/&gt;

==Unintended consequences==
{{Further information|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

Many researchers have argued that, by way of an "intelligence explosion" sometime in the 21st century, a self-improving AI could become so vastly more powerful than humans that we would not be able to stop it from achieving its goals.&lt;ref name="Muehlhauser, Luke 2012"&gt;Muehlhauser, Luke, and Louie Helm. 2012. [https://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf "Intelligence Explosion and Machine Ethics"]. In Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment, edited by Amnon Eden, Johnny Søraker, James H. Moor, and Eric Steinhart. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his paper "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence," philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that artificial intelligence has the capability to bring about human extinction. He claims that general super-intelligence would be capable of independent initiative and of making its own plans, and may therefore be more appropriately thought of as an autonomous agent. Since artificial intellects need not share our human motivational tendencies, it would be up to the designers of the [[Superintelligence|super-intelligence]] to specify its original motivations. In theory, a super-intelligent AI would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and to thwart any attempt to prevent the implementation of its top goal, many uncontrolled [[unintended consequences]] could arise. It could kill off all other agents, persuade them to change their behavior, or block their attempts at interference.&lt;ref name="Bostrom, Nick 2003"&gt;Bostrom, Nick. 2003. [http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"]. In Cognitive, Emotive and Ethical Aspects of Decision Making in Humans and in Artificial Intelligence, edited by Iva Smit and George E. Lasker, 12–17. Vol. 2. Windsor, ON: International Institute for Advanced Studies in Systems Research / Cybernetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, instead of overwhelming the human race and leading to our destruction, Bostrom has also asserted that super-intelligence can help us solve many difficult problems such as disease, poverty, and environmental destruction, and could help us to “enhance” ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/armageddon-is-not-the-ai-problem/|title=Sure, Artificial Intelligence May End Our World, But That Is Not the Main Problem|website=WIRED|language=en-US|accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly.&lt;ref name="Muehlhauser, Luke 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom, Nick 2003" /&gt; Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not "common sense". According to [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2011. [https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf "Complex Value Systems in Friendly AI"]. In Schmidhuber, Thórisson, and Looks 2011, 388–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Hibbard]]&lt;ref name="hibbard 2014"/&gt; proposes an AI design that avoids several types of unintended AI behavior including self-delusion, unintended instrumental actions, and corruption of the reward generator.

==In fiction==
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
The movie ''[[The Thirteenth Floor]]'' suggests a future where [[simulated reality|simulated worlds]] with sentient inhabitants are created by computer [[game console]]s for the purpose of entertainment. The movie ''[[The Matrix]]'' suggests a future where the dominant species on planet Earth are sentient machines and humanity is treated with utmost [[Speciesism]]. The short story "[[The Planck Dive]]" suggest a future where humanity has turned itself into software that can be duplicated and optimized and the relevant distinction between types of software is sentient and non-sentient. The same idea can be found in the [[Emergency Medical Hologram]] of ''[[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|Starship Voyager]]'', which is an apparently sentient copy of a reduced subset of the consciousness of its creator, [[Lewis Zimmerman|Dr. Zimmerman]], who, for the best motives, has created the system to give medical assistance in case of emergencies. The movies ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'' and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence |A.I.]]'' deal with the possibility of sentient robots that could love. ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' explored some aspects of Asimov's three laws. All these scenarios try to foresee possibly unethical consequences of the creation of sentient computers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The ethics of artificial intelligence is one of several core themes in BioWare's [[Mass Effect]] series of games.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It explores the scenario of a civilization accidentally creating AI through a rapid increase in computational power through a global scale [[neural network]]. This event caused an ethical schism between those who felt bestowing organic rights upon the newly sentient Geth was appropriate and those who continued to see them as disposable machinery and fought to destroy them. Beyond the initial conflict, the complexity of the relationship between the machines and their creators is another ongoing theme throughout the story.

Over time, debates have tended to focus less and less on ''possibility'' and more on ''desirability'',{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} as emphasized in the [[Hugo de Garis#The Artilect War|"Cosmist" and "Terran" debates]] initiated by [[Hugo de Garis]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. A Cosmist, according to Hugo de Garis, is actually seeking to build more intelligent successors to the human species.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
[[Image:Tree of life.svg|right|thumb|A [[phylogenetic tree]] of living things]]
'''Evolutionary ecology''' lies at the intersection of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are [[Life history theory|life history evolution]], [[sociobiology]] (the [[evolution]] of social [[behavior]]), the evolution of inter specific relations ([[cooperation]], [[Predator-prey interaction|predator–prey interactions]], [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]) and the evolution of [[biodiversity]] and of [[Community|communities]].

Evolutionary ecology mostly considers two things: how interactions (both among species and between species and their physical environment) shape species through selection and adaptation, and the consequences of the resulting evolutionary change.

==Evolutionary models==
{{Evolutionary biology}}
A large part of evolutionary ecology is about utilising models and finding empirical data as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morozov|first=Andrew|date=2013-12-06|title=Modelling biological evolution: recent progress, current challenges and future direction|journal=Interface Focus|volume=3|issue=6|pages=20130054|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2013.0054|issn=2042-8898|pmc=3915852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the Lack clutch size model devised by [[David Lack]] and his study of [[Darwin's finches]] on the Galapagos Islands. Lack's study of Darwin's finches was important in analyzing the role of different ecological factors in [[speciation]]. Lack suggested that differences in species were adaptive and produced by [[natural selection]], based on the assertion by G.F. Gause that two species cannot occupy the same niche.&lt;ref&gt;"Lack, David Lambert." Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 17, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008, pp. 521–523. Gale Virtual Reference Library, go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=tusc49521&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CCX2830905204&amp;it=r&amp;asid=f73ad736d17e749682f6a72c03aeca54. Accessed 10 Nov. 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Levins]] introduced his model of the specialization of species in 1968, which investigated how habitat specialization evolved within heterogeneous environments using the fitness sets an organism or species possesses. This model developed the concept of spatial scales in specific environments, defining fine-grained spatial scales and coarse-grained spatial scales.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Joel S., and Noel B. Pavlovic. “Evolution in heterogeneous environments: Effects of migration on habitat specialization.” Evolutionary Ecology, vol. 6, no. 5, 1992, pp. 360–382. {{doi|10.1007/bf02270698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this model include a rapid increase in environmental ecologists' understanding of how spatial scales impact species diversity in a certain environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Simon P., et al. “The spatial scales of species coexistence.” Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, vol. 1, no. 8, 2017, pp. 1066–1073. {{doi|10.1038/s41559-017-0230-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model is Law and Diekmann's 1996 models on [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], which is defined as a relationship between two organisms that benefits both individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein, Judith. “Mutualisms and Symbioses.” Oxford Bibliographies, 20 Nov 2017, www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0006.xml.&lt;/ref&gt; Law and Diekmann developed a framework called adaptive dynamics, which assumes that changes in plant or animal populations in response to a disturbance or lack thereof occurs at a faster rate than mutations occur. It is aimed to simplify other models addressing the relationships within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Akçay, Erol. (2015). Evolutionary models of mutualism. In J. L. Bronstein (Ed.), Mutualism (pp. 57–76). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tangled nature model ==
The tangled nature model provides different methods for demonstrating and predicting trends in evolutionary ecology. The model analyzes an individual prone to [[mutation]] within a population as well as other factors such as extinction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Tangled Nature Model of Evolutionary Ecology: An Overview |author=Laird, Simon |journal=Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems| volume= II|pages= 49–62 |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4556-4_5|year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8176-4555-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was developed by Simon Laird, Daniel Lawson, and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen of the Imperial College London in 2002. The purpose of the model is to create a simple and logical ecological model based on observation. The model is designed such that ecological effects can be accounted for when determining form, and fitness of a population.

== Ecological genetics ==
Ecological genetics tie into evolutionary ecology through the study of how traits evolve in natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0021214.html |title=Ecological Genetics |publisher=Wiley |date=September 2016 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists are concerned with how the environment and timeframe leads to genes becoming dominant. Organisms must continually adapt in order to survive in natural habitats. Genes define which organisms survive and which will die out. When organisms develop different genetic variations, even though they stem from the same species, it is known as polymorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Polymorphism |title=Polymorphism |publisher=biology online |date=December 6, 2008 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that pass on beneficial genes continue to evolve their species to have an advantage inside of their niche.

==Evolutionary ecologists==

=== Charles Darwin ===

The basis of the central principles of evolutionary ecology can be attributed to [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), specifically in referencing his theory of [[natural selection]] and [[population dynamics]], which discusses how populations of a species change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/ecologyapp/modules/population-dynamics/|title=Population Dynamics {{!}} e-cology|website=sites.nicholas.duke.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernst Mayr]], professor of Zoology at Harvard University, Darwin’s most distinct contributions to evolutionary biology and ecology are as follows: “The first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of [[evolution]] itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, “Darwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George Evelyn Hutchinson ===
[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|George Evelyn Hutchinson’s]] (1903–1991) contributions to the field of ecology spanned over 60 years, in which he had significant influence in systems ecology, radiation ecology, [[limnology]], and [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390–394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the “father of modern ecology” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390–394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], Hutchinson was one of the first scientists to link the subjects of ecology and mathematics. According to Hutchinson, he constructed “mathematical models of populations, the changing proportions of individuals of various ages, birthrate, the [[ecological niche]], and population interaction in this technical introduction to population ecology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60322007|title=Introduction to population ecology|last=1943-|first=Rockwood, Larry L.,|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9781405132633|location=Malden, MA|oclc=60322007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had a vast interest in limnology, due to his belief that lakes could be studied as a [[microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;that provides insight into system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyland|first=Callen|date=Summer 2011|title=The Art of Ecology, Writings of G.

If a set of properties in either system changes in such a way that the action of the first system on the second changes, this may cause changes in properties of the second system which alter the mode of action of the second system on the first.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=G. Evelyn|date=1948-10-01|title=Circular Causal Systems in Ecology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1948.tb39854.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=221–246|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1948.tb39854.x|issn=1749-6632|bibcode=1948NYASA..50..221H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert MacArthur ===

[[Robert H. MacArthur|Robert MacArthur]] (1930–1972) is best known in the field of Evolutionary Ecology for his work ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'', in which he and his co-author propose “that the number of species on any island reflects a balance between the rate at which new species colonize it and the rate at which populations of established species become [[Extinction|extinct]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Island_Biogeography.html|title=Island Biogeography|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eric Pianka ===

According to the University of Texas, [[Eric Pianka]]’s (1939–present) work in evolutionary ecology includes foraging strategies, reproductive tactics, competition and niche theory, community structure and organization, species diversity, and understanding rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pianka is also known for his interest in lizards to study ecological occurrences, as he claimed they were “often abundant, making them relatively easy to locate, observe, and capture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Michael Rosenzweig ===

[[Michael Rosenzweig|Michael L. Rosenzweig]] (1941–present) created and popularized [[Reconciliation ecology]], which began with his theory that designated nature preserves would not be enough land to conserve the [[biodiversity]] of Earth, as humans have used so much land that they have negatively impacted [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and had other ecological impacts that have negatively affected species compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62866022|title=Win-win ecology : how the earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise|last=L.|first=Rosenzweig, Michael|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156041|location=Oxford|oclc=62866022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Michael Rosenzweig's idea of [[reconciliation ecology]] was developed based on existing research, which was conducted on the principle first suggested by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] stating that larger areas of land will have increased species diversity as compared to smaller areas. This research focused on [[Species–area relationship|species-area relationships]] (SPARs) and the different scales on which they exist, ranging from sample-area to interprovincial SPARs. Steady-state dynamics in diversity gave rise to these SPARs, which are now used to measure the reduction of species diversity on Earth. In response to this decline in diversity, Rosenzweig's reconciliation ecology was born.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, Michael L. “Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity.” Oryx, vol. 37, no. 02, 10 Feb. 2003, {{doi|10.1017/s0030605303000371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary ecology has been studied using symbiotic relationships between organisms to determine the evolutionary forces by which such relationships develop. In symbiotic relationships, the [[symbiont]] must confer some advantage to its host in order to persist and continue to be evolutionarily viable. Research has been conducted using aphids and the symbiotic bacteria with which they coevolve. These bacteria are most frequently conserved from generation to generation, displaying high levels of [[vertical transmission]]. Results have shown that these symbiotic bacteria ultimately confer some resistance to parasites to their host aphids, which both increases the fitness of the aphids and lead to symbiont-mediated coevolution between the species.&lt;ref&gt;Vorburger, Christoph, et al. “Comparing constitutive and induced costs of symbiont-Conferred resistance to parasitoids in aphids.” Ecology and Evolution, vol. 3, no. 3, 2013, pp. 706–13. {{doi|10.1002/ece3.491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color variation in cichlid fish ==
The effects of evolutionary ecology and its consequences can be seen in the case of color variation among [[Cichlid|African cichlid fish]]. With over 2,000 species, cichlid fishes are very species-rich and capable of complex social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-8-133 |title=Functional diversity in the color vision of cichlid fishes |journal=BMC Biology |volume=8 |pages=133 |publisher=BMC Biology, BioMed Central |date=October 28, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2017|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-8-133 |pmid=21029409 |pmc=2988715 |last1=Sabbah |first1=Shai |last2=Laria |first2=Raico |last3=Gray |first3=Suzanne M |last4=Hawryshyn |first4=Craig W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polychromatism, the variation of color patterns within a population, occurs within cichlid fishes due to environmental adaptations and to increase chances of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00055.x/abstract |title=Evolution of colour patterns in East African cichlid fish |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=514 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |date=December 25, 2001 |access-date=November 4, 2017|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00055.x |last1=Seehausen |last2=Mayhew |last3=Alphen |first3=J.

'''''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast''''' is a book by [[Nelson Goodman]] in which he explores some problems regarding [[scientific law]] and [[counterfactual conditionals]] and presents his [[New riddle of induction|New Riddle of Induction]].

'''Franz Xaver Niemetschek''' ({{lang-cz|František Xaver Němeček|links=no}}; {{lang-pl|Niemeczek|links=no}}) (24 July 1766 – 19 March 1849) was a Czech [[philosopher]], [[teacher]] and [[music critic]]. He wrote the first full-length biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] which has remained an important source of information about the composer.

==Life==

Born in [[Sadská]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], Niemetschek came from a large, musical family. He received his schooling in [[Prague]] at the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] and read philosophy at the university. He taught [[poetry]] and [[Latin]] at the Gymnasiums in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] and started a music publishing business. In 1800 he was awarded a doctorate and in 1802 he became professor at [[Prague University]], lecturing on [[logic]], [[ethics]] and [[pedagogy]]. The composer [[Jan Václav Voříšek]] was one of his pupils. He was made a freeman of Pilsen and Prague for his many valuable contributions to the arts, e.g. as director of the institute for the [[deaf and dumb]]. He wrote books on music history. He lived near the residence of [[Josepha Duschek]]ova in the [[Liechtenstein Palace (Malostranské náměstí, Prague)|Liechtenstein Palace]] in the [[Lesser Quarter]]s of Prague, and was a frequent visitor at the musical gatherings in [[Bertramka]]. In 1820 he retired to Vienna after disagreements with the university authorities.

[[File:Franz Xaver Niemeczek grave, Vienna, 2016.jpg|thumb|Niemeczek's grave, Vienna]]
Niemetschek was one of the first [[music critics]] in Prague. He saw the [[Singspiel]] as the principal factor in the decline of musical standards in the city.

Niemetschek died in Vienna at the age of 82 and is buried in [[St. Marx Cemetery]]. Unfortunately his estate, which contained many valuable documents, is now lost.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Mozart biography==

Mozart's widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] made many documents available to him for his research. His book ''Leben des k.k. Kapellmeisters Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart'' was published in 1798. Later, in 1808, it was published in an altered form with the title ''Lebensbeschreibung des k.k. Kapellmeisters Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart''. Niemetschek claimed to have had a long association with Mozart, but the lack of direct quotations or citings of personal conversations leads some scholars to doubt his claims.&lt;ref name=WatesRE2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Wates|first=Roye E.|title=Mozart: An Introduction to the Music, the Man, and the Myths|year=2010|page=15|publisher=Amadeus Press|isbn=1574671898|quote=Niemetschek... implies that he knew Mozart... [His] future wife ... fashioned hats for Constanze Mozart... [He] himself never saw the composer... didn't move to Prague until 1793.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he welcomed Mozart's two surviving sons, [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]] and [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart|Wolfgang Jr.]], into his home in the Lesser Quarter and became a foster father figure to them.

As the biography makes clear, Niemetschek was very proud of his Czech nationality, and he strongly emphasizes the warm reception that Mozart received during his visits to Prague. ''See [[Mozart and Prague]].''

Based on research by Austrian scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Walther Brauneis|de}}, severe doubt has recently been cast on the veracity of Niemetschek's claim that he actually made Mozart's personal acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Brauneis: "Franz Xaver Niemetschek: Sein Umgang mit Mozart – Eine Legende?", Internationaler Musikwissenschaftlicher Kongreß zum Mozartjahr 1991, Baden-Vienna, ed. Ingrid Fuchs, (Hans Schneider, Tutzing 1993), pp. 491–503.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Gaspard Félix Ravaisson-Mollien''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁavɛsɔ̃ mɔljɛ̃|lang}}; 23 October 1813 &amp;ndash; 18 May 1900) was a French philosopher and [[archaeologist]].

==Biography==
Ravaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour|Collège Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la métaphysique d'Aristote'' ("Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.

In 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled "De l'habitude" ("On Habit"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].

In philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.
[[File:Théodore Chassériau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-Félix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Théodore Chassériau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-Félix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]
Ravaisson's chief philosophical works are: "''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvième siècle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et métaphysique'' (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson was also an archaeologist, and contributed articles on ancient sculpture to the ''Revue Archéologique'' and the ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions''. In 1871 he published a monograph on the [[Venus de Milo]].

'''Android Runtime for Chrome''' ('''ARC''') was a compatibility layer and [[sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]] technology for running Android applications on desktop and laptop computers in an isolated environment. It allowed safely running the applications from a [[web browser]], independent of user operating system, allowing the Android applications to run at near-native speeds. It has since been discontinued after Google developed another method to run Android apps on Chrome OS devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Overview==
The Android Runtime for Chrome is a partially [[open-source software|open-sourced]] project under development by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/arc/arc/+/master/docs/getting-started-open-source.md
|title=Getting Started with ARC Open Source on Linux
|publisher=Google
|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced by Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2014 developer conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtLJPvx7-ys#t=6070 Google I/O 2014 - Keynote - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a limited beta consumer release in September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrome.blogspot.cz/2014/09/first-set-of-android-apps-coming-to.html Google Chrome Blog: First set of Android apps coming to a Chromebook near you&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Duolingo, Evernote, Sight Words, and Vine Android applications were made available in the Chrome Web Store for installation on [[Chromebook]] devices running OS version 37 or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/6088175?hl=en
|title=About App Runtime for Chrome (Beta)
|publisher=Google
|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015|01}}, the development by Google is taking place behind closed doors with individual repository commits, code reviews and most issue tracking being kept internal to the company. The open sourced parts of ARC are licensed under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]].

==Development==
In a limited beta consumer release in September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrome.blogspot.cz/2014/09/first-set-of-android-apps-coming-to.html Google Chrome Blog: First set of Android apps coming to a Chromebook near you&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duolingo]], [[Evernote]], Sight Words, and [[Vine (software)|Vine]] Android applications were made available in the Chrome Web Store for installation on [[Chromebook]] devices running OS version 37 or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/6088175?hl=en
|title=About App Runtime for Chrome (Beta)
|publisher=Google
|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, three more apps were added: [[CloudMagic]], [[Onefootball]], and [[Podcast Addict]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omgchrome.com/three-android-apps-officially-available-chrome-os-including-podcast-addict&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Anandtech reported that [[VLC media player]] should be added in the coming months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/show/9082/the-chromebook-pixel-2015-review/5&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2015, Google released ''ARC Welder'', a Chrome Packaged App providing the ARC runtime and application packager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Brian|title=Google’s ARC Welder Gives You A Glimpse Of An Android-Anywhere Future|url=http://readwrite.com/2015/04/02/arc-welder-android-apps-to-chrome|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=ReadWrite}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to give Android developers a preview of the upcoming technology and a chance to test their Android apps on the Chrome platform.

==Architecture==
ARC builds upon the [[Google Native Client]].&lt;ref&gt;https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/bss/2014/l/proposals/meng.xu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Client platform is being extended with a [[POSIX]]-compatible layer on top of the NaCl Integrated Runtime and Pepper APIs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emulate the Linux environment in the foundation of an Android phone. This then allows running an almost unchanged Dalvik VM in a sandboxed environment.

ARC uses the Chrome permission system, not the Android one.

==Security==
According to a security evaluation by Meng Xu, ARC apps may communicate with other installed Chrome Extensions and the files stored on the underlying operating system which might open avenues to various attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sslab.gtisc.gatech.edu/2014/arc-security.html |title=Security Evaluation for ARC |author=Meng Xu |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These threats are mitigated by the heavily sandboxed environment of ARC.&lt;ref&gt;https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/bss/2014/l/final/mengxu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community efforts==
During the second half of 2014, before any developer tools or documentation was released by Google, several community efforts about ARC appeared.

Vlad Filippov maintains ARChon, an unofficial distribution of the ARC runtime which can be installed to non-chromebook computers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bitbucket.org/vladikoff/archon vladikoff / ARChon — Bitbucket]&lt;/ref&gt; The same developer also maintains a JavaScript (nodejs) tool to automate packaging Android apps for use with ARC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk vladikoff/chromeos-apk · GitHub&lt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other developers created more user-friendly tools beyond chromeos-apk to simplify packaging applications for the ARCon runtime.

==Reception==
The reception has been mostly positive. Some developers expressed confusion about the wide scale of competing development platforms which Google now offers: Web apps, Chrome Packaged Apps and Android Apps delivered through ARC. Google responded that they are fully committed to all those platforms and encourage developers to choose the one that fits them best.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502063427/http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "In psychology, what is "guilt," and what are the stages of guilt development?". eNotes.com. 2006. 31 December 2007: 'Let's begin with a working definition of guilt. Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders. People appear to engage in targeted and specific reparatory behaviors toward the persons they wronged or offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guilty Feelings, Targeted Actions|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/5/607|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 22337764|pages = 607–618|volume = 38|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0146167211435796|language = en|first = Cynthia E.|last = Cryder|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Springer|first3 = Carey K.|last3 = Morewedge|pmc=4886498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11. Psychopathy and the Five-Factor Model of Personality, Widiger and Lynam |title=Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=173–7 |isbn=1-57230-864-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;!--Check Edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A person with psychopathy has a tendency to be harmful to his or herself and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-guilt==

Feeling guilt for one's own actions. This doesn't mean that you feel guilty for your own actions all the time, you can feel self-guilt even if someone else did something. Self-guilt can often lead to [[depression (mood)]] and worst-case scenarios.

===Self-guilt in relationships===
While dealing with self-guilt, there's even more stuff you need to deal with. Self-guilt can mentally eat up a person while they're in a relationship, making them feel [[guilt]] on one's ownself. This can occur due to many things, one of them in insecurties. Feeling insecure can lead to self-guilt, feeling like it's one's own fault for feeling that way. This can often feel stressful, causing mental-break downs, problems in the relationship, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="tinybuddha"&gt;[https://tinybuddha.com/topic/self-guilt-might-ruin-my-relationship-need-to-make-a-solid-change/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Self-harm===
Self-guilt is a feeling many people who self-harm get. Self-guilt is almost like mentally self-harming to one's ownself, except it's in the mind. People who self-harm often feel it's their fault for doing it, which makes them feel ashamed. Harming yourself is often felt like it's your own fault, giving the feeling of ''self-guilt''. &lt;ref name="self-harm and self-guilt"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1367493507082759| pmid=18039732|title = Guilt and shame: Experiences of parents of self-harming adolescents| journal=Journal of Child Health Care| volume=11| issue=4| pages=298–310|year = 2007|last1 = McDonald|first1 = Glenda| last2=O'Brien| first2=Louise| last3=Jackson| first3=Debra}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Depression===
[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is often related to self-guilt. Constant feeling of self-guilt can lead to depression, since an individual is constantly putting themselves down. Self-guilt sparks insecurity, indecision, and poor decisions. &lt;ref name="depression"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/overcoming-guilt-in-depression/ | title=Overcoming Guilt in Depression| date=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

'''Howard (Haim) Kreisel''' is a professor of medieval [[Jewish Philosophy]] in the department of Jewish Thought at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] and directs the Goldstein-Goren-International Center for Jewish Thought

==Biography==
Howard (Haim) Kreisel was born in New York in 1951. He received his B.A. (summa cum laude with honors in philosophy) at [[Brandeis University]] in 1972 and went on to complete his M.A. (1976) and Ph.D. (1981) at Brandeis in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies. His doctoral dissertation, Theories of Prophecy in Medieval Jewish Philosophy was written under the supervision of [[Alfred Ivry]]. He taught medieval [[Jewish studies]] for three years at the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] (Wyncote, Pennsylvania) before moving to Israel in 1983. He has taught at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from 1983 till the present and currently holds the Miriam Martha Hubert Chair in Jewish Thought. In 1995-1996 he served as a visiting professor at the [[University of Calgary]] in the departments of religion and philosophy. Among his administrative positions he served as the first chair of the newly formed Goldstein-Goren department of Jewish thought at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (1998–2002) before assuming the position of directing the Goldstein-Goren International Center for Jewish Thought (2003–present) and editor-in-chief of the series he founded, Goldstein-Goren Library of Jewish Thought (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press).

==Scholarship==
Kreisel’s research covers the gamut of [[medieval Jewish philosophy]]. His particular interests lie in the areas of [[prophecy]], medieval Jewish ethical and [[political philosophy]] as well as philosophical [[exegesis]] of the Bible. Over the past decade he has devoted most of his scholarly activity to producing critical annotated editions of important Jewish medieval treatises that have survived only in manuscript form, most notably works by [[Nissim of Marseilles]], [[Moses Ibn Tibbon]] and [[Levi ben Avraham]]. All four volumes have appeared of the latter’s monumental encyclopedia, ''Livyat Hen''. Kreisel recently completed a project to publish the five earliest supercommentaries on [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]]’s commentary on the [[Torah]], and is currently working on Judah Mosconi's supercommentary. He is the author of 10 books and over 50 scholarly articles. He has also edited or co-edited 6 books.

==Releases==
* '''IPPOLIT''', released on May 2, 2009, was the first release of the series. It was split in multiple usenet messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Rec/rec.games.chess.computer/2009-05/msg00022.html|title=Re: IPPOLIT release|website=Newsgropus.derkeiler.com|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://ippolit.wikispaces.com/RobboLito RobboLito], released in September 2009, was the second installment of the IPPOLIT series. [[Endgame tablebase]], [http://ippolit.wikispaces.com/RobboBases RobboBases] support was introduced.
* [http://ippolit.wikispaces.com/Igorrit Igorrit], released in January 2010, added [[Multi-core]] support, and was the third installment of the IPPOLIT series.

==Controversy==
IPPOLIT was initially prohibited from many computer chess websites after the author of the chess engine [[Rybka]] claimed it to be a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of his program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Ippolit|title=chessprogramming|website=Chessprogramming.wikispaces.com|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPPOLIT authors have denied the accusation. Even today, some chess rating lists still refuse to include it in their lists of tested programs.

'''InRule Technology''' is a software company that offers [[Business Rule Management System]] (BRMS) enterprise software products&lt;ref name="JOHN"&gt;Rymer, John. Gualtieri, Mike. [http://www.i-sol.com.ar/web/esp/brm/papers/ForresterMarket%20Overview%20Business%202011.pdf Market Overview: Business Rules Platforms 2011]. Forrester, 2011, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; InRule is the only BRMS Certified for Microsoft Dynamics CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-us/applications/inrule-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm-12884954421 Pinpoint.Microsoft.com]. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

InRule Technology’s Chief Executive Officer Rik Chomko and Chief Technology Officer Loren Goodman began exploring the concept of building configurable applications in 1997. That process evolved into giving users the ability to modify calculations, logic and other aspects of their applications without coding effort and developer involvement.&lt;ref&gt;IllinoisTech.org. [http://www.illinoistech.org/story.aspx/310808 ITA Spotlight: InRule Technology]. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chomko and Goodman founded InRule Technology in Chicago in 2002. Paul Hessinger joined InRule Technology in 2004 as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and served until his retirement in 2015. They work with companies in several markets, including financial services, public sector,&lt;ref&gt;Online Sunshine.

[http://www.insurancetech.com/policy-administration/west-bend-mutuals-soa-based-underwriting/221900299 West Bend Mutual’s SOA-Based Underwriting System Drives Flexibility and Increased Revenue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, InRule Technology became a charter member of the Microsoft Business Process Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, James. James Taylor on Everything Decision Management. [http://jtonedm.com/2008/04/21/first-look-inrule-technology/ First Look – InRule Technology]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, InRule Technology was named to the Inc. 500|500 list of the nation's fasted growing private companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/08/prweb12121904.htm|title=InRule Technology Named to Inc. 500{{!}}5000 List of Fastest Growing Companies|last=|first=|date=2014-08-27|website=Cision PR Web|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

InRule has been recognized as one of Chicago's Best and Brightest Companies to Work For by the [[National Association of Business Resources]] from 2014 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://101bestandbrightest.com/events/2014-chicago-best-and-brightest-companies-to-work-for/winners/ 2014], [http://101bestandbrightest.com/events/chicagos-2015-101-best-and-brightest-companies-to-work-for/winners/?winyear=121 2015], [http://101bestandbrightest.com/events/chicagos-2016-best-and-brightest-companies-to-work-for/winners/?winyear=118 2016], [http://101bestandbrightest.com/events/chicagos-2017-best-brightest-companies-work/winners/?winyear=352 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
On October 29, 2012, InRule Technology launched InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which is the first, and to date only, Business Rule Management System Certified for Microsoft Dynamics CRM&lt;ref&gt;Boucher Ferguson, Renee. [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/Microsoft-Forms-Business-Process-Alliance-Develops-BPM-Roadmap/ Microsoft Forms Business Process Alliance, Develops BPM Roadmap]. EWeek.com, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides components to enable creation and update of rules within Microsoft Dynamics CRM, InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a platform for shops that prefer to work with Microsoft’s platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran, Mani. [https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crmmusings/archive/2013/01/14/product-review-inrule-174-for-microsoft-dynamics-174-crm.aspx Product Review: InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM]. Microsoft Dynamics CRM Community, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

With the availability of InRule 4.6 in 2014, the company introduced deployment of InRule through REST services and allowed REST services to be called from InRule.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, James. James Taylor on Everything Decision Management. [http://jtonedm.com/2014/06/25/first-look-inrule-4-6-update/]. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This enables access to data exposed as a REST service and to package up a rule service for RESTful access. The product launch reflected the move of the company’s core audience to use a broader array of technologies despite an earlier focus on .Net.

In 2017, InRule introduced InRule for the Salesforce Platform, as well as a technology partnership with Work-Relay, a Business Process Management (BPM) application built on the Salesforce Platform. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.work-relay.com/news/business-process-management-bpm-leader-work-relay-announces-partnership-inrule-technology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The software architecture includes multiple components, including irAuthor, the primary authoring tool for creating and maintaining rules; irVerify, a real-time test environment to run and debug rule applications; and irSDK, a set of APIs that allows developers to integrate inRule into their applications. Additionally, irSOA allows users to access the InRule rule engine as a service.&lt;ref name="SIMON"&gt;Holloway, Simon. [http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/business-rules-management-in-the-microsoft-business-process-/ Business Rules Management in the Microsoft Business Process Alliance].

'''Kathenotheism''' is a term coined by the [[philology|philologist]] [[Max Müller]] to mean the worship of one [[god]] at a time. It is closely related to [[henotheism]], the worship of one god while not rejecting the existence of other gods. Müller coined the term in reference to the [[Vedas]], where he explained each deity is treated as [[Supreme Being|supreme]] in turn.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
Kathenotheism, a more specific form of  [[henotheism]], refers to the worship of a succession of supreme gods "one at a time", from the Greek ''kath' hena'' "one by one" + ''[[theism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kathenotheism Online Etymology Dictionary: kathenotheism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
The ancient [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]] has a theology comparable to kathenotheism. The Orphic Hymns address each god of the Olympian pantheon as supreme in turn.

==Hinduism==
The [[Smarta Tradition]] of Hinduism worship the five major deities as supreme in turn and collectively.

'''Louis Dupre''' is a [[Catholic]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and [[religious philosopher]]. He was the T. Lawrason Riggs Professor in [[Yale University]]'s religious studies department from 1973 to 1998, after which he became Professor Emeritus.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;http://www.yale.edu/religiousstudies/facultypages/dupre.html&lt;/ref&gt; His work generally attempts to tie the modern age more closely to medieval and classical thought, finding precursors to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] events that were naively viewed as revolutions. His well-known works include "Passage to Modernity" and "The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture."

Dupré is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

He was born in the Flemish i.e. Dutch speaking part of Belgium in 1926 in the village of Veerle (Antwerp province). He graduated at the KULeuven as a doctor in philosophy in 1952 with a dissertation on Karl Marx. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1958 and became a professor at Georgetown University. Known as a Marx specialist then with three studies on Marx he became a professor in religious philosophy at Yale University in 1973. Afterwards he was known as a Kierkegaard specialist. Marx' and Kierkegaard's criticisms on modernity and the cultural fragmentation inherent to it became the kernel of his later works. The phenomenon of religion in a secularised world becomes his main subject in "The Other Dimension", "Transcendent Selfhood" 
and "A Dubious Heritage". Eventually, the religious philosopher poses the large cultural question about the relation between (Christian) religion and the birth of modern western culture: "Passage to Modernity" (14th–16th century), "The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture" and "The Quest of the Absolute. Birth and Decline of European Romanticism". In 2010, he left the United States and he has lived in Courtrai in Belgium since.

'''Lynn C. Pasquerella''' is an American academic and the President of the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]. Before she assumed this position, she was the 18th president of [[Mount Holyoke College]] in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts]], serving from 2010 to 2016. She was a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Rhode Island]] for 19 years before becoming URI's Associate Dean of the Graduate School. From 2006 to 2008 she was vice provost for research and dean of the graduate school at the [[University of Rhode Island]].  She was the [[provost (education)|Provost]] of the [[University of Hartford]] from 2008-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.www.hartfordinformer.com/media/storage/paper146/news/2008/03/13/News/Lynn-Pasquerella.Becomes.New.Provost-3265782.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926224234/http://media.www.hartfordinformer.com/media/storage/paper146/news/2008/03/13/News/Lynn-Pasquerella.Becomes.New.Provost-3265782.shtml |archivedate=2009-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pasquerella is a 1980 [[Phi Beta Kappa]], ''magna cum laude'' graduate of [[Mount Holyoke College]] and earned her [[Ph.D.]] in [[Philosophy]] in 1985 from [[Brown University]].

Pasquerella is a philosopher whose area of interest is [[medical ethics]]. She was a fellow in the John Hazen White Sr. Center for Ethics and Public Service and a professor of medical ethics in [[Alpert Medical School]]’s Affinity Group Program.

Pasquerella has received funding through the [[United States Department of Energy]] to work on ethical issues related to the [[Human Genome Project]]. She has also received research grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], the [[American Bar Association]], the Council of Graduate Schools, and the [[United States Office of Research Integrity]]. She was the principal investigator on a $3.5 million NSF ADVANCE grant to promote the careers of women in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) disciplines and on a $750,000 NSF–Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate grant to encourage recruitment of underrepresented groups into the professoriate in STEM fields.

Pasquerella serves on the Boards of Paul Newman's Discovery Center and the Africa Center for Engineering Social Solutions, for which she has also been a  project leader in [[Kenya]].   She has served on the Board of Directors of [[The Rectory School]], Day Kimball Hospital’s ethics committee and as chair of its Institutional Review Board, the Rhode Island Bio Bank Steering Committee, the Rhode Island Health Department’s Institutional Review Board, and the advisory board for the Women’s Adult Correctional Facility in Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS134675+02-Nov-2009+PRN20091102]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 2010, Pasquerella has hosted ''The Academic Minute'', a radio segment and podcast featuring a different university-based researcher each day. ''The Academic Minute'' is produced by [[Northeast Public Radio]] with support from [[Newman's Own Foundation]] in partnership with [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wamc.org/academic-minute.html|title=The Academic Minute|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Northeast Public Radio, ''The Academic Minute'' is heard on approximately 30 additional stations across the United States and Canada.

On January 4, 2016, Pasquerella announced that she would be stepping down as president of Mount Holyoke College at the end of the 2016 academic year. Pasquerella will become the 14th president of the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] starting July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/01/04/mount-holyoke-college-president-stepping-down/Yne56AXOZhmWjB9b2UU2hI/story.html |title=Mount Holyoke College president to resign later in 2016 |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |first=J.D. |last=Capelouto |date=2016-01-04 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2017, Pasquerella was the commencement speaker for [[Elizabethtown College]]'s Class of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://huntingdondailynews.our-hometown.com/news/2017-06-12/People%7CPastimes/Elizabethtown_College_grants_diplomas_to_graduates.html|title=Elizabethtown College grants diplomas to graduates {{!}} June 12, 2017 {{!}} The Daily News serving Huntingdon, Mount Union, Orbisonia, and Saxton PA|website=huntingdondailynews.our-hometown.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5494">A '''movement paradox''' is a phenomenon of grammar that challenges the [[transformational grammar|transformational]] approach to [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;See Pollard and Sag (1994:165-166) and Bresnan (2001:16-19) for a discussion of movement paradoxes.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of movement paradoxes is emphasized by those theories of syntax (e.g. [[lexical functional grammar]], [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[construction grammar]], most [[dependency grammar]]s) that reject movement, i.e. the notion that [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]] in syntax are explained by the movement of [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]].

==Syntactic movement==   
Given a transformational approach to syntax, the following related sentences are explained in terms of [[Syntactic movement|movement]]:

::a. We talked about &lt;u&gt;the fact that he was sick&lt;/u&gt; for days.
::b. &lt;u&gt;The fact that he was sick&lt;/u&gt;, we talked about ___ for days. &lt;small&gt;- Example of topicalization&lt;/small&gt;

The underlined noun phrase, which contains a clause, is taken to have moved leftward in the second sentence, the blank marking its starting position. A transformational approach to syntax will explain all sorts of discontinuities (e.g. [[wh-fronting]], [[topicalization]], [[extraposition]], [[scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], [[Inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], [[Shifting (syntax)|shifting]]) in this manner in terms of movement.

==Three types of movement paradoxes==  
Movement paradoxes challenge the movement account of discontinuities. They occur when the "moved" constituent is acceptable in its derived position but not in its base position, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The three examples given here are taken from Bresnan (2001:16ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. *We talked about &lt;u&gt;that he was sick&lt;/u&gt; for days. &lt;small&gt;- Underlined clause is unacceptable before movement.&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;u&gt;That he was sick&lt;/u&gt;, we talked about ___ for days. &lt;small&gt;- Example of topicalization&lt;/small&gt;

::a. *...but she did not &lt;u&gt;met me&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Underlined verb phrase is unacceptable before movement&lt;/small&gt;
::b. ?...but &lt;u&gt;met me&lt;/u&gt; she did not ___. &lt;small&gt;- Example of topicalization&lt;/small&gt; 

::a. *I &lt;u&gt;aren't&lt;/u&gt; your friend. &lt;small&gt;- Underlined copular verb is unacceptable before movement.&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;u&gt;Aren't&lt;/u&gt; I ___ your friend? &lt;small&gt;- Example of inversion&lt;/small&gt; 

These data are difficult to explain in an analysis based on movement, since it is not evident how the b-sentence can be grammatical each time if it is derived by a movement operation applied to the corresponding a-example. The first example illustrates a movement paradox involving a clausal complement of the preposition ''about'', the second a movement paradox involving competing forms of a [[non-finite verb]] (''meet'' vs ''met''), and the third a movement paradox involving a contracted form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] (''aren't''). To state the problem in other words, the movement analysis of the b-sentences has to explain the unexpected fact that the a-sentences are bad.

==A fourth type of movement paradox==
Movement paradoxes are present in other languages as well. The so-called ''long passive'' in German presents a movement paradox that revolves around competing case forms, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The examples of the long passive here are similar to those discussed by Groß and Osborne (2009:56ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| 
|- 
| a.  
| Gestern 
| wurde
| versucht,
| den
| Wagen
| zu reparieren.
|
|- 
|
| yesterday
| was
| tried
| the-'''ACC'''
| car
| to repair
| 'One attempted to fix the car yesterday.'
|-
|}  

::{| 
|- 
| b.  
| *Den 
| Wagen
| wurde
| gestern
| versucht
| zu reparieren.
|
|- 
|
| the-'''ACC'''
| car
| was
| yesterday
| tried 
| to repair
| 'One attempted to fix the car yesterday.'
|-
|}

::{| 
|- 
| c.  
| Der 
| Wagen
| wurde
| gestern
| versucht
| zu reparieren.
|
|- 
|
| the-'''NOM'''
| car
| was
| yesterday
| tried 
| to repair
| 'One attempted to fix the car yesterday.'
|-
|}

On the assumption that the noun phrase ''den Wagen'' is in its base position in the a-sentence, this noun phrase must be in a derived position in the other two sentences. The problem is evident in the competing case forms of the determiner (''den'' vs. ''der''). In the derived position at the front of the sentence, the determiner must appear in the nominative (''der'', not ''den''), whereas when this noun phrase appears in its base position, the accusative of the determiner must appear (''den'', not ''der''). The paradox is evident in the necessity that a change in case form accompany movement.

'''Nazzareno Camilleri''' (1906–1973) was a Maltese philosopher, [[theologian]], and [[mysticism|mystic]]. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were chiefly [[metaphysics]] and [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Camilleri was born at [[Sliema]], [[Malta]], on November 10, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;For other biographical details, see also Eugenio {{harvp|Valentini|1975}} and {{harvp|Valentini|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his family lived very close to the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] oratory there, he was familiar with the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]] from a very tender age. He joined them at the young age of fifteen, in 1921, and immediately sent to [[Sicily]] to continue his studies at [[San Gregorio di Catania]].

He studied there up till 1926, when subsequently he was enrolled at the [[Jesuit]] [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] to pursue his institutional studies for the [[priesthood]]. There he successfully completed his philosophy (1926–29) and theology (1931–35) courses. Between the two (1929–31), he was sent for a short stint to [[Sicily]] to teach at [[San Gregorio di Catania]]. He was ordained a [[priest]] in [[Malta]] in 1934.

===Pre-war and war periods===
After finishing his studies in [[Rome]], Camilleri was sent to [[Rome]], to the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] oratory situated close to the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]]. Here he was appointed professor of [[theology]] and Prefect of Studies.

Camilleri stayed there for two years, until 1937. He was afterwards sent to teach [[moral theology]] at the [[Don Bosco]] International Institute at the [[Crocetta (Torino)|Crocetta]], [[Turin]]. Here he stayed for another two years, at the end of which he successfully completed his [[doctorate]] in [[theology]].

In 1940, when [[Italy]] entered [[World War II]] on the [[Axis powers|Axis]] side, Camilleri was [[interned]], since, as a [[Malta|Maltese]] citizen, he was a [[United Kingdom|British]] subject. He spent the war period in the north of [[Italy]], first at [[Chieri]] (1940–42), then at [[Montalenghe]] (1942–45). At [[Chieri]] he was Director of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] theology students; at [[Montalenghe]], Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy.

===At Turin, Rome and death===
After the end of the war, Camilleri was back at [[Turin]] as Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the [[Salesian Pontifical University]]. He stayed in this office for nine years (1945–54), teaching [[dogmatic theology]] and [[ascetism]]. Afterwards, at the same university, he taught at the Institute of [[Pedagogy]] and [[Religious Studies]] (later, in 1956, called the Faculty of Educational Sciences) eleven years, up till 1965.

At the close of that academic year (1964–65), the whole of the [[Turin]] branch of the university was assimilated by the [[Rome]] branch. Thus Camilleri continued to teach at [[Salesian Pontifical University]] in [[Rome]] for another year, retiring from his teaching profession due to ill health in 1966..

He died in [[Rome]] in 1973, ''in aura sanctitatis'' (in fame of holiness). He was buried at the Cemetery of Genzano in [[Rome]] within the chapel of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]].

===Sainthood===
Twenty-one years after Camilleri’s death, in 1994, the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]] began the process for his [[canonisation]]. The so-called ''Evidential Statements of Witness'' to his [[heroic virtue]]s were published in 1989. Camilleri bears the title of [[Venerable]].

==Works==

===Unpublished Journal===
Between September 1923 and February 1973 (nine days before his death), Camilleri held a diary which was never intended to be published or even read by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Valentini|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Italian publishers call it '''''Diario Intimo''''' (Intimate Journal). Unfortunately, only short extracts of this remarkable document have ever been published. It runs over twenty-eight registers containing in all some four thousand pages. They are held at the archives of the [[Salesian Pontifical University]] in [[Rome]].

===Representative writings===
The following works are probably the most representative works of Camilleri’s philosophical thought and speculation.

* 1949 – '''''De Ineffabili Essentia Metaphysica Libertatis''''' (Concerning the Essential Transcendental Metaphysics of Freedom).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 55-page book in Latin published in [[Turin]]. The main thesis in this work is that freedom is a relationship which is intentionally chosen. However, at the same time, freedom suffers no change in itself.
* 1858 – '''''Una Tesi Antiprobabilista''''' (An Anti-Probabilistic Thesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 33-page book in Italian published in [[Turin]]. The work is a philosophical-moral investigation on the problem of [[probabilism]].
* 1965 – '''''Relazionismo Co-Ontologico''''' (Co-Ontological Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 72-page article published in the book ''De Deo: Praelecitonum Selectio'' (Concerning God: A choice of articles) in [[Rome]]. This is purely metaphysical work which investigates the qualities and the most intimate and profound nature of the relationship between creation and the creator. In other words, it is a study of the metaphysical (or radical) relationship between beings and absolute being.
*  ''Undated'' – '''''De ‘Adoptiva’ nostra Filiatione Divina''''' (Our ‘Adoptive’ Divine Sonship).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript held at the [[Salesian Pontifical University]] in [[Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;UPS, 2-C-2599.&lt;/ref&gt; typed by Camilleri himself. It is basically 105 pages of class notes in which, apart from fundamental issues, Camilleri deals with the communication of divine life to humans through [[Jesus Christ]].

===Other works===
The following are the other published works of Camilleri. Though no review is provided here, any one of these works might be of interest to philosophy, especially for a holistic view of Camilleri’s philosophy.

* 1944 – ''De Natura Actus Visionis Beatificæ'' (Concerning the Nature of the Actual Beatific Vision; unpublished)
* 1951 – ''Preparazione specifica all’Apostolato dell’Educazione'' (The Specific Preparation needed for Educational Apostolate)
* 1953 – ''Confessori Educatori'' (Educational Confessors)
* 1957 – ''Da Mihi Animas'' (Offering My Own Soul)
* 1957 – ''L’Ex-Allievo Salesiano Provveduto'' (Supplying the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] Ex-Student)
* 1958 – ''La Devozione Mariana nel Santo Adoloscente Domenico Savio'' (The Marian Devotion of the Adolescent Saint [[Dominic Savio]])
* 1959 – ''Defensor Putitatis'' (The Defender of Purity)
* 1960 – ''Principi di Pedagogia Cristiana'' (Principles of [[Christian]] [[Pedagogy]])
* 1961 – ''The Problem of Teenage Purity''
* 1961 – ''I Novissimi e la Comunione dei Santi'' (The End of Times and the Communion of Saints)
* 1962 – ''La Maestra delle Novizie'' (The Superior of Female Novices)
* 1962 – ''La Grande Indulgenza del Lavoro'' (The Great [[Indulgence]] of [[Wage labour|Labour]])
* 1962 – ''Spirito e Opera della S. Maria D. Mazzarello'' (The Spirit and Work of St. [[Maria Domenica Mazzarello|Mary D. Mazzarello]])
* 1963 – ''Teologia Pneumatica della Prudenza Cristiana'' (The Spiritual Theology of [[Christian]] [[Prudence]])
* 1964 – ''Il Direttore Salesiano'' (The [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] Director)
* 1966 – ''Teologia e Liturgia'' ([[Theology]] and [[Liturgy]])
* 1967 – ''Costituzione Dogmatica sopra la Chiesa; Decreto sopra le Chiese Orientali Cattoliche'' (The [[Lumen gentium|Dogmatic Constitution on the Church]]; [and] the [[Orientalium Ecclesiarum|Decree on the Eastern Catholic Churches]] [of the Second Vatican Council])
* 1967 – ''La Chiesa nel Mondo Contemporaneo; L’Apostolato dei Laici; I Mezzi della Comunicazione Sociale'' ([[Gaudium et spes|The Church in the Modern World]]; the [[Apostolicam actuositatem|Apostolate of the Laity]]; [and] the [[Inter mirifica|Media of Social Communications]] [of the Second Vatican Council])

===Articles===
Camilleri published some 360 articles. These have still not been classified or compiled, much less studied or analysed. The articles were published in journals such as the following:

====Abroad====
''Salesianum'', ''Orientamenti Pedagogici'', ''Rivista di Pedagogia e Scienze Religiose'', ''Perfice Munus'', ''Doctor Communis'', ''Catechesi'', ''Didascalia'', ''Settimana del Clero'', ''Meridiano 12'', ''Rivista dei Giovani'', ''Presenza Cristiana'' (Catania), ''Bollettino Salesiano'', ''Voci Fraterne'', ''Le Campagnie'', ''Can Roma'', ''Teatro dei Giovani'', ''Il Salesiano Coadiutore'', ''Unione'', ''L’Osservatore Romano'', ''Il Nostro Tempo'', and ''Il Popolo Nuovo''.

====In Malta====
''Buttlettin Salesjan'', ''Lehen is-Sewwa'', ''Il-Hajja'', ''The Future'', ''Times of Malta'', ''Il Ponte'', and ''Malta''.

==Appreciation==
The intellectual, professional and practical work of Camilleri was all related to education, particularly the youth education. Well known for his personal holiness, Camilleri possesses a formidable speculative mind. In his teaching and writings he communicates the security and finesse he encountered in the philosophy and theology of [[scholasticism]] linked, however, to the insights and sensibleness he read in the documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Camilleri cherished a deep affection for the thinking of [[Thomas Aquinas]], and desired that his students learn to read him attentively and interpret him faithfully. Camilleri was no arid or repetitive [[Thomist]]. Intellectually, he harboured an active mind. In this some compared him to [[Antonio Rosmini]].

On the other hand, Camilleri was not attracted to positive research for its own sake. He always seems to have seen his philosophical studies in the context of concrete life, particularly the [[Christian]] way of life. His objectives were speculative, one might say, but always at the service of practicality.

Much research and study is still to be done on the philosophy of Camilleri. Though the outlines are known, the specific knowledge of his philosophy is as yet unidentified.

Prior to the introduction of [[brain death]] into law in the mid to late 1970s, all [[organ transplant]]s from cadaveric donors came from '''non-heart beating donors''' ('''NHBDs''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bja/aei235 |pmid=16183683 |title=UK guidance for non-heart-beating donation |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=592–5 |year=2005 |last1=Ridley |first1=S |last2=Bonner |first2=S |last3=Bray |first3=K |last4=Falvey |first4=S |last5=MacKay |first5=J |last6=Manara |first6=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors after brain-dead (DBD) ([[beating heart cadaver]]s), however, led to better results as the organs were perfused with oxygenated blood until the point of [[perfusion]] and cooling at organ retrieval, and so NHBDs were generally no longer used except in Japan, where [[brain death]] was not legally, until very recently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lock |first1=Margaret |title=Twice Dead: Organ Transplants and the Reinvention of Death }}{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}{{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or culturally recognized.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

However, a growing discrepancy between demand for organs and their availability from DBDs has led to a re-examination of using non-heart beating donors, donors after circulatory death (DCDs), and many centres are now using such donors to expand their potential pool of organs.

Tissue donation ([[cornea]]s, [[heart valve]]s, [[skin]], [[bone]]) has always been possible for non-heart beating donors, and many centres now have established programmes for [[kidney]] transplants from such donors. A few centres have also moved into DCD [[liver]] and [[lung]] transplants. Many lessons have been learnt since the 1970s, and results from current DCDs transplants are comparable to transplants from DBDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60827-6 |pmid=20727576 |title=Analysis of factors that affect outcome after transplantation of kidneys donated after cardiac death in the UK: A cohort study |journal=The Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9749 |pages=1303–11 |year=2010 |last1=Summers |first1=Dominic M |last2=Johnson |first2=Rachel J |last3=Allen |first3=Joanne |last4=Fuggle |first4=Susan V |last5=Collett |first5=David |last6=Watson |first6=Christopher J |last7=Bradley |first7=J Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maastricht classification==
Non-heart beating donors are grouped by the Maastricht classification:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7482956 |year=1995 |author1=Kootstra |first1=G |title=Categories of non-heart-beating donors |journal=Transplantation Proceedings |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=2893–4 |last2=Daemen |first2=J.

Categories I, II, IV and V are termed ''uncontrolled'' and category III is ''controlled''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As of yet, only tissues such as heart valves, skin and corneas can be taken from category I donors. Category II donors are patients who have had a witnessed cardiac arrest outside hospital, have cardiopulmonary resuscitation by CPR-trained providers commenced within 10 minutes but who cannot be successfully resuscitated. Category III donors are patients on [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care]] units with non-survivable injuries who have treatment withdrawn; where such patients wished in life to be organ donors, the transplant team can attend at the time of treatment withdrawal and retrieve organs after cardiac arrest has occurred.

Maastricht definitions were reevaluated after the 6th International Conference in Organ Donation held in Paris in 2013 and a consensus agreement of an established expert European Working Group on the definitions and terminology were standardized, and later the word "retrieved" (organ) was substituted for "recovered" throughout the text.&lt;ref&gt;Maastricht definitions{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organs that can be used==
Kidneys can be used from category II donors, and all organs except the [[heart]] can potentially be used from category III, IV and V donors.  An unsuccessful kidney recipient can remain on [[dialysis]], unlike recipients of some other organs, meaning that a failure will not result in death.

Kidneys from uncontrolled (category II) donors must be assessed with care as there is otherwise a high rate of failure. Many centres have protocols for formal viability assessment. Relatively few centres worldwide retrieve such kidneys, and leaders in this field include the transplant units in [[Maastricht]] (the [[Netherlands]]), [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Leicester]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]]  ([[Spain]]), [[Pavia]] ([[Italy]])  and [[Washington, DC]] ([[United States]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Livers and lungs for transplant can only be taken from controlled donors, and are still somewhat experimental as they have only been performed successfully in relatively few centres. In the [[United Kingdom]], NHBD liver transplants are currently performed in [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] [[Cambridge]], [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] [[Birmingham]], [[King's College Hospital]] [[London]], [[St. James's University Hospital, Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit in Edinburgh. The International Meeting on Transplantation from Non-Heart Beating Donors is organised in the UK every 2 years and brings together specialists in transplantation including transplant physicians, surgeons, fellows, nurses, coordinators, intensive care physicians, perfusion technicians, ethicists, and researchers interested in the aspects of retrieval, preservation and  transplantation of DCD thoracic and abdominal organs and cells.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Lectures are held by experts on the most challenging themes such as clinical outcomes of transplantation of controlled and uncontrolled
DCD organs, progress made on machine perfusion of kidneys, livers, lungs and hearts and ethics and legal issues regarding donation after cardiac death.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Procedure for uncontrolled donors==
Following declaration of death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is continued until the transplant team arrive. A ''stand-off'' period is observed after cessation of CPR to confirm that death has occurred; this is usually from 5 to 10 minutes in length and varies according to local protocols.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Once the stand-off period has elapsed, a cut down is performed over the femoral artery, and a '''double-balloon triple-lumen''' (DBTL) catheter is inserted into the [[femoral artery]] and passed into the [[aorta]]. The balloons are inflated to occlude the aorta above and below the renal arteries (any donor blood specimens required can be taken before the top balloon is inflated). A pre-flush with [[streptokinase]] or another [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic]] is given through the catheter, followed by 20 litres of cold kidney perfusion fluid; the opening of the lumen is between the balloons so that most of the flush and perfusion fluid goes into the kidneys. Another catheter is inserted into the femoral vein to allow venting of the fluid.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Once full formal consent for organ donation has been obtained from relatives, and other necessary formalities such as identification of the deceased by the police and informing the [[Coroner]] (in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), the donor is taken to the operating room, and the kidneys and heart valves retrieved.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Procedure for controlled donors==
If the liver or lungs are felt to be suitable for transplantation, then the donor is usually taken directly to the operating room after cardiac arrest, and a rapid retrieval operation is performed once a 10-minute stand-off period has elapsed. It seems this stand-off period has been reduced to as short as 75 seconds based on a recent article by the CBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m/episodes/2013-2014/dead-enough|title=Dead Enough - Episodes - The Fifth Estate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now causing an ethical debate as to whether physicians will declare death sooner than is currently required. This is similar to a normal multi-organ retrieval, but prioritises rapid cannulation,{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} perfusion{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} and cooling with ice, with dissection following later.

If only the kidneys are suitable for retrieval, either rapid retrieval or cannulation with DBTL catheter can be used. Use of a DBTL catheter allows relatives of the deceased to see them after death, but the donor must be taken to the operating room as soon as possible.{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Category IV donors (who are already brain-stem dead), should either proceed as for a normal multi-organ retrieval – if this has already started – or should be managed as a category II or III as appropriate to the circumstances of cardiac arrest.{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Ethical issues==

Certain ethical issues are raised by NHBD transplantation such as administering drugs which do not benefit the donor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15806507 |year=2005 |author1=Motta |first1=E. D |title=The ethics of heparin administration to the potential non-heart-beating organ donor |journal=Journal of Professional Nursing : Official Journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=97–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observance of the Dead-donor Rule, the decision-making surrounding resuscitation, the withdrawal of life-support, the respect for a dying patient and the dead body, as well as proper information for the family.&lt;ref name=pmid15848461&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.12.197 |pmid=15848461 |title=Ethical and Legal Issues in Non-Heart-Beating Organ Donation |journal=Transplantation Proceedings |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=574–6 |year=2005 |last1=Bos |first1=M.A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 author Dale Gardiner issued a report called "How the UK Overcame the Ethical, Legal and Professional Challenges in Donation After Circulatory Death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5204/qutlr.v16i1.632 |title=How the UK Overcame the Ethical, Legal and Professional Challenges in Donation After Circulatory Death |journal=QUT Law Review |volume=16 |pages=125 |year=2016 |last1=Gardiner |first1=Dale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions prior to consent==

In category II uncontrolled donors, the donor may die and the transplant team arrive before the donor's next-of-kin can be contacted. It is controversial whether cannulation and perfusion can be started in these circumstances. On one hand, it can be considered a violation of the potential donor's autonomy to cannulate before their in-life wishes are known. On the other hand, delay in cannulation may mean that a patient's strongly held wish to be donor cannot be respected. Many ethicists also feel that a doctor's duty of care to the still living outweighs any duty of care to the dead. The compromise reached is usually to cannulate if there is any evidence of a wish to donate (such as a donor card or registration as a donor) even in the absence of next-of-kin.{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

For category III donors, treatment is being withdrawn from a living person, who will then die and become a donor. Important factors for assessment include A) that the decisions regarding non-survivable injuries are correct, B) continued treatment is futile and C) that withdrawal is in the patient's best interests be made completely independently of any consideration of suitability as an organ donor. Only after such decisions have been firmly made should a patient be considered as a potential organ donor. Although such treatment can be continued until the transplant team arrives, no additional treatment should be started to improve the organs—until the point of death, the patient should be treated exactly as any other dying patient.{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The standard recommendation to ensure this is to require a complete separation of the treatment and organ procurement teams.&lt;ref name=pmid17124739&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060895 |pmid=17124739 |pmc=1635157 |title=Donation after cardiocirculatory death in Canada |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=175 |issue=8 |pages=S1 |year=2006 |last1=Shemie |first1=S. D |last2=Baker |first2=A. J |last3=Knoll |first3=G |last4=Wall |first4=W |last5=Rocker |first5=G |last6=Howes |first6=D |last7=Davidson |first7=J |last8=Pagliarello |first8=J |last9=Chambers-Evans |first9=J |last10=Cockfield |first10=S |last11=Farrell |first11=C |last12=Glannon |first12=W |last13=Gourlay |first13=W |last14=Grant |first14=D |last15=Langevin |first15=S |last16=Wheelock |first16=B |last17=Young |first17=K |last18=Dossetor |first18=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not, however, clear how complete this separation can be in those jurisdictions that require hospitals to report the names of candidates for organ donation to an Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) ''before'' life support has been withdrawn so that organ donation can be discussed with surrogates.&lt;ref name=pmid17935243&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jhm.204 |pmid=17935243 |title='Non-heart-beating,' or 'cardiac death,' organ donation: Why we should care |journal=Journal of Hospital Medicine |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=324–34 |year=2007 |last1=Rady |first1=Mohamed Y |last2=Verheijde |first2=Joseph L |last3=McGregor |first3=Joan }}&lt;/ref&gt; This forces treating physicians to view their patients partly as potential organ donors, and even absent an OPO, it is unrealistic to think treating physicians are not aware of benefits to others of transplantation, and sometimes weigh this against the benefit of continued treatment to the patient.   As one author puts it:  "If the person in need of organ transplantation is younger, more attractive, or in some way more deserving than another critically ill patient"—and there are always such patients awaiting transplants—"then the conclusion that one patient's condition is hopeless can be tainted by an understanding of the tremendous hope organ availability holds for another."&lt;ref name="Van Norman GA 2003 766"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000542-200303000-00028 |pmid=12606924 |title=Another Matter of Life and Death |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=763–73 |year=2003 |last1=Van Norman |first1=Gail A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factored into this is the element of judgement that physicians bring to evaluating the "best interest" of patients.  There is considerable variability among physicians in determining from whom to withdraw life-sustaining treatments in the ICU.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.061155 |pmid=17030941 |pmc=1586080 |title=Is the Canadian health care system ready for donation after cardiac death? A note of caution |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=175 |issue=8 |pages=905 |year=2006 |last1=Doig |first1=C. J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17935243/&gt; Bias has been demonstrated on the part of medical professionals against patients who are perceived as handicapped or are otherwise stigmatized.  Studies have shown that, when evaluating the quality of life of severely handicapped patients, physicians consistently apply much poorer rating than do the patients themselves.   This raises the question:  Would prejudice about vulnerable patients, such as the handicapped, lead medical professionals to approach such individuals and families for NHBD more than others with higher "quality of life" ratings?&lt;ref name="Van Norman GA 2003 766"/&gt; Thus, as Doig puts it: "…the possibility of conflicted decision-making in a controlled DCD program is more than a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The upshot is that the mere existence of a NHBD program in a hospital potentially compromises the care of patients. Few have rejected those programs on this basis, but the question of how to protect against it is ongoing.

==Dead donor rule==
The so-called "Dead Donor Rule" (DDR) tells us that persons must be dead before their organs can be taken, and this rule is basic to all DCD programs.  Also common to all DCD programs is that death is determined by cardiocirculatory criteria according to which life-support is withdrawn, an interval of the monitored absence of pulse, blood pressure, and respiration observed, and then death declared.  Programs differ, however, on the length of the interval.  The Pittsburgh Protocol requires 2 minutes, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation (CCDT) 5 minutes, the 1981 President's Commission 10 minutes, and recently Boucek et al. have proposed that it can be shortened to 75 seconds.&lt;ref name="Bernat 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/nejmp0804161 |pmid=18703467 |title=The Boundaries of Organ Donation after Circulatory Death |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=359 |issue=7 |pages=669–71 |year=2008 |last1=Bernat |first1=James L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These times are based on estimates of when autoresuscitation (i.e., the spontaneous recovery of circulatory activity) becomes impossible.  The scientific validity of all these times, however, has been questioned.&lt;ref name="Van Norman GA 2003 766"/&gt; The IOM  in 2000 concluded that "existing empirical data cannot confirm or disprove a specific interval at which the cessation of cardiopulmonary function becomes irreversible."&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine.  ''Non-Heart-Beating Organ Transplantation: Practice and Protocols.'' Washington, DC, National Academy Press; 2000:22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, none of these intervals precludes the possibility of CPR restoring cardiocirculatory activity.  To preclude that, brain death is required.  The exact interval at which that occurs is likewise not known, but it is known to be more than 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=pmid18036254&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-28 |pmid=18036254 |pmc=2211498 |title=The ethics of donation and transplantation: Are definitions of death being distorted for organ transplantation? |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=2 |pages=28 |year=2007 |last1=Joffe |first1=Ari R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioural Research, ''Defining Death: A Report on the Medical, Legal and Ethical Issues in the Determination of Death.''  Washington, DC, US Government Printing Office; 1981:16-7.&lt;/ref&gt;     
In light of this we can now raise the question of whether patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria are really dead.  It is generally agreed that death occurs when the patient is in an irreversible state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jme.18.1.26 |pmid=1573646 |pmc=1376081 |title=The reversibility of death |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=26–30; discussion 31–3 |year=1992 |last1=Cole |first1=D J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria are really dead thus depends on what is meant by "irreversible," and the term is open to a stronger and weaker interpretation.
  
On the stronger interpretation "irreversibility" means that spontaneous cardiocirculation "cannot be restored no matter what intervention is done, including CPR."  On the weaker interpretation it means that spontaneous cardiocirculation "cannot be restored because CPR efforts have been refused by the patient (as a DNR order in an advance directive), by a surrogate decision-maker or by the medical team because it is not medically indicated."  Thus the person need not be in a physically irreversible state, but only in a morally or legally irreversible state.&lt;ref name=pmid17124739/&gt;
 
On the stronger interpretation, persons declared dead by DCD cardiocirculatory criteria cannot be known to be dead, as it is not always physically impossible to restore circulation by vigorous CPR.  The weaker interpretation, however, does allow persons declared dead by DCD criteria to be counted as dead.  It is often objected that this interpretation does not accord with the everyday meaning of death.  Ordinarily we do not think that persons are dead when we have reasons not to revive them, but only when they cannot physically be revived.  Nonetheless, declaring persons dead for purposes of transplantation by DCD criteria is  "accepted medical practice"  in many parts of the world, and where it is (as in Canada, for example&lt;ref name=pmid17124739/&gt;) the legal standard for declaring death is met.

The upshot is that we cannot straightforwardly say whether DCD violates the DDR.  Whether it does or not depends on whether we think this requires that people be dead in the ordinary sense of the word or in a legal or some other understanding of it, and  writers are lined up on both sides of this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-8 |pmid=17519030 |pmc=1892566 |title=Recovery of transplantable organs after cardiac or circulatory death: Transforming the paradigm for the ethics of organ donation |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=2 |pages=8 |year=2007 |last1=Verheijde |first1=Joseph L |last2=Rady |first2=Mohamed Y |last3=McGregor |first3=Joan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18036254/&gt;

==Pain and suffering==
Controlled DCD may involve interventions such as vessel cannulation before life-sustaining therapy is withdrawn and death is declared, and may also involve post-mortem interventions such as in situ preservation.   Uncontrolled DCD may additionally involve chest compressions and mechanical ventilation both before and after consent for DCD is obtained and typically requires the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.&lt;ref name=pmid17124739/&gt; We know that all of these interventions cause distress to conscious patients who are not taking palliative medications.  Thus, because patients who are candidates for DCD are not known to be brain dead either before or shortly after they are declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria, the possibility that they may experience distress must be considered.  
 
There are 3 approaches that have been taken to this possibility of pain and suffering:  (1) provide palliative medications where there are physical signs compatible with distress; (2) withhold all such medications on the ground that even if signs of distress are occurring, the patient does not have sufficient cognition to interpret any sensations as noxious; or (3) provide palliative medications prophylactically to prevent any possible distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/ken.0.0021 |pmid=11645297 |title=Non-Heart-Beating Organ Donation: A Reply to Campbell and Weber |journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |year=1995 |last1=Devita |first1=Michael A |last2=Vukmir |first2=Rade |last3=Snyder |first3=James V |last4=Graziano |first4=Cheryl }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Whichever approach is adopted, worries have been expressed over whether patients can be guaranteed not to experience any distress.&lt;ref name=pmid21686302&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21686302 |pmc=3116683 |year=2010 |author1=Browne |first1=A |title=The ethics of organ donation after cardiocirculatory death: Do the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation measure up? |journal=Open Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e129–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re: (1) providing medication only on signs compatible with distress does not prevent the possibility of distress.  Re: (2), since patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria cannot be known to be brain dead, dismissing signs compatible with distress as not being distress again does not prevent the possibility of distress.  Re: (3) physicians may inappropriately withhold sufficient sedative or analgesic medication to avoid the appearance of euthanasia or in order to improve organ viability.&lt;ref name="Van Norman GA 2003 766"/&gt;

There is also the question of whether DCD patients receive compromised end of life (EOL) care.  The President's Council for Bioethics has warned that DCD can transform EOL care from a "peaceful dignified death" into a profanely "high-tech death" experience for donors and donor's families.  ICUs are not typically set up to provide optimum palliative care.  The process of obtaining donation consent and subsequent donor management protocols for DCD deviate from some of the quality indicators recommended for optimal EOL care.  Organ-focused behaviour by professionals requesting consent for organ donation and ambivalent decision making by family members increase the risk of relatives of deceased donors subsequently developing traumatic memories and stress disorders.  The processes required for the successful accomplishment of donation consent and subsequent organ recovery can interfere with many of the interventions that lessen the burden of bereavement of relatives of ICU decedents.&lt;ref name=pmid17935243/&gt;

==Informed consent==
What are donors told about death and pain in order that they can give informed consent?{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The standard consent for DCD goes like this.  Patients or families are told that they will have a chance to say their goodbyes, the patient will then be taken to the operating room, life support will be removed, and after 2–10 minutes of continuously observed absence of pulse, blood pressure, and respiration, death will be declared and the removal of organs begin. Consent to this is taken to be consent to organ donation at death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria, i.e., to DCD.  The problem is that death is commonly understood as an irreversible state in the strong sense.  The commonsense understanding of death is that it is a permanent state, and that if a person has truly died then life cannot be restored to the individual.  Death understood as an irreversible state in the weak sense—as one that will not be, or ought not to be,  or cannot legally or morally be reversed—is on this view a revisionist account of how death can be best conceived rather than an accurate descriptive account of how it actually is  commonly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brock |first1=Dan W. |chapter=The role of the public in public policy on the definition of death |chapterurl={{Google books|eQ6OzvpZvp8C|page=293|plainurl=yes}} |pages=293–308 |editor1-first=Stuart J. |editor1-last=Youngner |editor2-first=Robert M. |editor2-last=Arnold |editor3-first=Renie |editor3-last=Schapiro |title=The Definition of Death: Contemporary Controversies |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8018-7229-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this, when donors consent to donation at death they can only be presumed to be consenting to organ donation when their loved one is in a physically irreversible state.  Since, however, death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria is not necessarily a physically irreversible state, consent to organ donation at death is not consent to organ donation at death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria.&lt;ref name=pmid21686302/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/s0963180108080080 |pmid=18462547 |title=The Institute of Medicine on Non-Heart-Beating Organ Transplantation |journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=75–86 |year=2007 |last1=Browne |first1=Alister }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11657352 |year=1998 |author1=Menikoff |first1=J |title=Doubts about death: The silence of the Institute of Medicine |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics : A Journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=157–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menikoff criticizes the IOM for not routinely disclosing to prospective donors and families that and how death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria differs from death in the ordinary sense.  In particular, he faults the IOM for not telling them that donors will be declared dead before brain death is known to have occurred, and hence they may have their organs removed when portions of the  brain (including the higher brain) are still functional.  Potts et al. on behalf of the IOM reply that informed consent does not require this level of disclosure:   "Reviewing with interested family members that all brain activity may not have ceased at the exact moment that death is pronounced may be appropriate in some circumstances, but, for many families confronted with such overwhelming emotional matters, knowledge that death has been pronounced is what is paramount.  The sensitivity and skill of the physicians and nurses to the individual needs of families is the key factor whether or not organ donation is involved."&lt;ref name=pmid11657353&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.1998.tb01672.x |pmid=11657353 |title=Commentary: Clear Thinking and Open Discussion Guide IOM's Report on Organ Donation |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=166–8 |year=2016 |last1=Potts |first1=John T |last2=Herdman |first2=Roger C |last3=Beauchamp |first3=Thomas L |last4=Robertson |first4=John A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind this disagreement on what disclosure is required is a larger one that Brock has characterized as a choice between "truth or consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brock DW | year = 1987 | title = The role of the public in public policy on the definition of death. In: Younger SJ, Arnold RM, Schapiro R, eds. ''The Definition of Death: Contemporary Controversies'' Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins Press; 1999:298; see also Brock DW. Truth or consequences: the role of philosophers in policy making | url = | journal = Ethics | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 786–91 | pmid = 11658836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brock's view, public policy cannot centre in on the unqualified and unconstrained search for the truth without concern for the consequences of that search.  On some occasions "the likely effects on the well-being and rights of the public of exposing the full complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy surrounding a particular public policy could be sufficiently adverse and serious to justify not exposing them and presenting the issue in misleading or oversimplified terms instead."  Brock concludes that "No general answer can be given to truth-or-consequences choices that will hold for all cases.  In any particular instance of this choice, we must instead weigh the policy gains against the moral and political risks, and how that balances out will often be empirically uncertain and morally controversial."&lt;ref&gt;Brock DW.

Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins Press; 1999:303-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue at hand, Menikoff and Brock think that the importance of informed consent should put us on the "truth" side of the question.  Menikoff writes:  "Deceiving prospective organ donors about relevant truths concerning their condition is likely, ultimately, to lead to diminished public confidence and to fewer organ donations.  But even if it did not reduce the number of donated organs, in a system that is allegedly based on freely given consent, we must recognize that obtaining such consent by telling less than the truth is fundamentally wrong." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Menikoff J | year = 1998 | title = Doubts about death: the silence of the Institute of Medicine | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 162–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Brock contends that in a democratic state there is a presumption that the citizens will be informed about all relevant information of public policy, and thinks that DCD involves such a radical change in the timing of death from what people ordinarily think, that it is something that they should be informed about.&lt;ref&gt;Brock DW.  The role of the public in public policy on the definition of death.  In: Younger SJ, Arnold RM, Schapiro R, eds. ''The Definition of Death: Contemporary Controversies''.  Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins Press; 1999:302.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the IOM took itself to have the task of addressing the question:   "Given a potential donor in an end-of-life situation, what are the alternative medical approaches that can be used to maximize the availability of organs from that donor without violating prevailing ethical norms regarding the rights and welfare of donors?"  And it replied:  "Our goal was to support both the interests of patients and families regarding nature and time of death and the public's interests in increased organ procurement.  In striking the balance, the expert panel strictly adhered to widely endorsed principles of ethics and established legal and legal guidelines."&lt;ref name=pmid11657353/&gt;  In thus balancing what is disclosed to the family against what is in the interest of organ procurement, the IOM comes down on the "consequences" side of the "truth or consequences" debate.

==DCD and the future==
DCD is a procedure that operates in an area set by two rules.  The first is the DDR, which says that no vital organs can be taken before the patient is dead.  The second, a corollary of this, prohibits killing patients by or for organ procurement.&lt;ref name=pmid10126538&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10126538 |year=1993 |author1=Arnold |first1=R. M |title=The dead donor rule: Should we stretch it, bend it, or abandon it? |journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=263–78 |last2=Youngner |first2=S. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
     
It is not, however, always clear how procedures that are beneficial to transplantation can be fit under those rules.  For example, providing ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation) to donors immediately after death is declared by cardiocirculatory criteria can keep organs in their freshest possible condition.  If, however, ECMO provides circulation and oxygenation to the entire body, can the donor really be declared dead by those criteria?  The rules can also generate other puzzle cases.  If a donor is declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria, can the heart be transplanted, or does the fact that the heart is started in another negate the determination of death in the first?&lt;ref name="Bernat 2008" /&gt;

Further such problems are bound to arise in the future.  To handle them Bernat recommends that a committee be set up:  "A consensus-driven oversight process should determine whether investigational protocols reflect appropriate medical treatment and whether their translation into accepted clinical practice is sound public policy.  Leaders of the critical care, neurology, and transplantation communities need to jointly draft practice guidelines for organ donation after circulatory death that establish acceptable boundaries of practice.  These boundaries should be based on scientific data and accepted principles and should be demarcated conservatively to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the transplantation enterprise."&lt;ref name="Bernat 2008" /&gt;

Others, however, argue that rather than having to either provide answers to these problems that square with the rules in question or forgo advantageous procedures, it would be best to reject those rules.  Instead of making the question "When is the patient dead?" the central question to trigger organ retrieval, the proposal is to shift the focus to obtaining valid consent from patients or surrogates and the principle of nonmaleficence.  As Truog explains the proposal:   "On this view, policies could be changed such that organ procurement would be permitted only with the consent of the donor or appropriate surrogate and only when doing so would not harm the donor.  Individuals who could not be harmed by the procedure would include those who are permanently and irreversibly unconscious (patients in a persistent vegetative state or newborns with anencephaly) and those who are imminently and irreversibly dying.   Qualified individuals who had given their consent could simply have their organs removed under general anesthesia without first undergoing an orchestrated withdrawal of life support.  Anencephalic newborns whose parents requested organ donation could likewise have the organs removed under general anesthesia without the need to wait for the diagnosis of brain death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9017413 |year=1997 |author1=Truog |first1=R. D |title=Is it time to abandon brain death? |journal=The Hastings Center Report |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18703469&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/nejmp0804474 |pmid=18703469 |title=The Dead Donor Rule and Organ Transplantation |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=359 |issue=7 |pages=674–5 |year=2008 |last1=Truog |first1=Robert D |last2=Miller |first2=Franklin G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has conceptual and pragmatic advantages.   On the conceptual side, securing organs at optimum times does not require us to constantly redefine death and when it occurs so that persons who are alive may have their organs taken.  It would also allow us to say that when a physician removes life-support and the patient dies that the physician caused patient's death.  Many think this is more natural than saying that all the physician did was to return the patient to an untreated disease state and that state caused the death.  Finally, we thereby avoid the proliferation of definitions of death with differing times in different jurisdictions, different definitions of death for different purposes (the cardiocirculatory definition of death discussed in this article is only valid for DCD), and arbitrary rulings such as declaring anencephalic infants with heartbeat dead.&lt;ref name=pmid10126538/&gt; 
  
On the pragmatic side, rejecting the rules in question would have advantages for recipients and donors in transplant programs.  Because there will now be no necessary interval between pulselessness and the declaration of death, there can be a reduction in warm ischemia time, and so an improvement in the quality and quantity of transplantable organs.&lt;ref name=pmid18703469/&gt; It will also be possible to give the donor drugs such as heparin and phentolamine, which can hasten death but also maximize organ preservation.   Finally, it will eliminate the possibility that patients will experience discomfort as they are withdrawn from ventilator support by allowing potentially fatal doses of morphine that are not titrated to signs of distress.&lt;ref name=pmid10126538/&gt;

The main obstacle to accepting the proposal is securing the acceptance of the public to allow physicians to cause the death of (which is to say kill) patients to obtain transplantable organs.  Proponents of the proposal contend that robust consent requirements can provide the public with the assurance against exploitation that the dead donor rule and the prohibition on killing are designed to provide.  Others deny this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3527865 |pmid=10641238 |jstor=3527865 |title=The Dead Donor Rule |journal=The Hastings Center Report |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=6–14 |year=1999 |last1=Robertson |first1=John A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-3-5 |pmid=18248665 |pmc=2276227 |title=Death, organ transplantation and medical practice |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=3 |pages=5 |year=2008 |last1=Huddle |first1=Thomas S |last2=Schwartz |first2=Michael A |last3=Bailey |first3=F Amos |last4=Bos |first4=Michael A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the question can be posed:  "Given the difficulties our society is likely to experience in trying to openly adjudicate these disparate views [of accepting or rejecting the prohibition on physicians killing for transplantation], why not simply go along with the quieter strategy of policy creep?  It seems to be getting us where we want to go, albeit slowly.  Besides, total candor is not always compatible with public policy (Calabresi G and Bobbitt P. ''Tragic Choices''. New York: Norton,1978)."&lt;ref name=pmid10126538/&gt;  The debate continues unresolved.

{{Jewish outreach}}

'''Orthodox Jewish outreach''', often referred to as '''Kiruv''' or '''Keruv''' ({{lang-he-n|קירוב , קֵרוּב}} "bringing close"), is the collective work or movement of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that reaches out to non-Orthodox Jews to encourage belief in [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] and living according to Orthodox [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The process of a Jew becoming more observant of Orthodox Judaism is called ''teshuva'' ("return" in Hebrew) making the "returnee" a ''[[baal teshuva]]'' ("master of return"). Orthodox Jewish outreach has worked to enhance the rise of the [[baal teshuva movement]].

==Varieties==

===Haredi===
{{Main|Aish HaTorah | Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem | Machon Shlomo | Kiruv Organisation}}
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the founding of the non-Hasidic, Haredi institutions that eventually became the [[Aish HaTorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and Machon Shlomo yeshivas.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Rabbi Noah Weinberg]] was one of the pioneers of this movement with Aish HaTorah.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Ohr Somayach has also played a major role in the baal teshuva movement through its education of generations of students.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

The world's first baal teshuva yeshiva for men was [[Hadar Hatorah]] which opened in New York in 1962 under Rabbi Yisroel Jacobson, and continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Hatorah Celebrates Golden Jubilee • CrownHeights.info - Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch NewsCrownHeights.info – Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch News|url=http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/44507/hadar-hatorah-celebrates-golden-jubilee|website=crownheights.info|accessdate=2017-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other baal teshuva yeshivas include the Diaspora Yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein in Jerusalem's Old City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbDQpgZILuwC&amp;pg=PA330 |title=Judaism and Crisis: Crisis as a catalyst in Jewish cultural history|first1=Armin |last1=Lange|first2=K.

Baal teshuva yeshivas for women include Neve Yerushalayim, founded in 1970, and [[EYAHT]], affiliated with Aish HaTorah and founded in 1982.

Concurrent with the opening of baal teshuva learning programs in Israel in the 1970s, a small number of Orthodox outreach workers began approaching English-speaking, college-age students visiting the [[Western Wall]] and inviting them to experience a [[Shabbat]] meal with a host family or to check out one of the baal teshuva yeshivas. These outreach workers included Rabbi Meir Schuster, Baruch Levine, and, beginning in 1982, [[Jeff Seidel]].&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/2519/-hunter-at-kotel-seeks-shabbat-dinner-guests/|title='Hunter' at Kotel Seeks Shabbat Dinner Guests|first=Todd|last=Winer|work=Chicago Jewish News|date=9 February 1996|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdp9btWGWQC&amp;pg=PA537 |title= Where Heaven Touches Earth: Jewish Life in Jerusalem from Medieval Times to the Present|first=Dovid|last=Rossoff|page=537|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|year=2001|isbn= 0873068793|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bjl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/news-detail.php?SECTION_ID=37&amp;ARTICLE_ID=55720|title=BJL Exclusive: Jeff Seidel and Yohanan Danziger Miraculously Escape Jerusalem Arab Stoning Unharmed|first=Margie|last=Pensak|work=Baltimore Jewish Life|date=27 December 2014|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chabad===
{{Main|Chabad outreach}}
Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]], and then his successor, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] were responsible for turning Chabad's activities toward outreach.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Each in turn sent out rabbinic emissaries, known as "[[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]]", and their wives to settle in places across the world solely for the purpose of teaching those who did not receive a Jewish education or to inspire those who did. The vehicle chosen for this was termed a "[[Chabad house]]."

[[Chabad]] has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues and communal institutions, as well as more direct outreach efforts, such as its [[Mitzvah tank]]s. The organization has been recognized as using free holiday services to reach out across denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue.

==Overview==

When [[Pakistan]] gained independence there was only one department of [[philosophy]] in the country, at [[Government College Lahore]]. Now there are seven departments of philosophy at different Pakistani universities, and many Pakistani philosophers are doing research in diverse fields of philosophy.

Notable Pakastani philosophical organizations include The Pakistan Philosophical Congress, which was founded by M. M. Sharif, a pupil of G. E. Moore, in 1954{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and the Islamic Philosophical Association. In addition there are various smaller groups devoted to promoting philosophical study and research.

While philosophy in Pakistan has been greatly influenced by [[Western philosophy]], it nonetheless retains strong elements of the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophy]]. The Pakistani philosophy community includes adherents of all the major strands of contemporary western philosophy, including a significant number of Pakistani philosophers who are inclined towards more traditional, metaphysical, positions.

Pakistani philosophers include: [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]], Irfan Muhammad (KU), M M Sharif, Khalifa Abdul Hakeem, C A Qadir, Kazi A Kadir, Abdul Wahab Suri (KU), Ather Rasheed, Absar Ahmad, Intasar ul Haq, Waheed Ali Farooqi, B H Sidiquei, Sajid Ali, Abdul Khaliq, Naeem Ahmed, Abdul Hafeez, Muhammad Maroof, Mirza Ather Beig, Shahid Hossain, Fazlur Rehman, Shehzad Qaiser, Manzoor Ahmed, Ghazala Irfan, Javed Bhuto, [[Syed Zafarul Hasan]], Robina Lodhi and Waqar Aslam.

The '''paradox of hedonism''', also called the '''pleasure paradox''', refers to the practical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of [[pleasure]]. Unfortunately for the [[hedonist]], constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or [[happiness]] in the long run—or even in the short run, when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.

The utilitarian philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] was first to note in ''The Methods of Ethics'' that the [[paradox]] of [[hedonism]] is that pleasure cannot be acquired directly.&lt;ref name="Paradox of Hedonism"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Paradox of Hedonism |url=http://sophistsociety.tumblr.com/post/5196531729/paradox-of-hedonism |publisher=The Sophist Society |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations on this theme appear in the realms of [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[economics]].

==Overview==
{{Hedonism}}
It is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:

* [[John Stuart Mill]], the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosopher, in his autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus  at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, Autobiography in The Harvard Classics, Vol. 25, Charles Eliot Norton, ed. (New York: P. F. Collier &amp; Son Company, 1909 (p. 94)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Viktor Frankl]] in ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Frankl. ''Man's Search for Meaning''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Antichrist'' (1895)]] and [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|''The Will to Power'' (1901)]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.&lt;br /&gt;
What is bad?  Everything that is born of weakness.&lt;br /&gt;

==Example==
Suppose Paul likes to [[Stamp collecting|collect stamps]]. According to most models of behavior, including not only [[utilitarianism]], but most economic, psychological and social conceptions of behavior, it is believed that Paul collects stamps because he gets pleasure from it. Stamp collecting is an avenue towards acquiring pleasure. However, if you tell Paul this, he will likely disagree. He does get pleasure from collecting stamps, but this is not the process that explains why he collects stamps. It is not as if he said, "I must collect stamps so I, Paul, can obtain pleasure". Collecting stamps is not just a means toward pleasure. He simply likes collecting stamps, therefore (indirectly) acquiring pleasure.

This paradox is often reversed to illustrate that pleasure and happiness cannot be reverse-engineered.  If for example you heard that collecting stamps was very pleasurable, and began a stamp collection as a means towards this happiness, it would inevitably be in vain. To achieve happiness, you must not seek happiness directly, you must strangely motivate yourself towards things unrelated to happiness, like the collection of stamps.&lt;ref name="Paradox of Hedonism"/&gt;

==Suggested explanations==
''Happiness'' is often imprecisely equated with ''pleasure''. If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. When one aims solely towards pleasure itself, one's aim is frustrated. [[Henry Sidgwick]] comments on such frustration after a discussion of self-love in the above-mentioned work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I should not, however, infer from this that the pursuit of pleasure is necessarily self-defeating and futile; but merely that the principle of Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human nature, is practically self-limiting; i.e., that a rational method of attaining the end at which it aims requires that we should to some extent put it out of sight and not directly aim at it.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sidgwick. ''The Methods of Ethics''. BookSurge Publishing (1 March 2001) (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While not addressing the paradox directly, [[Aristotle]] commented on the futility of pursuing pleasure. Human beings are actors whose endeavors bring about consequences, and among these is pleasure. Aristotle then argues as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we grow weary? Certainly all human things are incapable of continuous activity. Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies activity.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Nicomachean Ethics'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.10.x.html Book X, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sooner or later, finite beings will be unable to acquire and expend the resources necessary to maintain their sole goal of pleasure; thus, they find themselves in the company of misery. [[Evolutionary theory]] explains that humans evolved through natural selection and follow genetic imperatives that seek to maximize [[reproduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sociobiology:  Evolution, Genes and Morality| url = http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/sociobio.html | author = Raymond Bohlin| accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not [[happiness]]. As a result of these selection pressures, the extent of human happiness is limited biologically. [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] argues in his treatise ''[[The Hedonistic Imperative]]'' makes the point that humans might be able to use [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[neuroscience]] to eliminate suffering in all human life and allow for peak levels of happiness and pleasure that are currently unimaginable.

'''Peter the Iberian''' ({{lang-ka|პეტრე იბერი|tr}}) (c. 417-491) was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] royal prince, [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] who was a prominent figure in early [[Christianity]] and one of the founders of the Christian [[neoplatonism]]. Some have claimed that he is the author of the works written under the pen name [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Nutsubidze. "Mystery of Pseudo-Dionys Areopagit (a monograph), Tbilisi, 1942; E. Honigmann, Pierre l'Iberian et les ecrits du Pseudo-Denys l'Areopagita. Bruxelles, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

His accomplishments include founding the first Georgian monastery in [[Bethlehem]] and becoming the bishop of [[Maiuma|Majuma]] near Gaza. The oldest Georgian ''[[Bir el Qutt inscriptions]]'' mention Peter with his father.

== Life ==
He was born into the royal [[Chosroid dynasty]] of the Kings of [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]] (Eastern Georgia)&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tSq1wuai-XUC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=peter+the+iberian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PDKNtN-9Zy&amp;sig=0OwUWWhJoFH6CnmQR0YROKZX4f0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKx6bpqu7LAhWCeSYKHVibD-4Q6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20the%20iberian&amp;f=false Horn, Cornelia B. and Phenix, Robert R., ''The Lives of Peter the Iberian, Theodosius of Jerusalem, and the Monk Romanus'', Society of Biblical Lit, 2008] {{ISBN|9781589832008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially named Murvan (alternatively, Nabarnugios), Prince of Iberia ([[Kartli]]). His father, King Bosmarios of Iberia, invited noted philosopher Mithradates from [[Lazica]] to take part in Murvan’s education. For a time, the child was kept hidden so as not to be delivered as a hostage to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgianweb.com/religion/iber.html ''Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints'', (David Marshall Lang, trans.)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 423, at the age of about five, the prince was sent as a political hostage to [[Constantinople]] to ensure the loyalty of Iberia to the Byzantines rather than to the Persians.&lt;ref name=Kofsky/&gt; Here he received a brilliant education under a personal patronage of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman]] empress [[Aelia Eudocia]], wife of [[Theodosius II]].

According to his biographer, John Rufus, Peter refused to write to or receive letters from home lest it undermine his ascetic discipline.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt; When he was about twenty, the young prince, together with his mentor Mithradates, left the palace and escaped to make a pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where he became a monk at [[Jerusalem]] under the name of Peter. In 430, he founded his own monastery at [[Bethlehem]] (later known as the Georgian Monastery of Bethlehem). In 445, he was ordained as a priest. Accompanied by Mithradates (now called John), he traveled across several countries of the [[Near East]] and finally settled in [[Maiuma|Majuma]] near [[Gaza City|Gaza]].

In 452, he served as bishop of Majuma for six months before some Christians were banished by the decree of the local ruler. Peter escaped to [[Egypt]] but returned to Palestine a decade later. He gained numerous followers and disciples. According to the medieval sources, he was an author of several famous religious works. However, none of them survived to be written under the name of Peter.

He died at [[Yavneh-Yam]], port of ancient [[Yavneh|Iamnia]], in 491 and was buried in his monastery near [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

Various eastern Churches think that he may have deviated from the [[Chalcedonian]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;These Churches (Armenian, Coptic, etc) believe that Peter the Iberian was a Monophysite and an anti-chaldeonian, whereas this view is not shared by the Georgian Orthodox Church.  Although his biographies do not discuss this issue, some of the scholars who side with the Armenian sources accept the idea that he was an anti-chaldeonian, while others do not.  For example, [[David Marshall Lang]] believes in the possibility that he was a monophysite (see Lang, D M. "Peter the Iberian and his biographers." Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 1951: 158-168), while [[Shalva Nutsubidze]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], 1942) and [[Ernest Honingmann]] ([[Belgium]], 1952) believe that he was a neoplatonic philosopher. (Horn (2006), p. 167.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter’s ''Vita'' was written by his disciple, John Rufus (John of Beth Rufina), later his successor as bishop of Maiuma.&lt;ref name=Kofsky/&gt;

'''The Photon Belt''' (also called the '''photon band''', '''photon ring''', '''manasic ring''', '''manasic radiation''', '''manasic vibration''', '''golden ring''', or '''golden nebula''') is a spiritual belief, largely linked to some parts of the [[New Age]] Movement.  It postulates that a belt or ring of [[photon]]s is going to envelop the [[Earth]], causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] transition, with the time period leading up to "the Shift" referred to as "The [[wikt:quickening|Quickening]]." The concept of the photon belt also ties into various phenomena including belief in [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] and [[2012 millenarianism]].

== Concept ==
The core of the Photon Belt beliefs is that there is an immense belt of photons orbiting around the [[Pleiades]]. According to some New Age beliefs, Earth will pass through this belt of photons, resulting either in humanity's elevation to a higher plane of existence, the end of the world, or both. Authors Virginia Essene (July 19, 1928 - 2015) and [[Sheldon Nidle]] write that the Photon Belt represents a temporary window for spiritual transition during which time humans can reach a higher level of existence, which they term the "galactic" level.&lt;ref name=Essene1994/&gt;

== History ==
German engineer and esotericist '''Paul Otto Hesse''' (1889–1958)&lt;ref&gt;'''Paul Otto Hesse''' (November 26, 1889 – December 30, 1958) was a German oberingenieur (senior engineer) and esotericist. He was born in Langenau, Dresden, Sachsen (Saxony), Germany, and died in a hospital in Berlin, Germany, after a short illness. His parents were Karl Oswald Hesse and Minna Lina Liebscher. In the 1950s his address was Westfaelische Strasse 58, Berlin-Halensee (in the borough of Charlottenburg), Berlin, Germany (See: [https://digitalseance.wordpress.com/all-posts/the-photon-belt-alcyone-saga/the-photon-belt-alcyone-saga-3-paul-otto-hesse]). Hesse was a channel/medium for a spiritual entity which identified itself to him as "the Word." It was this entity who dictated most of the information Hesse published in his book ''Der jüngste Tag'' (1st edition, 1950), the manuscript of which Hesse completed during Easter, 1949. Hesse believed that the spiritual entity who communicated to him most of the information in ''Der jüngste Tag'' is the same being referred to as the "Word" in the ''New Testament'' (see ''John'' 1:1-14). In Christian theology/Christian esotericism, the "Word" is the spiritual entity otherwise known as the "Logos", the "Christ", the "Christ Spirit", the "Cosmic Christ Spirit", or the "Christ Consciousness".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:2:3N57-XJ1 Genealogical Record for Paul Otto Hesse (1889-1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbs.rs/scripts/cobiss?command=DISPLAY&amp;base=COBIB&amp;RID=174786828 Bio-Bibliographical Reference #1 for Paul Otto Hesse (1889-1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliografije.nb.rs/bibliografija/tekuca/monografska/y2011sv2/autori027.html Bio-Bibliographical Reference #2 for Paul Otto Hesse (1889-1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliografije.nb.rs/bibliografija/tekuca/monografska/y2011sv2/zapisi06.html#172 Bio-Bibliographical Reference #3 for Paul Otto Hesse (1889-1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1st German-language edition of ''Der jüngste Tag'' was published by Verlag 'Die Arve' (located in Winden, Kanton Thurgau, Switzerland) in 1950. In 1959 - shortly after Hesse's death on Dec. 30, 1958 - Johannes Imhof (the founder and proprietor of Verlag 'Die Arve') published the 2nd German-language edition of ''Der jüngste Tag''. At the end of this 2nd edition of the book - on pp. 134-135 - Imhof added a brief obituary of Hesse (dated Easter, 1959), giving the date and place of Hesse's death, as well as some other information. Imhof's obituary of Hesse has also been printed in all subsequent German-language editions of ''Der jüngste Tag'' (3rd ed., 1967; 4th ed., 1986; 5th ed., 1995). The full title of the 2nd German-language edition of the book is: ''Der jüngste Tag: Das Gewissen als Offenbarung der Alliebe durch die Manasische Vibration. Ein Buch an die Menschheit, das von den kommenden Dingen spricht und von dem Wort, das seit Anfang ist'' (Winden, Thurgau, Switzerland: Verlag 'Die Arve', 1959) (See: [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/80803795]) (''The Last Day: Conscience as Universal Love, Revealed through the Manasic Vibration. A Book to Humanity, which Speaks of the Coming Things, and of the Word which has been from the Beginning''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many internet writers state - mistakenly - that Paul Otto Hesse was an astronomer, and that he made certain scientific discoveries about the Pleiades in 1961. Since Hesse died on December 30, 1958, this date of 1961 is obviously false. The claim that he was an astronomer is also false, but at least that claim was a reasonable supposition, since, outside of Germany, very little of a factual nature was known about Paul Otto Hesse - until recently. It appears that some internet writers who were not careful in their research misidentified Paul Otto Hesse with the German mathematician [[Ludwig Otto Hesse]] (1811-1874), who is referred to in various sources just as "Otto Hesse". This misidentification, in turn, then led to the further error of confusing some of the writings of [[Ludwig Otto Hesse]] with those of one of his teachers - the German astronomer [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] (1784-1846), who had made several noteworthy original scientific discoveries about stars in the Pleiades group. Bessel, who was Director of the [[Königsberg Observatory]] (Sternwarte Königsberg) from 1810-1846, had been one of Ludwig Otto Hesse's teachers at the Albertus [[University of Königsberg]]. Bessel revealed some of his discoveries about Pleiadean stars in his "A Catalogue of Twenty-seven Stars of the Pleiades", which was published in the ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' (Vol. 5, December, 1839, p. 7). The ultimate consequence of this unfortunate comedy of errors was that - for a long time - many internet writers mistakenly believed that the once mysterious and hard-to-identify Paul Otto Hesse was an astronomer. Another reason Paul Otto Hesse and [[Ludwig Otto Hesse]] may have gotten confused with each other is the fact that, in addition to ''Der jüngste Tag'', Paul Otto Hesse also wrote a mathematical treatise dealing with the mathematical/metaphysical problem known as "the squaring (quadrature) of the circle". This treatise was titled ''Geometrische Konstruktion der quadratur des Zirkels [Beurkundet durch die Cheopspyramide, exaktes [pi]: 3, 141 677 692 349 533 120 838 1536] Das mathematische Wunder der altaegyptischen Mysterien'' (Berlin-Halensee, Germany: Self-Published by the Author, 1953) (See: [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13470305]) (''Geometric Construction of the Squaring of the Circle [Illustrated by the Cheops Pyramid, exact pi = 3.141 677 692 349 533 120 838 1536] - The Mathematical Miracle of Ancient Egyptian Mysteries''). Careless writers may have assumed that mathematician [[Ludwig Otto Hesse]] was the author of this work, resulting in Paul Otto Hesse receiving no acknowledgment as being the actual author of the work, and thereby further confusing the identities of the 2 men.&lt;/ref&gt; described his beliefs about the Photon Belt and its impact on humanity and planet Earth in his book ''Der jüngste Tag'' (First Edition, 1950)&lt;ref name=Hesse2/&gt; (English translation, variously: ''The Last Day'', ''Doomsday'', or ''Judgement Day''). Hesse claimed that this book was dictated to him by "the Word". Citing ''Mark'' 13:32, Hesse says no one can know exactly when planet Earth will enter the Photon Belt.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kahir, ''Nahe an 2000 Jahre. Gegenwart und Zukunft in prophetischer Schau''. Turm-Verlag Bietigheim/Württ, 6. Aufl. 1981, pp. 309-318.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Samael Aun Weor]], who adopted the idea of the Photon Belt in the late 1970s, refers to it as "Alcyone's rings" or "the rings of Alcyone".&lt;ref name=Essene1994/&gt; Weor claims that "[[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]] is the principal sun of the [[Pleiades]], and in its orbit gravitate seven suns, our sun being the seventh which circles Alcyone." According to Weor, Alcyone has rings made of "radiation" caused by the "splitting of the electron." Weor refers to this "radiation" as "manasic" (from the [[Sanskrit]] term for the mind, ''manas''), and indicates that "it in some way relates to [the distinction between] the inferior manas (lower mind or lower self) and the superior manas (higher mind or Higher Self)." Weor purports that "the electrons in Alcyone's rings release a type of unknown energy".&lt;ref name=Essene1994/&gt;

A number of predictions have been made as to the date of Earth's collision with the Photon Belt. So far, no observable effects attributable to the photon belt have been seen on those dates. Dates so far given have included 1992, 1997 and 2011.&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;

==Criticism==

While the concept of the Photon Belt is a part of New Age philosophy, some parts of the story can be analyzed scientifically. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of any sort of "photon belt."

# A [[photon]] is a [[boson]]--one of the [[elementary particle]]s that carry the [[Four forces|four forces of physics]]--in this case, the force that produces light, i.e., the [[electromagnetic force]]. To the extent that such a thing as a "photon belt" is physically possible, it would require the gravitational pull of a [[black hole]], with light rays being bent around the black hole near the [[event horizon]], forming a [[photon sphere]].&lt;ref name=NASA1/&gt; Barring interaction with gravity or matter, photons otherwise always travel in straight lines.
# [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]] is a star in the Pleiades cluster, some 440 light-years away. The core of the Pleiades cluster is approximately 8 light-years across. The Sun, and with it the Earth, is moving away from Alcyone.&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;

The question "'''Why is there anything at all?'''", or, "'''Why is there something rather than nothing?'''" has been raised or commented on by philosophers including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwor00leibuoft "Principles of Nature and Grace"], 1714, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalwor00leibuoft#page/212/mode/2up/search/209 Article 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] − who called it '''the fundamental question of [[metaphysics]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London (1959), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|website=www.hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=9783644045118|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|page=166|language=de|date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; − and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

==Overview==
The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]] or [[multiverse]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]]. It can be seen as an open [[metaphysical]] question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metaphysics special: Why is there something rather than nothing?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130890-400-metaphysics-special-why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorensen|first1=Roy|title=Nothingness|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dascal|first1=Marcelo|title=Leibniz: What Kind of Rationalist?|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402086687|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&amp;pg=PA452|page=452|language=en|date=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldschmidt|first1=Tyron|title=The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136249228|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=3XDMAgAAQBAJ|language=en|date=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the question's adequacy==

Some argue that the question may be inherently illogical; if the universe had no beginning point then its non-existence might never have been an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Lynds|first1=Peter|title=Why there is something rather than nothing: The finite, infinite and eternal|eprint=1205.2720|date=10 January 2012|class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has suggested a model that eliminates the [[initial singularity]] and predicts that the Universe had no beginning but existed forever as a kind of quantum [[potential]] before 'collapsing' into the Big Bang's hot dense state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What if the universe had no beginning?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-if-the-universe-had-no-beginning|website=earthsky.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosmologie: Quantentrick schafft Urknall-Singularität ab|url=http://www.spektrum.de/news/quantentrick-schafft-urknall-singularitaet-ab/1332377|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ein Universum ohne Urknall, Dunkle Materie und Dunkle Energie|url=http://www.forschung-und-wissen.de/nachrichten/astronomie/ein-universum-ohne-urknall-dunkle-materie-und-dunkle-energie-13372141|website=Forschung und Wissen|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research a possible consequence of "[[rainbow gravity]]" might be that the universe had no beginning with time stretching back infinitely without an initial singularity and Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Clara|title=In a "Rainbow" Universe Time May Have No Beginning|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rainbow-gravity-universe-beginning/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before the Big Bang, but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

Philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has said the question may not need answering, as it is attempting to answer a question that is outside a spatio-temporal setting, from within a spatio-temporal setting. He compares the question to asking "what is north of the North Pole?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Stephen Law - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, including philosopher Bede Rundle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanterian|first1=Edward|title=Bede Rundle obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/bede-rundle|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether [[nothing]] can exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Bede Rundle - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2013/05/14/why-theres-something-rather-than-nothing/|title=Why there's something rather than nothing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.closertotruth.com/articles/levels-nothing-robert-lawrence-kuhn|title=Levels of Nothing by Robert Lawrence Kuhn - Closer to Truth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Bede Rundle - CloserToTruth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm Why Does Anything Exist?]&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing might be a human concept that is only a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and inappropriate for a description of a possible alternative reality, state, or absence of state.

==On causation==
Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the notion of an [[uncaused cause]] was non-sensical, and that the [[Eternity of the world|universe was eternal]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[David Hume]] argued that, whilst we expect everything to have a cause because of our experience of the necessity of causes, a cause may not be necessary in the case of the formation of the universe, which is outside our experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutting|first1=Gary|title=Talking God: Philosophers on Belief|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393352825|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=O96aCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|language=en|date=2016-11-22}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said "I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strangenotions.com/5-reasons-why-the-universe-cant-be-merely-a-brute-fact/|title=5 Reasons Why the Universe Can't Be Merely a Brute Fact : Strange Notions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[brute fact]]" position also taken by physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/08/the_evidence_is_pretty_incontrovertible_that_he_doesnt_exist_stephen_colberts_favorite_scientist_on_the_universe_naturalism_and_finding_meaning_without_god/|title="The evidence is pretty incontrovertible that he doesn't exist": Stephen Colbert's favorite scientist on the universe, naturalism and finding meaning without God|first=Phil|last=Torres|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Why there is something, rather than nothing?|eprint=1802.02231|date=6 February 2018|class=physics.hist-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Brian Leftow]] has argued that the question cannot have a causal explanation (as any cause must itself have a cause) or a contingent explanation (as the factors giving the contingency must pre-exist), and that if there is an answer it must be something that exists necessarily (i.e. something that just exists, rather than is caused).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Brian Leftow - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher of physics Dean Rickles has argued that numbers and mathematics (or their underlying laws) may necessarily exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Dean Rickles - Closer ToTruth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Michael Kuhn (to Christopher Ishaam) – Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; Particles can emerge from underlying quantum fields under [[Quantum fluctuation|the effects of quantum physics]] and possibly under other physical laws that may have existed [[Big Bang#Singularity|at the start of the Big Bang]].

{{Jesus}}
The '''quest for the historical Jesus''' consists of academic efforts to determine what words and actions, if any, may be attributed to [[Historical Jesus|Jesus]], and to use the findings to provide [[portraits of the historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name=AlanP13&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by [[Mark Allan Powell]], Westminster John Knox Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0664257038}} pages 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase.&lt;ref name=BenQ9&gt;''The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth''. by Ben Witherington III, InterVersity Press, 1997 (second expanded edition), {{ISBN|0830815449}} pp. 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DThiessen6&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter, Westminster John Knox Press 2002) {{ISBN|0664225373}} pp. 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlanP19&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell, Westminster John Knox Press 1999) {{ISBN|0664257038}} pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt;  These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the [[historical method]] to study biblical narratives. While [[Biblical criticism|textual analysis of biblical sources]] had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions.&lt;ref name=criteria100&gt;''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter, Bloomsbury 2004 {{ISBN|0567043606}} pp. 100–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The enthusiasm shown during the [[Quest for the historical Jesus#First quest|first quest]] diminished after [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s critique of 1906 in which he pointed out various shortcomings in the approaches used at the time. The [[Quest for the historical Jesus#Second quest|second quest]] began in 1953 and introduced a number of new techniques, but reached a plateau in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=voorst2/&gt; In the 1980s a number of scholars gradually began to introduce new research ideas,&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Symbol41/&gt; initiating a [[Quest for the historical Jesus#Third quest|third quest]] characterized by the latest research approaches.&lt;ref name=voorst2&gt;[[Robert E. Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=criteria28&gt;''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter, Bloomsbury 2004 {{ISBN|0567043606}} pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus&lt;ref name=Ehrman285/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grantmajority"/&gt; and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life,&lt;ref name=AmyJill4 /&gt; the portraits of Jesus constructed in the quests have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.&lt;ref name=GerdD5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2/&gt; There are overlapping attributes among the portraits and, while pairs of scholars may agree on some attributes, those same scholars may differ on other attributes and there is no single portrait of the historical Jesus that satisfies most scholars.&lt;ref name=Cradel124/&gt;&lt;ref name=familiar20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy-Jill Levine]] in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al., Princeton University Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-691-00992-6}} p. 1: "no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-D0116-0041-019, Albert Schweitzer.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Albert Schweitzer]], whose book ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]'' coined the term.&lt;ref name=Casey3/&gt;]]
As the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ended, various scholars in Europe began to go beyond [[Biblical criticism|textual analysis]] and the development of [[Gospel harmony|gospel harmonies]] and began to produce biographies of Jesus typically referred to as ''Lives of Jesus''.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; These biographies attempted to apply some historical techniques to a harmonized version of the gospel accounts and produced new overviews of the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; These attempts at constructing a biography of Jesus came to be known as the first "quest for the historical Jesus", a term effectively coined by [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s book which was originally titled ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede''.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casey3/&gt;

By late 19th century, hundreds of ''Lives of Jesus'' were written. Some of these were purely sensational: They were not produced because any new data had appeared, but because some people read and interpreted the gospels in new ways.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; These stories of the ''Lives of Jesus'' were often romanticized, highly psychological or included new elements which did not appear in any of the gospels or other historical documents. For example, [[Ernest Renan]] used the incident where Jesus rides a donkey during his [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] to build a story in which Jesus the carpenter was a gentle prophet who had a donkey in Galilee and rode it while traveling between its different towns.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=criteria33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''John's Gospel and the History of Biblical Interpretation: Bk. 1'' by Sean P. Kealy, Edwin Mellen Press 2002) {{ISBN|077346980X}} p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Powell states that the production of these ''Lives of Jesus'' were typically driven by three elements: 1. the imposition of a grand scheme (e.g. Jesus as a reformer) which dictated the theme of the work and in terms of which the gospels were interpreted; 2. the exclusion of those parts of the gospel accounts that did not fit in the scheme; 3. the addition of new material which did not appear in any of the gospels to fill in the gaps in the story.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt; [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]] stated that in many cases these stories portrayed Jesus "like the questers themselves" rather than a first-century Jewish figure.&lt;ref name=Cradel112&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, B&amp;H Academic 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} p. 112: "The inevitable result of the first quest was that Jesus looked more like the questers themselves than the first century Jew that Jesus was"&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying theme used by the authors of the various  ''Lives of Jesus'' during the first quest varied. In some cases it aimed to praise Christianity, in other cases to attack it.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=criteria33/&gt; One of the earliest notable publications in the field was by [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus|Hermann Reimarus]] (1694–1768) who portrayed Jesus as a less than successful political figure who assumed his destiny was to place God as the king of Israel.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt; Reimarus wrote a treatise which rejected miracles and accused the Bible authors of fraud, but he did not publish this.&lt;ref&gt;"Reimarus, Hermann Samuel."

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baron d'Holbach]] (1723–1789) who had no interest in recovering a historical Jesus but to criticize religion wrote "Ecce Homo -The History of Jesus of Nazareth" and published it anonymously in Amsterdam in 1769.&lt;ref name=Dale1&gt;''Resurrecting Jesus: The Earliest Christian Tradition and Its Interpreters'' by Dale C.

[[File:Ernest-Renan.gif|thumb|left|[[Ernest Renan]] whose book was one of the most popular 19th century ''Lives of Jesus''.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;]]
[[David Strauss]] (1808–1874), at the age of 27 years, pioneered the search for the "Historical Jesus" by rejecting all [[supernatural]] events as [[mythical]] elaborations. His 1835 work, ''Life of Jesus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=David Friedrich|authorlink=David Strauss|title=Das leben Jesu: Kritisch bearbeitet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_IP4pkf3OoC|year=1835|publisher=C.F. Osiander}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first and most influential systematic analyses of the life story of Jesus, aiming to base it on unbiased historical research.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; Strauss viewed the miraculous accounts of Jesus' life in the gospels in terms of myths which had arisen as a result of the community's imagination as it retold stories and represented natural events as miracles.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fami81&gt;''Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'' by Michael J. McClymond, Eerdmans 2004 {{ISBN|0802826806}} page 82&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Schweitzer wrote in ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' (1906; 1910) that Strauss's arguments "filled in the death-certificates of a whole series of explanations which, at first sight, have all the air of being alive, but are not really so". He added that there are two broad periods of academic research in the quest for the historical Jesus, namely, "the period before David Strauss and the period after David Strauss". Among the works that appeared after Strauss, [[Ernest Renan]]'s book ''Vie de Jesus'', which combined scholarship with sentimental and novelistic psychological interpretation, was very successful and had eight re-printings in three months.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt; Renan merged gospel narratives with his own psychological interpretations, e.g. that Jesus preached a "sweet theology of love" in Galilee, but turned into a revolutionary once he encountered the establishment in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt;

[[Johannes Weiss]] (1863–1914) and [[William Wrede]] (1859–1906) brought the [[eschatological]] aspects of the ministry of Jesus to the attention of the academic world.&lt;ref name=Zahl20&gt;''The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus'', by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003) {{ISBN|0802821103}} pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Both Weiss and Wrede were passionately anti-liberal and their presentations aimed to emphasize the unusual nature of the ministry and teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Zahl20/&gt; Wrede wrote on the [[Messianic Secret]] theme in the [[Gospel of Mark]] and argued that it was a method used by early Christians to explain Jesus not claiming himself as the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;''Mark as Story: Retrospect and Prospect'' by Kelly R. Iverson, Christopher W., Skinner, Society of Biblical Literature 2011) {{ISBN|1589835484}} p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Kalthoff]] (1850–1906), in the chapter "Was There An Historical Jesus?" of his 1904 work, ''How Christianity arose. New contributions to the Christ-problem'' (published in English 1907 as ''The rise of Christianity'') wrote, "A Son of God, Lord of the World, born of a virgin, and rising again after death, and the son of a small builder with revolutionary notions, are two totally different beings. If one was the historical Jesus, the other certainly was not. The real question of the historicity of Jesus is not merely whether there ever was a Jesus among the numerous claimants of a Messiahship in Judea, but whether we are to recognise the historical character of this Jesus in the Gospels, and whether he is to be regarded as the founder of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalthoff|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Kalthoff|title=The Rise of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXIAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=1907|publisher=Watts|page=28|chapter=Was There An Historical Jesus?|quote=A Son of God, Lord of the World, born of a virgin, and rising again after death, and the son of a small builder with revolutionary notions, are two totally different beings.

[[Albert Schweitzer]] (1875–1965), a historian of theology, presented an important critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus – From Reimarus to Wrede'' (1906, first edition), denouncing the subjectivity of the various writers who injected their own preferences in Jesus's character. There is one chapter (Ch. 10) on the [[Two-source hypothesis]] of [[Christian Hermann Weisse]] and the [[Wilke hypothesis]] of [[Christian Gottlob Wilke]] and three chapters to David Strauss (Ch. 7, 8, and 9), as well as a full chapter to Bruno Bauer (Ch. 11). [[Bruno Bauer]] (1809–1882) was the first academic theologian to affirm the non-historicity of Jesus. However his scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a [[Outcast (person)|pariah]], until Albert Kalthoff rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Schweitzer highly praised Bauer's early work, prior to  his later period work and conclusion regarding the [[Christ myth theory|ahistoricty of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schweitzer|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Schweitzer|title=The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UPLuZZ8NHIC&amp;pg=PA159|year=1910|page=159|quote=[Bauer] had long been regarded by theologians as an extinct force; nay, more, had been forgotten. [...] It was, indeed, nothing less than a misfortune that Strauss and Bauer appeared within so short a time of one another. Bauer passed practically unnoticed, because every one was preoccupied with Strauss. Another unfortunate thing was that Bauer overthrew with his powerful criticism the hypothesis which attributed real historical value to Mark, so that it lay for a long time disregarded, and there ensued a barren period of twenty years in the critical study of the Life of Jesus. [...] Bauer's "Criticism of the Gospel History" is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found.

A direct challenge to the first quest was ''[[The Christ Myth]]'', first published in 1909 by [[Arthur Drews]] on the [[Christ myth theory]] and the denial of the existence of a [[Historicity of Jesus|historical Jesus]].  Drews, by amplifying and publicizing the thesis initially advanced by Bruno Bauer,&lt;ref name= "Bauer"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bauer/ "Bruno Bauer", by Douglas Moddach, 2009, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)'']&lt;/ref&gt; rose to international prominence from the resulting international controversy provoked by his book. In 1912, [[Shirley Jackson Case]] noted that within the last decade, doubts about Jesus existence had been advanced in several quarters, but nowhere so insistently as in Germany where the skeptical movement had become a regular propaganda, "Its foremost champion is Arthur Drews, professor of philosophy in Karlsruhe Technical High School. Since the appearance of his ''Christusmythe'' in 1909 the subject has been kept before the public by means of debates held in various places, particularly at some important university centers such as Jena, Marburg, Giessen, Leipzig, Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Shirley Jackson|title=The Historicity of Jesus: A Criticism of the Contention that Jesus Never Lived, a Statement of the Evidence for His Existence, an Estimate of His Relation to Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drlKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1912|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=39|quote=Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=drlKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U04xbTGhnmCJF4hlxlnX0nMPWc8eQ&amp;ci=65%2C707%2C765%2C620&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;39] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Walter P.|title=The Historical Jesus in the Twentieth Century: 1900-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA69|date=1 July 1999|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-56338-280-2|page=69|quote=Case [Shirley Jackson Case] then provided some of the history of the problem, noting the contributions of the French in Charles Dupuis and Constantin Volney (end of eighteenth century), Karl Bahrdt and Karl Venturini in Germany, Charles Hennell in England, as well as the influence of D.

Mead, Thomas Whittaker), in Holland (Gerardus J. P. J. Bolland), in France (Charles Virolleaud), Italy (Emilio Bossi), Poland (Andrzej Niemojewski), and America (W. B.

To [[The Christ Myth#Albert Schweitzer|discuss Drews's thesis]], Schweitzer added two new chapters in the 1913 second edition of his work, ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. (''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'', 2. Auflage, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xtnOIhZAmgC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=Schweitzer+bestreitung&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=VcSITOexH8zLswbjrv2mCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Schweitzer%20bestreitung&amp;f=false Albert Schweitzer, ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', 2d ed. 1913, Ch. 22, p. 451]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ch. 23 (p.&amp;nbsp;500–560), "The Debate About the Historicity of Jesus" (''Die Diskussion über die Geschichtlichkeit Jesu''), reviews the publications of 40 theologians/scholars in response to Drews, and mentions the participants in the February 1910 public debate. Most of the publications are critical and negative. Schweitzer continues his systematic exposure of the problems and difficulties in the theories of the ''Bestreiter'' ("challengers') and ''Verneiner'' ("deniers") — the [[Radical Criticism|Dutch Radicals]], [[J. M. Robertson]], [[William Benjamin Smith|W. B. Smith]] and Drews – and the authenticity of Paul's epistles and Paul's historicity as well.

Schweitzer himself also argued that all the 19th-century presentations of Jesus had either minimized or neglected the apocalyptic message of Jesus, and he developed his own version of the profile of Jesus in the Jewish apocalyptic context.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

===Dénouement of the first quest===
Schweitzer's work was preceded by [[Martin Kähler]]'s book ''The So-Called Historical Jesus and the Historic Biblical Christ'' which was published in 1896.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; Kähler argued that it was not possible to separate the Jesus of history from the Christ of faith and that in any case, the key goal of biblical analysis should be to better understand the Christ of faith who had influenced history.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; Kähler's work appealed to both conservatives and liberals and its combined effect with Schweitzer's book effectively ended the first quest.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;

==Period of no quest==
[[File:Rudolf Bultmann Portrait.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rudolf Bultmann]] believed that what matters is that Jesus lived and was crucified, not what happened during his life.&lt;ref name=Marcus187/&gt;]]
Schweitzer's 1906 critique undermined the previous attempts in historical Jesus research, and is often seen as the start of a period of "no quest" lasting until [[Ernst Käsemann]]'s 1953 lecture which started the second quest.&lt;ref name= BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd 1995 37"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boyd |first=Gregory A. |title=Cynic Sage or Son of God: Recovering the Real Jesus in an Age of Revisionist Replies |year=1995 |publisher=Victor Books/SP Publications |location=Wheaton, IL |isbn=1-56476-448-6 |page=37 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Witherington]] states that at the end of the first quest, historical Jesus research was assumed to be dead, although that did not turn out to be the case.&lt;ref name= BenQ9/&gt;

Some scholars such as Paul Zahl argue that the last two paragraphs of Schweitzer's book aptly summarize the end of the first quest, Schweitzer stating "Jesus of Nazareth will not suffer himself to be modernized as a historical figure... He comes to us as One unknown".&lt;ref name=Zahl21/&gt; Zahl likens the first quest to the [[Terra Nova Expedition|Scott expedition]] to [[Antarctica]], and states that the first quest ended as a total disaster, slowing down academic efforts to pursue research into the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=Zahl21&gt;''The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus'' by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 {{ISBN|0802821103}} pp. 12, 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars such as [[Stanley E. Porter|Stanley Porter]] or [[Dale Allison]] disagree with that assessment, or the separation in terms of these phases.&lt;ref name=Casey3/&gt;&lt;ref name=criteria33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dale2&gt;''Resurrecting Jesus: The Earliest Christian Tradition and Its Interpreters'' by Dale C. Allison Jr., Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark 2005 {{ISBN|0567029107}} pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bengt887&gt;Bengt Holmberg, "Futures for Jesus Quests" in the ''Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus'' edited by Tom Holmen and Stanley E. Porter, Brill 2010 (4 volumes) {{ISBN|9004163727}} pp. 887–889&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley Porter states that Schweitzer's critique only ended the "romanticized and overly psychologized" studies into the life of Jesus, and other research continued.&lt;ref name=criteria33&gt;''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter 2004 {{ISBN|0567043606}} pp. 33–37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dale Allison]] states that other research did take place during the so-called no quest phase, and the progress was continuous in that every year except 1919 a new academic book on Jesus was published.&lt;ref name=Dale1/&gt; [[Maurice Casey]] states that although it may at first appear reasonable to call this a period of "no quest" that characterization is not accurate and in this period significant other progress was made, e.g. [[B. H. Streeter]]'s work on [[Markan priority]] and [[Q source]] which affected future research.&lt;ref name=Casey3&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' by Maurice Casey 2010 {{ISBN|0-567-64517-7}} pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

A key figure in the relatively quiet period from 1906 to 1953 was [[Rudolf Bultmann]], who was skeptical regarding the relevance and necessity of historical Jesus research and argued that the only thing we can or need to know about Jesus is the "thatness" (German: ''Dass'') of his existence and very little else.&lt;ref name=Marcus187&gt;''Jesus in Contemporary Scholarship'' by Marcus J. Borg, Trinity Press 1994 {{ISBN|1563380943}} p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwin1170/&gt; Bultmann argued that all that matters is the "thatness", not the "whatness" in that only that Jesus existed, preached and died by crucifixion matters, not what happened throughout his life.&lt;ref name=Marcus187/&gt; Bultmann was also a supporter of the study of the [[Oral gospel traditions|oral traditions]] that transmitted the gospels.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Oral Gospel Tradition'' by Henry Wansborough, Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark 2004  {{ISBN|0567040909}} p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Bultmann believed that only a few scattered facts could be known about Jesus, and although a few things could be known about Jesus such a search was pointless for all that matters is following "the call of Jesus" which can only be known through an existential encounter with the word of God.&lt;ref name=Edwin1170/&gt; Bultmann argued that the earliest Christian literature showed little interest in specific locations and that the study of Jesus through historical analysis was not only impossible, but unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Edwin1170&gt;Edwin Broadhead "Implicit Christology and the Historical Jesus" in the ''Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus'' edited by Tom Holmen and Stanley E. Porter, Brill 2010 {{ISBN|9004163727}} pp. 1170–1172&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the end Bultmann did not totally close the door on historical research and by 1948 suggested the possibility of further investigation.&lt;ref name=Edwin1170/&gt;

==Second quest==
[[File:Bautismo de Cristo por Navarrete el Mudo.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[criterion of embarrassment]] developed during the second quest was applied to the [[Baptism of Jesus]], depicted here in a c. 1567 painting by [[Juan Fernández Navarrete]].&lt;ref name="Powell47" /&gt;]]
While the exact date for the start of the first or third quest may be questioned, the beginning of the second quest has a well known time and location, namely [[Ernst Käsemann]]'s October 20, 1953 lecture titled "The Problem of the Historical Jesus", delivered to an annual gathering of alumni from the [[University of Marburg]] who, like Käsemann, has studied with [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref name=AlanP19/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zahl23&gt;''The First Christian'' by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 {{ISBN|0802821103}} pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Käsemann's lecture marked a departure from the teachings of his former professor Bultmann who emphasized theology and in 1926 had argued that historical Jesus research was both futile and unnecessary; although Bultmann slightly modified that position in a later book.&lt;ref name=Edwin1170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zahl23/&gt; Käsemann advanced the position that although the gospels may be interpreted for theological purposes, they still contain historical memories which can yield information about Jesus.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlanP19/&gt; This perspective effectively began what was then known as the "New Quest" and later came to be called the second quest for the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; Most of the scholars involved in the second quest were either German or trained by Germans.&lt;ref name=Symbol41&gt;''The Symbolic Jesus: Historical Scholarship, Judaism and the Construction of Contemporary Identity'' by William Arnal, Routledge 2005 {{ISBN|1845530071}} pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Käsemann's perspective that it is possible to know something about Jesus if the tools of historical analysis are applied in a systematic manner proved highly consequential and inspired a number of scholars to develop new approaches to the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlanP19/&gt; One of the influential works that followed his approach was [[Günther Bornkamm]]'s 1956 book ''Jesus of Nazareth'' and his well-known statement that "what the Gospels report concerning the message, the deeds and the history of Jesus is still distinguished by an authenticity... these features point us directly to the earthly figure of Jesus" provided momentum for the second quest in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth'' by Gunther Bornkamm 1960, Harper NY {{ISBN|080062887X}} page 24: "what the Gospels report concerning the message, the deeds and the history of Jesus is still distinguished by an authenticity, a freshness and a distinctiveness not in any way effaced by the Church's Easter faith. These features point us directly to the earthly figure of Jesus"&lt;/ref&gt; [[James M. Robinson]]'s 1959 book ''A New Quest for the Historical Jesus'' was reprinted numerous times, indicating the high level of interest in the subject during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Quest for the Historical Jesus and Other Essays'' by [[James M.

In order to analyze biblical passages, Käsemann introduced the [[criterion of dissimilarity]], that compares a gospel passage (e.g. a statement by Jesus) to the Jewish context of the time, and if dissimilar, places weight on its being on safe ground.&lt;ref name=GerdD122&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter, Westminster John Knox Press 2002  {{ISBN|0664225373}} p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the second quest the [[criterion of embarrassment]] was also introduced.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; This criterion states that a group is unlikely to invent a story that would be embarrassing to themselves.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; For instance, this criterion argues that the [[early Christianity|early Christian Church]] would have never wanted to invent the kernel of the story about the [[Baptism of Jesus]] because [[John the Baptist|John]] baptised for the remission of [[sin]]s, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, hence the story served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.&lt;ref name="Powell47"&gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey35"&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' by Maurice Casey 2010 {{ISBN|0-567-64517-7}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; While the baptism of Jesus itself may be a historical event, the presence of the dove and the voice from Heaven may be later embellishments to the original happening.&lt;ref name=AlanP13/&gt; [[Marcello Craveri]]'s "Life of Jesus" in 1967, based on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], argued that the claims to divinity made by the historical Jesus were strictly limited and not unusual for a Jew of that generation. Much of the stronger claims, and the emphasis on the redeeming power of Christ's death on the Cross, could be seen as reworkings by St. Paul, who was probably influenced strongly by the [[Graeco-Roman]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Craveri, ''The Life of Jesus; An assessment through modern historical evidence.'', Eco Press 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s the initial momentum of the second quest had all but disappeared.&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Symbol41/&gt; A number of scholars, attribute the end of this quest to the diminishing role of [[Rudolf Bultmann|Bultmann]]'s ideas, [[Ben Witherington]] stating: "As the towering influence of Bultmann and the enthusiasm for existentialism began to wane, so did the enthusiasm for the Second Quest".&lt;ref name=BenQ9/&gt; [[Geza Vermes]] stated: "Owing to the colossal influence of Bultmann on German, and subsequently through his former students on North American, New Testament learning, the clock of real historical research stopped for half a century" and that it started again only after that influence had ended.&lt;ref name=Symbol41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Religion of Jesus the Jew'' by Geza Vermes, Fortress Press 1993 {{ISBN|0800627970}} pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Zahl stated that while the second quest made significant contributions at the time, its results are now mostly forgotten, although not disproven.&lt;ref name=Zahl12&gt;''The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus'' by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 {{ISBN|0802821103}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third quest==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Jesus Teaches the People by the Sea (Jésus enseigne le peuple près de la mer) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|280px|"Jesus Teaches the People by the Sea", a painting by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
The second quest reached a plateau in the 1970s and by the 1980s a third quest had started and gained a formal following.&lt;ref name="DThiessen6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt;&lt;ref name=voorst2/&gt; Unlike the second quest, the third quest had no well-defined beginning and emerged as a number of scholars presented new approaches within a relatively short time of each other.&lt;ref name=DThiessen6/&gt; In 1992 [[N. T. Wright]] coined the term "third quest" to refer to these new approaches.&lt;ref name="criteria28"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JJohn127&gt;''John, Jesus, and History, Volume 1: Critical Appraisals of Critical Views'' by Paul N. Anderson, Felix Just and Tom Thatcher 2007 {{ISBN|1589832930}} page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the previous criteria of [[criterion of multiple attestation|multiple attestation]], [[criterion of dissimilarity|dissimilarity]] (also called discontinuity) and [[criterion of embarrassment|embarrassment]], a number of other criteria have been developed through the third quest.&lt;ref name=criteria100/&gt;&lt;ref name=whois35 /&gt; Primary among these are:&lt;ref name=whois35 &gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by Thomas P. Rausch (Jul 1, 2003) {{ISBN|0814650783}} pages 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPM126&gt;[[John P. Meier]] "Criteria: How do we decide what comes from Jesus?" in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight, Eisenbrauns 2006 {{ISBN|1575061007}} pages 126-142&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The criterion of historical plausibility was introduced in 1997.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; This principle analyzes the plausibility of an event in terms of components such as contextual plausibility and consequential plausibility, i.e. the historical context needs to be suitable, as well as the consequences.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; In recent research, the criterion of plausibility has found favor among scholars over the [[criterion of dissimilarity]] and accounts that fit the historical context are viewed as more likely to be valid.&lt;ref name=DThiessen6/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theissen 1998. p. 11"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The criterion of rejection and execution was developed in 1985.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; It is quite different from other criteria and does not directly point to an individual saying or act of Jesus as authentic, but focuses attention on the fact that Jesus was rejected by the Jews and executed by the Romans and then asks what words and deeds would fit into this scenario.&lt;ref name=whois35/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPM126/&gt; [[John P. Meier]] stated that this criterion draws attention that a Jesus who did not challenge the authorities of his time would have been unlikely to have been crucified, and thus helps evaluate the sayings of Jesus in that context.&lt;ref name=JPM126/&gt;

:* The criterion of congruence (also called cumulative circumstantial evidence) is a special case of the older criterion of coherence.&lt;ref name=PetrP&gt;Petr Pokorny "Jesus Research as Feedback" ''Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus'' by Tom Holmen and Stanley E. Porter, Brill 2010 {{ISBN|9004163727}} pp. 338–339&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion of coherence, also called the criterion of consistency and conformity, looks back at what has already been established as historical, and tests if a new hypothesis is consistent and coherent with what is already known.&lt;ref name=whois35/&gt; Thus this criterion is not simply applied to ancient texts as a star but looks back at the results of modern analysis and considers its coherence and consistency.&lt;ref name=JPM126/&gt; The criterion of congruence lends support to a hypothesis if observations from other data suggest similar conclusions.&lt;ref name=PetrP/&gt;

A number of other proposed criteria are viewed as dubious and unreliable by third quest scholars.&lt;ref name=whois35/&gt; These include the presence of traces of Aramaic proposed by [[Joachim Jeremias|J. Jeremias]] which evaluates a biblical saying based on the presence of possibly Aramaic vocabulary or grammar; and the similar criterion of the Palestinian environment which considers a saying authentic if it fits in the Palestinian setting of Jesus' time.&lt;ref name=whois35/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPM126/&gt; The criterion of the vividness of narration suggested that a saying expressed in more vivid language than the rest of the surrounding text, it may be an eyewitness declaration; but the criterion is generally rejected by scholars.&lt;ref name=whois35/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPM126/&gt;

A new characteristic of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archeology and [[James Charlesworth]] states that few modern scholars now want to overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in [[Galilee]] and [[Roman Judea|Judea]] during the time of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Charlesworth11 &gt;"Jesus Research and Archaeology: A New Perspective" by James H. Charlesworth in ''Jesus and archaeology'' edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 {{ISBN|0-8028-4880-X}} pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; A further characteristic of the third quest has been its interdisciplinary and global nature of the scholarship.&lt;ref name=ChiltonJacob&gt;''Soundings in the Religion of Jesus: Perspectives and Methods in Jewish and Christian Scholarship'' by [[Bruce Chilton]] Anthony Le Donne and [[Jacob Neusner]] 2012 {{ISBN|0800698010}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt; While the first two quests were mostly by European Protestant theologians, the third quest has seen an worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines, e.g. Jewish scholars involved in historical Jesus research have contributed their detailed knowledge of [[Second Temple Judaism]] as the backdrop for the third quest.&lt;ref name=ChiltonJacob/&gt;

==Historical interpretations of Jesus==
{{Main article|Historical Jesus}}
While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus as a historical figure, the portraits of Jesus constructed during the three quests have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285&gt;In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] (who is a secular agnostic) wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" B. Ehrman, ''Forged : writing in the name of God'', Harper 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-06-207863-6}}. p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grantmajority"&gt;[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] (a [[classicist]]) states that "In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary." in ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'' by Michael Grant 2004 {{ISBN|1898799881}} page 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GerdD5&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter, Westminster John Knox Press 2002 {{ISBN|0664225373}} page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Jesus, Quest of the." ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 775&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amy-Jill Levine]] states that despite the differing portraits, there is a general scholarly consensus on the basic outline of Jesus' life in that most scholars agree that Jesus [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]], debated Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables, gathered followers and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=AmyJill4 &gt;[[Amy-Jill Levine]] in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al. Princeton University Press {{ISBN|978-0-691-00992-6}} p. 4: "There is a consensus of sorts on a basic outline of Jesus' life. Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, debated with fellow Jews on how best to live according to God's will, engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, gathered male and female followers in Galilee, went to Jerusalem, and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate"&lt;/ref&gt;

The many differences of emphasis among mainstream interpretations in the third quest may be grouped together based on a number of primary interpretations of Jesus as variously an apocalyptic prophet, charismatic healer, cynic philosopher, Jewish Messiah or prophet of social change.&lt;ref name=Cradel124&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CambHist23&gt;''The Cambridge History of Christianity'', Volume 1 by Margaret M. Mitchell and Frances M. Young, Cambridge University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0521812399}} page 23&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is little scholarly agreement on a single interpretation of his life, or the methods needed to construct it.&lt;ref name=GerdD5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2&gt;''Jesus Research: An International Perspective'' (Princeton-Prague Symposia Series on the Historical Jesus) by James H. Charlesworth and Petr Pokorny, Eerdmans 2009 {{ISBN|0802863531}} pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter74&gt;''Images of Christ: Ancient and Modern'', by Stanley E. Porter, Michael A. Hayes and David Tombs, Sheffield Academic Press 1997 {{ISBN|0567044602}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt; There are also overlapping attributes among the accounts and pairs of scholars which may differ on some attributes may agree on others.&lt;ref name=Cradel124/&gt;&lt;ref name=familiar20&gt;''Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'' by Michael James McClymond, Eerdmans 2004) {{ISBN|0802826806}} pp. 16–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CambHist23/&gt; These groupings reflect the essential feature of each portrait and the accounts often include overlapping elements, for example there are a number of scholars, including [[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan]] and [[N. T. Wright|Wright]], who are otherwise critical of each other, but whose interpretations agree that Jesus was not "primarily apocalyptic" and still believe that Jesus preached such a message, while others (e.g. [[Marcus Borg|Borg]] and [[Burton L. Mack|Mack]]) differ on that issue.&lt;ref name=familiar20/&gt; The third quest has thus witnessed a fragmentation of the scholarly interpretations in which no unified picture of Jesus can be attained at all.&lt;ref name=GerdD5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2/&gt;

In his 1906 book ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]'', Albert Schweitzer noted the similarities of the portraits to the scholars who construct them and stated that they are often "pale reflections of the researchers" themselves.&lt;ref name=Cradel124/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus the Christ'' by Walter Kasper, Paulist Press 1976 ISBN p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Theological Hermeneutics and 1 Thessalonians'', by Angus Paddison, Cambridge University Press 2005) {{ISBN|0521849837}} p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] stated that the trend has continued and summarized the situation by stating that many authors writing about the life of Jesus would "do autobiography and call it biography".&lt;ref name=Cradel124/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt;

His father left the family when Anderson was eleven.&lt;ref name="anderson2"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, he was a [[Golden Gloves]] [[Boxing|boxer]].&lt;ref name="downing"&gt;{{cite book |last=Downing |first=Michael |title=Shoes Outside the Door: Desire, Devotion, and Excess at San Francisco Zen Center |publisher=Counterpoint |year=2001 |location=Washington, DC |pages=15–16 |oclc=46793103 |isbn=1582431132 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson developed an interest in [[Buddhism]] while still in his teens.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; In 1967, he abandoned his graduate studies in [[psychology]] and [[mathematics]] to study [[Soto Zen]] under [[Shunryu Suzuki]] at the [[San Francisco Zen Center]].

Anderson was then ordained as a priest in 1970 by Suzuki, who gave Anderson the [[Buddhist name]] Tenshin Zenki 天眞全機 (''Naturally Real, the Whole Works'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gach |first=Gary |title=What Book!?: Buddha Poems from Beat to Hiphop |publisher=Parallax Press |year=1998 |location=Berkeley |pages=210 |oclc=38324499 |isbn=0938077929}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 Anderson received [[shiho]] from [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]], becoming Baker's first [[Dharma heir]]. However, when Baker was forced to resign amid complaints about his affairs with female Zen Center members and his purchase of expensive luxury goods, Baker claimed Anderson never completed the entire transmission ceremony.&lt;ref name="downing2"&gt;{{harvnb|Downing|2001|pp=357–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of the San Francisco Zen Center disagreed, understanding Anderson to be Baker's Dharma heir (Baker has since agreed).&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; After Baker's resignation, Anderson replaced him as abbot.

In a controversial incident, while jogging in [[Golden Gate Park]] in 1983, Anderson found the corpse of a man with a bullet wound to the head and a revolver nearby. Anderson returned to the body over a period of several days to meditate over the corpse, on one visit taking the revolver.&lt;ref name="anderson1"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2001|pp=187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Anderson was [[Robbery|mugged]] one block away from the San Francisco Zen Center. He retrieved the unloaded revolver and chased the perpetrator to a nearby tenement, where both were quickly arrested.&lt;ref name="anderson1"/&gt;

The Zen Center Board of Directors sent him on a [[leave of absence]] for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Buddhist sect's top priest is taking a voluntary...|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/06/16/A-Buddhist-sects-top-priest-is-taking-a-voluntary/9654550814400/|accessdate=7 February 2018|agency=UPI|publisher=United Press International|date=16 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return, he served as co-abbot with [[Mel Weitsman]] until 1995. Regarding this ordeal, Anderson has written of his remorse and insight garnered from the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2001|pp=187–189}}: "On both a personal and a professional level, I am still dealing with the consequences of this episode. Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both to me and to others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow."&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999 Anderson suffered a [[heart attack]] while conducting [[dokusan]]. He later underwent a successful emergency [[angioplasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chadwick |first=David |authorlink=David Chadwick (writer) |title=Cuke Sangha News through '07 |url=http://www.cuke.com/sangha_news/sanghanews-through-07.html |publisher=cuke.com |date=20 October 1999 |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is married to Rusa Chiu, a Jungian analyst in private practice. He has two daughters, Deborah Savran and Thea Anderson, and four grandchildren.

==Teaching style==
According to [[James Ishmael Ford]], "...Anderson Roshi is one of the first people to have worked hard to bring [[Dogen]] studies West. He has also stretched much of Zen's traditional approach to psychology by drawing upon other ancient Buddhist sources, including [[Abhidharma]] and [[Yogachara]] teaching, while at the same time being solidly informed regarding Western approaches to the discipline."&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; To some students, "...Reb's practice invites comparison to the legendary Japanese samurai, the warriors who trained in medieval Zen monasteries."&lt;ref name="downing"/&gt;

==Dharma heirs==
Sobun Katherine Thanas received [[shiho]] from Tenshin Roshi in 1988 and later was installed as abbess of the Santa Cruz Zen Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorial Page: Karin Sobun Katherine Thomas |url=http://www.sczc.org/memorial-page.html |publisher=Santa Cruz Zen Center |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zengyu Paul Discoe, Chikudo Jerome Peterson and Ananda Claude Dalenburg also received shiho in 1988 (Ananda was the inspiration for the character Bud Diefendorf in [[Jack Kerouac|Jack Kerouac's]] novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chadwick |first=David |authorlink=David Chadwick (writer) |title=Interviews with Ananda (Claude) Dalenberg |url=http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/interviews/ananda.html |publisher=cuke.com |date=7 October 1994 |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson gave [[shiho]] to his student [[Jiko Linda Cutts]] in 1996, who went on to serve as co-abbess of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] from 2000 until 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2110">The '''received view of theories''' is a position in the [[philosophy of science]] that identifies a [[scientific theory]] with a set of propositions which are considered to be linguistic objects, such as [[axiom]]s.  [[Frederick Suppe]] describes the position of the received view by saying that it identifies scientific theories with an "axiomatic calculi in which theoretical terms are given a partial observation interpretation by mean of correspondence rules."&lt;ref&gt;Suppe, Frederick (1989). ''The Semantic Conception of Theories and Scientific Realism''. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The received view is generally associated with the [[logical positivism|logical empiricists]].

Recently, the received view of theories has been displaced by the [[semantic view of theories]] as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102-S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frigg |first1=Roman | author-link= Roman Frigg |year=2006 |title=Scientific Representation and the Semantic View of Theories |journal=Theoria |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2926/1/Scientific_Representation.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sanskrit]] texts, '''Rāja yoga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|dʒ|ə|_|ˈ|j|oʊ|g|ə}}) was both the goal of [[yoga]] and &lt;!--possibly later, but certainly also in Sanskrit--&gt;a method of attaining it. The term also became a modern name for the practice of yoga, when in the 19th-century [[Swami Vivekananda]] equated raja yoga with the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga&gt;Swami Vivekananda, Raja Yoga, {{ISBN|978-1500746940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Rāja yoga has variously been called "royal yoga", "royal union", "sahaj marg", "classical yoga", and "aṣṭāṅga yoga".

==Etymology and usage==
Rāja (Sanskrit: राज) means "chief, best of its kind" or "king".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html rAja] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Rāja yoga thus refers to "chief, best of yoga".

The historical use of the term ''Rāja yoga'' is found in other contexts, quite different than its modern usage. In ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, it meant the highest state of yoga practice (one reaching ''samadhi'').{{sfn|Mallinson-1|2011}} [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], for example, refers to Hathayoga as one of the ways to achieve Rāja yoga.

The first known use of the phrase "Rāja yoga" occurs in a 16th-century commentary on a specific step in the ''[[Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]]''.&lt;ref name=jasonbirch/&gt; The Hindu scholar [[Dattatreya]], in his medieval era Tantric work named "Yogaśāstra", explains in 334 shlokas, principles of four yoga: Mantra yoga, Hatha yoga, Laya yoga and Raja yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791436967}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Daniélou]] states that ''Rāja yoga'' was, in the historic literature of Hinduism, one of five known methods of yoga, with the other four being ''Hatha yoga'', ''Mantra yoga'', ''Laya yoga'' and ''Shiva yoga''.&lt;ref name=alaindanielou&gt;Alain Daniélou (1991), Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe, {{ISBN|978-0892813018}}, Chapters 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Daniélou translates it as "Royal way to reintegration of Self with Universal Self ([[Brahman]])".

The term became a modern [[retronym]] when in the 19th-century [[Swami Vivekananda]] equated raja yoga with the [[Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]].&lt;ref name=jasonbirch/&gt;{{sfn|Mallinson-1|2011}}&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga/&gt; This sense of meaning is different from [[Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā]], a text of the [[Nath|Natha sampradaya]],{{sfn|Mallinson-2|2011}} where it is a different practice. Similarly, [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]], a recent religious movement, teaches "Rāja yoga" that has very little to do with either the precepts of Hatha Yoga or Patañjali's ''Yoga Sūtras''.&lt;ref name=jasonbirch&gt;Jason Birch (2013), Råjayoga: The Reincarnations of the King of All Yogas, ''International Journal of Hindu Studies'', Volume 17, Issue 3, pages 401–444&lt;/ref&gt; Modern interpretations and literature that discusses ''Raja yoga'' often credit Patañjali's ''Yogasūtras'' as its textual source, but many neither adopt the teachings nor the philosophical foundations of the Yoga school of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Birch (2013), Råjayoga: The Reincarnations of the King of All Yogas, ''International Journal of Hindu Studies'', Volume 17, Issue 3, page 404-406&lt;/ref&gt; This mixing of concepts has led to confusion in understanding historical and modern Indian literature on Yoga.{{sfn|Mallinson-1|2011}}{{sfn|Mallinson-2|2011}}

==History==
[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Swami Vivekananda]] equated raja yoga with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga/&gt;]]

===Raja yoga ===
{{main|Samadhi}}
The [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] Yoga text, ''Amanaska'', dated to be from the 12th century CE or earlier, is a dialogue between [[Vamadeva]] and deity [[Shiva]]. In the second chapter, the text mentions Raja yoga, and explains why it is called so. It states that it is so named because it enables the yogin to reach the illustrious king within oneself, the supreme self.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Birch (2013), The Amanaska: King of All Yogas, Ph.D. Dissertation, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt; Raja yoga is declared as the goal where one experiences nothing but the bliss of the undisturbed, the natural state of calm, serenity, peace, communion within and contentment.&lt;ref name=jasonbirch/&gt;

The Raja yoga goal and state is synonymous with various terms, such as ''Amanaska'', ''Unmani'' and ''Sahaj''.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson and Karl H. Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Yoga: India's philosophy of meditation, Volume XII, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833494}}, pages 364, 366&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] (literally, ''Little Lamp of Hatha Yoga'') asserts this as follows,&lt;ref name=hathyoga/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
'''राजयोगः समाधि'''श्छ उन्मनी छ मनोन्मनी &lt;nowiki&gt;| अमरत्वं लयस्तत्त्वं शून्याशून्यं परं पदम || ३ ||
अमनस्कं तथाद्वैतं निरालम्बं निरञ्जनम | जीवन्मुक्तिश्छ सहजा तुर्या छेत्येक-वाछकाः || ४ ||
सलिले सैन्धवं यद्वत्साम्यं भजति योगतः | तथात्म-मनसोरैक्यं समाधिरभिधीयते || ५ ||
यदा संक्ष्हीयते पराणो मानसं छ परलीयते | तदा समरसत्वं छ समाधिरभिधीयते || ६ ||
तत-समं छ दवयोरैक्यं जीवात्म-परमात्मनोः | परनष्ह्ट-सर्व-सङ्कल्पः समाधिः सोअभिधीयते || ७ ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Raja yoga''', samadhi, unmani, manonmani, amaratva, laya, tatva, [[Śūnyatā|sunya]], asunya, parama pada,
amanaska, [[advaita]], niralamba, niranjana, [[jivanmukti]], sahaja and turiya denote the same state of being.
Just as with salt dissolved in water becomes one with it, so the union of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and ''Manas'' (mind) is denominated samadhi,
When the breath becomes exhausted, and mind becomes ''Praliyate'' (still, reabsorbed), they fuse into union called samadhi.
This equality, this oneness of the two, the living self and the absolute self, when all ''Sankalpa'' (desire, cravings) end is called samadhi.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Raja yoga as a type of yoga===
Some medieval era Indian texts on Yoga list Rajayoga as one of many types of yoga.&lt;ref name=jasonmedievallist/&gt; For example, the Sarvanga yoga pradipikå, a Braj-bhashya commentary by Sundardas, from the 17th-century, teach three tetrads of Yogas. The first group is [[Bhakti yoga]], Mantra yoga, [[Kundalini yoga|Laya yoga]], and Carcha yoga; the second group is [[Hatha yoga]], Raja yoga, Laksha yoga, and [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga|Astanga yoga]]; the third is [[Samkhya]] yoga, [[Jnana yoga|Jñana yoga]], Brahma yoga, and Advaita yoga. Of these twelve, Sundardas states that Rajayoga is the best yoga.&lt;ref name=jasonmedievallist&gt;Jason Birch (2013), Råjayoga: The Reincarnations of the King of All Yogas, ''International Journal of Hindu Studies'', Volume 17, Issue 3, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raja yoga as yoga system of Patanjali===
{{main|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
[[File:patanjali.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Patanjali|Patañjali]] statue (traditional form indicating [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] or incarnation of [[Shesha]])]]
One meaning of Raja yoga is as a modern retronym introduced by Swami Vivekananda, when he equated raja yoga with the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].{{sfn|Mallinson-1|2011}}&lt;ref name=jasonbirch/&gt;&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga/&gt; After its circulation in the first half of 1st millennium CE, many Indian scholars reviewed it, then published their ''Bhāṣya'' (notes and commentary) on it, which together form a canon of texts called the ''Pātañjalayogaśāstra'' ("The Treatise on Yoga of Patañjali").{{sfn|Maas|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Axel Michaels, the ''Yoga Sutras'' are built upon fragments of texts and traditions from ancient India.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=267}} According to Feuerstein, the ''Yoga Sutras'' are a condensation of two different traditions, namely "eight limb yoga" (ashtanga yoga) and action yoga (''kriya yoga'').{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978|p=108}} The ''kriya yoga'' part is contained in chapter 1, chapter 2 verse 1-27, chapter 3 except verse 54, and chapter 4.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978|p=108}} The "eight limb yoga" is described in chapter 2 verse 28-55, and chapter 3 verse 3 and 54.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978|p=108}}

There are numerous parallels in the concepts in ancient [[Samkhya]], Yoga and [[Abhidharma]] schools of thought, particularly from 2nd century BCE to 1st century AD, notes Larson.&lt;ref name=l4345&gt;Larson, pp. 43-45&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's Yoga Sutras may be a synthesis of these three traditions. From Samkhya school of Hinduism, Yoga Sutras adopt the "reflective discernment" (''adhyavasaya'') of ''prakrti'' and ''purusa'' (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three [[epistemology|epistemic]] methods to gaining reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=l4345/&gt; From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of ''nirodhasamadhi'', suggests Larson, Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhism which believes that there is neither self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul.&lt;ref name=l4345/&gt; The third concept Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] traditions of isolation, meditation and introspection, as well as the yoga ideas from the 1st millennium BCE Indian texts such as [[Katha Upanishad]], [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] and [[Maitri Upanishad]].&lt;ref name=l4345/&gt;

===Islamic period===
In early 11th century, the Persian scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=sptg&gt;S Pines and T Gelblum (Translators from Arabic to English, 1966), Al-Bīrūni (Translator from Sanskrit to Arabic, ~ 1035 AD), and Patañjali, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/611180 Al-Bīrūnī's Arabic Version of Patañjali's ''Yogasūtra''], ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (1966), pages 302-325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David White (2014), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq06f The ''Yoga Sutra of Patanjali'' - A Biography], Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4008-5005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellmut Ritter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1579273 al-Bīrūnī's übersetzung des ''Yoga-Sūtra des Patañjali''], Oriens, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Dec. 31, 1956), pages 165-200 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Along with generally accurate translations, Al Biruni's text has significant differences than Yogasutra manuscripts discovered in India, during the 19th century. Al Biruni's record has helped modern scholars establish that Patanjali's ''Yogasutras'' manuscript existed in India in many versions, each with multiple commentaries by Hindu scholars. Some of these versions and commentaries have been lost or yet to be found.&lt;ref name=sptg/&gt; Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology.&lt;ref name=sptg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Maas (2013), A Concise Historiography of Classical Yoga Philosophy, in Periodization and Historiography of Indian Philosophy (Editor: Eli Franco), Sammlung de Nobili, Institut für Südasien-, Tibet- und Buddhismuskunde der Universität Wien, {{ISBN|978-3900271435}}, pages 53-90, {{oclc|858797956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD.

In Indian [[Timeline of Indian history#13th century|historical timeline]], marking with the [[Delhi Sultanate|arrival of Islam]] in India in twelfth century, further development and literature on Yoga philosophy of Hinduism went into decline.{{sfn|White|2014|pp=6-9}} By the sixteenth century, Patanjali's Yoga philosophy was nearly extinct.{{sfn|White|2014|pp=6-16}} Yoga was preserved by [[sadhu]]s (ascetics, [[sannyasa|sannyasi]]s) of India. Some of the Hindu yoga elements were adopted by [[Sufi]] sect of Muslims in India.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G.

[[File:St. Stephen the Martyr (Omaha), chapel window 2, Archangel Michael, detail.jpg|thumb|St. Michael in stained glass window by [[Franz Mayer &amp; Co.]]. [[Quis ut Deus?]] ('Who is like God?') is on his shield.]]
[[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]] is referenced in the [[Old Testament]] and has been part of Christian teachings since the earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John Norman. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' Continuum Publishing, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8264-5252-3}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] writings and traditions he acts as the defender of the Church, and chief opponent of [[Satan]]; and assists souls at the hour of death.

A widely used "[[Prayer to Saint Michael]]" was brought into official use by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1886 and was recommended by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1994. The feast day of the archangels Michael, [[Gabriel]], and Raphael is September 29.

==Angels and archangels==
[[File:Francesco Botticini - I tre Arcangeli e Tobias.jpg|thumb|240px|''Archangel Michael with archangels [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] and [[Gabriel]], as they accompany [[Book of Tobit|Tobias]]'', by [[Francesco Botticini]], 1470]]

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that: "The whole life of the church benefits from the mysterious and powerful help of the angels.... From its beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their watchful care and intercession."&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' David Bordwell, the Vatican, Continuum International Publishing, 2002 {{ISBN|0-86012-324-3}}, p.78, §§334–335&lt;/ref&gt; "Christ is the center of the angelic world. They are ''His'' angels....They belong to him because they were created through and for him."{{sfn|Catechism of the Catholic Church §331}}

Roman Catholic tradition calls Michael, [[Gabriel]] and [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] ''archangels''. The word archangel comes from the Greek words ''arche'' (prince) and ''angelos'' (messenger). Michael means "''Who is like God?''" (a rhetorical question), Gabriel means "''Power of God''" or "''Strong One of God''" and Raphael means "''God has healed''".&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Anne. ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' OSV Press 2003, {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael are named in the [[Bible]] as angels. (Roman Catholics accept as canonical, the [[Book of Tobit]], in which Raphael is named.) Only Michael is called an archangel in the Bible. The feast of these angels is celebrated on September 29.

Within the hierarchy of the angels, at the highest level, St. Michael is a princely [[seraph]],&lt;ref&gt;Stravinskas, Peter M. J., ''OSV's Catholic Encyclopedia'', OSV Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|0-87973-669-0}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt; an angel of supreme power and the leader of God's army.

Christian art often portrays archangels together. Archangels Michael and Gabriel are jointly depicted on [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]], a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] icon of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] that has been the subject of widespread Catholic devotions for centuries.

==In scripture==
Michael is mentioned by name five times in the Bible
* Daniel 10:13, Gabriel says, "...but the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood in my way for twenty-one days, until finally Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me."
* Daniel 10:21, "No one supports me against all these except Michael, your prince, standing as a reinforcement and a bulwark for me"
* Daniel 12:1, "At that time there shall arise Michael, the great prince, guardian of your people; It shall be a time unsurpassed in distress since nations began until that time."
* Jude 1:9, "Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him but said, 'May the Lord rebuke you!'"
* Revelation 12:7–9, "Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels battled against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back, but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent, 9 who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its angels were thrown down with it."

==Role and mission==
[[File:Guido Reni 031.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Guido Reni]]'s painting in [[Santa Maria della Concezione, Rome]], 1636 is also reproduced in mosaic at the ''St. Michael Altar'' in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], in the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm Baumgarten, Paul Maria. "Basilica of St. Peter." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 5 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Roman Catholicism Saint Michael has four distinct roles. First, he is the ''Enemy of Satan'' and the fallen angels. He defeated Satan and ejected him from Paradise and will achieve victory at the hour of the final battle with Satan. Secondly, he is the ''Christian angel of death'': at the hour of death, Saint Michael descends and gives each soul the chance to redeem itself before passing. Saint Michael's third role is ''weighing souls'' (hence the saint is often depicted holding scales) on Judgment Day. And finally, Saint Michael is the ''Guardian of the Church''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Boyle, Donna-Marie. ''Catholic Saints Prayer Book'' OSV Publishing, 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-285-9}} p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of Satan and the fallen angels===
Saint Michael is viewed as the commander of the [[Army of God (Bible)|Army of God]]. From the time of the apostles, he has been invoked and honored as the protector of the Church. Scripture describes him as "one of the chief princes" and the leader of heaven's forces in their triumph over the powers of hell.{{sfn|O'Boyle, p.60}}

Saint Michael defeats Satan two times, first when he ejects Satan from Paradise, and then in the final battle of the end times when the [[Antichrist]] will be defeated by him. Noted hagiographer [[Alban Butler]], defined the role of Saint Michael:"Who is like God?" was the cry of Archangel Michael when he smote the rebel Lucifer in the conflict of the heavenly hosts. And when Antichrist shall have set up his kingdom on earth, it is St Michael who will unfurl once more the standard of the cross, sound the last trumpet, bind together the false prophet and the beast and hurl them for all eternity into the burning pool.&lt;ref name="Alban Butler page 372"&gt;Butler, Alban. ''Lives of the Saints'', Forgotten Books {{ISBN|1-60506-312-6}} p.372&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Michael is the traditional prototype of the ''spiritual warrior'', a paradigm extended to other [[warrior saint]]s. This conflict against evil may at times be viewed as an interior battle. The concept of the warrior saint has extended to other Catholic saints, beginning with examples such as [[Saint George]] and Saint [[Theodore of Amasea]].&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Mirabai. ''Saint Michael: The Archangel'', Published by Sounds True, 2007 {{ISBN|1-59179-627-X}} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacopo vignali, san michele arcangelo libera le anime del purgatorio.jpg|thumb|220px|''Archangel Michael saving souls from purgatory'', by [[Jacopo Vignali]], 17th century]]

===At the hour of death===
Saint Michael is one of the angels presumed present at the hour of death. Traditionally, he is charged to assist the  dying and accompany their souls to their particular judgment, where he serves as an advocate.{{sfn|Johnson 2005, p.30}} Cemetery chapels are often dedicated to him, where masses are offered in his honor on behalf of the departed.{{sfn|Ball, pp.42, 425}}

===Weighing souls on Judgment Day===
[[File:Stift Rein - Bibliothek, Antiphonale Cisterciense, Miniatur Erzengel Michael.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''St. Michael weighing souls during the [[Last Judgement]]'', ''Antiphonale Cisterciense'' (15th century),  Abbey Bibliotheca, [[Rein Abbey, Austria]]]]
In Catholic tradition, on [[Judgment Day]] Saint Michael weighs souls based on their deeds during their life on earth. Saint Michael is often portrayed in art with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Mornin, Edward. ''Saints: A Visual Guide'', Frances Lincoln. 2006 {{ISBN|0-7112-2606-7}} p.18&lt;/ref&gt;
This role of Saint Michael was depicted by [[Michelangelo]] on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]. In this depiction, angels hold up two books: the smaller book held by Saint Michael records the names of the blessed, while the larger book is a list of the damned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm "Sistine Chapel", Vatican] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031746/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |date=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guardian of the Church===
The tradition of Michael as prince-protector of the Jewish people was adopted by the Christian Church.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w9CkldubfRAC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Devotion+to+Saint+Michael&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4VQ1VfDcM5WmyAS0oYDQBA&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Devotion%20to%20Saint%20Michael&amp;f=false Johnson, Richard Freeman. ''Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend'', Boydell Press, 2005] {{ISBN|9781843831280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Michael has long been recognized as the protector and guardian of the Church itself and the angel of the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. In a 2007 address [[Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] urged the bishops he was ordaining to take Michael as a model in making room in the world for God, countering denials of him and thus defending man's greatness, and in acting as "true [[guardian angels]]" of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20070929_episc-ordinations_en.html Vatican website, address of September 29, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Michael is also the guardian angel of the Pope and has been invoked as the patron and guardian angel of many countries as well as specific professions.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Alban. ''The lives of the fathers, martyrs, and other principal saints'', B. Dornin, 1821, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
McGrath, Michael. ''Patrons and Protectors'', Liturgy Training, 2001, {{ISBN|1-56854-109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultus==
"Of all the angels, Michael was by far the most important in the Middle Ages."&lt;ref name=Keck&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kq3QxWIbbdAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=saint+michael+archangel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwopLQr8fPAhWBPz4KHYa6BLQ4HhDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20michael%20archangel&amp;f=false Keck, David. ''Angels and Angelology in the Middle Ages'', Oxford University Press, Jul 23, 1998] {{ISBN|9780195354966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest indications of a cult of St. Michael occur in the ancient Near East. The emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] built the ''[[Michaelion]]'' at Chalcedon on the site of an earlier temple. Other sanctuaries were located at healing springs in Anatolia, Antioch, and Egypt. Identification of St Michael with the gift of healing can be seen in [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] leading a devotional procession in 590 when the city of Rome was afflicted with a plague that killed his predecessor. Gregory reportedly saw a vision of Saint Michael atop the Mausoleum of Hadrian. The archangel sheathed his sword, suggesting to the pope that the peril was ended. He subsequently renamed the Mausoleum ''[[Castel Sant'Angelo]]'' (Castle of the Holy Angel) in honor of St. Michael.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Connell, ''Society and individual in Renaissance'' University of California Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-520-23254-2}} page 418&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Visio Sancti Pauli'', written in the late fourth or early fifth century, presents St Michael as an advocate for sinners, guarantor of rain, and thus a patron of agriculture. The Greek, Syrian and Coptic Churches had venerated St. Michael since at least the early sixth century. The cult of St. Michael was widespread in the British Isles during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Richard Freeman. ''The Cult of Saint Michael the Archangel in Anglo-Saxon England'', Northwestern University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends include a number of reported appearances of Saint Michael, where sanctuaries or churches were later built or dedicated to him. These include [[Monte Gargano]] in Italy early in the 6th century, where the [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo]], the oldest shrine in Western Europe is dedicated to Saint Michael. Early in the 8th century, Saint Michael reportedly appeared three times to [[Aubert of Avranches|Saint Aubert]], the bishop of [[Avranches]]  in [[Normandy]], France and instructed him to build a church on the small island now known as [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. Several healings were reported when the church was being built and Mont Saint-Michel still remains a Catholic pilgrimage site.{{sfn|Johnson 2005, p.42}}&lt;ref&gt;Walsham, Alexandra. ''Angels in the early modern world'', Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-84332-4}} page 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Saint Michael as protector and guardian has also led to the design of statues that depict him and the construction of Churches and [[monasteries]] at specific locations. Because most monastic islands lie close to land, they were viewed as forts holding demons at a distance against attacks on the Church. Monasteries such as [[Mont Saint-Michel]] off the coast of [[Normandy]], France and [[Skellig Michael]], off the coast of [[County Kerry]], Ireland, dedicated to the Archangel are examples of these.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, William M., ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000, {{ISBN|1-57958-090-4}}, p.672&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable structure is that of [[St Michael's Mount]], located in Mounts Bay, near [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]] - a stunning island castle that resembles Mont Saint-Michel, and can only be reached on foot at low tide.

St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] recommended the invocation of Saint Michael at the time of temptation and sorrow: "Whenever any grievous temptation or vehement sorrow oppresses thee, invoke thy guardian, thy leader, cry out to him, and say, 'Lord, save us, lest we perish!'"&lt;ref name="Alban Butler page 372" /&gt;

St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was specially devoted to Saint Michael and would fast for about forty days from the [[Assumption of Mary|feast of the Assumption]] (August 15) to Saint Michael's feast day on September 29.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Regis. ''Francis of Assisi: early documents'' New City Press, 2000 {{ISBN|1-56548-112-7}} p.374&lt;/ref&gt; Some Franciscan communities continue to observe the period from August 15 to September 29 as "St. Michael's Lent", a time of fasting and prayer.

==Mentions in the Tridentine liturgy==
In editions of the [[Roman Missal]] before 1970, Saint Michael was mentioned in the [[Confiteor]] as recited by the priest and again in [[altar server]]'s response at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He was mentioned also in celebrations of [[Solemn Mass]] when the priest put incense in the thurible, reciting the prayer: ''Per intercessionem beati Michaelis Archangeli, stantis a dextris altaris incensi, et omnium electorum suorum, incensum istud dignetur Dominus benedicere, et in odorem suavitatis accipere. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen'' (Through the intercession of Blessed Michael the Archangel, standing at the right hand of the altar of incense, and of all his elect, may the Lord kindly bless this incense and accept it as a savour of sweetness).&lt;ref name=Missale&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal, with feasts updated to the late 1920s]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until [[Pope John XXIII]] revised it in 1960, the [[Tridentine Calendar|General Roman Calendar]] had not one but two feasts of Saint Michael, one on 29 September, the other on 8 May.&lt;ref name=Missale/&gt;

==Veneration==

===Patronage===
Michael the Archangel is the patron saint of grocers, mariners, paratroopers, police officers, and military members.

[[File:St. Michael's Church in Hammerfest.jpg|thumb|St. Michael's church in [[Hammerfest]], Norway, the northernmost Catholic church in the world]]
A large number of Roman Catholic churches around the globe are dedicated to Saint Michael, from [[Hammerfest]], Norway to [[Oeste Catarinense]] in Brazil. Saint Michael's feast day of September 29 has been solemnly celebrated in many locations since the fifth century. And many churches that honor Saint Michael are dedicated on the 29th of September, e.g., Pope [[Boniface&amp;nbsp;IV]] dedicated Saint Michael's Church in Rome, on that day in 610.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Alban. ''The lives of the fathers, martyrs, and other principal saints'', J. Duffy, 1866 p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devotions==
Devotions to Saint Michael have a large Catholic following, and a number of churches are dedicated to him worldwide.
Roman Catholic devotions to Saint Michael have been expressed in a variety of forms, including a [[Chaplet of St. Michael|chaplet]] and [[Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel|scapular]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13508b.htm Hilgers, Joseph. "Scapular." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of prayers, novenas and hymns are directed to him.

===Prayers===
[[Pope Leo XIII]] added a [[Prayer to Saint Michael]] to the [[Leonine Prayers]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Ecclesiastical Review'' 7 (1886), [https://archive.org/stream/s3p2irishecclesi07dubluoft#page/1050/mode/2up/search/1050 1050]&lt;/ref&gt; Although these prayers are no longer recited after [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as they were until 1964, [[Pope John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]] encouraged the Catholic faithful to continue to pray it, saying: "''I ask everyone not to forget it and to recite it to obtain help in the battle against forces of darkness''."&lt;ref&gt;John Paul II, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/angelus/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_reg_19940424_it.html Regina Coeli address] 24 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Like any other [[novena]], the [[Novenas to Saint Michael]] are prayed on nine consecutive days.

A prayer to St. Michael for protection is found in the [[Carmina Gadelica]], collected by [[Alexander Carmichael]] in the Gaelic-speaking regions of Scotland.

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}&lt;poem&gt;
O Michael of the Angels
and the righteousness in heaven,
Shield thou my soul 
 With the shade of thy sword.
Shield thou my soul
 On earth and in heaven.&lt;/poem&gt;
{{col-2}}&lt;poem&gt;
From foes upon earth,
From foes beneath earth, 
From foes in concealment, 
Protect and encircle
 My soul 'neath thy wing,
  O my soul with the shade of thy wing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/carminagadelicah30carm#page/148/mode/2up Carmichael, Alexander. ''Carmina Gadelica'', p.149, Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, 1940]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[File:StMichaelRosary.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[Chaplet of Saint Michael|Saint Michael Chaplet]] using beads like a [[rosary]]]]

===Chaplet===
The ''[[Chaplet of Saint Michael]]'' is a [[Chaplet (Prayer)|chaplet]] attributed to a [[private revelation]] by Saint Michael to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] nun [[Antónia d'Astónaco]] in 1751.
This chaplet was approved by [[Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;IX]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="Ann Ball page 123"&gt;Ann Ball, ''2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[EWTN]] [http://www.ewtn.com/devotionals/prayers/chaplet-of-st-michael.htm The Chaplet of St. Michael the Archangel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scapular===
The ''[[Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel]]'' is a [[RCTerm|Roman Catholic]] [[devotional scapular]] associated with [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]]. [[Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;IX]] gave to this scapular his blessing, but it was first formally approved under [[Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]] who sanctioned the Archconfraternity of the Scapular of Saint Michael.{{sfn|Ball, p.520}}
[[File:ArchangelCrivelli.jpg|thumb|110px|''St. Michael defeating Satan'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]], 15th century]]

===Exorcism===
A [[prayer to Saint Michael]] is included in the Rite of [[Exorcism in the Catholic Church|Exorcism]] in the [[Roman Ritual]], and was retained, in edited form, in the [[Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications|1999 revision of the rite]]. It was also at the [[Benedictine]] [[Metten Abbey]] dedicated to Saint Michael that the exorcism formula [[Vade Retro Satana]] was discovered in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kunzler, ''The Church's Liturgy'', Published by LIT Verlag 2001 {{ISBN|3-8258-4854-X}} page 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osb.org/gen/patterson/02origin.html Order of St. Benedict]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymns===
Through the centuries, Catholic devotions to Saint Michael have resulted in a number of poems and hymns.
&lt;ref&gt;George Wither, ''The hymns and songs of the church'' Published by J. R. Smith, 1856, page 248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Newman, ''Hymns'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-4097-1628-7}} page 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer, ''Selections from Ancient Irish Poetry'' 2007 {{ISBN|1-4086-3323-X}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the "Hymn to Archangel Michael":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O angel! Bear, O Michael of great miracles, To the Lord my plaint.&lt;br&gt;
Hearest thou? Ask of forgiving God Forgiveness of all my vast evil.&lt;br&gt;
Delay not! Carry my fervent prayer To the King, the great King!&lt;br&gt;
To my soul Bring help, bring comfort At the hour of its leaving earth.&lt;br&gt;
Stoutly To meet my expectant soul Come with many thousand angels!&lt;br&gt;
O Soldier! Against the crooked, wicked, militant world Come to my help in earnest!&lt;br&gt;
Do not Disdain what I say! As long as I live do not desert me!&lt;br&gt;
Thee I choose, That thou mayst save my soul, My mind, my sense, my body.&lt;br&gt;
O thou of goodly counsels, Victorious, triumphant one, Angelic slayer of Antichrist!{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hymn  "''[[Te Splendor]]''" to Saint Michael (which derives its name from the fact that in Latin it begins with ''Te splendor et virtus Patris'') is published in the [[Raccolta]] collection of prayers with indulgences.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Raccolta]] Collection of indulgenced prayers'' by T. Galli, authorized translation by Ambrose Saint John, Published by Burns and Lambert, London, 1857, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Saint Michael often portray the scene where Satan, or the fallen angels, are helpless below the sword or spear of a triumphant Saint Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Solrunn Nes, ''The mystical language of icons'', Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|0-8028-2916-3}}, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; In some depictions, the Latin phrase ''[[Quis ut Deus?]]'' can be seen on the shield of Saint Michael. The phrase means "''Who is like God?''" and Saint Michael asks it scornfully as he slays Satan, represented as a dragon, or a man-like figure, at times with wings.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm Holweck, Frederick. "St. Michael the Archangel." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elven, John. 1854, ''The book of family crests'' Henry Washbourne Publisher, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of the name Michael gave rise to the Latin phrase ''[[Quis ut Deus?]]'' which can be seen on his artistic portrayals of Michael defeating Satan.{{sfn|Ball, p.520}}

A '''spiritual test''', according to several [[religious tradition]]s, is a life situation, provided by [[God]], to evaluate man’s individual [[moral character]] and obedience to His laws.  Spiritual tests assess one’s virtue in many aspects of everyday life, individual conduct, particularly when no witnesses exist, and reflect the maturation of the character with regards to such [[moral imperative]]s as honesty, respect, and consideration for others.

== Overview ==
A spiritual agreement, [[pact]] or [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] is established between the individual believer and God.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} God tests the person's resolve in this covenant by giving that person physical, mental, emotional and spiritual difficulties to overcome. It is a common belief in many religions that God does not test humanity beyond their capacity to handle these tests, which are designed to check their full commitment to their own Faith.

== In religious books ==

=== Judaism ===
“For I command you today to love Yahuwah your Elohim, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and Yahuwah your Elohim will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.  But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Yarden to enter and possess. “(Devarim 30:15-18) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibletruth.cc/1Yochanan.htm#Those_Who_Practice_Righteousness_Are_Righteous&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
"It was there at Marah that the LORD set before them the following decree as a standard to test their faithfulness to him. He said, 'If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his sight, obeying his commands and keeping all his decrees, then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians; for I am the L ORD who heals you'" &lt;ref&gt;(Exodus 15:25-26, New Living Translation Bible).&lt;/ref&gt;

"No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it" (1 Corinthians:10:13, New Revised Standard Version).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucg.org/bible-study-lesson/bible-study-course-lesson-4-why-does-god-allow-suffering/importance-godly-character/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
“Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas reported that he asked the Messenger of Allah (SAW): “Which of the people are tested most severely?” Rasulullah (SAW) replied: “The Prophets, then the righteous, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them from the people. A man is tested according to his religious commitment. So, if his religious practice is sound, then his testing is increased, and if his religious practice is weak, then his testing is reduced. A servant continues to be tested until he walks the Earth without a single sin on him.” (Ahmad, Tirmidhi)

“Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now until He distinguishes the wicked from the good.” (Surah Al ‘Imrân 3:179, Quran)&lt;ref&gt;http://amuslimsistermaria200327.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/5-reasons-on-why-does-allah-test-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baha’i Faith ===
“The more one is severed from the world, from desires, from human affairs, and conditions, the more impervious does one become to the tests of God. Tests are a means by which a soul is measured as to its fitness, and proven out by its own acts. God knows its fitness beforehand, and also its unpreparedness, but man, with an ego, would not believe himself unfit unless proof were given him. Consequently his susceptibility to evil is proven to him when he falls into the tests, and the tests are continued until the soul realizes its own unfitness, then remorse and regret tend to root out the weakness.

The same test comes again in greater degree, until it is shown that a former weakness has become a strength, and the power to overcome evil has been established” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Getsinger | first =Dr. Edward C. | coauthors = | title =(pilgrim notes) | journal =Star of the West | volume =6 | issue =6 | pages =45 | date = June 24, 1915 | url =http://starofthewest.info/viewer.erb?vol=06&amp;page=45| accessdate = December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a means for spiritual growth ==

=== Baha’i Writing ===
“Thou hast written concerning the tests that have come upon thee. To the sincere ones, tests are as a gift from God, the Exalted, for a heroic person hasteneth, with the utmost joy and gladness, to the tests of a violent battlefield, but the coward is afraid and trembles and utters moaning and lamentation. Likewise, an expert student prepareth and memorizeth his lessons and exercises with the utmost effort, and in the day of examination he appeareth with infinite joy before the master. Likewise, the pure gold shineth radiantly in the fire of test. Consequently, it is made clear that for holy souls, trials are as the gift of God, the Exalted; but for weak souls they are an unexpected calamity. This test is just as thou hast written: it removeth the rust of egotism from the mirror of the heart until the Sun of Truth may shine therein. For, no veil is greater than egotism and no matter how thin that covering may be, yet it will finally veil man entirely and prevent him from receiving a portion from the eternal bounty.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Abdu'l-Bahá | first = | authorlink =`Abdu'l-Bahá | title =Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas | publisher =Bahá’í Publishing Committee | date = 1909 | pages =722–723 | url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-787.html.utf8#gr3 | isbn =}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sriramachakra''' (also called '''Sri Rama Chakra''', '''Ramachakra''', '''Rama Chakra''', or '''Ramar Chakra''') is a [[mysticism|mystic]] [[diagram]] or a [[yantra]] given in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[panchangam|almanac]]s as an instrument of [[astrology]] for predicting one's future. The geometrical diagram consists of a [[square]] divided into smaller squares by equal numbers of lines parallel to the sides of the square. Certain integers in well defined patterns  are written in the various smaller squares.   In some almanacs, for example, in the Panchangam published by the [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]]&lt;ref name=Sringeri&gt;{{cite book|title=Vijaya Samvatsara Vakya Panchanga 2012-13|date=2012|publisher=Sri Sharada Peertham|location=Sringeri|page=47|url=http://www.sringeri.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/panchangam-tamil-2013-14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Pnachangam published by [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Srirangam Temple]],&lt;ref name=Srirangam&gt;{{cite web|title=Srirangam Kovil Vakya Panchangam|url=http://srirangaminfo.com/vakya-panchangam-srirangam.php|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the diagram takes the form of a [[magic square]] of order 4 with certain special properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indira Narasingarao-Magic Square|url=http://www.magicsquarepuzzles.com/indira-narasingarao-magic-square.html|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebook&gt;{{cite book|author=Indira Narasinga Rao|title=Magic of magic squares|date=2007|publisher=Indira Publishers|location=Chennai|url=http://www.magicsquarepuzzles.com/ebook/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This magic square belongs to  a certain class of magic squares called '''strongly magic squares''' (or ''complete magic squares'') which has been so named and studied by  T V Padmakumar, an [[amateur]] [[mathematician]] from [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name=padma&gt;{{cite journal|author=T V Padmakumar|title=Strongly magic squares|journal=The [[Fibonacci Quarterly]]|date=August 1997|volume=35|issue=3|pages=198–205|url=http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/35-3/padmakumar.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-taught mathematician unravels the mysteries of magic squares|url=http://talent-kerala.net/previous/jul2002htm/10.htm|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nampoori&gt;{{cite web|author=V P N Nampoori|title=Hidden Structures of Indian Magic Square Sree Rama Cakra or Sri Rama Yantra -New Insight|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/17588172/502264724/name/auro5.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some almanacs, for example, in the [[Pambu Panchangam]], the diagram consists of an arrangement of 36 small squares in 6 rows and 6 columns in which the digits 1, 2, ..., 9  are written in that order from left to right starting from the top-left corner, repeating the digits in the same direction once the digit 9 is reached.&lt;ref name=Pambu&gt;{{cite book|title=Asal No. 28, Pambu Panchangam|date=2012|publisher=Manonmani Vilasam Press|location=Chennai|page=27|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/101102661/PAMBU-PANCHANGAM-2012-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another smaller mystic diagram, called '''Seetha Chakra''' given in Tamil almanacs. In some almanacs&lt;ref name=Sringeri/&gt;&lt;ref name=Srirangam/&gt; it is given as a [[magic square]] of order 3 whereas in some others&lt;ref name=Pambu/&gt; it is an arrangement of 9 small squares in 3 rows and 3 columns in which the digits 1, 2, .. 9 are written in that order column-wise from left to right.

These Chakras are used by the believers to predict the future. A believer takes a small flower, prays to God seeking divine directions and drops the flower randomly on a board containing an inscription of one of the Chakras. The number on which the flower falls is believed to give a broad indication of the future of the believer. For example, if the design is Sri Rama Chakra in the form of a magic square and the number on which the flower has fallen is 11 then the person can expect "victory in his/her future endeavors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Magic square|url=http://www.magicsquarepuzzles.com/philosophy-magic-square.html|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seetha Chakras===

==Sri Rama Chakra as a strongly magic square==
Let ''M'' be a magic square of order 4 and let it be represented by  matrix as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
M=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; a_{14} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp;a_{23} &amp; a_{24} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp;a_{33} &amp; a_{34} \\
a_{41} &amp; a_{42} &amp;a_{43} &amp; a_{44} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers that run diagonally in both directions, all add up to the number 34. ''M'' is called a '''strongly magic square''' if the following condition is satisfied:&lt;ref name=padma/&gt;

:For all ''m'', ''n'' such that 1 ≤ ''m'' ≤ 4, 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 4, we have
:&lt;math&gt;a_{m,n}+a_{m,n+1}+a_{m+1,n}+a_{m+1,n+1}=34&lt;/math&gt;,
:where it is assumed that if a subscript exceeds 4 it is replaced by 1 (wrapping around rows and columns).

For example in a strongly magic square ''M'' the following must be true.

:&lt;math&gt;a_{23}+a_{24}+a_{33}+a_{34} = 34 &lt;/math&gt; (taking ''m'' = 2, ''n'' = 3)
:&lt;math&gt;a_{24}+a_{21}+a_{34}+a_{31} = 34 &lt;/math&gt; (taking ''m'' = 2, ''n'' = 4)
:&lt;math&gt;a_{44}+a_{41}+a_{14}+a_{11} = 34 &lt;/math&gt; (taking ''m'' = 4, ''n'' = 4)

One can easily verify that the magic square represented by the Sri Rama Chakra is a strongly magic square.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8082">'''"The Centipede's Dilemma"''' is a short poem that has lent its name to a psychological effect called the '''centipede effect''' or '''centipede syndrome'''. The centipede effect occurs when a normally automatic or unconscious activity is disrupted by consciousness of it or reflection on it. For example, a golfer thinking too closely about her swing or someone thinking too much about how he knots his tie may find his performance of the task impaired. The effect is also known as '''hyper-reflection''' or '''Humphrey's law'''&lt;ref name=colman&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-953406-7|pages=120|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the English psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] (1889–1966), who propounded it in 1923. As he wrote of the poem, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us". The effect is the reverse of a [[solvitur ambulando]].

==The poem==
The poem, a short rhyme, is usually attributed to Katherine Craster (1841–1874)&lt;ref name="colman"/&gt; in ''Pinafore Poems'', 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|title=Psychologically Speaking: A Book of Quotations|year=1999|publisher=BPS Books|location=Leicester|isbn=978-1-85433-302-5|page=220|author2=Martlew, Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881 it had begun appearing in journals such as ''The Spectator''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Spectator|volume=54|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Living Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Littell|first1=Eliakim|last2=Littell|first2=Robert S.|work=The Living Age|volume=150|publisher=The Living Age Co. Inc.|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem later appeared in an article by British zoologist [[Ray Lankester|E.&amp;nbsp;Ray Lankester]], published in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on May 23, 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lankester|first=E.&amp;nbsp;Ray|title=Muybridge Photographs|journal=Nature|date=23 May 1889|pages=78–80|url=https://archive.org/stream/naturejournal40londuoft/naturejournal40londuoft_djvu.txt | volume=40|doi=10.1038/040078b0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which discussed the work of the photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in capturing the motion of animals: "For my own part," wrote Lankester, "I should greatly like to apply Mr. Muybridge's cameras, or a similar set of batteries, to the investigation of a phenomenon more puzzling even than that of 'the galloping horse'. I allude to the problem of 'the running centipede{{' "}}. Lankester finished the article on a fanciful note by imagining the "disastrous results in the way of perplexity" that could result from such an investigation, quoting the poem and mentioning that the author was unknown to him or to the friend who sent it to him. It has since been variously attributed to specific authors but without convincing evidence, and often appears under the title "The Centipede's Dilemma".

The version in the article is as follows:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg moves after which?"
:This raised her doubts to such a pitch,
:She fell exhausted in the ditch
:Not knowing how to run.

Another version of the Centipede's Dilemma:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg comes after which?"
:Which threw her mind in such a pitch,
:She laid bewildered in the ditch
:Considering how to run.

Modern versions of the poem often recast it in verse as a fable of a spider (or other protagonist) who found a clever way to avoid being eaten.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another rhyme goes:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

:A spider met a centipede while hurrying down the street,
:"How do you move at such a speed, with all so many feet?"
:"I do not have to contemplate to keep them all in line,
:But if I start to concentrate they're tangled all the time!"

==In psychology and philosophy==
The psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] referred to the tale in his 1923 book ''The Story of Man's Mind'':&lt;ref name=humphrey&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphrey|first=George|title=The Story of Man's Mind|year=1923|publisher=Small, Maynard and company|location=Boston|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work", he wrote. "If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled". He went on to recount the centipede's story, commenting, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us, for exactly the same thing happens if we pay conscious attention to any well-formed habit, such as walking". Thus, the eponymous "Humphrey's law" states that once performance of a task has become automatized, conscious thought about the task, while performing it, impairs performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roeckelein|first=Jon&amp;nbsp;E.|title=Dictionary of Theories, Laws, and Concepts in Psychology|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-30460-6|page=447|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas habit diminishes and then eliminates the attention required for routine tasks, this [[automaticity]] is disrupted by attention to a normally [[unconscious competence]].

The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] referred to the centipede effect in his book ''Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction'':&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl R.|editor-last=Notturno|editor-first=M.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcjnmyRhQwsC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=tLMilPiJvv&amp;dq=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11504-9|pages=116|edition=1st. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "if we have learnt certain movements so that they have sunk below the level of conscious control, then if we try to follow them consciously we very often interfere with them so badly that we stop them". He gives the example of the violinist [[Adolf Busch]] who was asked by fellow-violinist [[Bronisław Huberman]] how he played a certain passage of [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven's violin concerto]]. Busch told Huberman that it was quite simple—and then found that he could no longer play the passage.

The psychiatric psychoanalyst [[Theo L. Dorpat]] compares questions and interventions irrelevant to the patient's current thought process during [[psychotherapy]] in his book ''Gaslighting'' to "the story of the centipede who became disorganized and unable to walk after he was asked, 'What's wrong with your 34th left foot?'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorpat|first=Theo&amp;nbsp;L.|title=Gaslighting, the Double-Whammy, Interrogation and Other Methods of Convert Control in Psychotherapy &amp; Analysis|year=1996|publisher=Aronson|location=Northvale, New Jersey|isbn=978-1-568-21828-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

In 1903, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'' magazine printed an adaptation of the story by the Austrian author [[Gustav Meyrink]], "The Curse of The Toad" (''Der Fluch der Kröte''). The fable was also published in Meyrink's 1903 collection of tales, ''The Hot Soldier and Other Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Zipes|editor-first=Jack|title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860115-9|page=318|edition=1st published.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spider Robinson]]'s short story "The Centipede's Dilemma" concerns a psychic who uses instinctive telekinetic powers to cheat at darts, and is foiled when another character triggers hyper-reflection in him.

Churches address the [[theology|theological]] implications raised by creationism and evolution in different ways. 

==Evolution==
Most contemporary Christian leaders and scholars from many mainstream churches, such as [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and some [[Lutheran]] [[List of Lutheran denominations|denominations]], reject reading the Bible as though it could shed light on the physics of creation instead of the spiritual meaning of creation. According to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]], "[for] most of the history of Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic]] Church now explicitly accepts the theory of evolution,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[John Paul II]] address here [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; (albeit with most conservatives and [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalists]] within the Church in dissent), as do [[Anglican]] scholars such as [[John Polkinghorne]], arguing that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier examples of this attitude include [[Frederick Temple]], [[Asa Gray]] and [[Charles Kingsley]], who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories on publication,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]'s ''Science and Theology'' pp6-7&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and [[geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], who saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories.

[[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]] assumes that Genesis is a poetic work, and that just as human understanding of God increases gradually over time, so does the understanding of his creation. In fact, both Jews and Christians have been considering the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation narrative as an allegory]] (instead of an historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. Two notable examples are [[Saint Augustine]] (4th century) who, on theological grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, (and not in seven days as a plain account of Genesis would require)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, "THE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF AUGUSTINE'S VIEW OF CREATION"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214012715/http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html |date=2006-02-14 }} (From: [[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] 40.1:42-45 (3/1988)), The [[American Scientific Affiliation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1st century Jewish scholar [[Philo of Alexandria]], who wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html ''The Works of Philo Judaeus'', Chapter 2], translated by [[Charles Duke Yonge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Liturgical year}}
A '''triduum''' (plural: ''tridua'') is a religious observance lasting three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15041c.htm John Wynne, "Triduum" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1912)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known example today is the [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[Paschal Triduum]] (the three days from the evening of [[Maundy Thursday]] to [[Easter|Easter Sunday]]). Other liturgical tridua celebrated in [[Western Christianity]] include the [[Rogation Days]] and the feasts of [[Christmas]], Easter and [[Pentecost]] together with the first two days of their [[Octave (liturgy)|octave]]s, while in [[Eastern Christianity]] (both [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]]) the analogues of festive tridua take the form of a major feasts followed by an associated [[Synaxis]]. The most publicly celebrated examples are the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] together with its eve and the following day dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]], and the [[Christmas|Nativity feast]] with [[Christmas Eve]] and the Synaxis of [[Theotokos]]. 

Ecclesiastical approval has been granted for tridua in honour of the [[Trinity]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Saint Joseph]].

Many other tridua are celebrated on occasions such as when children are in preparation for their first Communion; among pupils at the beginning of the school year; among seminarians at the same time; and in religious communities for those who are to renew their vows yearly or every six months.

[[Image:Metal type.svg|thumb|right|200px|Diagram of a cast metal [[Sort (typesetting)|sort]].]]
'''Typesetting''' is the composition of [[Written language|text]] by means of arranging physical [[Sort (typesetting)|types]]&lt;ref name="typesetting random house dictionary definition"&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 23 December 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typeset Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called [[sort (typesetting)|sorts]] in mechanical systems and [[glyphs]] in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's [[orthography]] for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more [[font]]s (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for [[typeface]]s). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A., ''The Library: An Illustrated History'', ALA edition, Skyhorse, 2009, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-digital era==

===Manual typesetting===
{{Main|Movable type}}
During much of the [[Letterpress printing|letterpress era]], movable type was composed by hand for each [[page (paper)|page]]. Cast metal ''[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]'' were composed into words, then lines, then paragraphs, then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a ''form'', with all letter faces exactly the same "height to paper", creating an even surface of type. The form was placed in a press, inked, and an impression made on paper.

During typesetting, individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand, and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right, and as viewed by the setter upside down. As seen in the photo of the composing stick, a lower case 'q' looks like a 'd', a lower case 'b' looks like a 'p', a lower case 'p' looks like a 'b' and a lower case 'd' looks like a 'q'. This is reputed to be the origin of the expression "mind your p's and q's". It might just as easily have been "mind your b's and d's".

The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort: '''a''' face, '''b''' body or shank, '''c''' point size, '''1''' shoulder, '''2''' nick, '''3''' groove, '''4''' foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. Not shown, and more the concern of the casterman, is the “set”, or width of each sort. Set width, like body size, is measured in points.

In order to extend the working life of type, and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyping]], the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as [[plaster of Paris]] or [[papier mâché]] called a [[flong]] to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of [[type metal]].

Advances such as the [[typewriter]] and [[computer]] would push the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and [[letterpress]] printing have not fallen completely out of use, and since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a revival as an [[artisanal]] pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.

===Hot metal typesetting===
{{main|Hot metal typesetting}}
The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting. While some, such as the [[Paige compositor]], met with limited success, by the end of the 19th century, several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text. Most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used, hence are termed "hot metal" typesetting. The [[Linotype machine]], invented in 1884, used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices, and cast an entire line of type at a time (hence its name). In the [[Monotype System]], a keyboard was used to [[Punched tape|punch a paper tape]], which was then fed to control a casting machine. The [[Ludlow Typograph]] involved hand-set matrices, but otherwise used hot metal. By the early 20th century, the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses.

===Phototypesetting===
{{Main|Phototypesetting}}
[[Image:Linotype CRTronic 360.jpg|thumb|200px|Linotype CRTronic 360 phototypesetting terminal]]
[[Phototypesetting|Phototypesetting or "cold type"]] systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips (one per font) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were connected to computer front ends.

One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a [[punched tape|punched paper tape]] corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative [[film]]. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a [[Galley proof|galley]].  The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or [[paste up]] of a whole page.  A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make [[Printing plate|plate]]s for [[offset printing]].

==Digital era==
[[File:Door toename automatisering in krantenbedrijf verdwijnt het oude zettersvak Weeknummer, 77-14 - Open Beelden - 13160.ogv|thumb|Dutch newsreel from 1977 about the transition to computer typesetting]]
The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a [[cathode ray tube]]. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA351 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; IBM 2680 (1967), [[Information International, Inc.|I.I.I.]] VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA352 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Linotron 202 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/en/49-14026/19731989.html Linotype History]&lt;/ref&gt; These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be "driven online" by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives.

&lt;/ref&gt; Character-by-character, computer-aided [[phototypesetting]] was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a [[raster image processor]] to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] an entire page to a single high-resolution [[digital image]], now known as imagesetting.

The first commercially successful laser imagesetter, able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, [[Compugraphic]] (later purchased by [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]]) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own.

Early [[minicomputer]]-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[Datalogics]] Pager, Penta, [[Atex (software)|Atex]], Miles 33, Xyvision, troff from [[Bell Labs]], and IBM's [[IBM SCRIPT|Script]] product with CRT terminals, were better able to drive these electromechanical devices, and used text [[markup language]]s to describe [[typeface|type]] and other page formatting information. The descendants of these text markup languages include [[SGML]], [[XML]] and [[HTML]].

The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and [[signature]]s of 4, 8, 16 or more pages using [[imposition]] software on devices such as the Israeli-made [[Scitex]] Dolev. The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters, often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device, drove development of generalized printer control languages, such as [[Adobe Systems]]' [[PostScript]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

[[Image:Oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png|thumb|right|200px|Text sample (an extract of the essay ''The Renaissance of English Art'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]) typeset in [[Iowan Old Style]] roman, italics and small caps, adjusted to approximately 10 [[Line length|words per line]], with the typeface sized at 14 [[point (typography)|points]] on 1.4 x [[leading]], with 0.2 points extra [[tracking (typography)|tracking]].]]

Computerized typesetting was so rare that ''[[BYTE]]'' (comparing itself to "the proverbial shoemaker's children who went barefoot") did not use any computers in production until its August 1979 issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout. The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks, but hoped to do so "as matters progress".&lt;ref name="helmers197908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Helmers |first=Carl |date=August 1979 |title=Notes on the Appearance of BYTE... |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1979-08/1979_08_BYTE_04-08_LISP#page/n157/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1980s, practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest, where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.

In 1985, [[desktop publishing]] became available, starting with the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] (and later [[QuarkXPress]]) and [[PostScript]]. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] and [[WordPerfect]], revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (''H and J'').

By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists.

The availability of cheap or free [[font]]s made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier, but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of [[PostScript]], supplemented by the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computers and operating systems.

===SCRIPT variants===
{{Main|SCRIPT (markup)}}
[[Image:John A Prior Health Sciences Library Mural Typesetter.jpg|thumb|Mural mosaic "Typesetter" at John A. Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio]]
IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word "SCRIPT". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, [[Column (typography)|multicolumn]] page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utk.edu/~mnewman/ibmguide07.html U01-0547, "Introduction to SCRIPT,"] is available through PRTDOC.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP-67/CMS SCRIPT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html SCRIPT 90.1 Implementation Guide], June 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html CSG.uwaterloo.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project development in 1974. The program was first used at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/1974.shtml A Chronology of Computing at The University of Waterloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter, which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT:

a) It easily handles footnotes.

b) Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals, and can appear at the top or bottom of the page, in the centre, on the left or on the right, or on the left for even-numbered pages and on the right for odd-numbered pages.

c) Underscoring or overstriking can be made a function of SCRIPT, thus uncomplicating editor functions.

d) SCRIPT files are regular OS datasets or CMS files.

e) Output can be obtained on the printer, or at the terminal…" 
The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents, though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs.  Thus, SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/ChronologyGlossary.pdf Glossary of University of Waterloo Computing Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SCRIPT/VS]] was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the 1980s.

DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS-DOS, called after its author, D. D. Williams,&lt;ref&gt;DWScript – Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM.

Script is still available from IBM as part of the [[Document Composition Facility]] for the [[z/OS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/printsoftware/dcfhome_z_ww.html IBM Document Composition Facility (DCF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SGML and XML systems===
The standard generalized markup language ([[SGML]]) was based upon IBM [[Generalized Markup Language]] (GML). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script. [[Document Style Semantics and Specification Language|DSSSL]] is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents.

[[XML]] is a successor of SGML. [[XSL Formatting Objects|XSL-FO]] is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files.

The arrival of [[SGML]]/[[XML]] as the document model made other typesetting engines popular.

Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's [[XML Professional Publisher (XPP)]], [[FrameMaker]], [[Arbortext]]. XSL-FO compatible engines include [[Apache FOP]], [[Antenna House Formatter]], [[RenderX]]'s [[XEP (software)|XEP]].
These products allow users to program their SGML/XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages.

YesLogic's [[Prince XML|Prince]] is another one, which is based on CSS Paged Media.

===Troff and successors===
{{Main|Troff}}
During the mid-1970s, [[Joseph Ossanna]], working at [[Bell Laboratories]], wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T [[phototypesetter]] owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by [[Brian Kernighan]] to support output to different equipment, such as [[laser printer]]s. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a [[GNU]] work-alike called [[groff (software)|groff]], are now [[open source]].

===TeX and LaTeX===
[[Image:AMS Euler sample.png|right|200px|thumb|Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS [[Euler font]].]]
{{Main|TeX}}
The [[TeX]] system, developed by [[Donald E. Knuth]] at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. [[LuaTeX]] and LuaLaTeX are variants of [[TeX]] and of [[LaTeX]] scriptable in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].  TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own, and deals more with appearance than structure. The [[LaTeX]] macro package written by [[Leslie Lamport]] at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface, and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document. LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books. Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort, there are programs that do. These programs include [[Scientific Workplace]], [[Texmacs|TeXmacs]], [[MiKTeX]] and [[LyX]], which are graphical/interactive editors.

==Other text formatters==
Several other text formatting software exist, but are not widely used. Notably  [[Lout (software)|Lout]], [http://patoline.org/ Patoline], [http://sile-typesetter.org Sile], [https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/ Pollen], [http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/systems/ant/ Ant]

'''Villa Saint Martin''' is a centre in [[Ignatian spirituality]] run by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It was the first residential spirituality centre in Canada. It was founded in 1913 and opened by the [[Archbishop of Montreal]], [[Paul Bruchési]]. It is situated in the east of [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]] next to [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|Saint-Laurent]] in Montreal on the shore of the [[Rivière des Prairies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealretreats.org/index.php?page=retreatcentres.inc.php Montreal Retreats] retrieved 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
The first residential retreat in Canada happened in 1910 in [[Boucherville]] and was organized by Fr. Joseph Archambeault. Three years later a retreat house was purchased in [[L'Abord-à-Plouffe, Quebec|L'Abord-à-Plouffe]]. It was within the parish of [[Saint-Martin, Laval, Quebec|Saint-Martin]] in [[Laval, Quebec]], which is why the centre became dedicated to Saint Martin.&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

On 2 November 1913, the Villa Saint Martin was opened by the [[Archbishop of Montreal]], [[Paul Bruchési]]. Following the opening, the first retreat at the centre was led by Fr. Ruhlmann SJ and accompanied by the [[Archbishop of Winnipeg]], Arthur Alfred Sinnott and the [[Apostolic Nunciature in Ottawa|Apostolic Delegate to Canada]], Peregrine Stagni.&lt;ref name=villa&gt;[http://www.villasaintmartin.org/notre-histoire_63&amp;78 Notre Histoire] from VillaSaintMartin.org, retrieved 2 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of retreatants at the centre increased every year until [[World War II]]. After the end of the war, the house's main benefactor, who paid for its construction, Mr. Édouard Gohier financially struggled in the post-war economic collapse.&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

===New site===
In 1951, the current building for the centre was bought. It was originally built in 1900. The house was officially opened as a retreat house on 21 June 1953 by the [[Archbishop of Montreal]], [[Paul-Émile Léger]].&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the program of activities at the centre was expanded. The centre moved away from traditional weekend retreats for parish groups. More activity was focussed on married couples, and evening sessions were introduced. In the 1970s [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] groups started at the centre. In 1995, six- and eight-day retreats for smaller groups with personal spiritual directors were started. In 2001, more ecumenical projects were launched.&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

==Overview==
Retreats at the villa are based on the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]]. A variety of retreats are offered, from the entire 30-day retreat to ones based on art, themed retreats, and retreats in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villasaintmartin.org/activities_64 Activities] from VillaSaintMartin.org, retrieved 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese chair and armrest.jpg|thumb|Traditional Japanese chair with a zabuton and a separate armrest]]
A '''''zabuton''''' ({{lang|ja|座布団}}, [[Help:IPA for Japanese|[d͡za̠bɯ̟ᵝtõ̞ɴ]]]) is a Japanese [[cushion]] for sitting. The ''zabuton'' is generally used when sitting on the floor and may also be used when sitting on a chair. In a more casual setting, the ''zabuton'' can be used in conjunction with a ''[[zaisu]]'', a type of Japanese legless chair, with or without an accompanying {{nihongo|''kyousoku''|脇息}}, a Japanese-style armrest. Ordinarily, any place in Japan where seating is on the floor will be provided with ''zabuton'' for sitting comfort. A typical ''zabuton'' measures 50–70&amp;nbsp;cm (20–30 inches) square and is several centimetres thick when new.

Zabuton are found throughout Japan and enter many aspects of the culture.
*In [[Zen]] meditation, practitioners sit on ''[[zafu]]'', which is typically placed on top of a ''zabuton''. The ''zabuton'' cushions the knees and ankles.
*In [[sumo]], members of the audience throw ''zabuton'' toward the ring after the upset of a ''[[Yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' by a lower-ranked wrestler, despite the dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/3227869/Japan-bans-cushion-throwing-at-sumo-tournament.html|title=Japan bans cushion throwing at sumo tournament|first=Julian|last=Ryall|location=Tokyo|work=The Telegraph|date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[rakugo]]'', performers are not allowed to rise from their ''zabuton'' for the duration of their skit.
*In ''[[Yose (performance)|yose]]'', notably on the long-running television show ''[[Shōten]]'', comedians receive ''zabuton'' as a form of scoring.
*In ''[[jidaigeki]]'', according to a stereotype, the boss prisoner in a jail cell receives all the ''zabuton'' from his or her cell mates.
