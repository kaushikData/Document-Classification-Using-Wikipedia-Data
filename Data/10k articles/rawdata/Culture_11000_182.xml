The '''American Laboratory Theatre''' was an American [[drama school]] and [[theatrical company]] located in [[New York City]] that existed during the 1920s and 1930s.  It was a publicly subsidized, student-subscription organization that held fund-raising campaigns to support itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/05/04/94136924.pdf | title=Laboratory Theatre Exhibits Work. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 4, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time012030"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,738463,00.html | title=The Theatre: Revivals | magazine=Time | date=January 20, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
The school itself was known as the '''Theatre Arts Institute'''.&lt;ref name="nyt093029"/&gt; It was founded in 1923 by former [[Moscow Art Theatre]] members [[Richard Boleslavsky]] and [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] and stressed [[Stanislavski's system]] as its teaching method.&lt;ref name="enc-ox-thea"&gt;{{cite book | last= | first= | chapter= | editor-last=Hartnoll | editor-first=Phyllis | editor2-last=Found | editor2-first=Peter  | title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre  | publisher=Oxford University Press | location= | year=1992 | edition=2nd | isbn= | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide-camb-thea"/&gt;  Students were taught to be uninhibited, with exercises such as acting as a fish under water, a melting ice cream cone, or (for women) the mother of a sick child praying to the Madonna.&lt;ref name="mahoney"/&gt;  Both actors and directors were trained, and Boleslavsky and Ouspenskaya became known as the leading promulgators of Stanislavski's ideas in America.&lt;ref name="enc-ox-thea"/&gt;  

Some five hundred students were trained at the school during its years of existence.&lt;ref name="spolin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spolin.com/ny-vs-chic.html |title=New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears |publisher=The Spolin Center |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311131627/http://www.spolin.com/ny-vs-chic.html |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These included [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Harold Clurman]], and [[Stella Adler]], all of whom would go on to exert a great influence on American acting.&lt;ref name="enc-ox-thea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spolin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2004/04/26/nr_hrc-2/ | title=Ransom Center acquires Stella Adler archive | publisher=University of Texas | date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future critic [[Francis Fergusson]] was also a student.&lt;ref name="spolin"/&gt;  [[Lenore LaFount]] started an acting career after her time at the school, but would soon marry [[George W. Romney]] and later become First Lady of Michigan and a political candidate in her own right (and the mother of businessman and politician [[Mitt Romney]]).&lt;ref name="mahoney"/&gt;  

The school gave theatrical productions from 1925 to 1930.&lt;ref name="guide-camb-thea"&gt;{{cite book | last= | first= | chapter= | editor-last=Stanton | editor-first=Sarah | editor2-last=Banham | editor2-first=Martin  | title=Cambridge Paperback Guide To Theatre  | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location= | year=1996 | edition= | | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatively small in size, it aimed for a high-brow audience.&lt;ref name="time012030"/&gt;  Its productions included well-known works by [[William Shakespeare]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[Anton Chekhov]],&lt;ref name="mahoney"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mahoney | first=Tom | title=The Story of George Romney: Builder, Salesman, Crusader  | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | | year=1960 | | pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also included well-regarded instantiations of modern and avant-garde works such as [[Jean-Jacques Bernard]]'s ''Martine'' and [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s ''The Bridal Veil''.&lt;ref name="enc-ox-thea"/&gt;  Talent scouts for radio and film attended the school's performances.&lt;ref name="mahoney"/&gt;

In 1929, [[Maria Germanova]] succeeded Boleslavsky as director of the theatre; she was also from the Moscow Art Theatre.&lt;ref name="nyt093029"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/09/30/94184185.pdf | title=To Succeed Boleslavsky. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 30, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lab, as it was sometimes known, disbanded in 1933, but was an important and influential link between Stanislavski's Moscow company and the even more influential [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] of New York that followed it during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="guide-camb-thea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spolin"/&gt;

'''Amish furniture''' is [[furniture]] manufactured by the [[Amish]], primarily of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]]. It is generally known as being made completely out of wood, usually without [[particle board]] or laminate. The styles most often used by the Amish woodworkers are generally more [[Furniture Style|traditional]] in nature.

== History ==
Amish furniture first gained attention in the 1920s, when early American folk art was "discovered", and dealers and historians placed great value upon the beauty and quality of the pieces. Many different styles of Amish furniture emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/F88ME.html | title=Furniture and Woodworking| work=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online| date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jonestown School began in the late 18th century in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania]]. The Jonestown School is most widely known for painted blanket chests decorated with flowers on three panels. Examples of these chests are on display at both the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Museum]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.
	
Another distinctive style of Amish furniture is the Soap Hollow School, developed in Soap Hollow, Pennsylvania. These pieces are often brightly painted in red, gold, and black. [[Henry Lapp]] was a furniture maker based in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], and it is his designs that most closely resemble the furniture we think of today as Amish-made. He was one of the first to abandon the painted, Germanic-style influence in his furniture and opted for an undecorated, plain style, following more the styles of Welsh furniture making of the time. The order book he offered to his customers contained watercolor paintings of his pieces and is now in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. The record price for American folk-painted furniture was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 1986. It was a tall case clock made in 1801 by Johannes Spitler that sold for $203,500.

Because [[Amish|Amish beliefs]] prevent the use of electricity, many [[woodworking]] tools in Amish shops are powered by hydraulic and pneumatic power that is run on diesel compressors. Most communities permit some technology, and allowances can be made in the case of woodworking, as the craft often supports multiple families within the community.

Great attention is paid to the details of the wood in the furniture-making process. Each piece of wood is hand-selected to match the specific furniture in mind. Attention is paid to the grain of the wood, both in gluing pieces together and in achieving the desired look of the finished piece. Amish furniture is also valued for its [[sustainability]] and is considered a "green" product. The Amish woodworkers pride themselves in their work and view their products as both pieces of art and furnishings to be used and lived in for generations.

==Styles==
Amish furniture is made in many different styles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/difference-between-shaker-mission-furniture-101985.html|title=What Is the Difference Between Shaker and Mission Furniture?|last=|first=|date=|work=SFGate.com|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission]] and [[Shaker furniture|Shaker]] styles share a few characteristics. Mission is characterized by straight lines and exposed joinery. It is often considered to be clean and modern in design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.arts-crafts.com/archive/achomes/mission-style.shtml | title=Mission Style Design for theBungalow| work=The Arts &amp; Crafts Society | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaker style is plain, yet elegant and has a very simple and basic design aimed at functionality and durability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.furniturefashion.com/characteristics_of_shaker_furniture/ | title=Characteristics of Shaker Furniture| work=Furniture Fashion| date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Queen Anne furniture|Queen Anne style]] is in direct contrast to the Mission and Shaker styles. It is considered traditional, with ornate moldings, unique foot details, and carved ornamentation. Other styles available include Southwestern, Rustic, Cottage, Country, Quaker, and Beachfront.
	
Amish furniture-making is often a skill passed through many generations. Most Amish children rarely attend school beyond eighth grade, often to help out at home, or in the shops. Many families become known for their specific design details and niches. Some woodworkers focus only on outdoor furniture, others on pieces for the living room or bedroom. No piece of furniture is ever identical to another because of the care taken to select the wood. The grain is different on every piece of wood, and the craftsmen often try to highlight the features of each individual piece.

==Technology==
During the second half of the 19th century, Grand Rapids became a major lumbering center, processing timber harvested in the region. By the end of the century, it was established as the premier furniture-manufacturing city of the United States. For this reason it was nicknamed “Furniture City”. After an international exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, Grand Rapids became recognized worldwide as a leader in the production of fine furniture.

A furniture-makers’ guild was established in 1931 to improve the design and craftsmanship of Grand Rapids furniture. National home furnishing markets were held in Grand Rapids for about 75 years, concluding in the 1960s. By that time, the furniture-making industry shifted to North Carolina.

Much of Grand Rapids furniture has now been outsourced to Asia. In that time, Amish builders have acquired much of the old machinery once used. However, because Amish beliefs prevent the use of electricity, many woodworking tools in Amish shops are powered by hydraulic and pneumatic power that is run on diesel compressors.

In recent years, the Amish furniture market has expanded to include online sales. The Amish craftsmen, because of their beliefs, are prohibited from running the websites. Non-Amish retailers often attend Amish furniture expositions in Ohio and Indiana to see Amish furniture on display and meet the craftsmen behind the pieces. Relationships are often developed, and the retailer becomes the middleman between the simple life of the Amish woodworker and the modern buyer.

Amish furniture is now available to a wider market and to those who may not be in close proximity to an Amish woodworking shop. It is no longer necessary to visit a retail location to select the unique wood and stain combination desired; this can all be done on the [[Internet]], and there are dozens of different wood, stain, and upholstery options to choose from. The finished furniture is shipped directly from the stain shop to the consumer.

==Wood options==
Amish furniture is made with a variety of quality [[Hardwood|hardwoods]] including [[northern red oak]], [[Quarter Sawing|quarter-sawn]] [[white oak]], [[cherry]], [[maple]], [[beech]], [[elm]], [[mahogany]], [[walnut]], [[hickory]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]], and [[pine]]. Northern red oak is a very popular choice for American consumers for its warmth, color, and durability. It is typically grown in Eastern U.S., particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. White oak is slightly harder than red oak and can be cut to show more ray fleck. The antique look of white oak makes it ideal for [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission]] and [[Shaker furniture|Shaker]] styles. Cherry has a light reddish-brown color that will darken  with light exposure. Maple wood offers a spectrum of beauty from different angles. It is significantly harder than oak and is growing in popularity because of its beauty. American beech is white with a red tinge and bends readily when steamed. Elm ranges in color from nearly white to brown with a red tinge and is fairly stiff and heavy. Mahogany is typically used in high-class furnishings because of its attractive finish. As mahogany matures its color varies from yellowish or pinkish to deep red or brown. Walnut is heavy, hard, and stiff and ranges in color from nearly white in the [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] to dark brown in the heartwood. Walnut holds stain, paint, and polish well.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=Wood, Stain Options|url=http://www.onlineamishfurniture.com/Wood-Stain-Options_c_166.html|website=www.onlineamishfurniture.com|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickory is harder than oak and distinguished by extreme contrasts of light and dark colors. Hickory’s sapwood is a creamy white while hickory’s heartwood is a red, pink or reddish-brown color and often referred to as red hickory.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Hickory Wood|url=http://www.dutchcrafters.com/collection/732/Characteristics-of-Hickory-Wood|website=www.DutchCrafters.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cedar has a deep rosy glow and stripes of light golden sapwood.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=Cedar Wood|url=http://www.dutchcrafters.com/collection/1015/Cedar-Wood|website=www.DutchCrafters.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern white pine is a soft wood. It tends to have more knots than a hardwood and can yellow with age.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=Pine Wood|url=http://www.dutchcrafters.com/collection/68/pine-wood-furniture|website=www.DutchCrafters.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candaulism''' is a [[paraphilia|sexual practice]] or [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] in which a man exposes his female partner, or images of her, to other people for their [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] [[pleasure]].

The term may also be applied to the practice of undressing or otherwise exposing a female partner to others, or urging or forcing her to engage in sexual relations with a third person, such as during a [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] activity. Similarly, the term may also be applied to the posting of personal images of a female partner on the internet or urging or forcing her to wear clothing which reveals her physical attractiveness to others, such as by wearing very brief clothing, such as a [[microskirt]], [[tight-fitting clothing|tight-fitting]] or [[see-through clothing]] or a low-cut top.

== History of the term ==
The term is derived from ancient King [[Candaules]] who conceived a plot to show his unaware naked wife to his servant [[Gyges of Lydia]]. After discovering Gyges while he was watching her naked, Candaules' wife ordered him to choose between killing himself or killing her husband in order to repair the vicious mischief.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Gide]], ''Le roi Candaule'' (1901)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hebbel, ''Gyges und sein Ring''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Hdt.+1.8&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 Book 1.8]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first defined by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his book: ''Psychopathia sexualis. Eine klinisch-forensische Studie'' (Stuttgart: Enke 1886).&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his book: ''Psychopathia sexualis. Eine klinisch-forensische Studie'' (Stuttgart: Enke 1886).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology ==
[[Isidor Sadger]] hypothesized that the candaulist completely identifies with his partner's body, and deep in his mind is showing himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Bornean, ''Lexicon der Liebe'' (Hannibal, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Candaulism is also associated with [[voyeurism]] and [[exhibitionism]]. An alternative definition proposes it as a practice involving one person observing, often from concealment, two others having sexual relations.

==Historical instances==
The case of [[Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet|Sir Richard Worsley]], against George Bissett for "[[criminal conversation]]"—that is, adultery with [[Seymour Dorothy Fleming|Lady Worsley]]—revealed an incident in which Sir Richard had assisted Bissett to spy on Lady Worsley taking a bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rubenhold | first=Hallie | authorlink=Hallie Rubenhold | title=Lady Worsley's Whim | place=London | publisher=Vintage Books | isbn=978-0-7011-7980-9 | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collector and connoisseur [[Charles Saatchi]] has considered the influence of candaulism upon the work of [[Salvador Dali]], citing episodes recorded by the artist's biographers in which Dali's wife [[Gala Dali|Gala]] was displayed to other men.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Standard'', 21 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The notorious American [[FBI]] agent caught for having spied for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as the [[Russian Federation]], [[Robert Hanssen#Personal life|Robert Hanssen]], took explicit photographs of his wife and sent them to a friend. Later Hanssen invited his friend to clandestinely observe Hanssen having sex with Hanssen's wife during the friend's occasional visits to the Hanssen household. Initially, his friend watched through a window from outside the house. Later, Hanssen appropriated video equipment from the FBI to set up [[closed-circuit television]] to allow his friend to watch from his guest bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=252–253}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|author=Adrian Havill|work=Court TV (now [[TruTV]])|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/spies/hanssen/2.html|title=Robert Philip Hanssen: The Spy who Stayed out in The Cold|accessdate=6 February 2007}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rf-web.tamu.edu/security/security%20guide/Spystory/Hanssen.htm |title=Hanssen: Deep Inner Conflicts |publisher=Texas A&amp;M Research Foundation |accessdate=4 Nov 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203014913/http://rf-web.tamu.edu/security/Security%20Guide/Spystory/Hanssen.htm# |archive-date=2010-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanssen also posted sexually explicit stories to the Internet crafted to allow readers who knew the Hanssens to identify them, also without his wife's knowledge.

==In literature==
{{unreferenced section|date = August 2017}}
Candaulism is a theme of ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', the cycle of novels by [[Anthony Powell]]. A key scene in the penultimate volume, ''[[Temporary Kings]]'', is set in a Venetian palazzo under a ceiling on which [[Tiepolo]] has depicted King Candaules allowing his wife to be seen naked by Gyges. The theme of [[voyeurism]] runs through the sequence of novels including a scene in which the recurring character [[Kenneth Widmerpool]] watches his wife with a lover.

In the ''[[Book of Esther]]'' the King orders Queen Vashti to appear before his guests wearing her crown and she refuses.  Some commentators have taken this to mean her crown ''and nothing else'', which if accurate would place this story as an example.

[[Image:Jupiter Tonans.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the supreme [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of the sky.]]
The '''Capitoline Triad''' was a group of three deities who were worshipped in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] in an elaborate temple on [[Rome]]'s [[Capitoline Hill]] ([[Latin]] ''Capitolium''). It comprised [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]. The triad held a central place in the public religion of Rome.&lt;ref name="Ryberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryberg |first1=Inez Scott |title=Was the Capitoline Triad Etruscan or Italic? |journal=The American Journal of Philology |date=1931 |pages=145–156 |doi=10.2307/290109 |jstor=290109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Triad==
[[Image:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Capitoline Triad – Museum of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]]]]
The three deities who are most commonly referred to as the "Capitoline Triad" are [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king of the gods; [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (in her aspect as ''Iuno Regina'', "Queen Juno"), his wife and sister; and Jupiter's daughter [[Minerva]], the goddess of wisdom. This grouping of a male god and two goddesses was highly unusual in ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religions]], and is almost certainly derived from the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] trio of [[Tinia]], the supreme deity, [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], his wife, and [[Menrva]], their daughter and the goddess of wisdom. In some interpretations, this group replaced an original [[Archaic Triad]].&lt;ref name="Ryberg" /&gt;

===Capitolium===
{{See also|Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|l1=Temple of Jupiter}}
Jupiter, Juno and Minerva were honored in [[Roman temple|temples]] known as ''Capitolia'', which were built on hills and other prominent areas in many cities in Italy and the [[Roman province|provinces]], particularly during the [[Augustus|Augustan]] and [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] periods. Most had a triple ''[[cella]]''. The earliest known example of a Capitolium outside of Italy was at Emporion (now [[Empúries]], Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Blagg, T.F.C. (1990). "The temple at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] ([[Aquae Sulis]]) in the context of classical temples in the western European provinces" (pp. 426&amp;ndash;427). ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 3 (pp. 419&amp;ndash;430).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ovid]], [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] also had a place there, since he had a shrine there before it was built and, as the god of boundary stones, refused to yield.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Fasti 2.667–676: "What happened when the new Capitol was being built? Why, the whole company of gods withdrew before Jupiter and made room for him; but Terminus, as the ancients relate, remained where he was found in the shrine, and shares the temple with great Jupiter. Even to this day there is a small hole in the roof of the temple, that he may see naught above him but the stars. From that abide in that station in which thou hast been placed. Yield not an inch to a neighbour, though he ask thee, lest thou shouldst seem to value man above Jupiter."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word ''Capitolium'' (pl. ''Capitolia'') could be used to refer to any temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad, it referred especially to the temple on the Capitoline Hill in Rome known as ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]] [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Iovis Optimi Maximi Capitolini]]'' ("Temple of Jupiter Best and Greatest on the Capitoline"). The temple was built under the reign of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the last [[Roman Kingdom|King of Rome]] prior to the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]]. Although the temple was shared by Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, each deity had a separate ''cella'', with Juno Regina on the left, Minerva on the right, and Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the middle. It included a podium and a [[tetrastyle]] (four column) [[pronaos]] (porch).&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Duncan (1987). "Seneca and the Temple of Divus Claudius" (pp. 253&amp;ndash;254). ''Britannia'' 22 (pp. 137&amp;ndash;141).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another shrine (''[[sacellum]]'') dedicated to Jupiter, Juno Regina and Minerva was the [[Capitolium Vetus]] on the [[Quirinal Hill]]. It was thought to be older than the more famous temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, and was still a landmark in [[Martial]]'s time, in the late 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, L. (1992). ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (p. 70). Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4300-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Career Transition For Dancers''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago helping dancers establish new careers when they have retired from their performing careers. Founded in 1985, the organization has provided over 46,000 hours of individual and group career counseling, with a dollar value of over $4 million, and awarded over $3 million in educational and entrepreneurial support.  The organization has 4,600 active dancer-clients and has helped dancers in 47 states with their transitions through mobile National Outreach Projects.&lt;ref name="cleveland.broadwayworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleveland.broadwayworld.com/article/Career_Transition_For_Dancers_Presents_Their_National_Outreach_Project_911_20100819 |title=Career Transition For Dancers Presents Their National Outreach Project 9/11 |publisher=Cleveland.broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1982, several foundations and unions including the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the AFL-CIO Labor Institute for Human Enrichment and the [[Actors' Equity Association]], led by [[Agnes de Mille]], granted funding for a conference to discuss the need to assist dancers both during and at the end of their careers.

The conference took place on June 8, 1982 and was led by Project Director Edward Weston, Chairman Richard E. LeBlond, Jr., and Honorary Chairman Agnes de Mille.  Exploring the trauma professional dancers face both during and at the end of their careers, the main goal of the conference was to consider how to better assist dancers with moving into new professions that would make use of their backgrounds, talents and skills. By the end of the conference it had been agreed that it was critical for dancers to begin exploring alternative careers at the beginning of their dance training and performing careers.&lt;ref name="chicagoartistsresource.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/dance/node/27165 |title=Career Transition for Dancers |publisher=Chicago Artists Resource |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, nonprofit organization Career Transition For Dancers, Inc. was established in New York City with money from [[Actors' Equity Association]], the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachelle Depalma |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/nyregion/retired-dancers-get-advice.html |title=Retired Dancers Get Advice |location=Great Britain |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1985-12-15 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Career Transition For Dancers is the only organization in the United States dedicated solely to the enrichment of dancers' post-performing years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nystatearts.org/aso/one?org_id=3152&amp;search_type=discipline&amp;discipline=Dance&amp;page=1&amp;offset=0 |title=Career Transition for Dancers &amp;#124; NEW YORK STATE ARTS - Culture Guide &amp; Calendar |publisher=Nystatearts.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caroline Newhouse ===
Caroline Newhouse (1910–2003), an artist and arts philanthropist, served on the Board of Career Transition For Dancers as Director Emerita, establishing The Caroline H. Newhouse Scholarship Fund as well as The Caroline &amp; Theodore Newhouse Center for Dancers with an endowed gift of $1 million during her tenure.  Ms. Newhouse, an artist herself, always felt a special bond with dancers, who often served as models for her artwork. "While you sculpt, you talk, and they told me how hard they have to work in order to perform," she said. "There is no time for them to do anything except dance, dance, dance. And at 29, the body doesn't react anymore as it did when you were 19."  Ms. Newhouse's love for dance was also shared by her husband, Theodore Newhouse, who helped establish the Newhouse communications company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploredance.com/article.htm?id=993&amp;s=author&amp;sid=1894 |title=CAROLINE H. NEWHOUSE: Inspiration for Career Transition For Dancers |publisher=Exploredance.com |date=2003-04-27 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company owns Condé-Nast Publications, which has been a long-time supporter of the organization and is currently one of the organization's annual gala underwriters, along with the Samuel I.

[[File:The Charlotte Medal - 1788.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charlotte Medal]]

The '''Charlotte Medal''' is a [[silver]] [[medallion]] {{convert|74|mm}} wide, depicting the voyage of the ''[[Charlotte (1784 ship)|Charlotte]]'', with the [[First Fleet]], to [[Botany Bay]], Australia. Its [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts a scene of the ship and its reverse is inscribed with a description of the journey. The medal is said to be the first work of Australian [[Australian art#Colonial art .281770.E2.80.931900.29|colonial art]].&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/exhibition_overview/arriving |title=Arriving |publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]] |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
During the journey the Charlotte visited [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Whilst at anchor, one of the ship's convicts, a [[forger]] and [[mutiny|mutineer]]&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt; by the name of Thomas Barrett was caught giving locals fake coins made from buckles, buttons and spoons. The [[Surgeon-general]] of the Fleet, [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] was impressed with his skill in making these forgeries, without having the apparent means to do so. This led him to commission Barrett to make the medal, to commemorate the journey, possibly from the surgeon's silver [[kidney dish]].&lt;ref name=JournalOfAVoyage&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/setis/id/p00092 |title=Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with sixty-five plates of nondescript animals, birds, lizards, serpents, curious cones of trees and other natural productions |author=White, John |work=|pages=44–45 |publisher=University of Sydney Library |year=1790 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created in the style of a [[Touch piece]].&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;

==Inscriptions==
The obverse of the medal depicts the ''Charlotte'' at anchor at night in Botany Bay. The inscription reads {{quote|The Charlotte at anchor in Botany Bay Jan'y &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.20.1788&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum/&gt;}}

The reverse of the medal is inscribed with a journal of the voyage. It reads {{quote|Sailed the Charlotte of [[London]] from [[Spithead|Spit head]] the 13 of May 1787. Bound for Botany Bay in th Island of [[New Holland (Australia)|new holland]] arriv,d at [[Tenerife|Teneriff]] &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;4 of June in Lat 28 13 N Long 16 23 W depart,d it 10 D', arriv,d at rio janeiro 6 of Aug in Lat 22,54 S Long 42,38 W, depart,d it the 5 of Sep' arriv,d at the [[Cape of good hope]] the 14 Oct' in Lat 34 29 S Long 18 29 E depart,d it &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;13 of Nov' and made the [[South East Cape|South Cape]] of New Holland the 8 of Jan 4 1788 in Lat 43,32 S Long 146,56 E arrivd at Botany Bay the 20 of Jun' the Charlotte in C&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in Lat 34.00 South Long 151.00 East distance from [[Great Britain|great Britan]] Miles 13106&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum/&gt;}}

==Owners and ANMM purchase==
It is unknown who owned the medal after White. It is possible that he presented it with his voyage findings, or it stayed with his family after his death, but at some point before 1919 it came into the possession of [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Victoria]] and [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Prince Louis]].&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.perthmint.com.au/2013/12/05/what-is-the-charlotte-medal-and-why-is-it-of-such-immense-significance-to-australia/ |title=What is the Charlotte medal and why is it of such immense significance to Australia? |author=Coin Collector Blog |publisher=The Perth Mint Australia |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 it was sold via [[Sotheby's|Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge]] to a British [[numismatist]], Henry Baldwin.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine&gt;{{Citation |last =Hosty |first =Kieran  |title =The Charlotte Medal |magazine =Signals: Quarterly Magazine of The Australian National Maritime Museum |pages =10–15  |date =September–November 2008 |url =http://emuseum.anmm.gov.au/media/full/00045213%20Signals%20article.pdf |accessdate =17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 it was sold to an American numismatist, John J Ford.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;

In 1981 it was sold to a [[Melbourne]] dentist, Dr John Chapman, for $15,000 at Spink Sydney Auction. Dr Chapman donated a medal containing a reproduction of the Charlotte Medal to [[Museum Victoria]] to mark its [[Australian Bicentenary|bicentennial]], in 1988.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCreport&gt;{{cite AV media |people =John Chapman, Tracee Hutchison |title =The 7.30 Report &amp;ndash; Historical medals and coins go under the hammer |medium =Television production |publisher =[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location =Melbourne, Australia |date =10 July 2008 |url =http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2008/s2300524.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NumismatistJournal&gt;{{cite journal |last =Chapman |first =John |title =The Solution of the Charlotte Enigma |journal =Journal of the Numismatic Association of Australia |volume =9 |pages =28–33 |date =1998 |url =http://www.loonyrobot.com/naa-online.com/pdfjournal/Vol9/Vol%209%20Article%204.pdf |accessdate =17 September 2014 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140918052905/http://www.loonyrobot.com/naa-online.com/pdfjournal/Vol9/Vol%209%20Article%204.pdf |archivedate =18 September 2014 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BicentennialMedal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/273157/medal-bicentenary-of-the-charlotte-medal-1788-1988-dr-john-chapman-caulfield-south-victoria-australia-1988 |title=Medal &amp;ndash; Bicentenary of the Charlotte Medal 1788&amp;ndash;1988, Dr John Chapman, Caulfield South, Victoria, Australia, 1988 |publisher=Museum Victoria |year=1987 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], with funds from the [[Australian Heritage Council|National Cultural Heritage]] Account, authorised through the Australian Government, won an auction for the medal with a bid of $750,000.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal/&gt; The final price was $873,750, with $200,000 of NCH funding&lt;ref name=AusGovernmentReport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/PMCH_Review_report_final_for_web.doc&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=rsIZVJymK6Sy7AbUnoGACw&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAHOAo&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXxEeEDAJ3vh1nHzxZIxmYVicbyw |title=Review of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 and Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Regulations 1987 &amp;ndash; Report of public consultation |author=Cultural Property Section |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |date=2009 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013004/http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/PMCH_Review_report_final_for_web.doc%26rct%3Dj%26frm%3D1%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26sa%3DU%26ei%3DrsIZVJymK6Sy7AbUnoGACw%26ved%3D0CDMQFjAHOAo%26usg%3DAFQjCNHXxEeEDAJ3vh1nHzxZIxmYVicbyw# |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it possible that, despite its age, the medal has only been sold four times.

==Copper medal==
A smaller [[copper]] medallion, with a diameter of {{convert|47|mm}}, was created at the same time. The medal was made for White's personal servant, William Broughton and omits the ship scene, being inscribed simply with an abridged version of the journey.&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal/&gt; The medallion was uncovered during house restoration in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=NumismatistJournal/&gt; It has been suggested that this medal should "rank as equal in rarity and significance" as its silver counterpart.&lt;ref name=CopperMedalAuction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noble.com.au/auctions/lot/?id=308954 |title=Lot 740 &amp;ndash; Aust.

The expression '''collective behavior''' was first used by [[Franklin Henry Giddings]] (1908) and employed later by [[Robert E. Park]] (1921), [[Herbert Blumer]] (1939), Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1957), and Neil Smelser (1962) to refer to social processes and events which do not reflect existing [[social structure]] ([[laws]], conventions, and [[institutions]]), but which emerge in a "spontaneous" way. Use of the term has been expanded to include reference to cells, social animals like birds and fish, and insects including [[ants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Deborah M.|title=The Ecology of Collective Behavior|journal=PLoS Biol|date=11 March 2014|volume=12|issue=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001805|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001805|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective behavior takes many forms but generally violates societal norms (Miller 2000, Locher 2002). Collective behavior can be tremendously destructive, as with riots or mob violence, silly, as with fads, or anywhere in between. Collective behavior is always driven by group dynamics, encouraging people to engage in acts they might consider unthinkable under typical social circumstances (Locher 2002).

==Defining the field==

Turner and Killian (1957) were the first sociologists to back their theoretical propositions with visual evidence in the form of photographs and motion pictures of collective behavior in action. Prior to that sociologists relied heavily upon eyewitness accounts, which turned out to be far less reliable than one would hope.

Turner and Killian's approach is based largely upon the arguments of Blumer, who argued that social "forces" are not really forces. The actor is active:  He creates an interpretation of the acts of others, and acts on the basis of this interpretation.

== Examples ==

Here are some instances of collective behavior: the Los Angeles riot of 1992, the hula-hoop fad of 1958, the stock market crashes of 1929, and the "phantom gasser" episodes in Virginia in 1933-34 and Mattoon, IL in 1944 (Locher 2002, Miller 2000).  The claim that such diverse episodes all belong to a single field of inquiry is a theoretical assertion, and not all sociologists would agree with it.  But Blumer and [[Neil Smelser]] did agree, as did others, indicating that the formulation has satisfied some leading sociological thinkers.

===Four forms===

Although there are several other schema that may be used to classify forms of collective behavior the following four categories from Blumer (1939) are generally considered useful by most sociologists.

====The crowd====
Scholars differ about what classes of social events fall under the rubric of collective behavior.  In fact, the only class of events which all authors include is crowds.  Clark McPhail is one of those who treats crowds and collective behavior as synonyms.  Although some consider McPhail's work overly simplistic (Locher 2002), his important contribution is to have gone beyond the speculations of others to carry out pioneering empirical studies of crowds.  He finds them to form an elaborate set of types.

The classic treatment of crowds is [[Gustave LeBon]], ''The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind'' (1896), in which the author interpreted the crowds of the French Revolution as irrational reversions to animal emotion, and inferred from this that such reversion is characteristic of crowds in general.  LeBon believed that crowds somehow induced people to lose their ability to think rationally and to somehow recover this ability once they had left the crowd. He speculated, but could not explain how this might occur.  [[Freud]] expressed a similar view in ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1922).  Such authors have thought that their ideas were confirmed by various kinds of crowds, one of these being the [[economic bubble]].  In Holland, during the [[tulip mania]] (1637), the prices of tulip bulbs rose to astronomical heights.  An array of such crazes and other historical oddities is narrated in Charles MacKay's ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'' (1841).

At the [[University of Chicago]], Robert Park and Herbert Blumer agreed with the speculations of LeBon and other that crowds are indeed emotional.  But to them a crowd is capable of any emotion, not only the negative ones of anger and fear.

A number of authors modify the common-sense notion of the crowd to include episodes during which the participants are not assembled in one place but are dispersed over a large area.  Turner and Killian refer to such episodes as ''diffuse'' crowds, examples being [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals, panics about sexual perils, witch hunts and Red scares.  Their expanded definition of the crowd is justified if propositions which hold true among compact crowds do so for diffuse crowds as well.

Some psychologists have claimed that there are three fundamental human emotions: fear, joy, and anger.  Neil Smelser, John Lofland, and others have proposed three corresponding forms of the crowd: the panic (an expression of fear), the craze (an expression of joy), and the hostile outburst (an expression of anger).  Each of the three emotions can characterize either a ''compact'' or a ''diffuse'' crowd, the result being a scheme of six types of crowds.  Lofland has offered the most explicit discussion of these types.

====The public====

Boom distinguishes the '''crowd''', which expresses a ''common emotion'', from a '''public''', which  discusses a ''single issue''.  Thus, a public is not equivalent to all of the members of a society.  Obviously, this is not the usual use of the word, "public."  To Park and Blumer, there are as many publics as there are issues.  A public comes into being when discussion of an issue begins, and ceases to be when it reaches a decision on it.

====The mass====

To the crowd and the public Blumer adds a third form of collective behavior, the '''mass.''' It differs from both the crowd and the public in that it is defined not by a form of interaction but by the efforts of those who use the mass media to address an audience.  The first mass medium was printing.

====The social movement====
{{Main|Social movement}}
We change intellectual gears when we confront Blumer's final form of collective behavior, the social movement. He identifies several types of these, among which are ''active'' social movements such as the French Revolution and ''expressive'' ones such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  An active movement tries to change society; an expressive one tries to change its own members.

The social movement is the form of collective behavior which satisfies least well the first definition of it which was offered at the beginning of this article.  These episodes are less fluid than the other forms, and do not change as often as other forms do.  Furthermore, as can be seen in the history of the labor movement and many religious sects, a social movement may begin as collective behavior but over time become firmly established as a social institution.

For this reason, social movements are often considered a separate field of sociology.  The books and articles about them are far more numerous than the sum of studies of all the other forms of collective behavior put together.  Social movements are considered in many Wikipedia articles, and an article on the field of social movements as a whole would be much longer than this essay.

The study of collective behavior spun its wheels for many years, but began to make progress with the appearance of Turner and Killian's "Collective Behavior" (1957) and Smelser's ''Theory of Collective Behavior'' (1962). Both books pushed the topic of collective behavior back into the consciousness of American sociologists and both theories contributed immensely to our understanding of collective behavior (Locher 2002, Miller 2000).  Social disturbances in the U. S. and elsewhere in the late '60s and early '70s inspired another surge of interest in crowds and social movements.  These studies presented a number of challenges to the armchair sociology of earlier students of collective behavior.

== Theories developed to explain ==

Social scientists have developed theories to explain crowd behavior.

#'''Contagion Theory''' - the Contagion Theory was formulated by [[Gustave Le Bon]]. According to Le Bon crowds exert a hypnotic influence over their members. Shielded by their anonymity, large numbers of people abandon personal responsibility and surrender to the contagious emotions of the crowd. A crowd thus assumes a life of its own, stirring up emotions and driving people toward irrational, even violent action (LeBon 1895). Le Bon's Theory, although one of the earliest explanations of crowd behavior, is still accepted by many people outside of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Castellano, C.; Fortunato, S., &amp; Loreto, V. (2009). Statistical physics of social dynamics. Rev Mod Phys 81(2): 591–646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D. (2012). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048596 Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction]. PLoS ONE 7(10): e48596. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048596&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D., &amp; de Aguiar, M. A. (2017). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177970 Voting contagion: Modeling and analysis of a century of U.S. presidential elections]. PLoS ONE 12(5): e0177970. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177970&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argue that the "collective mind" has not been documented by systematic studies. Furthermore, although collective behavior may involve strong emotions, such feelings are not necessarily irrational. Turner and Killian (1957) argue convincingly that the "contagion" never actually occurs and participants in collective behavior do not lose their ability to think rationally.
#'''Convergence Theory''' - whereas the Contagion Theory states that crowds cause people to act in a certain way, Convergence theory states that people who want to act in  a certain way come together to form crowds. Developed by Floyd Allport (1924) and later expanded upon by Neil Miller and John Dollard (1941) as "Learning Theory," the central argument of all convergence theories is that collective behavior reveals the otherwise hidden tendencies of the individuals who take part in the episode. It asserts that people with similar attributes find other like-minded persons with whom they can release these underlying tendencies. People sometimes do things in a crowd that they would not have the courage to do alone because crowds can diffuse responsibility but the behavior itself is claimed to originate within the individuals. Crowds, in addition, can intensify a sentiment simply by creating a critical mass of like-minded people.
#'''Emergent-Norm Theory''' - according to [[Ralph Turner (sociologist)|Ralph Turner]] and [[Lewis Killian]] (1957), crowds begin as collectivities composed of people with mixed interests and motives. Especially in the case of less stable crowds—expressive, acting and protest crowds—norms may be vague and changing, as when one person decides to break the glass windows of a store and others join in and begin looting merchandise. When people find themselves in a situation that is vague, ambiguous, or confusing new norms "emerge" on the spot and people follow those emergent norms, which may be at odds with normal social behavior. Turner and Killian further argue that there are several different categories of participants, all of whom follow different patterns of behavior due to their differing motivations.
#'''Value-added Theory''' - Neil Smelser (1962) argues that collective behavior is actually a sort of release valve for built-up tension ("strain") within the social system, community, or group. If the proper determinants are present then collective behavior becomes inevitable. Conversely, if any of the key determinants are not present no collective behavior will occur unless and until the missing determinants fall into place. These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.
#'''Complex Adaptive Systems theory''' - Dutch scholar [[Jaap van Ginneken]] claims that contagion, convergence and emergent norms are just instances of the synergy, emergence and autopoiesis or self-creation of patterns and new entities typical for the newly discovered meta-category of complex adaptive systems. This also helps explain the key role of salient details and path-dependence in rapid shifts.

'''Cotton Mather'''{{pronunciation-needed}} {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (February 12, 1663&amp;nbsp;– February 13, 1728; A.B. 1678, [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]; A.M. 1681, honorary doctorate 1710, [[University of Glasgow]]) was a socially and politically influential [[History of New England|New England]] [[Puritan]] minister, prolific author, and [[pamphleteer]]. He left a scientific legacy due to his [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] experiments and his promotion of [[inoculation]] for disease prevention, though he is most frequently remembered today for his involvement in the [[Salem witch trials]]. He was subsequently denied the presidency of Harvard College which his father, [[Increase Mather]], had held.

==Life and work==
[[File:Richard Mather.png|thumb|right|100px|Richard Mather]]
[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|right|100px|thumb|John Cotton (1585–1652)]]
Mather was born in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, the son of Maria (née Cotton) and [[Increase Mather]], and grandson of both [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and [[Richard Mather]], all also prominent Puritan ministers. Mather was named after his maternal grandfather John Cotton. He attended [[Boston Latin School]], where his name was posthumously added to its [[Boston Latin School#Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]], and graduated from Harvard in 1678 at age 15. After completing his post-graduate work, he joined his father as assistant pastor of Boston's original [[Second Church, Boston|North Church]] (not to be confused with the Anglican/Episcopal [[Old North Church]] of [[Paul Revere]] fame). In 1685, Mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church.&lt;ref name="Sibley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sibley|first=John Langdon|date=1885|title=Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Volume III|url=https://archive.org/details/sibleysharvardgr03sibl|location=Cambridge|publisher=Charles William Sever, University Bookstore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

Mather wrote more than 450 books and pamphlets, and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in America. He set the moral tone in the colonies, and sounded the call for second- and third-generation Puritans to return to the [[Theology|theological]] roots of [[Puritan]]ism, whose parents had left [[England]] for the [[New England]] colonies of [[North America]]. The most important of these was ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'' (1702) which comprises seven distinct books, many of which depict biographical and historical narratives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Increase Mather grave.jpg|thumb|right|The Mather tomb in [[Copp's Hill Burying Ground|Copp's Hill Cemetery]]]]

Mather influenced early American science. In 1716, he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] because of observations of corn varieties. This observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend James Petiver:&lt;ref&gt;Zirkle 1935, p. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015011424788;seq=129;view=1up;num=104 104]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |First: my Friend planted a Row of Indian corn that was Coloured Red and Blue; the rest of the Field being planted with corn of the yellow, which is the most usual color. To the Windward side, this Red and Blue Row, so infected Three or Four whole Rows, as to communicate the same Colour unto them; and part of ye Fifth and some of ye Sixth. But to the Leeward Side, no less than Seven or Eight Rows, had ye same Colour communicated unto them; and some small Impressions were made on those that were yet further off.&lt;ref&gt;Zirkle 1935, p. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015011424788;seq=129;view=1up;num=105 105]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1713, Mather's wife, newborn twins, and two-year-old daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hostetter|first=Margaret Kendrick|title=What We Don't See|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=April 5, 2012|volume=366|pages=1328–34|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1111421|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1111421|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was twice widowed, and only two of his 15 children survived him; he died on the day after his 65th birthday and was buried on [[Copp's Hill]], near [[Old North Church]].&lt;ref name="Sibley"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

===Boyle's influence on Mather===
[[Robert Boyle]] was a huge influence throughout Mather's career. He read Boyle's ''The Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy'' closely throughout the 1680s, and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it, using almost identical language to Boyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Robert Middlekauff|last=Middlekauff|first=Robert|title=The Mathers: Three Generations of Puritan Intellectuals, 1596–1728|place=Los Angeles, CA|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

===Increase Mather===
Mather's relationship with his father [[Increase Mather]] is thought by some to have been strained and difficult. Increase was a pastor of the [[Second Church, Boston|North Square Church]] and president of [[Harvard College]]; he led an accomplished life. Despite Cotton's efforts, he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father. He did surpass his father's output as a writer, writing more than 400 books. One of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials, which Increase Mather reportedly did not support.&lt;ref&gt;Hovey, pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yale College===
Cotton Mather helped convince [[Elihu Yale]] to make a donation to a new college in New Haven which became [[Yale College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v27.n28/story3.html|title=Profile|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=December 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408195809/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v27.n28/story3.html|archivedate=April 8, 2009|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salem witch trials of 1692, the Mather influence==
===Pre-trials===
In 1689, Mather published ''Memorable Providences'' detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the Goodwin family in Boston. Catholic washerwoman [[Ann Glover|Goody Glover]] was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mather|first=Cotton|title=Memorable Providences|year=1689|publisher=Joseph Brunning|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mather had a prominent role in this case. Besides praying for the children, which also included fasting and meditation, he would also observe and record their activities. The children were subject to hysterical fits, which he detailed in ''Memorable Providences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werking|first=Richard H|date=1972|title="Reformation Is Our Only Preservation": Cotton Mather and Salem Witchcraft|url=|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=29|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Mather argued that since there are witches and devils, there are "immortal souls."

[[Robert Calef]] was a contemporary of Mather and critical of him, and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the [[Salem witch trials]] three years later: 

{{quote|Mr Cotton Mather, was the most active and forward of any Minister in the Country in those matters, taking home one of the Children, and managing such Intreagues with that Child, and after printing such an account of the whole, in his Memorable Providences, as conduced much to the kindling of those Flames, that in Sir Williams time threatened the devouring of this Country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Calef|first=Robert|title=More Wonders of the Invisible World|year=1700|publisher=Nath Hillar on London Bridge|location=London, UK|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nineteenth-century historian [[Charles Wentworth Upham]] shared the view that the afflicted in Salem were imitating the Goodwin children, but he put the blame on both Cotton and his father [[Increase Mather]]: 

{{quote|They are answerable… more than almost any other men have been, for the opinions of their time. It was, indeed a superstitious age; but made much more so by their operations, influence, and writings, beginning with Increase Mather's movement, at the assembly of Ministers, in 1681, and ending with Cotton Mather's dealings with the Goodwin children, and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide. For this reason, then in the first place, I hold those two men responsible for what is called 'Salem Witchcraft'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Upham|first=Charles Wentworth|date=September 1869|title=Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nrMTAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdid=book-nrMTAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdot=1|magazine=The Historical Magazine and Notes and Queries Concerning the Antiquities, History and Biography of America|series=Second|volume=VI|number=3|page=140|location=Morrisania, NY|publisher=Henry B. Dawson|accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

===The court===
Mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning. Sir [[William Phips]], governor of the newly chartered [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], appointed his lieutenant governor, [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts, where he presided over the witch trials. According to George Bancroft, Mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular Stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under Phips through the intervention of Mather's own politically powerful father, Increase. "Intercession had been made by Cotton Mather for the advancement of Stoughton, a man of cold affections, proud, self-willed and covetous of distinction."{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874–1878|p=83}} Apparently Mather saw in Stoughton, a bachelor who had never wed, an ally for church-related matters. Bancroft quotes Mather's reaction to Stoughton's appointment as follows:

{{quote|"The time for a favor is come", exulted Cotton Mather; "Yea, the set time is come."{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874–1878|p=84}}}}

Mather claimed not to have attended the trials in Salem (although his father attended the trial of [[George Burroughs]]). His contemporaries Calef and [[Thomas Brattle]] place him at the executions (see below). Mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end: "If in the midst of the many Dissatisfaction among us, the publication of these Trials may promote such a pious Thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall Re-joyce that God is Glorified." Mather called himself a historian not an advocate but, according to one modern writer, his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling Martha Carrier "a rampant hag". Mather referred to George Burroughs&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs was a Harvard alumnus who survived Indian attacks in [[Maine]]. He was an unordained minister hanged the same day as Martha Carrier, John Proctor, George Jacobs, and John Willard&lt;/ref&gt; as a "very puny man" whose "tergiversations, contradictions, and falsehoods" made his testimony not "worth considering".&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Schiff. "The Witches of Salem: Diabolical doings in a Puritan village", ''The New Yorker'', September 7, 2015, pp. 46-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

===Caution on the use of spectral evidence===
The afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant, invisible to any but themselves, was tormenting them; this was considered evidence of witchcraft, despite the defendant's denial and profession of strongly held Christian beliefs. On May 31, 1692, Mather wrote to one of the judges, [[John Richards (colonial judge)|John Richards]], a member of his congregation,{{Sfn|Upham|1869}}{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} expressing his support of the prosecutions, but cautioning; "do not lay more stress on pure [[spectral evidence]] than it will bear … It is very certain that the Devils have sometimes represented the Shapes of persons not only innocent, but also very virtuous. Though I believe that the just God then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused."&lt;ref name="silverman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Letters|first=Cotton|last=Mather|editor-first=Kenneth|editor-last=Silverman|year=1971|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|place=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|isbn=0-8071-0920-7|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion on the matter was sought from the ministers of the area and a response was submitted June 15, 1692. Cotton Mather seems to take credit for the varied responses when anonymously celebrating himself years later: "drawn up at their desire, by Cotton Mather the younger, as I have been informed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Life of Sir [[William Phips]]|author=Anonymous|place=London, UK|year=1697}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Return of the Several Ministers" ambivalently discussed whether or not to allow [[spectral evidence]].  The original full version of the letter was reprinted in late 1692 in the final two pages of [[Increase Mather]]'s ''Cases of Conscience''. It is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument. Calef calls it "perfectly Ambidexter, giving as great as greater Encouragement to proceed in those dark methods, then cautions against them… indeed the Advice then given, looks most like a thing of his Composing, as carrying both Fire to increase and Water to quench the Conflagration."{{Sfn|Upham|1859}}{{Sfn|Calef|1823|pages=301–03}}  It seems likely that the "Several" ministers consulted did not agree, and thus Cotton Mather's construction and presentation of the advice could have been crucial to its interpretation.

[[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] summarized the Return, "The two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others, and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before." Reprinting the Return five years later in his anonymously published ''Life of Phips'' (1697), Cotton Mather omitted the fateful "two first and the last" sections, though they were the ones he had already given most attention in his "Wonders of the Invisible World" rushed into publication in the summer and early autumn of 1692.

On August 19, 1692, Mather attended the execution of George Burroughs&lt;ref&gt;Three independent contemporary sources place him there: Thomas Brattle, Samuel Sewall, and Robert Calef. Brattle refers to him "C.M." in Burr ''Narratives'' (Scribner, 1914) p. 177. Calef's account is also reprinted in Burr "Narratives" p. 360. Diary of Samuel Sewall (MHS, Boston, 1878) p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; (and four others who were executed after Mather spoke) and Robert Calef presents him as playing a direct and influential role:

{{quote|Mr. Buroughs [sic] was carried in a Cart with others, through the streets of Salem, to Execution. When he was upon the Ladder, he made a speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious Expressions as were to the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) [as witches were not supposed to be able to recite] was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit, as was very Affecting, and drew Tears from many, so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution. The accusers said the black Man [Devil] stood and dictated to him. As soon as he was turned off [hanged], Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse, addressed himself to the People, partly to declare that he [Mr. Burroughs] was no ordained Minister, partly to possess the People of his guilt, saying that the devil often had been transformed into the Angel of Light. And this did somewhat appease the People, and the Executions went on; when he [Mr. Burroughs] was cut down, he was dragged by a Halter to a Hole, or Grave, between the Rocks, about two feet deep; his Shirt and Breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of Trousers of one Executed put on his lower parts: he was so put in, together with [John] Willard and [Martha] Carrier, that one of his Hands, and his Chin, and a Foot of one of them, was left uncovered.}}

[[File:C. Mather dated signature.png|thumb|Letter from Cotton Mather to William Stoughton, September 2, 1692]]
On September 2, 1692, after eleven of the accused had been executed, Cotton Mather wrote a [[September 2, 1692 Letter by Cotton Mather|letter to Chief Justice William Stoughton]] congratulating him on "extinguishing of as wonderful a piece of devilism as has been seen in the world" and claiming that "one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen."

Regarding spectral evidence, Upham concludes that "Cotton Mather never in any public writing 'denounced the admission' of it, never advised its absolute exclusion; but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of 'presumption' … [and once admitted] nothing could stand against it. Character, reason, common sense, were swept away."&lt;ref name="upham"&gt;
{{Citation|first=Charles|last=Upham|title=Salem Witchcraft|publisher=Frederick Ungar|location=New York|year=1859|isbn=0-548-15034-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to an English clergyman in 1692, Boston intellectual [[Thomas Brattle]], criticizing the trials, said of the judges' use of spectral evidence:

{{quote|The S.G. [Salem Gentlemen] will by no means allow, that any are brought in guilty, and condemned, by virtue of spectre Evidence... but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences, that these persons are found guilty, (considering what before has been said,) I leave you, and any man of sense, to judge and determine.&lt;ref name="georgelburr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burr|first=George Lincoln|title=Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706|publisher=Electronic Text Center|location=University of Virginia Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by Governor Phips, around the same time his own wife's (Lady Mary Phips) name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft, began in January 1693. This immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions. Due to a reprieve by Phips, there were no further executions. Phips's actions were vigorously opposed by William Stoughton.&lt;ref name="upham"/&gt;

Bancroft notes that Mather considered witches "among the poor, and vile, and ragged beggars upon Earth", and Bancroft asserts that Mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates.{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874–1878|p=85}}

===Post-trials===
In the years after the trials, of the principal actors in the trial, whose lives are recorded after, neither he nor [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|Stoughton]] admitted strong misgivings.{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874–1878|p=98}} For several years after the trials, Cotton Mather continued to defend them and seemed to hold out a hope for their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Babette|last=Levy|title=Cotton Mather|publisher=Twayne|location=Boston|year=1979|isbn= 0-8057-7261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}}

''Wonders of the Invisible World'' contained a few of Mather's sermons, the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in Europe.&lt;ref name="craker"&gt;{{Citation|first=Wendel D.|last=Craker|title=Spectral Evidence, Non-Spectral acts of Witchcraft, and Confessions at Salem in 1692|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=40|number=2|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |335}} He somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in ''Return of the Several Ministers'', by defending the use of spectral evidence.{{Sfn|Hansen|1969|p=209}} ''Wonders of the Invisible World'' appeared around the same time as Increase Mather's ''Cases of Conscience."{{Sfn|Breslaw|2000|p=455}}''
[[File:Oct 20, 1692 Cotton Mather letter to his uncle.jpeg|thumb|Oct. 20th, 1692 CM letter to his uncle]]
[[File:October 20 1692 Cotton Mather letter.pdf|thumb|Transcription of the above letter]]
Mather did not sign his name or support his father's book initially:

{{Quote|There are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press, containing Cases of Conscience about Witchcraft. I did, in my Conscience think, that as the humors of this people now run, such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witch-advocates, very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches, considered in parcels, while things as they lay in bulk, with their whole dependencies, were not exposed; but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice &amp; more than so produce a public &amp; open contest with the judges who would (tho beyond the intention of the worthy author &amp; subscribers) find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile [mob]|October 20, 1692 letter to his uncle John Cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Holmes|first=Thomas James|title=Cotton Mather: A Bibliography of His Works|publisher=Crofton|year=1974}}.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last major events in Mather's involvement with witchcraft were his interactions with Mercy Short in December 1692 and Margaret Rule in September 1693.{{Sfn|Lovelace|1979|p=202}} The latter brought a five year campaign by Boston merchant [[Robert Calef]] against the influential and powerful Mathers.{{Sfn|Breslaw|2000|p=455}} Calef's book ''More Wonders of the Invisible World'' was inspired by the fear that Mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials, and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of 1692. He quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges. [[Increase Mather]] was said to have publicly burned Calef's book in Harvard Yard around the time he was removed from the head of the college and replaced by [[Samuel Willard]].&lt;ref&gt;MHS secretary John Eliot seems to be the first to make this claim in "Biographical Dictionary" (Boston and Salem, 1809) PD available online. p 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Lovelace|1979|p=22}}

===Poole vs. Upham===
In 1869, [[William Frederick Poole]] quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on Cotton Mather's role in the Witch Trials:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
If anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly, let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking,...
'Who got up Salem Witchcraft?'... he will reply, 'Cotton Mather'. Let him try another boy...
'Who was Cotton Mather?' and the answer will come, 'The man who was on horseback, and hung witches.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=William Frederick|title=Cotton Mather and Salem Witchcraft|year=1869|publisher=University Press: Welch, Bigelow, &amp; Co.|location=Cambridge|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Poole was a librarian, and a lover of literature, including Mather's ''Magnalia'' "and other books and tracts, numbering nearly 400 [which] were never so prized by collectors as today." Poole announced his intention to redeem Mather's name, using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by [[Charles Wentworth Upham]], ''Salem Witchcraft Volumes I and II With an Account of Salem Village and a History of Opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Subjects'', which runs to almost 1,000 pages, and a quick search of the name Mather (referring to either father, son, or ancestors) shows that it occurs 96 times. Poole's critique, in book form, runs less than 70 pages but the name "Mather" occurs many more times than the other book, which is more than ten times as long. Upham shows a balanced and complicated view of Cotton Mather, such as this first mention: "One of Cotton Mather's most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master. It flows from a heart warm with gratitude."

Upham's book refers to [[Robert Calef]] no fewer than 25 times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by Calef in the mid-1690s and stating: "Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no ground to dispute the veracity of Calef as to matters of fact." He goes on to say that Calef's collection of writings "gave a shock to Mather's influence, from which it never recovered."

Calef produced only the one book; he is self-effacing and apologetic for his limitations, and on the title page he is listed not as author but "collector". Poole, champion of literature, cannot accept Calef whose "faculties, as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order;…", and his book "in our opinion, has a reputation much beyond its merits." Poole refers to Calef as Mather's "personal enemy" and opens a line, "Without discussing the character and motives of Calef…" but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn Calef. Upham responded to Poole (referring to Poole as "the Reviewer") in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title but with the clauses reversed: Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather.Many of Poole's arguments were addressed, but both authors emphasize the importance of Cotton Mather's difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence, as copied in the final pages, called "The Return of Several Ministers", of Increase Mather's "Cases of Conscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/mather.html|title=Witchcraft|last=Mather|publisher=University of Virginia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The debate continues: Kittredge vs. Burr===
Evidenced by the published opinion in the years that followed the Poole vs Upham debate, it would seem Upham was considered the clear winner (see Sibley, GH Moore, WC Ford, and GH Burr below.).  In 1891, Harvard English professor Barrett Wendall wrote [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cotton_Mather_the_Puritan_Priest.html?id=PD8NAAAAYAAJ ''Cotton Mather, The Puritan Priest'']. His book often expresses agreement with Upham but also announces an intention to show Cotton Mather in a more positive light. "[Cotton Mather] gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other…" And some pages later: "[Robert] Calef’s temper was that of the rational Eighteenth century; the Mathers belonged rather to the Sixteenth, the age of passionate religious enthusiasm."

In 1907, George Lyman Kittredge published an essay that would become foundational to a major change in the 20th-century view of witchcraft and Mather culpability therein. Kittredge is dismissive of Robert Calef, and sarcastic toward Upham, but shows a fondness for Poole and a similar soft touch toward Cotton Mather. Responding to Kittredge in 1911, [[George Lincoln Burr]], a historian at Cornell, published an [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44817262.pdf essay] that begins in a professional and friendly fashion toward both Poole and Kittredge, but quickly becomes a passionate and direct criticism, stating that Kittredge in the "zeal of his apology… reached results so startlingly new, so contradictory of what my own lifelong study in this field has seemed to teach, so unconfirmed by further research… and withal so much more generous to our ancestors than I can find it in my conscience to deem fair, that I should be less than honest did I not seize this earliest opportunity share with you the reasons for my doubts…"&lt;ref&gt;GL Burr, England's Place in the History of Witchcraft" AAS, pp 4-5. These page numbers refer to original book format, available PD online.  Also see link to PDF from AAS.&lt;/ref&gt; (In referring to "ancestors" Burr primarily means the Mathers, as is made clear in the substance of the essay.) The final paragraph of Burr's 1911 essay pushes these men's debate into the realm of a progressive creed

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I fear that they who begin by excusing their ancestors may end by excusing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;GL Burr, NE Place in Witchcraft, 1911, p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps as a continuation of his argument, in 1914, [[George Lincoln Burr]] published a large compilation "Narratives". This book arguably continues to be the single most cited reference on the subject. Unlike Poole and Upham, Burr avoids forwarding his previous debate with Kittredge directly into his book and mentions Kittredge only once, briefly in a footnote citing both of their essays from 1907 and 1911, but without further comment.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706. PD available online. p xxi footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; But in addition to the viewpoint displayed by Burr's selections, he weighs in on the Poole vs Upham debate at various times, including siding with Upham in a note on [[Thomas Brattle]]'s letter, "The strange suggestion of W. F. Poole that Brattle here means Cotton Mather himself, is adequately answered by Upham…"&lt;ref&gt;Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706. PD available online. p 188 footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Burr's "Narratives" reprint a lengthy but abridged portion of Calef's book and introducing it he digs deep into the historical record for information on Calef and concludes "…that he had else any grievance against the Mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think." Burr finds that a comparison between Calef's work and original documents in the historical record collections "testify to the care and exactness…"&lt;ref&gt;Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706. PD available online. p 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century revision: The Kittredge lineage at Harvard===

&lt;blockquote&gt;1920–3 [[Secret Court of 1920|Kenneth B. Murdock]] wrote a doctoral dissertation on Increase Mather advised by [[Secret Court of 1920|Chester Noyes Greenough]] and Kittredge. Murdock's father was a banker hired in 1920 to run the Harvard Press&lt;ref&gt;Max Hall ''Harvard University Press A History'' 1986 Harvard University Press Cambridge MA p 43, 61&lt;/ref&gt; and he published his son's dissertation as a handsome volume in 1925: ''Increase Mather, The Foremost American Puritan'' (Harvard University Press). Kittredge was right hand man to the elder Murdock at the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Max Hall ''Harvard University Press'', p 43, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This work focuses on Increase Mather and is more critical of the son, but the following year he published a selection of Cotton Mather's writings with an introduction that claims Cotton Mather was "not less but more humane than his contemporaries. Scholars have demonstrated that his advice to the witch judges was always that they should be more cautious in accepting evidence" against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;K Murdock ''Selections from Cotton Mather'' (Hafner, New York, 1926). See introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock's statement seems to claim a majority view. But one wonders who Murdock would have meant by "scholars" at this time other than Poole, Kittredge, and TJ Holmes (below)&lt;ref&gt;For contrast, see Herbert Schneider, of Columbia University, who in 1930 described the Mathers as "smug ministers of God" whose misdeeds in 1692 "put an official end to the theocracy." Schneider, Herbert Wallace, ''The Puritan Mind'', Henry Holt &amp; Co, 1930, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and Murdock's obituary calls him a pioneer "in the reversal of a movement among historians of American culture to discredit the Puritan and colonial period…"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44517578.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1924 [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539299.pdf Thomas J. Holmes] was an Englishman with no college education, but he apprenticed in bookbinding and emigrated to the U.S. and become the librarian at the William G. Mather Library in Ohio &lt;ref&gt;See link above containing obituary by CK Shipley in AAS Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt; where he likely met Murdock. In 1924, Holmes wrote an essay for the Bibliographical Society of America identifying himself as part of the Poole-Kittredge lineage and citing Kenneth B. Murdock's still unpublished dissertation. In 1932 Holmes published a bibliography of Increase Mather followed by ''Cotton Mather, A Bibliography'' (1940). Holmes often cites Murdock and Kittredge and is highly knowledgeable about the construction of books. Holmes' work also includes Cotton Mather’s October 20, 1692 letter (see above) to his uncle opposing an end to the trials.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 1930 Samuel Eliot Morison published ''Builders of the Bay Colony.'' Morison chose not to include anyone with the surname Mather or Cotton in his collection of twelve "builders" and in the bibliography writes "I have a higher opinion than most historians of Cotton Mather's ''Magnalia''… Although Mather is inaccurate, pedantic, and not above ''suppresio veri'', he does succeed in giving a living picture of the person he writes about." Whereas Kittredge and Murdock worked from the English department, Morison was from Harvard's history department. Morison's view seems to have evolved over the course of the 1930s, as can be seen in ''Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century'' (1936) published while Kittredge ran the Harvard press, and in a year that coincided with the tercentary of the college: "Since the appearance of Professor Kittredge's work, it is not necessary to argue that a man of learning…" of that era should be judged on his view of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel E ''Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1936 p 494-497&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Intellectual Life of Colonial New England'' (1956), Morison writes that Cotton Mather found balance and level-thinking during the witchcraft trials. Like Poole, Morison suggests Calef had an agenda against Mather, without providing supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Detweiler|first=Robert|date=1975|title=Shifting Perespectives on the Salem Witches|url=|journal=The History Teacher|volume=8|pages=598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1953 Perry Miller published ''The New England Mind: From Colony to Province'' (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press). Miller worked from the Harvard English Department and his expansive prose contains few citations, but the "Bibliographical Notes" for Chapter XIII "The Judgement of the Witches" references the bibliographies of TJ Holmes (above) calling Holmes portrayal of Cotton Mather's composition of ''Wonders'' "an epoch in the study of Salem Witchcraft." However, following the discovery of the authentic holograph of the September 2, 1692 letter, in 1985, David Levin writes that the letter demonstrates that the timeline employed by TJ Holmes and Perry Miller, is off by "three weeks." &lt;ref&gt;David Levin, "[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539342.pdf Did the Mather's Disagree About the Salem Witchcraft Trials]" (AAS, 1985) p.35. Levin's answer to the question presented in his title would seem to be no, the Mathers did not fundamentally disagree.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the evidence in the later arriving letter, Miller portrays Phips and Stoughton as pressuring Cotton Mather to write the book (p.201): "If ever there was a false book produced by a man whose heart was not in it, it is ''The Wonders''….he was insecure, frightened, sick at heart…" The book "has ever since scarred his reputation," Perry Miller writes. Miller seems to imagine Cotton Mather as sensitive, tender, and a good vehicle for his jeremiad thesis: "His mind was bubbling with every sentence of the jeremiads, for he was heart and soul in the effort to reorganize them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1969 Chadwick Hansen ''Witchcraft at Salem''. Hansen states a purpose to "set the record straight" and reverse the "traditional interpretation of what happened at Salem…" and names Poole and Kittredge as like-minded influences. (Hansen reluctantly keys his footnotes to Burr's anthology for the reader's convenience, "in spite of [Burr's] anti-Puritan bias…") Hansen presents Mather as a positive influence on the Salem Trials and considers Mather's handling of the Goodwin children sane and temperate.{{Sfn|Hansen|1969|p=168}} Hansen posits that Mather was a moderating influence by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed—or feigned confession—such as Tituba and Dorcas Good,{{Sfn|Hansen|1969|pp=23-24}} and that most negative impressions of him stem from his "defense" of the ongoing trials in ''Wonders of the Invisible World''.{{Sfn|Hansen|1969|p=189}} Writing an introduction to a facsimile of Robert Calef's book in 1972, Hansen compares [[Robert Calef]] to [[Joseph Goebbels]], and also explains that, in Hansen's opinion, women "are more subject to hysteria than men."&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick Hansen introduction to Robert Calef "More Wonders" (York Mail-Print, 1972) pp. v, xv note 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1971 ''The Admirable Cotton Mather'' by James Playsted Wood. A young adult book. In the preface, Wood discusses the Harvard-based revision and writes that Kittredge and Murdock "added to a better understanding of a vital and courageous man…" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1985 David Hall writes, "With [Kittredge] one great phase of interpretation came to a dead end."&lt;ref&gt;David D Hall, "Witchcraft and the Limits of Interpretation" NEQ Vol 58 No. 2 (June, 1985) see p 261-3. https://www.jstor.org/stable/365516 Note, Hall doesn't mention the [[September 2, 1692 Letter by Cotton Mather|September 2, 1692]] letter in this essay and no subsequent mention of the letter in his later publications has been located.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall writes that whether the old interpretation favored by "antiquarians" had begun with the "malice of [[Robert Calef]] or deep hostility to Puritanism," either way "such notions are no longer… the concern of the historian." But David Hall notes "one minor exception. Debate continues on the attitude and role of Cotton Mather…" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tercentary of the trials and ongoing scholarship===
Toward the later half of the twentieth century, a number of historians at universities far from New England seemed to find inspiration in the Kittredge lineage. In ''Selected Letters of Cotton Mather'' Ken Silverman writes, "Actually, Mather had very little to do with the trials."&lt;ref&gt;Ken Silverman ''Selected Letters of Cotton Mather'', (Louisiana, 1971)  p 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve pages later Silverman publishes, for the first time, a letter to chief judge William Stoughton on [[September 2, 1692 Letter by Cotton Mather|September 2, 1692]], in which Cotton Mather writes "… I hope I can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen … I have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance…"&lt;ref&gt;See [[September 2, 1692 Letter by Cotton Mather|link to this letter]] for a complex discussion of the provenance, as it did not arrive at the archives until 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in the early 1980s, historian John Demos imputed to Mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Demos|title=Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|year=2004|isbn=0-19-503131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}}

Coinciding with the tercentary of the trials in 1992, there was a flurry of publications.

Historian [http://magazine.missouristate.edu/2012/02/16/dr-larry-gragg Larry Gregg] highlights Mather's cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed, and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when Mather stated, "the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent, but also the very virtuous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Larry|last=Gregg|title=The Salem Witch Crisis|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}}

==Smallpox inoculation controversy==
The practice of smallpox [[inoculation]] (as opposed to the later practice of [[vaccination]]) was developed possibly in 8th-century India&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Donald R. (2002). ''The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History''; {{ISBN|0-226-35168-8}}, p. 140.&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or 10th-century China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=2000|series=Science and Civilization in China|volume=6. Biology and Biological Technology|title=Part 6, Medicine|place=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=154}}.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Spreading its reach in seventeenth-century Turkey, inoculation or, rather, [[variolation]], involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with [[exudate]] from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox ([[variola]]), to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity. By the beginning of the 18th century, the [[Royal Society]] in England was discussing the practice of inoculation, and the smallpox epidemic in 1713 spurred further interest.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, pp. 489–90&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1721, however, that England recorded its first case of inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;Coss, Stephen. (2016). ''The Fever of 1721: the Epidemic that Revolutionized Medicine and American Politics''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 87; {{ISBN|9781476783086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early New England===
Smallpox was a serious threat in colonial America, most devastating to Native Americans, but also to Anglo-American settlers. New England suffered smallpox epidemics in 1677, 1689–90, and 1702.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson and Newman 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was highly contagious, and mortality could reach as high as 30 percent.&lt;ref name="Gronim 2007, 2482"&gt;Gronim 2007, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in 1690 and 1702. During this era, public authorities in Massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine. Incoming ships were quarantined in Boston harbor, and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a "pesthouse".&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1706, Mather's slave, [[Onesimus (Boston slave)|Onesimus]], explained to Mather how he had been inoculated as a child in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niven|first1=Steven J.|title=Onesimus (fl. 1706–1717), slave and medical pioneer, was born in the...|url=http://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/onesimus-fl-1706-1717-slave-and-medical-pioneer-was-born|website=Hutchins center|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=September 21, 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mather was fascinated by the idea. By July 1716, he had read an endorsement of inoculation by Dr Emanuel Timonius of Constantinople in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''. Mather then declared, in a letter to Dr [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] of [[Gresham College]] in London, that he planned to press Boston's doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, pp. 490–91&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1721, a whole generation of young Bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemic's horrors had by and large disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow 1974, pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22 of that year, HMS ''Seahorse'' arrived from the West Indies carrying smallpox on board. Despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine, eight known cases of smallpox appeared in Boston by May 27, and by mid-June, the disease was spreading at an alarming rate. As a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread, many residents fled to outlying rural settlements. The combination of exodus, quarantine, and outside traders' fears disrupted business in the capital of the Bay Colony for weeks. Guards were stationed at the House of Representatives to keep Bostonians from entering without special permission. The death toll reached 101 in September, and the [[Selectmen]], powerless to stop it, "severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll."&lt;ref name="Blake 1952, 4952"&gt;Blake 1952, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; As one response, legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who, under these conditions, could no longer support their families.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On June 6, 1721, Mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by Timonius and Jacobus Pylarinus to local physicians, urging them to consult about the matter. He received no response. Next, Mather pleaded his case to Dr. [[Zabdiel Boylston]], who tried the procedure on his youngest son and two slaves—one grown and one a boy. All recovered in about a week. Boylston inoculated seven more people by mid-July. The epidemic peaked in October 1721, with 411 deaths; by February 26, 1722, Boston was again free from smallpox. The total number of cases since April 1721 came to 5,889, with 844 deaths—more than three-quarters of all the deaths in Boston during 1721.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Boylston had inoculated 287 people, with six resulting deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Best|first1=M|title=Making the right decision: Benjamin Franklin's son dies of smallpox in 1736|journal=Qual Saf Health Care|date=2007|volume=16|issue=6|pages=478–80|doi=10.1136/qshc.2007.023465|pmid=18055894|pmc=2653186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inoculation debate===
Boylston and Mather's inoculation crusade "raised a horrid Clamour"{{Sfn|Mather|1911–1912|pp=11, 628}} among the people of Boston. Both Boylston and Mather were "Object[s] of their Fury; their furious Obloquies and Invectives", which Mather acknowledges in his diary. Boston's Selectmen, consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection, forbade Boylston from performing it again.{{Sfn|Blake|1952|p=493}}

''[[The New-England Courant]]'' published writers who opposed the practice. The editorial stance was that the Boston populace feared that inoculation spread, rather than prevented, the disease; however, some historians, notably [[H. W. Brands]], have argued that this position was a result of the [[contrarian]] positions of editor-in-chief [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] (a brother of [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/cowpocklge.html|title=The Smallpox Inoculation Hospital at St. Pancras|publisher=BL|place=UK|date=2003-11-30|accessdate=2013-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205817/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/cowpocklge.html|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by John Williams from Boston, who posted that "several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of Physick, either natural or divine, and therefore unlawful",{{Sfn|Williams|1721}} to those put forth in a pamphlet by Dr. [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]] of Boston, entitled ''The Abuses and Scandals of Some Late Pamphlets in Favour of Inoculation of the Small Pox'' (1721), on the qualifications of inoculation's proponents. (Douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from Europe.) At the extreme, in November 1721, someone hurled a lighted grenade into Mather's home.{{Sfn|Blake|1952|p=495}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/special-edition-on-infectious-disease/2014/the-fight-over-inoculation-during-the-1721-boston-smallpox-epidemic|date=December 31, 2014|title=The Fight Over Inoculation During the 1721 Boston Smallpox Epidemic|publisher=Harvard University|first=Matthew|last=Niederhuber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical opposition====
Several opponents of smallpox inoculation, among them John Williams, stated that there were only two laws of physick (medicine): sympathy and antipathy. In his estimation, inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease, or an antipathy toward one, but the creation of one. For this reason, its practice violated the natural laws of medicine, transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal.{{Sfn|Williams|1721|p=13}}

As with most colonists, Williams' Puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life, and he used the [[Bible]] to state his case. He quoted [[Matthew 9:12]], when [[Jesus]] said: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick." Dr. [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]] proposed a more [[secular]] argument against inoculation, stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices. In addition, he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians, and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise. According to Douglass, smallpox inoculation was "a medical experiment of consequence," one not to be undertaken lightly. He believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others, and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony, including that of caring for the sick, they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs. Douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented. The only reason Mather had had success in it, he said, was because Mather had used it on children, who are naturally more resilient. Douglass vowed to always speak out against "the wickedness of spreading infection".{{Sfn|Douglass|1722|p=11}} Speak out he did: "The battle between these two prestigious adversaries [Douglass and Mather] lasted far longer than the epidemic itself, and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous."{{Sfn|Van de Wetering|1985|p=46}}

====Puritan resistance====
Generally, Puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments. Increase Mather, Cotton's father, was joined by prominent pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, ''The New England Soul'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; "One of the classic assumptions of the Puritan mind was that the will of God was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Alan|last=Heimert|title=Religion and the American Mind|page=5}}.&lt;!-- publishing info, ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Williams questioned whether the smallpox "is not one of the strange works of God; and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most High." He also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by God as "punishment for sin," and warned that attempting to shield themselves from God's fury (via inoculation), would only serve to "provoke him more".{{Sfn|Williams|1721|p=4}}

Puritans found meaning in affliction, and they did not yet know why God was showing them disfavor through smallpox. Not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their "errand". Many Puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art. They grappled with adhering to the [[Ten Commandments]], with being proper church members and good caring neighbors. The apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the Sixth Commandment—"thou shalt not kill"—seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure. Williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the Bible, it was not the will of God, and therefore "unlawful."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1721, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that inoculation violated [[The Golden Rule]], because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease, he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him. With the Bible as the Puritans' source for all decision-making, lack of scriptural evidence concerned many, and Williams vocally scorned Mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1721, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inoculation defended====
With the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll, a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day. The use of quarantine and various other efforts, such as balancing the body's [[humors]], did not slow the spread of the disease. As news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas, reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people. "By circa 1700, smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the Atlantic world."{{Sfn|Gronim|2007|p=248}}

Mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of God and argued the procedure was not outside of Puritan principles. He wrote that "whether a Christian may not employ this Medicine (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God's good Providence in discovering of it to a miserable World; and humbly look up to His Good Providence (as we do in the use of any other Medicine) It may seem strange, that any wise Christian cannot answer it. And how strangely do Men that call themselves Physicians betray their Anatomy, and their Philosophy, as well as their Divinity in their invectives against this Practice?"{{Sfn|Mather|1721|page=25, n. 15}} The Puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone, both the good and the wicked, yet God had provided them with the means to save themselves. Mather reported that, from his view, "none that have used it ever died of the Small Pox, tho at the same time, it were so malignant, that at least half the People died, that were infected With it in the Common way."{{Sfn|Mather|1721|p=2}}

While Mather was experimenting with the procedure, prominent Puritan pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper expressed public and theological support for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=William|last=Cooper|title=A Letter from a Friend in the Country, Attempting a Solution of the Scruples and Objections of a Conscientious or Religious Nature, Commonly Made Against the New Way of Receiving the Small Pox|place=Boston|publisher=S. Kneeland|year=1721|pages=6–7}} Apparently Cooper, also a minister, wrote this in cooperation with Colman because nearly the same response to the objections to inoculation is published under Colman's name as the last chapter to {{Citation|last=Colman|title=A Narrative of the Method and Success of Inoculating the Small Pox in New England|year=1722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to first-hand experiences and personal relationships. Although many were initially wary of the concept, it was because people were able to witness the procedure's consistently positive results, within their own community of ordinary citizens, that it became widely utilized and supported. One important change in the practice after 1721 was regulated [[quarantine]] of innoculees.{{Sfn|Van de Wetering|1985|page=66, n. 55}}

===The aftermath===
Although Mather and Boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice, the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of 1721–22. After overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success, Boylston traveled to [[London]] in 1725, where he published his results and was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1726, with Mather formally receiving the honor two years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Coss 2016, p. 269, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sermons against Pirates and Piracy==
Throughout his career Mather was also keen to minister to convicted [[pirates]].&lt;ref name="Flemming-At the Point of a Cutlass"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flemming|first1=Gregory N.|title=At the Point of a Cutlass: The Pirate Capture, Bold Escape, and Lonely Exile of Philip Ashton|date=2014|publisher=ForeEdge|location=Lebanon NH|isbn=9781611685626|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWG0AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a number of pamphlets and sermons concerning piracy, including “Faithful Warnings to prevent Fearful Judgments,” “Instructions to the Living, from the Condition of the Dead,” “The Converted Sinner ... A Sermon Preached in Boston, May 31, 1724, In the Hearing and at the Desire of certain Pirates,” “A Brief Discourse occasioned by a Tragical Spectacle of a Number of Miserables under Sentence of Death for Piracy,” “Useful Remarks. An Essay upon Remarkables in the Way of Wicked Men,” and “The Vial Poured Out Upon the Sea”. His father Increase had preached at the trial of Dutch pirate [[Peter Roderigo]]&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gosse|first1=Philip|title=The Pirates' Who's Who by Philip Gosse|date=1924|publisher=Burt Franklin|location=New York|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Cotton Mather in turn preached at the trials and sometimes executions of pirate Captains (or the crews of) [[William Fly]], [[John Quelch (pirate)|John Quelch]], [[Samuel Bellamy]], [[William Kidd]], [[Charles Harris (pirate)|Charles Harris]], and [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]]. He also ministered to [[Thomas Hawkins (pirate)|Thomas Hawkins]], [[Thomas Pound]], and [[William Coward (pirate)|William Coward]]; having been convicted of piracy, they were jailed alongside “Mary Glover the Irish Catholic witch,” daughter of witch “Goody” [[Ann Glover]] at whose trial Mather had also preached.&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmonds|first1=John Henry|title=Captain Thomas Pound|date=1918|publisher=J.

In his conversations with William Fly and his crew Mather scolded them: “You have something within you, that will compell you to confess, That the Things which you have done, are most Unreasonable and Abominable. The Robberies and Piracies, you have committed, you can say nothing to Justify them.  …  It is a most hideous Article in the Heap of Guilt lying on you, that an Horrible Murder is charged upon you; There is a cry of Blood going up to Heaven against you.”&lt;ref name="The vial poured out upon the sea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mather|first1=Cotton|title=The vial poured out upon the sea.

===''Boston Ephemeris''===
The Boston Ephemeris was an [[almanac]] written by Mather in 1686. The content was similar to what is known today as the ''[[Farmer's Almanac]]''. This was particularly important because it shows that Cotton Mather had influence in mathematics during the time of Puritan New England. This almanac contained a significant amount of astronomy, celestial within the text of the almanac the positions and motions of these celestial bodies, which he must have calculated by hand.{{Sfn|Burdick|2009}} {{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

===''The Biblia Americana''===
When Mather died, he left behind an abundance of unfinished writings, including one entitled ''The Biblia Americana''.  Mather believed that ''Biblia Americana'' was the best thing he had ever written; his masterwork.{{Sfn|Hovey|2009|p=533}} ''Biblia Americana'' contained Mather's thoughts and opinions on the Bible and how he interpreted it.  ''Biblia Americana'' is incredibly large, and Mather worked on it from 1693 until 1728, when he died. Mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it. People did not have to choose one or the other. In ''Biblia Americana'', Mather looked at the Bible through a scientific perspective, completely opposite to his perspective in ''The Christian Philosopher'', in which he approached science in a religious manner.{{Sfn|Smolinski|2009|pp=280–81}}

===''Pillars of Salt''===
Mather's first published sermon, printed in 1686, concerned the execution of James Morgan, convicted of murder. Thirteen years later, Mather published the sermon in a compilation, along with other similar works, called ''Pillars of Salt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mather|first=Cotton|year=2008|publisher=Library of America|title=True Crime: An American Anthology|isbn=978-1-59853-031-5|url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=289&amp;section=toc|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Magnalia Christi Americana''===
''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'', considered Mather's greatest work, was published in 1702, when he was 39. The book includes several biographies of saints{{Vague|date=June 2011}} and describes the process of the New England settlement.{{Sfn|Meyers|2006|pp=23–24}} In this context "saints" does not refer to the canonized saints of the Catholic church, but to those Puritan divines about whom Mather is writing. It comprises seven total books, including ''Pietas in Patriam: The life of His Excellency Sir William Phips'', originally published anonymously in London in 1697. Despite being one of Mather's best-known works, some have openly criticized it{{By whom |date= March 2010}}, labeling it as hard to follow and understand, and poorly paced and organized. However, other critics have praised Mather's work, citing it as one of the best efforts at properly documenting the establishment of America and growth of the people.{{Sfn|Halttunen|1978|p=311}}

===''The Christian Philosopher''===
In 1721, Mather published ''The Christian Philosopher'', the first systematic book on science published in America. Mather attempted to show how Newtonian science and religion were in harmony. It was in part based on [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'' (1690). Mather reportedly took inspiration from ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', by the 12th-century Islamic philosopher Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Despite condemning the "Mahometans" as infidels, Mather viewed the novel's protagonist, Hayy, as a model for his ideal Christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist. Mather viewed Hayy as a [[noble savage]] and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the Native American Indians, in order to convert them to Puritan Christianity. Mather's short treatise on the [[Lord's Supper]] was later translated by his nephew [[Josiah Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=To every tribe|work=Josiah Cotton|title=Thanksgiving's Wampanoag call: Come Over and Help Us!|url=http://www.toeverytribe.org/tag/josiah-cotton|accessdate=September 13, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050416/http://www.toeverytribe.org/tag/josiah-cotton/|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23209">'''Defence-in-depth''' is the term used by American political analyst [[Edward Luttwak]] (born 1942) to describe his theory of the defensive strategy employed by the [[Late Roman army]] in the third and fourth centuries AD.

Luttwak's ''Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'' (1976) launched the thesis that in the third and early fourth centuries, the [[Imperial Roman army]]'s defence strategy mutated from "forward defence" (or "preclusive defence") during the [[Principate]] era (30 BC-AD 284) to "defence-in-depth" in the fourth century. "Forward-"  or "preclusive" defence aimed to neutralise external threats before they breached the [[borders of the Roman Empire|Roman borders]]: the [[barbarian]] regions neighbouring the borders were envisaged as the [[theatre (warfare)|theatres of operations]]. In contrast, "defence-in-depth" would not attempt to prevent incursions into Roman territory, but aimed to neutralise them on Roman soil - in effect turning border [[Roman province|provinces]] into combat zones.

Scholarly opinion generally accepts "forward-defence" as a valid description of the [[Roman Empire]]'s defensive posture during the Principate. But many specialists in [[Roman military history]] (which Luttwak is not) contest that this posture changed to Luttwak's "defence-in-depth" from 284 onwards. Described as "manifestly wrong" by the expert on Roman borders, C. R. Whittaker,&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker (1994) &lt;/ref&gt; "defence-in-depth" has been criticised as incompatible with fourth-century Roman imperialist ideology (which remained [[expansionist]]), Roman [[strategic planning]] capabilities, with the evidence of fourth-century Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and with the vast corpus of excavation evidence from the Roman border regions.

== Thesis ==
According to this view, the [[Imperial Roman army]] had relied on neutralizing imminent barbarian incursions before they reached the imperial borders. This was achieved by stationing units (both [[Roman legion|legions]] and [[auxilia]]) right on the border and establishing and garrisoning strategic salients beyond the borders (such as the [[Agri Decumates]] in SW Germany). The response to any threat would thus be a pincer movement into barbarian territory: large infantry and cavalry forces from the border bases would immediately cross the border to intercept the coalescing enemy army; simultaneously the enemy would be attacked from behind by crack Roman cavalry (''alae'') advancing from the strategic salient(s).&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) Fig.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; This system obviously required first-rate intelligence of events in the barbarian borderlands, which was provided by a system of watch towers in the strategic salients and by continuous cross-border scouting operations (''explorationes'').

According to Luttwak, the forward defence system was always vulnerable to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders to deal with such threats.  In addition, the lack of any reserves to the rear of the border meant that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defenses would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements could arrive to intercept them.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 136&lt;/ref&gt; The first major challenge to forward defense was the great invasion of Germanic tribes  (esp. [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]]) across the Danube in 166-7, which began the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The barbarians reached as far as [[Aquileia]] in northeastern Italy and were not finally expelled from the empire until 175. But the response of the imperial high command was not to change the forward defence strategy, but to reinforce it (by the founding of 2 new legions under Marcus Aurelius and 3 more under Septimius Severus and probably matching auxiliary forces).&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 131-2&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after the catastrophic military crises of 251-71 that the Roman command under Diocletian turned to defence-in-depth: but only out of necessity, not conviction, as there were attempts to return to forward defence as late as [[Valentinian I]] (ruled 364-75)&lt;ref name="Luttwak 1976 132"&gt;Luttwak (1976) 132&lt;/ref&gt; Forward defence had become simply too costly to maintain, especially with the emergence of a more powerful and expansionist Persian empire (the [[Sassanids]]) which required greater deployments in the East.

The essential feature of defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was the acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves would become the main combat zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border.&lt;ref name="Luttwak 1976 132"/&gt; Under this strategy, border forces would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would retreat into fortified strongholds and wait for mobile forces (''comitatenses'') to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border forces would be substantially weaker than under forward defence, but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves: hence the abandonment of the old "playing-card" rectangular design of Roman fort. The new forts were so designed that they could only be taken with the use of siege engines (which barbarians generally lacked): square or even circular layout, much higher and thicker walls, wider perimeter berms and deeper ditches; projecting towers to allow enfilading fire; and location in more defensible points, such as hilltops. At the same time, many more small forts were established in the hinterland, especially along roads, to impose delays on the invaders. Also, fortified granaries were built to store food safely and deny supplies to the invaders. Finally, the civilian population of the province was protected by providing walls for all towns, many villages and even some [[Roman villa|villas]] (large country houses); some pre-Roman hillforts, long since abandoned, were re-occupied in the form of new Roman walled settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) Fig.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; The invading force would thus find itself in a region peppered with strongholds in enemy hands and where it could not easily get access to sufficient supplies. If the invaders ignored the strongholds and advanced, they risked sorties and attacks in the rear. If they attempted to besiege the strongholds, they would give the mobile troops valuable time to arrive. Overall, the aim of defence-in-depth was to provide an effective defence system at a sustainable cost, since defence-in-depth required much lower troop deployments than forward defence. To be more precise, the cost was transferred from general taxpayers to the people of the frontier provinces,&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 137&lt;/ref&gt; especially the rural peasantry, who, for all the fortifications, would often see their family members killed or abducted, homes destroyed, livestock seized and crops burnt by marauding barbarians.

== Critique ==
Luttwak's work has been praised for its lucid analysis of, and insights into, issues regarding Roman military dispositions, and for stimulating much scholarly debate about these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 377&lt;/ref&gt; But the validity of his basic thesis has been strongly disputed by a number of scholars, especially in a powerful critique by B. Isaac, the author of the fundamental study of the Roman army in the East (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1979); F. Miller (1982); Isaac (1992) 372-418&lt;/ref&gt; The objections fall under two broad headings: (1) The Roman empire did not have the intelligence and planning capacity to sustain a "grand strategy" and in any case was not defensive in ideology or policy.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 416&lt;/ref&gt;(2) Defence-in-depth is not, in the main, consistent with the literary and archaeological evidence.&lt;ref name="Mann 1979 180-1"&gt;Mann (1979) 180-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic planning ===
Luttwak's thesis of an imperial grand strategy rests on a number of assumptions: (a) that the empire's strategic posture was basically defensive; (b) that Roman expansion and choice of borders were systematic and rational, with the main objective of securing defensible borders; (c) that the Roman government's primary concern was to ensure the security of its provincial subjects. But Isaac demonstrates that these assumptions are probably false and result from inappropriate application of modern concepts of international relations and military strategy to the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 373, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac suggests that the empire was fundamentally aggressive both in ideology and military posture, up to and including the fourth century. This was demonstrated by the continued military operations and siting of fortifications well beyond the imperial borders.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 387-93&lt;/ref&gt; The empire's expansion was determined mostly by the ambitions of emperors; and that the choice of borders, to the extent that they were planned at all, was more influenced by logistical considerations (e.g. rivers, that were critical conduits for supplies) rather than defensibility. Finally, the imperial government probably was far less concerned with the security of its subjects than would be a modern government.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 393-4&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac shows that the empire did not develop the centralised military planning, or even accurate enough cartography, necessary to support grand strategy. Rome did not develop the equivalent of the centralised [[Staff_(military)|general staff]] of a modern army (and even less strategic studies institutes of the kind frequented by Luttwak). Emperors depended on the theatre military commanders (the provincial governors, later the ''magistri militum'' and ''duces'') for all military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 378, 383, 401-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological evidence ===
There is also little unequivocal archaeological and literary evidence to support defence-in-depth.&lt;ref name="Mann 1979 180-1"/&gt;
Luttwak's defence-in-depth hypothesis appears to rely on two basic features: (a) deepened fortified border zones: "It became necessary to build forts capable of sustained resistance, and these fortifications had to be built in depth, in order to protect internal lines of communication. Instead of a thin perimeter line on the edges of provincial territory, broad zones of military control had to be created..." &lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 159&lt;/ref&gt; "The thin line of auxiliary 'forts' and legionary 'fortresses' was gradually replaced by a much broader network of small fortified hard-points (in the hands of) scattered groups of static ''limitanei''..."&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 171&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis thus predicts the establishment of fortifications well into the interior of border provinces, rather than just a string of bases right on the border line; (b) the use of the ''comitatus praesentales'' (imperial escort armies) as interception forces to deal with incursions. In this regard, it is to be noted that Luttwak terminates his analysis in 350, before the establishment of the regional ''comitatus''. The interception forces were thus the single large ''comitatus'' of Constantine, and, later, the 3 ''comitatus'' known from Ammianus to exist in 350 of Gaul, Illyricum and the East.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy (2000) 172&lt;/ref&gt; But there are serious difficulties with both propositions.
[[File:Limes4-en.png|thumb|300px|right|Map showing location of Roman forts along the river Danube in [[Pannonia]]. Note that forts built in fourth century (dark red) are all either on, or even beyond, the Danube, and none in the hinterland, contradicting defence-in-depth. Also note the so-called "Devil's Dyke" or ''Limes Sarmatiae'' earthen fortifications, on the fringes of the [[Hungarian Plain]]. These works, built in the time of [[Constantine I]] (r. 312-337), may have been jointly manned by Roman troops and [[Iazyges]] natives, and were probably designed to protect the Plain from incursions by marauding Germanic tribes: a clear element of forward defence in the late period  ]]

(a) J.C. Mann points out that there is no evidence, either in the ''Notitia Dignitatum'' or in the archaeological record, that units along the Rhine or Danube were stationed in the border hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1979) 180&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, virtually all forts identified as built or occupied in the fourth century on the Danube lay on, very near or even beyond the river, strikingly similar to the second-century distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre (1995) Map on p87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elton 1996 157 and 159 Fig 13"&gt;Elton (1996) 157 and 159 (Fig 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Luttwak seizes on the situation in Palaestina Salutaris (mainly the former [[Arabia Petraea]]) province, which was dotted with forts all over, as an example of defence-in-depth.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 160&lt;/ref&gt; But here it cannot be proven that the defence system developed only in the fourth century. It may have dated from as early as the second century. In any case, Isaac shows that these "in-depth" forts were probably used for the purposes of internal security against rebels and brigands rather than defence against external threat.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac (1992) 198ff&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, such material as can be dated to Diocletian suggests that his reorganisation resulted in a massive reinforcement of linear defence along his newly built desert highway, the ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]''.

In Britain, the configuration of a large number of fourth-century units stationed between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the legionary fortresses at ''Deva'' (Chester) and ''Eboracum'' (York), superficially resembles defence-in-depth. But the same configuration existed in the second century, and was due to the short length of the frontier, forcing a "vertical" rather than horizontal deployment, as well as the need to protect the coastlines from seaborne attack. It was not defence-in-depth in the Luttwak sense.&lt;ref name="Mann 1979 181"&gt;Mann (1979) 181&lt;/ref&gt;

So strong is the evidence for forward defence under Diocletian that Luttwak himself struggles to avoid that conclusion. At one point, he describes it as "shallow defence-in-depth", a contradiction in terms.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 155&lt;/ref&gt; At another, he admits that Diocletian's policy was a "sustained attempt to provide a preclusive (i.e. forward) defence of the imperial territory". Indeed, the unfavourable evidence forces Luttwak to adopt a self-contradicting thesis. While claiming that the basic strategy of the fourth century was defence-in-depth, he admits that there were repeated attempts by the stronger emperors (up to and including Valentinian I) to revert to forward defence.&lt;ref name="Luttwak 1976 132"/&gt; This obviously casts doubt on whether a defence-in-depth strategy was ever contemplated or implemented in reality.

The Romans continued to assist the client tribes to defend themselves in the fourth century e.g. the construction by Constantine's army of two massive lines of defensive earthworks (the [[Devil's Dykes]] in Hungary and the [[Brazda lui Novac de Nord]] in Romania) well beyond the Danube (100–200 miles forward) to protect the client tribes of the [[Banat]] and the [[Wallachia]]n plain against Gothic incursions.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre (1995) 87&lt;/ref&gt; This system of a series of buffer zones of "client tribes" clearly represents an efficient and economical form of "forward defence". It contradicts the proposition that the border provinces of the empire were themselves envisaged as buffer zones.

===Literary evidence===
In the absence of any evidence of "defensive depth" in the stationing of border forces, the only "depth" left were the ''comitatus praesentales'' (imperial escort armies) stationed in the interior of the empire. But Luttwak himself admits that these were too distant from the frontier to be of much value in intercepting barbarian incursions:&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (1976) 190&lt;/ref&gt; their arrival in theatre could take weeks, if not months.&lt;ref&gt;Elton (1996) 215&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are often described as "mobile field armies", in this context "immobile" would be a more accurate description. Luttwak terminates his analysis in mid-fourth century, just before the establishment of the regional ''comitatus''.&lt;ref name="Mann 1979 181"/&gt; But the positioning of the latter, right on the borders or within 60 miles (100&amp;nbsp;km) of them,&lt;ref&gt;Elton (1996) 209&lt;/ref&gt; seems strikingly similar to that of the legions in the second century. It could be argued that the deployment of the regional ''comitatus'' was simply an admission that Zosimus' criticism of Constantine's policy was valid and that effective forward defence required reinforcement of the ''limitanei'' troops.

A further powerful objection to defence-in-depth is that it is clear from Ammianus that Rome continued major offensive operations across the imperial borders in the fourth century. These were strikingly similar to the pincer movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of forward defence in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's campaign against the [[Quadi]] in 375.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus XVI.11&lt;/ref&gt; The barbarian tribe that were the target of the operation rarely resisted the Romans in pitched battle and more often took refuge in forests and hills. The Romans would then systematically ravage their crops and burn their hamlets until starvation forced the barbarians to surrender. They would then be forced to conclude treaties of alliance with the Romans, often involving the client status described below.&lt;ref&gt;Elton (1996) 221-7&lt;/ref&gt; But there was no aspect of this activity that was peculiar to the fourth century.

One "defence strategy" the empire certainly employed was a system of treaties of mutual assistance with tribes living on the imperial frontiers, but this was not unique to the fourth century, but a long-standing practice dating to the days of the late Republic. The Romans would promise to defend the ally from attack by its neighbours. In return, the ally would promise to refrain from raiding imperial territory, and prevent neighbouring tribes from doing the same. In many cases, the loyalty of the ally would need to be further secured by gifts or regular subsidies. In some cases, the Romans would assume a loose suzerainty over the tribe, in effect dictating the choice of new chiefs. This practice was applied on all the frontiers: Germans along the Rhine, Sarmatians along the Danube, Armenian kings and Caucasian and [[Saracen]] tribes on the Eastern frontier and Mauri in North Africa. On the desert frontier of Syria, the Romans would appoint a Saracen [[sheikh]] (called a ''[[phylarch]]os'' in Greek), according him an official rank in the Roman hierarchy, to "shadow" each ''dux limitis'' in the sector. In return for food subsidies, the phylarchs would defend the desert frontier against raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1964) 611&lt;/ref&gt;

== State of the debate ==
As regards imperial ideology and central defence planning, Adrian Goldsworthy argues that both sides of the debate, which continues vigorously, have made valid points. Some degree of central planning is implied by the disposition, frequently altered, of legions and auxiliary forces in the various provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy (2005) 154&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although the empire's ideology may have been offensive in nature, border fortification such as [[Hadrian's Wall]] was clearly defensive. It is a fact that the empire ceased to expand its territory after the rule of emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). Thereafter, the borders remained largely static, with indeed a few losses of territory: the immediate evacuation of Trajan's conquests in [[Mesopotamia]] by his successor [[Hadrian]] (r. 117-38) and of the [[Agri Decumates]] in Germany and of [[Dacia]] in the third century. Thus, even if the empire's ideology and propaganda was expansionist (the slogan ''imperium sine fine''- "empire without limits" - was common), its policy was in reality generally non-expansionist.

As regards Luttwak's defence-in-depth theory itself, there appears to be insufficient clearcut evidence to support it and massive evidence against it. Mann's critique was written in 1979, so does not take account of the substantial corpus of archaeological data accumulated since. But the latter overwhelmingly contradicts a defence-in-depth strategy. Virtually all identified forts built in the fourth century lay on, very near or even beyond the border.&lt;ref name="Elton 1996 157 and 159 Fig 13"/&gt; Some evidence of fortifications in the hinterland has come to light that could be consistent with defence-in-depth. But such features cannot be unequivocally linked with military units. Furthermore, the fourth-century army's "defence" posture shares many features with the earlier forward-defence policy. The undoubted enhanced fortification of forts and other buildings, as well as cities in the border provinces (and deep in the interior of the empire including Rome itself) may therefore be interpreted as simply an admission that forward defence was not working as well as in the earlier centuries. Either barbarian pressure was much greater and/or the Roman border forces were less effective than before in containing it.

== Impression ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp; The sincere voice of D. Kemalavati, coming from the bottom of her heart, is heard in the sounds of [[rebana]] as the unfading [[syair]] Teungku Sik Pante Kullu from [[Hikayat]] about the holy war. In the poems of D. Kemalavati we see the beautiful face of her homeland, the long-suffering Aceh ... Metaphors, diction, imbued with symbolism, leave in our souls the trace that makes us love the beauty ... Her poems are an integral part of Nusantara poetry and the whole world. - '''[[Ahmad Kamal Abdullah]]''',  [[Malaysian National Laureate]], [[S.E.A. Write Award]] Laureate &lt;ref&gt; D. Kemalawati.

The '''Devonshire Hunting Tapestries''' are a group of four magnificent [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[tapestry|tapestries]] dating from the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/devonshire-hunting-tapestries/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enormous works, each over 3 metres wide, depict men and women in [[1400-1500 in fashion|fashionable dress of the early fifteenth century]] [[hunting]] in a [[forest]]. The tapestries formerly belonged to the [[Dukes of Devonshire]], but in 1957 were accepted by HM Government in lieu of tax payable on the estate of the [[10th Duke of Devonshire]] and allocated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], where they remain. 

The [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] described using his 'spare' tapestry to insulate the [[Long gallery|Long Gallery]] at [[Hardwick Hall]] in the 1840s, a practice which saved these rare Gothic hangings from being discarded. The tapestries depict a ''Deer Hunt'', ''Falconry'', a ''Swan and Otter Hunt'' and a ''Boar and Bear Hunt''. The hunt was a particularly powerful theme and would have been a familiar pastime to many of the high-born individuals and families who owned tapestries. Hunting was both a stylized sport and an important source of the only meats considered noble.

This detail is from the ''Boar and Bear Hunt'' Tapestry, made in the 1420s, and shows men carrying special [[boar-spear]]s, which have cross-bars designed to stop the charge of the boar and keep its deadly [[tusk]]s at arms length. Much of the charm of these scenes lies in the elaborate costume detail. The lady crossing the stream on the lower right has 'Monte le Desire' inscribed on her flowing sleeve. This is the opening line of a popular song of the period. The practice of embellishing one's clothes with such words was a medieval equivalent of having a stylish slogan printed on a T-shirt except that, in the tapestry, weaving on a horizontal [[loom]] has reversed the letters.

The dress of the participants is of the type worn at court, particularly that of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which had control of the tapestry-weaving areas in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|southern Netherlands]]. It is unlikely that any serious hunting took place in such restricting and exotic clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Anna|title=V&amp;A: A Hundred Highlights.|year=2001|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|isbn=1-85177-365-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Earthworm Jim''''' is a 1994 [[Shoot 'em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] [[platform game]] developed by [[Shiny Entertainment]], featuring an [[earthworm]] named Jim, who wears a [[Robotics|robotic]] suit and battles evil. The game was released for the [[Sega Genesis]], and subsequently [[porting|ported]] to a number of other [[video game consoles]].

It was well received by critics, and received a sequel, ''[[Earthworm Jim 2]]'', in 1995. In 2010, [[Gameloft]] developed and released a high definition [[Video game remake|remake]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], titled ''[[Earthworm Jim HD]]''.
In February 2018, Gameloft’s contract with Interplay ended, so [[Earthworm Jim HD]] as well as the [[Nintendo DSI]] , [[Wii]] and [[Windows Phone]] ports were removed from digital stores.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Earthworm Jim Nintendo.gif|thumb|left|Jim in the 'New Junk City' level on the SNES version]]

The game plays as a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[sidescrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] with elements of a [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] game as well. The player controls Jim and must maneuver him through the level while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The player can use Jim's gun as a method of shooting enemies, or his head as a whip for whipping enemies. The whip move also allows the player to grab hold of, and swing from, certain hooks in the game. Some levels have additional requirements beyond merely getting to the end of the level. For example, the level "For Pete's Sake", involves making sure the computer-controlled [[Peter Puppy]] character gets through the level unharmed, which is accomplished by whipping him to make him jump over pits, and defeating enemies before they can damage him. Failure to do so results in Peter lashing out at Jim, taking away from his health.

Levels commonly culminate with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss battle]]. The game incorporates a large variety of villains in the boss battles, including [[Psy-Crow]], [[Queen Slug-for-a-Butt]], [[Evil the Cat]], [[Bob the Killer Goldfish]], [[Major Mucus]], and [[Professor Monkey-For-A-Head]]. Two villains made their only appearance in this game, Chuck, a junkyard man with a tendency to vomit bizarre objects, and Doc [[Duodenum]], a crazed organ of a giant alien.

In-between most levels, a racing level called "Andy Asteroids" is played. Unlike the rest of the game, it places the viewpoint behind Jim. The player must direct Jim on his rocket, in a race against Psycrow, through a tube-like structure while collecting items and boosts and avoiding asteroids. If the player wins, the next level is started instantly. If the player loses, a special boss fight against Psy-Crow must be won in order to progress to the next level.

Other variations in gameplay occur over the course of the game as well, such as a competitive bungie-jumping and fighting level, and an underwater maze that must be traversed both within a timelimit and without crashing too many times.&lt;ref name="wii.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/924/924151p1.html|title=Earthworm Jim Review|work=IGN|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Jim is a normal [[earthworm]], until a special "[[Super Suit (Earthworm Jim)|super suit]]" falls from the sky and allows him to operate much like a human, with his "worm-part" acting as a head and the suit acting as arms, body, and legs.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/earthwormjim/earthwormjim.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Earthworm Jim|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim's task is two-fold, he must evade the game's many [[antagonist]]s, who are after him because they want the suit back, and also rescue and protect [[Princess What's-Her-Name]] from them. The game plays out with Jim eluding and defeating all enemies, and saving Princess What's-Her-Name. However, not only does she not return Jim's affection, but she is also crushed by the flying cow that was launched at the beginning of the game by Jim himself.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt;

== Development ==
[[Playmates Toys]], finding success with the license for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], wanted to start their own franchise.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; Inspired by the success of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series with ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', they decided that they wanted to start the franchise as a video game, a rare approach at the time.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; From there, the game's design actually started with [[Doug TenNapel|Douglas TenNapel]]'s simple sketch of an earthworm that he presented to [[Shiny Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="killscreendaily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/laughing-stock-doug-tennapel|title=Laughing Stock: Doug TenNapel|work=Kill Screen|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622081730/http://killscreendaily.com/articles/laughing-stock-doug-tennapel/|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Impressed, programmer [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] and the rest of Shiny bought the rights to Earthworm Jim from TenNapel, and started developing the game.&lt;ref name="killscreendaily.com"/&gt; From there, TenNapel would work on doing the game design, creating level ideas, and voicing Jim's character, while Perry and the other programmers created other characters and game mechanics.&lt;ref name="killscreendaily.com"/&gt; Perry recounted that the giant hamster "was drawn by one of our guys at three o'clock one morning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The Game Makers: The Producers|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=83|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1995|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's crazy atmosphere, world, and characters was due to the fact that the company had previously always been restricted to doing licensed games, like [[7up]]'s ''[[Cool Spot]]'', where they had to conform to the other company's preset limitations.&lt;ref name="killscreendaily.com"/&gt; In that respect, the game was actually created as a satire of platform video games at the time; for instance, "Princess-What's-Her-Name" was a parody of how so many video games had throw-away female characters to be saved.&lt;ref name="killscreendaily.com"/&gt;

=== Release===
The original version was released for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; A version for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was released shortly after the original and is largely the same as the Genesis version. The Super NES version has altered graphics, with alternate backgrounds and special effects, but lacked some sound effects and one of the levels from the Genesis version (titled "Intestinal Distress").&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; The stated reason for the Genesis version having the extra level was that the "Genesis version was more easily compressed and had the room for the bonus level".&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; Subsequently, [[Nick Bruty]] has stated in an interview that Sega asked Shiny Entertainment to add a level exclusively to the Sega version in exchange for reduced cartridge cost. Nick states that they designed the level overnight, and completed coding and testing the level in a single day–the day the game was sent to be printed to the consoles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theretrohour.com/earthworm-jim-aladdin-and-mdk-with-nick-bruty-the-retro-hour-ep58/ Earthworm Jim, Aladdin and MDK with Nick Bruty – The Retro Hour EP58]&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Mega Drive version was available exclusively via the [[Sega Channel]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vc.sega.jp/vc_ewj/ Sega of Japan Virtual Console page (Japanese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's Genesis release was promoted with a [[television commercial]] in which an elderly woman tells a [[bedtime story]] about Earthworm Jim while eating live earthworms (actually plastic props). The networks airing the commercial received so many complaints from nauseated viewers that the commercial was pulled in some markets, including stations in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Spokane]], and [[Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=January 1995|title=Earthworm Jim Commercial Becoming a Real Mouthful|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=Sendai Publishing|issue=66|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's Special Edition was released for the Sega Genesis add-on, the [[Sega CD]], and [[Windows 95]].&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; It was based off the Genesis version, contained all of its levels, plus some extended section to the levels and a single completely new level, titled "Big Bruty", a new remixed CD audio soundtrack, as well as around 1,000 more frames of in-game animation.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; These versions were also the only ones to contain alternate endings when winning on the "Practice" or "Difficult" difficulties, in which a narrator rambles on about many (false) facts about worms or congratulates the player in a similar absurd manner respectively.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt;

Another special edition of the game was released exclusively through the [[Sega Channel]] for a contest dubbed ''The Great Earthworm Jim Race''. This version included a secret room which, when reached by the first 200 players, would display a password and a [[toll-free telephone number]]. Those that called the number were awarded prizes.&lt;ref name="Races. Pg.28"&gt;''Sega Channel is Off to the Races''. [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]. Issue 69. Pg.28. April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Earthworm Jim Winner Crowned|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=139–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurocom]] ported a compressed and scaled down version for the [[Game Boy]]. It was hindered by the lack of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; This version was also ported to the [[Game Gear]], which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the [[Sega Master System]], but only in Brazil.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt; However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What The Heck? is missing.

A conversion of the game was also being developed by German studio Softgold and planned to be published by [[Atari Corporation]] for both the [[Atari Jaguar]] and the [[Atari Jaguar CD]], but it was never finished due to the departure of Normen B. Kowalewski from Atari, who was the lead developer of the port, sometime between or at the end of 1995. The alpha prototype, which consisted of basic character animations, and the source code of the conversion are currently lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Quartermann|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_65#page/n59/mode/1up|title=Gaming Gossip|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=December 1994|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=bmx|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/235352-earthworm-jim-on-jaguarquestion-was-asked-answer-was-given/#entry3196194|title=Earthworm Jim on Jaguar:question was asked, answer was given :-)|website=[[AtariAge]]|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baranski|first=Björn|url=http://ejagfest.de/interview-earthworm-jim-was-planned-for-the-atari-jaguar/?lang=en|title=Interview: Earthworm Jim was planned for the Atari Jaguar|publisher=ejagfest.de|date=November 3, 2015|accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also had a MS-DOS port released in a package titled "[[Earthworm Jim 1 &amp; 2: The Whole Can 'O Worms]]" (along with the MS-DOS port of ''[[Earthworm Jim 2]]'') with redrawn graphics and missing the level "Intestinal Distress". The game was ported by [[Rainbow Arts]].

In 2001 Game Titan ported the Super NES version to the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Despite the extra power of the Game Boy Advance, this version still ran very poorly, with poor animation, missing details, and was widely criticized.&lt;ref name="hardcoregaming101.net"/&gt;

The game was re-released digitally on a number of platforms in the late 2000s as well. The original Genesis version was released through [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in Europe on October 3, 2008,&lt;ref name="VC EU"&gt;{{cite news|title=Now on Virtual Console |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/now_on_virtual_console_9695.html |publisher=Nintendo of Europe |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2009-08-26 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on October 27, 2008.&lt;ref name="VC NA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two WiiWare Games and One Virtual Console Game Added to Wii Shop Channel|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/oT8dyUiAQmpN9sL4wlTj346dEWnyry8F|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MS-DOS version was re-released through DOSbox emulation on GOG.com and Steam.

=== High definition remake ===
{{main article|Earthworm Jim HD}}

In 2009 [[Gameloft]] released digitally an updated remake of the game on a number of mobile/handheld platforms. The remake was made entirely from scratch, without using the original game's code, and featured overhauled and smoothed graphics, a remixed soundtrack, re-recorded voice of Jim and touchscreen controls. Completely new, computer-themed levels were added, however, some previous features were lost. While extended version of the "New Junk City" level from the "Special Edition" is included, the "Big Bruty" ("Special Edition" new level) and "Who Turned out the Lights?" (secret level from the original release) are not present.&lt;ref name="wireless.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/103/1037313p1.html|title=Earthworm Jim Review|work=IGN|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102084417/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/103/1037313p1.html|archivedate=2 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN: Earthworm Jim HD|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/objects/026/026621.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=7 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423001902/http://uk.ps3.ign.com/objects/026/026621.html|archive-date=2010-04-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released as a download for the [[Nintendo DSi]] as [[DSiWare]], which is also downloadable on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Nintendo :: Official Website :: What DSiWare games can't be transferred to the Nintendo 3DS? |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/gi_index.jsp?menu=applications%20and%20features&amp;submenu=ctr-gi-apps-dsiware-wont-transfer |publisher=[[Nintendo]].com |accessdate=2011-08-05 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only new addition for the DSiWare version was an extra minigame that involved the player using the system's camera on their own face, in order to mimic the same faces Jim would make on-screen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Gameloft remake was also later released digitally on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network as "Earthworm Jim HD".&lt;ref name="xboxlive.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/109/1095982p1.html|title=Earthworm Jim HD Review|work=IGN|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817192647/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/109/1095982p1.html|archivedate=17 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/earthworm-jim-hd/reviews/earthworm-jim-hd-review-6267072/|title=Earthworm Jim HD Review|work=GameSpot|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a [[comic book]]-like introduction, three new computer-themed bonus levels, and a 4 player multiplayer mode with special levels based on already existing ones.

Reception for the game was very positive. ''Earthworm Jim'' was awarded Best Genesis Game of 1994 by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'',&lt;ref name="egmbuyersguide1995"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1995 |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Genesis version a perfect score,&lt;ref name="GPro74"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Earthworm Jim|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Famicom Tsūshin]]'' scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 30 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: アースワームジム. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.341.

The game has been noted for its fluid animation, featuring a hand-drawn style that was unusual for [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] releases.&lt;ref name="wii.ign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPro74"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Davis |coauthors= |title=''Earthworm Jim'' Review |work=Gamespot.com |page= |date=June 8, 2001  |accessdate=January 14, 2012|quote= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/earthworm-jim/reviews/earthworm-jim-review-2771794/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro'' argued that the game has "the most innovative game play since [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] first raced onto the Genesis", backing up the point by noting "In the first level, New Junk City, Jim leaps off old tires, climbs strange crevices and cliffs, swings from chains, and creeps through a maze of garbage - and that's the most traditional level in the game!"&lt;ref name="GPro74"/&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' gave rave reviews for both the Genesis and SNES versions, praising animations, long levels, and warped sense of humor. One of their reviewers summarized that "This game was made by a gamer, and it shows."&lt;ref name="EGM63"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Earthworm Jim|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=63|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=October 1994|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM63snes"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Earthworm Jim|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=63|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=October 1994|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the game's overall appeal, a review from GameZone stated "Back when platformers were the king of genres, ''Earthworm Jim'' made its presence known as the 'cool kid on the block' by appealing to many demographics. Obtaining a moderate difficulty level and establishing itself with stylish humor, ''Earthworm Jim'' was a financial and critical success for Interplay and Shiny Entertainment. Even though I feel the sequel is the best of the series, the original still is able to stand out on its own."&lt;ref name="gamezone.com"&gt;[http://www.gamezone.com/news/earthworm_jim_sega_genesis_super_nintendo_entertainment_system Gamezone.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116102024/http://www.gamezone.com/news/earthworm_jim_sega_genesis_super_nintendo_entertainment_system |date=November 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also went on to praise the soundtrack from Mark Miller as well.&lt;ref name="gamezone.com"/&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Genesis version of the game, and stated that "Sure, it's only a slick 16bit platform game. And anyone looking for anything revolutionary will be disappointed - there's nothing strictly ''new'' here. But it's a whole load of fun, and ''that'''s what counts."&lt;ref name="NG1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sega CD enhanced port was also well received. ''GamePro'' and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' remarked that whereas most Sega CD ports simply add enhanced music, ''Earthworm Jim'' included a number of worthwhile additions such as new animations, new levels, and the new homing missile weapon.&lt;ref name="EGM68"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Earthworm Jim Special Edition|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=69|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=April 1995|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Earthworm Jim Special Edition|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=79 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EGM'' gave it their "Game of the Month" award,&lt;ref name="EGM68"/&gt; and ''GamePro'' later awarded it Best Sega CD Game of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Editor's Choice Awards 1995 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' reviewed that the Game Gear version has impressive graphics by portable standards but is crippled by the Game Gear's limited two-button control, frequent screen blurring, and frustrating difficulty.&lt;ref name="EGM72"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Earthworm Jim|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=72|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=July 1995|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro'' also felt the two-button control to be a serious problem, but concluded the Game Gear version to be "Overall ... fine for fans who want to take their EWJ show on the road."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Earthworm Jim|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=81|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1995|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the Windows 95 version, ''Maximum'' claimed "it's not only a damn fine platform game, it's probably the best the PC has seen to date." They particularly praised the non-frustrating challenge and the strong personality of the graphics.&lt;ref name="Max4"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Earthworm Jim|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]'' named the computer release of ''Earthworm Jim'' the best arcade title of 1995.&lt;ref name=cgm1995awards&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=A Decade of Gaming; Award Winners of 1995 |date=November 2000 | issue=120 | pages=56-58, 60, 62, 66, 68, 70-76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Sega CD version of ''Earthworm Jim: Special Edition'', and stated that "While a prepackaged, presold character, who's as cynically calculated for hip success as Earthworm Jim does rub us the wrong way, we admit there was a cracking good game to back him up, and this new CD version is even better."&lt;ref name="NG5"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=5|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=May 1995|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the game an A and wrote that the game is too similar to the Genesis and SNES versions to warrant a new purchase.&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/article/1995/06/23/earthworm-jim-special-edition/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later [[Gameloft]] remakes of the games received mixed reviews.  Reception for the 2010 remake, ''Earthworm Jim HD'', less positive. IGN and GameSpot both felt that the surreal art style and animation stood the test of time, but felt that some gameplay aspects and controls felt dated in comparison to modern platformers.&lt;ref name="xboxlive.ign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot.com"/&gt; Similarly, the [[iPhone]] version of the game was criticized for its sloppy controls, mostly due to being touchscreen only.&lt;ref name="wireless.ign.com"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
A sequel, ''[[Earthworm Jim 2]]'', was released in 1995. It was released in the same manner as the original; first on the Sega Genesis, and then ported to many other systems. It too was generally well received. Two further games, ''[[Earthworm Jim 3D]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Microsoft Windows|PC]], and ''[[Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy]]'' for the [[Game Boy Color]], were produced in 1999. However, they were developed without the involvement of Shiny Entertainment and were mostly met with negative reviews. An enhanced remake, ''[[Earthworm Jim (PSP)]]'' by [[Atari]] was planned for a 2007 release for the [[PlayStation Portable]], but was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/06/19/ataris-earthworm-jim-project-is-in-stasis/|title=Atari's Earthworm Jim project is in stasis - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/earthwormjim/earthwormjim3.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Earthworm Jim|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also inspired non-video game products, such as the ''[[Earthworm Jim (TV series)|Earthworm Jim]]'' television series, a comic book series, and a line of action figures.&lt;ref name="wii.ign.com"/&gt; Earthworm Jim is playable as a standard character in ''[[ClayFighter 63⅓]]'', and as a secret character in the "Sculptor's Cut" version of that game.

The UNESCO stated “education for sustainable development is a broad task that calls for the full involvement of multiple educational organizations and groups in bureaucracies and civil societies. These include Non-Governmental Organizations or NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development/partners/ngos/|title=NGOs  {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of education used by nation-states as well as international, [[intergovernmental organizations]], non-governmental organizations, also known as [[NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, (both transnational and national), and agents of [[civil society]] (many of which belong to the aforementioned categories) contributes heavily to the self-identification of individuals. NGOs, can be defined as "formal organizations, and as such, they emerge when a group of people organize themselves into a social unit “that was established with the explicit objective of achieving certain ends and formulating rules to govern the relations among the members of the organization and the duties of each member” (Blau and Scott, 1970)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0305-750X(87)90150-1 |title=The role of NGOs in the strengthening of civil society |journal=World Development |volume=15 |pages=121 |year=1987 |last1=Frantz |first1=Telmo Rudi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By understanding the language of each, one can reach a greater understanding of the multiple, conflicting, and overlapping educational ideologies employed across the globe. The issue of education on an international scale is also embedded in a complex framework of international relations which alters the effectiveness of those who employ the ideologies in a practical manner. '''Education NGOs''' differ in practice and ideology based on the previously mentioned factors. However, in the age of globalization, travel and communication have contributed to new ideas about individual identities in relation to the a global - rather than national - community.

==Historical background==
===Influence of Education===
An article published in The Nation (Pakistan newspaper) on July 2, 2018 described education as crucial to the development of all individuals. Education nurtures a person’s way of thinking, inculcates values, and teaches skills needed to succeed in life. At the same time, it helps boost the social, economic, and political progress of nations. It said governments that establish an efficient education system reaps benefits in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/09-Mar-2013/role-of-ngos-in-edu|title=Role of NGOs in edu|date=2013-03-09|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy]] is both the product of, and basis for, the educational ideologies that shape members of our society. Furthermore, the language utilized to describe the actors within society is key to understanding the outcomes of differing educational ideologies. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] is one of the philosophers who recognized the organizational utility of language in shaping nation-states. Although this language would only matter in the mind of single individuals, the proliferation of these concepts and their subsequent adoption was and is vital to their identification as members of a nation-state, as well as in distinguishing them from others. The following words; ''people'', ''nation'', ''citizen'', ''body politic'', ''popular sovereignty'', ''other'', and ''foreigner,'' were present throughout Jean Jacques Rousseau's [[social contract theory]], which resulted in the creation of imagined boundaries that bind individuals together for mutual benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/rousseau/section2/|title=SparkNotes: Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778): The Social Contract|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education was the tool that would construct a common understanding of these terms and bind people together. Jacques Rousseau proposed this nationalistic form of education;&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J. J. (1947). ''Considerations on the Government of Poland''. Minnesota Book Store.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is education," he said,"that should put the national stamp on men's minds and give the direction to their opinions and tastes which will make them patriots... National education is the privilege of free men who share common interests and are united under law".&lt;ref&gt;[''The Emile of Jean Jacques Rousseau: Selections''translated by William Boyd (New York: Teachers College Press, 1956), p.189]&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau's philosophy shaped and reflects the current system of nation-states in the international system. It also exposes the political nature of education; public education under this philosophy is therefore a tool of the nation-state which is used to consolidate a certain identity and will.

==The Role of NGOs, Non-State Actors and Globalization in Education ==

=== Effects of Globalization on Education ===
Education is rapidly becoming essential to attaining social mobility and economic stability, especially in an increasingly globalized world where technological skills and knowledge are necessary to participate in the economy.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;Brissett, N., &amp; Mitter, R. (2017). For function or transformation? A critical discourse analysis of education under the Sustainable Development Goals. ''Journal For Critical Education Policy Studies (JCEPS)'', ''15''(1), 181-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this reality, more educational institutions are seeking to incorporate more [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] courses and career training into their curriculums.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; However, these educational opportunities are not widely offered, which many scholars have argued has led to greater global inequality.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

Globalization has also generated a greater push for common, global educational standards such as the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, some critics argue that these standards pushes a Westernized concept of quality education and focuses on economic benefits rather than the goals of sustainable development and global equality.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

Where education has been the role of the nation state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/9780230371132 |title=Education, Globalization and the Nation State |year=1997 |last1=Green |first1=Andy |isbn=978-0-333-68316-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[globalization]] has created new institutions including global regulatory organizations, global mass media and the aforementioned global flow of populations,&lt;ref&gt;[Spring, Joel H. How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of the Nation-state. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004. p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; which have contributed to the weakening of the nation state in education. Global regulatory organizations include the [[intergovernmental organizations]] , such as membership organizations like the [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] that regulate the world economy, as well as other international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. These organizations operate within a context of global norms that are established, and laws that are passed, with the influence of non-state actors, or [[non-governmental organizations]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} While global regulatory organizations focus on the establishment and enforcement of policies by exerting influence over the conditions of monetary loans, NGOs attempt to establish and enforce norms through exerting a certain sense of [[moral authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[Spring, Joel H. How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of the Nation-state. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004. p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of some African countries do not fully welcome the idea of NGO contributions towards education; thus such governments tend to be constantly involved with activities of NGOs in the education sector.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller-Grandvaux |first1=Yolande |last2=Welmond |first2=Michel |last3=Wolf |first3=Joy |date=July 2002 |title=Evolving partnerships: The role of NGOs in basic education in Africa |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED473909.pdf |pages=17–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, governments regulate the activities of NGO's based on their economic standing, "administrative standing"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0305-750X(89)90263-5 |title=The politics of government-NGO relations in Africa |journal=World Development |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=569 |year=1989 |last1=Bratton |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "historical relationship" with NGO's.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead of direct funding, government relationship between with NGOs and non state actors in education is focused on promotion of non state actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09614521003763160 |title=Achieving Education for All through public–private partnerships? |journal=Development in Practice |volume=20 |issue=4–5 |pages=473 |year=2010 |last1=Rose |first1=Pauline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Millennium Development Goals ===
In 2000, the United Nations formed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - eight goals that sought to address global poverty, educational disparities, gender inequality and health crises. The 191 member states of the UN committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Nwonwu, F. (Ed.). (2007). ''Millennium development  achievements and prospects of meeting the targets in'' . Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Goal 2 specifically focused on providing "universal primary education," for children in every nation. The UN Education and Scientific Council (UNESCO) determined primary education to be "the beginning of systematic apprenticeship of reading, writing and mathematics." &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In order to measure the progress towards achieving Goal 2, UNESCO utilized three gauges; the literacy rate of the 15 - 24 year old demographic, the net total enrollment in the primary education system and the number of students who start first grade and reach the fifth grade.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In a 2003 Education for All report, data revealed that the progress towards Goal 2 in Sub-Saharan Africa had been unsuccessful. The report disclosed that 58% of students in the area were enrolled in a primary school and that there was a 15% rate of repeating school grades in half of the countries within the region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, research also indicates that the MDGs were in fact attained if measured on the overall, global scale. The rate of children of primary school age not receiving an education was reduced from 100 million to 57 million between the years 2000 to 2015 During this same period of time, the global literacy rate of people between 15–24 years old increased from 83% to 91%.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. A. (2017). In Focus: An Update on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. ''Journal Of Obstetric, Gynecologic &amp; Neonatal Nursing'', ''46''e48-e55. doi:10.1016/j.jogn.2016.11.010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable Development Goals ===
In 2016, the [[United Nations]] enacted the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) - a set of 17 global goals to be accomplished by 2030. Through Goal 4 (SDG 4), the United Nations seeks to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all." &lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Sustainable Development Goal 4. (n.d.). [United Nations]. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the UN reported that despite that more children in the world are attending school than ever before, millions of children still do not meet standard levels in math and reading. According to the current reports, less than half of students in 9 out of 24 sub-Saharan African nations and 6 of 15 Latin American countries had achieved proficient standards in math by the time they finished primary school. Additionally less than half of the children in a quarter of sub-Saharan African countries, who completed a primary education had reached proficient, reading standards.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Due to the low achievement rates in these areas, the UN stressed that efforts in educational attainment must be increased in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia as well as "for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas." &lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; The UN claimed that the main factors that have contributed to these disparities were the deficient states of schools in developing areas, inadequate training for teachers and the lack of access to electricity and potable water in a majority of schools in the regions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; To address these issues, in 2015, nations of the UN contributed $1 billion to the official development assistance (ODA) for scholarships.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

The table below provides some historic and modern roles of NGOs in education:

Actors in education that operate outside and across national boundaries are categorized as members of a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[Akira Iriye, ''Global Community: The Role of International Organizations in the Making of the Contemporary World. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002)]''&lt;/ref&gt; Although this does not greatly distinguish between international/transnational actors, other scholars have developed the term ''[[global civil society]]'', including a network of NGOs that function in contrast to and sometimes competing with, the actions of nation-states. "The emergence and growth of Civil Society over the past two decades has been one of the most significant trends in international development. The World Bank recognizes that civil society plays an especially critical role in helping to amplify the voices of the poorest people in the decisions that affect their lives, improve development effectiveness and sustainability, and hold governments and policymakers publicly accountable. The purpose of this web site is to provide Civil Service Organizations (CSOs) with information, links, and materials on the World Bank's evolving relationship with civil society in Washington and throughout the world".&lt;ref&gt;["The World Bank and Civil Society," http://wbln0018.Worldbank.org/essd/essd.nsf/NGOs/home.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the World Bank is the single largest external financeir of education in the world, with "Education...at the heart of the World Bank's mission to reduce global poverty" (according to their own reports).&lt;ref&gt;[The World Bank, ''Education and Development'', (Washington, DC: The World Bank, 2002), p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also adopts educational standards established by other international intergovernmental organizations, such as their implementation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "Educational Sector Strategy", which establishes specific international targets for "primary education, adult literacy, and gender parity in basic education with the ''Education for All'' initiative" as well as the OECD's ''Development Assistance Committee goals".&lt;ref&gt;[''World Bank Education: Education Sector Strategy''(Washington, DC: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, 1999), p.vii]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Although many scholars, activists, and NGOs agree with targeting specific populations, they contest the motives of the World Bank based on their measurements of success.&lt;ref name="Kevin Danaher 2001 p.8" /&gt; These members of civil society see the actions of the World Bank as emphasizing economic growth based on the pursuit of profits as well as the increase of consumption in developing areas, as favoring representative governments, and as supporting the privatization of educational systems (including private schools, charging tuition for government schools, and privatizing textbook production).&lt;ref name="Kevin Danaher 2001 p.8"&gt;Kevin Danaher, ed., ''Democratizing the Global Economy: The Battle Against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund'' (Monroe, Maine: Common Courage Press, 2001) p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as members of the antiglobalization movement, have argued that the economic and environmental growth policies of the World Bank actually hinder educational development in many countries, and are, in fact, undemocratic based on the perpetuation of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;[Spring, Joel H. How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of the Nation-state. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004. p.33]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "U.S. Network for Global Economic Justice", an antiglobalization platform, called for "the immediate suspension of the policies and practices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group which have caused widespread poverty, inequality, and suffering among the world's peoples and damage to the world's environment....These institutions are anti-democratic... and their policies have benefitted international private sector financiers, transnational corporations, and corrupt officials and politicians....We demand that the World Bank Group immediately cease providing advice and resources to advance the goals associated with corporate globalization, such as privatization and liberalization".&lt;ref&gt;[Network Platform &amp; Demands to the IMF and World Bank, http://www.50years.org/about/.]&lt;/ref&gt; These critics believe that the type of education that is promoted by international institutions and intergovernmental monetary institutions such as the IMF and World Bank represent the interest of the member countries, and do not benefit the human capital within the recipient countries. This is an example of policy implementation from above.

On the other hand, members of civil society and the antiglobalization movements alike view their own actions as policy implementation from below, emphasizing "relations among people and between people and the environment", as opposed to privatization of government services, and as focusing on the direct action and participation of citizens in decision-making.&lt;ref name="Kevin Danaher 2001 p.8" /&gt; Because of this, education has shifted from nation-state oriented learning to an emphasis on [[world citizenship]], [[civic education]], [[service learning]], [[human rights]], and [[environmental education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mdk12.msde.maryland.gov/instruction/curriculum/social_studies/what_is_civiced.html|title=What is civic education?: The Role of Civic Education ~ Social Studies ~ Instruction ~ School Improvement in Maryland|website=mdk12.msde.maryland.gov|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-citizenship-is-more-popular-than-you-might-think_us_59beb7d7e4b0390a1564deb0|title=World Citizenship Is More Popular Than You Might Think|last=Wittner|first=Lawrence|date=2017-09-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/teaching/teaching-resources/engaging-students-in-learning/service-learning/|title=Service learning  {{!}}  Center for Teaching and Learning|website=www.washington.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/education/what-environmental-education|title=What is Environmental Education? {{!}} US EPA|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights/what-are-human-rights|title=What are human rights? {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of World Citizenship on NGOs ===
Globalization has had positive benefits on the concepts of global/world citizenship and civic society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The adoption of the concept of a global society, by educators, has led to a growth in the non-governmental (NGO) and non-profit sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The idea of a global citizen arose with the following characteristics:

*Global Citizens know about and have contact with NGOs
*Global citizens' education orients them towards participation in NGOs
*Global Citizens are people with higher education and they have the financial resources to travel
*World citizenship is more probable for people involved in social service activities and voluntary work
*World citizenship is more probable for people with a weak national identity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[John Boli, Thomas A. Loya, and Teresa Loftin, "National Participation in World-Polity Organization," ''Constructing World Culture...'', p.74-75]&lt;/ref&gt;

World citizenship has exploded because of recent advances in new information technologies such as the internet and its social networking sites; these provide "powerful, new opportunities to advocates to disseminate information and mobilize support".&lt;ref&gt;"Public Advocacy: A Cornerstone of Democratic Society," ''Civicus World: Newsletter of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation''(May–June 1998), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in population movements and a surge in travel to world conferences (i.e. 1992 Rio Earth Summit, 1995 Beijing UN Conference on Women) has helped the operationalist relations between NGOs, further solidifying transnational networks of communication and influence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[Spring, Joel H. How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of the Nation-state. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004.p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Education Nonprofits==

=== United States Public Policy ===
[[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act]] of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/serveamerica/index.asp NationalService.gov &gt; Edward M.

*Reauthorizes and expands two previous acts, the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA).
**The National and Community Service Act of 1990 describes service learning as "a method under which students or participants learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service that is conducted in and meets the needs of a community; is coordinated with an elementary school, secondary school, institution of higher education, or community service program, and with the community; and helps foster civic responsibility; and that is integrated into and enhances the academic curriculum of the students, or the educational components of the community service program in which the participants are enrolled; and provides structured time for the students or participants to reflect on the service experience."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12511- United States Code: Title 42,12511. Definitions | LII / Legal Information Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonprofit Capacity Building Program&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/programs/capacity.asp NationalService.gov &gt; Nonprofit Capacity Building Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The Nonprofit Capacity Building Program (NCBP) will increase the capacity of a small number of intermediary grantees to work with small and midsize nonprofits in communities facing resource hardship challenges to develop and implement performance management systems".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== Main Concerns with the U.S Education System ===
Many education nonprofits and programs in the United States seek to address the growing, academic disparities between racial and socioeconomic groups. In the U.S, exam scores of poor students, who are often Latino or black, are lower than those of white, middle-class students.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Berliner, D. (2016). Addressing poverty: Our impoverished view of educational reform. In Mathis, W.J., &amp; Trujillo, T.M. (Eds.) ''Learning from the federal market-based reforms: Lessons for ESSA.'' Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing (pp. 437-486).&lt;/ref&gt; Students who attend schools with 50% or more children in poverty greater concentration are more likely to fall below the U.S standards in mathematics and reading.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Not only that, but as access to a higher education becomes increasingly crucial to earning a stable income, it has also become more costly in the nation. This issue has exacerbated the problem of equal access to college, as the typical black or Latino family do not possess a tenth of the wealth of the typical white family.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Orfield, G. (2016). A new civil rights agenda for American education in Mathis, William J. and Tina M. Trujillo. ''Learning from the Federal Market-Based Reforms : Lessons for ESSA''&lt;nowiki&gt;. Charlotte, NC : Information Age Publishing, [2016], 2016. National Education Policy Center series.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic disparities in the United States are also caused by other factors. One is that qualified, effective teachers are often concentrated in school districts that offer higher salaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.future-ed.org/breaking-tradition-a-pay-raise-strategy-that-benefits-teachers-and-school-districts/|title=A Better Way to Compensate Teachers {{!}} FutureEd|website=FutureEd|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these districts are inhabited mainly by wealthier families and less by students of color.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Another cause is that impoverished circumstances prevents children from learning in school, increasing the achievement gap.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Studies have also revealed that the trend of school choice is a hindrance to social mobility, as more affluent families have access to schools with greater resources that are often private.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Labaree, D. (1997). Private Goods, Public Goods: The American Struggle over Educational Goals. ''American Educational Research Journal,'' ''34''(1).&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency has generated greater school segregation not only amongst students of various races but also of different socioeconomic classes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

*Bridge national, [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]]
*Provide supplemental, educational resources to students
*Provide mentors for them outside of classroom&lt;li&gt;Help combat [[cycle of poverty]]&lt;/li&gt;

==Human Rights Education==
[[Human rights]] NGOs, the largest group of NGOs in global civil society, shift focus away from an allegiance to the nation-state, as proposed by Rousseau, to an allegiance to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink, ''Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stressed the training, dissemination, and information efforts aimed at the building of a universal culture of human rights...through the imparting of knowledge and skills and the molding of attitudes and directed to: a)The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; b)The full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity; c) The promotion of understanding, tolerance, gender equality and friendship among all nations, indigenous peoples, and racial, national, ethnic religious and linguistic groups; d)The enabling of all persons to participate effectively in a free society; e)The furtherance of the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/Training/Compilation/Pages/PlanofActionfortheUnitedNationsDecadeforHumanRightsEducation,1995-2004(1996).aspx|title=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission Plan of Action Report|last=|first=|date=December 12, 1996|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this report fails to address socio-economic inequalities, and is more ideological.

Teaches about:

*cultural differences, attempting to seek common ground for working for human rights
*human rights as the morality of a global civil society
*rights based approach to adequate nutrition, shelter, health care, and employment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==Prominent Education Nonprofit Institutions==
=== Active Intergovernmental Institutions ===
*World Bank (WB)
*Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
*World Trade Organization (WTO)
*United Nations (UN)
*Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
*United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)

=== Active Non-Governmental Organizations ===
* [[Education Pioneers]]
* [[Jumpstart for Young Children|Jumpstart]]
* [[Khan Academy]]
* [[Stand for Children]]
* [[Teach For America|Teach for America]]
* [[Education Above All]]

'''The Eight Principles of ''Yong''''' ({{zh|c=永字八法|p=Yǒngzì Bā Fǎ}}; {{lang-ja|永字八法/えいじはっぽう}}, ''eiji happō''; {{lang-ko|영자팔법/永字八法}}, ''Yeongjapalbeop'') explain how to write eight common [[Stroke (Chinese character)|stroke]]s in [[regular script]] which are found all in the one character, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|永}}}} ({{zh|p=yǒng}}, "forever", "permanence"). It was traditionally believed that the frequent practice of these principles as a beginning [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]] could ensure [[beauty]] in one's writing.

The Eight Principles are influenced by the earlier Seven Powers ({{lang|zh|七勢}})  by Lady [[Wei Shuo]] ({{lang|zh|衛鑠}}) of [[Eastern Jin]]. Publications on the Principles include:
* ''The Praise to the Eight Principles of "Yong"'' ({{lang|zh|永字八法頌}}) by [[Liu Zongyuan]] ({{lang|zh|柳宗元}}) of the [[Tang Dynasty]].
* ''Explanations to the Eight Principles of "Yong"'' ({{lang|zh|永字八法解}}) by Li Puguang ({{lang|zh|李溥光}}) of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Lǐ provided two-character [[metaphor]]ical names.

The term was coined in 1973 by American writer [[Norman Mailer]] to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print.&lt;ref name=twsTimeMag&gt;Paul Dickson  April 30, 2014, Time Magazine, [http://time.com/82601/the-origins-of-writerly-words/ The origins of writerly words], Retrieved November 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation in 1973, the term has evolved, now often being used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information.

==Usage==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines a factoid as a brief or trivial item of news or information and as an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact.&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt;

The term was [[neologism|coined]] by American writer [[Norman Mailer]] in his 1973 biography of [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;{{cite news|author=David Marsh|date=17 January 2014|work=The Guardian| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2014/jan/17/mind-your-language-factoids |title=A factoid is not a small fact. Fact: A factoid is subtly different from a trivial fact, whatever Steve Wright may claim| accessdate= June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mailer described factoids as "facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mailer |first=Norman |title=Marilyn: A Biography |publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap |year=1973 |isbn=0-448-01029-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the word by combining the word ''[[wikt:fact|fact]]'' and the ending ''[[wikt:-oid|-oid]]'' to mean "similar but not the same". The ''[[Washington Times]]'' described Mailer's new word as referring to "something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jan/23/20070123-121624-9376r/|title=Ah, there's joy in Mudville's precincts|last=Pruden|first=Wesley|authorlink=Wesley Pruden|date=January 23, 2007|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, factoids may give rise to, or arise from, [[list of common misconceptions|common misconceptions]] and [[urban legend]]s. Several decades after the term was coined by Mailer, it grew to have several meanings, some of which are quite different from each other.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1&gt;{{cite news|author=William Safire|date=December 5, 1993|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/magazine/on-language-only-the-factoids.html |title=On Language; Only the Factoids|accessdate= June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, [[William Safire]] identified several contrasting senses of ''factoid'':

* "factoid: accusatory: misinformation purporting to be factual; or, a phony statistic."&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;
* "factoid: neutral: seemingly though not necessarily factual"&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;
* "factoid: (the CNN version): a little-known bit of information; trivial but interesting data."&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;

This new sense of a factoid as a trivial but interesting fact was popularized by the [[CNN Headline News]] TV channel, which, during the 1980s and 1990s, often included such a fact under the heading "factoid" during newscasts. [[BBC Radio&amp;nbsp;2]] presenter [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] uses factoids extensively on his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steve Wright|title=Steve Wright's Book of Factoids |publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment |year=2005 |isbn=0-00-720660-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Dion Smythe defines factoids to be assertions about the truth, as documented in primary sources of historical research. In this indirect meaning, the truthfulness of factoids comes from objectively observable existence of such assertions themselves, and not from the truthfulness of what they claim about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Dion Smythe |title=A Whiter Shade of Pale: Issues and Opportunities in Prosopography |publisher=Unit for Prosopographical Research, Linacre College, University of Oxford |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-900934-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus factlet==
As a result of confusion over the meaning of factoid, some English-language style and usage guides recommend against its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brians, Paul |title=Common Errors in English Usage |publisher=William James &amp; Company |year=2003 |isbn=1-887902-89-9}} [http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/factoid.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]] in his "On Language" column advocated the use of the word ''factlet'' instead of ''factoid'' to express a brief interesting fact as well as a "little bit of arcana" but did not explain how adopting this new term would alleviate the ongoing confusion over the existing contradictory common use meanings of ''factoid''.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt;

Safire suggested that ''factlet'' be used to designate a small or trivial bit of information that is nonetheless true or accurate.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/magazine/on-language-only-the-factoids.html?pagewanted=all|title=On Language; Only the Factoids|last=Safire|first=William|date=December 5, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' identified Safire as the writer who coined the term ''factlet'',&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt; although Safire's 1993 column suggested ''factlet'' was already in use at that time.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine agreed with Safire, and recommended ''factlet'' instead of ''factoid'', such that ''factlet'' would signify a "small probably unimportant but interesting fact", and that the term be used in place of ''factoid'', which they saw as often having negative connotations.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic&gt;Alexis C. Madrigal, March 29, 2012, The Atlantic, [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/down-with-factoid-up-with-factlet/255235/ Down With Factoid!

'''Flat Classroom Project'''  is an award winning global collaborative project for students in Grades 3 -12, inspired by [[Thomas Friedman]]'s book, ''[[The World is Flat]]'', and leverages Web 2.0 tools to foster communication and interaction as well as collaboration and creation between students and teachers from classrooms around the world.

==About==
Co-founded in 2006 by educators Vicki Davis (U.S.) and Julie Lindsay (Australia), the [http://www.flatclassroomproject.net/ Flat Classroom® Project] is a global collaborative project designed for students, typically in Grade 3 - 12, using Web 2.0 tools to support communication and collaboration between students and teachers from classrooms around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Vicki|author2=Julie Lyndsay|title=Flat Classrooms|journal=Learning &amp; Leading with Technology|date=August 2007|volume=35|series=1|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was inspired by topics included in Thomas Friedman's  international bestselling book ''The World Is Flat: The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century'' and was featured in the 2007 update "Release 3.0" of that book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century|year=2007|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-374-29278-7|pages=501–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original project served as a foundation which has been recreated and expanded. Currently the project runs three times a year.

The project has gained international recognition and awards from the [[International Society for Technology in Education|International Society of Technology Educators]](ISTE), Taking IT Global, [[World Innovation Summit for Education]], and [[The Edublog Awards|Edublog Awards]] and has fostered four similar projects based on the same holistic and constructivist educational approach, including the Digiteen, Eracism, NetGenEd, and A Week in the Life projects. 

The first spin-off the NetGenEd Project, originally called the Horizon Project, examines the book ''Growing Up Digital'', by [[Don Tapscott]], in conjunction with the New Media Consortium's annual ''Horizon Report''.

Another spin-off effort is the [http://www.flatclassroomconference.com/ Flat Classroom™ Conference] which brings together geographically distant students that may have participated in one of the affiliated projects for a face-to-face meeting. At the conference students share ideas and take part in theme-based workshops to take back to their home schools. Themes are designed to explore global social issues and inspire unity and action, while advancing continued student-to-student and educator-to-educator connections.

===Pedagogical approach===

The goal of the Flat Classroom Project is to create global collaborative projects and maintain workspaces for students (at all school levels) and educators around the world. The aim is to provide bridging between students, educators, trainee teachers, and post-secondary education institutions.

By "flattening" the walls of the traditional classroom, participating classes essentially become one large virtual classroom, co-taught by participating teachers, via the Internet and a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boss|first=Suzie|title=Reinventing Project Based Learning: Your field guide to real-world projects in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=International Society for Technology in Education|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1-56484-238-1|author2=Jane Krauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is designed to: 
* develop cultural understanding;
* further skills with Web 2.0 and other software tools;
* provide experience in global collaboration and online learning;
* raise awareness of what it means to live and work in a globalised world;
* encourage research and discussion around the ideas developed in Friedman's core text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Laurence|title=Global Education: Using Technology to Bring the World to Your Students|year=2009|publisher=International Society for Technology in Education|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1-56484-258-9|pages=39–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core pedagogical approach includes the development of two primary products. The first product involves groups of students working collaboratively to compose a wiki web page, based on topic research, and using [[Wikipedia]] as a model. The second product involves individual students creating a multimedia artefact, again based on topic research, which should also include a portion requested from another student in a different part of the world. Student work is assessed with common criteria-based rubrics and reviewed by a panel of international judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonk|first=Curtis Jay|title=The World is Open: How Web Technology is Revolutionizing Education|year=2009|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-470-46130-3|pages=265–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is designed as a multi-modal, inter-disciplinary learning experience that highlights digital citizenship. Additionally, participating students are encouraged to develop [[Personal Learning Networks|Personal Learning Environments and Networks]], using a variety of Internet tools, while conducting their research.

With the success of the other projects it became apparent that many teachers of elementary students were wanting to also take part in the Flat Classroom experience. Beginning in October 2010 through to February 2011 eight international schools joined together to plan, work through and initiate the project.

'''Schools Involved'''

* The Phoenix School - Salem, Massachusetts
* International School of Bombay - Mumbai, India
* Yew Chung International School of Beijing - China
* International School of Prague - Czech Republic
* Denton Avenue School - New York
* Falcon School for Girls - London, England
* Yarmouth Elementary School - Yarmouth, Maine
* Mill Creek School - Illinois

Five different categories were chosen for the students to investigate their lives and compare them to other students in the project.  The categories chosen were Food and Celebrations, Clothing, Transportation, School Life and Housing.  Within each of these categories teams were created with members from each school participating.  A teacher mentor was in charge of each category to keep the teams focused. Synchronous and asynchornous methods were used to allow for authentic global collaboration among the students. At the end of the project each team combined their information together into one artifact representing their category sharing their lives from around the world. Teachers as well as students greatly benefited from the collaboration and helped to building relationships that are continuing on.

The pilot project was deemed a success and it has developed into a regular project under the Flat Classroom umbrella.

A '''genetically modified''' ('''GM''') '''insect''' is an [[insect]] that has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]], either through [[mutagenesis]], or more precise processes of [[transgenesis]], or [[cisgenesis]]. Motivations for using GM insects include biological research purposes and genetic [[Pest control|pest management]]. Genetic pest management capitalizes on recent advances in biotechnology and the growing repertoire of [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|sequenced genomes]] in order to control pest populations, including insects. Insect genomes can be found in genetic databases such as NCBI,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|title = National Center for Biotechnology Information|website = www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and databases more specific to insects such as FlyBase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://flybase.org/|title = FlyBase Homepage|last = Group|first = FlyBase Web Development|website = flybase.org|access-date = 2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; VectorBase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.vectorbase.org/|title = Welcome to VectorBase! {{!}} VectorBase|website = www.vectorbase.org|access-date = 2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BeetleBase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://beetlebase.org/|title = BeetleBase {{!}}|website = beetlebase.org|access-date = 2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an ongoing initiative started in 2011 to sequence the genomes of 5,000 insects and other arthropods called the i5k.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entsoc.org/press-releases/entomologists-launch-5000-insect-genome-project-i5k]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Lepidoptera]] (e.g. [[monarch butterflies]] and [[silkworms]]) have been genetically modified in nature by the wasp [[bracovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasmi|first=Laila|last2=Boulain|first2=Helene|last3=Gauthier|first3=Jeremy|last4=Hua-Van|first4=Aurelie|last5=Musset|first5=Karine|last6=Jakubowska|first6=Agata K.|last7=Aury|first7=Jean-Marc|last8=Volkoff|first8=Anne-Nathalie|last9=Huguet|first9=Elisabeth|date=2015-09-17|title=Recurrent Domestication by Lepidoptera of Genes from Their Parasites Mediated by Bracoviruses|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005470|journal=PLOS Genet|volume=11|issue=9|pages=e1005470|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005470|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4574769|pmid=26379286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sterile insect technique]] (SIT) was developed conceptually in the 1930s and 1940s and first used in the environment in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hendrichs|first = J.|last2 = Franz|first2 = G.|last3 = Rendon|first3 = P.|date = 1995-01-12|title = Increased effectiveness and applicability of the sterile insect technique through male-only releases for control of Mediterranean fruit flies during fruiting seasons|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1995.tb01303.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Entomology|language = en|volume = 119|issue = 1–5|pages = 371–377|doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0418.1995.tb01303.x|issn = 1439-0418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-4051-2_1|title = History of the Sterile Insect Technique|last = Klassen|first = W.|last2 = Curtis|first2 = C.

If enough males are released, the females will mate with mostly sterile males and lay non-viable eggs. This causes the population of insects to crash (the abundance of insects is extremely diminished), and in some cases can lead to local eradication. Irradiation is a form of mutagenesis which causes random mutations in DNA.

'''Release of Insects carrying Dominant Lethals (RIDL)''' is a control strategy using genetically engineered insects that have (carry) a lethal gene in their genome (an organism's DNA). [[Lethal gene]]s cause death in an organism, and RIDl genes only kill young insects, usually larvae or pupae. Similar to how inheritance of brown eyes is dominant to blue eyes, this lethal gene is dominant so that all offspring of the RIDL insect will also inherit the lethal gene. This lethal gene has a molecular on and off switch, allowing these RIDL insects to be reared. The lethal gene is turned off when the RIDL insects are mass reared in an insectory, and turned on when they are released into the environment. RIDL males and females are released to mate with wild males and their offspring die when they reach the larval or pupal stage because of the lethal gene. This causes the population of insects to crash. This technique is being developed for some insects and for other insects has been tested in the field. It has been used in the Grand Cayman Islands, Panama, and Brazil to control the mosquito vector of dengue, ''Ae. aegypti.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Harris|first = Angela F.|last2 = Nimmo|first2 = Derric|last3 = McKemey|first3 = Andrew R.|last4 = Kelly|first4 = Nick|last5 = Scaife|first5 = Sarah|last6 = Donnelly|first6 = Christl A.|authorlink6=Christl Donnelly|last7 = Beech|first7 = Camilla|last8 = Petrie|first8 = William D.|last9 = Alphey|first9 = Luke|date = 2011-11-01|title = Field performance of engineered male mosquitoes|url = http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n11/abs/nbt.2019.html|journal = Nature Biotechnology|language = en|volume = 29|issue = 11|pages = 1034–1037|doi = 10.1038/nbt.2019|issn = 1087-0156|pmid=22037376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Harris|first = Angela F.|last2 = McKemey|first2 = Andrew R.|last3 = Nimmo|first3 = Derric|last4 = Curtis|first4 = Zoe|last5 = Black|first5 = Isaac|last6 = Morgan|first6 = Siân A.|last7 = Oviedo|first7 = Marco Neira|last8 = Lacroix|first8 = Renaud|last9 = Naish|first9 = Neil|date = 2012-09-01|title = Successful suppression of a field mosquito population by sustained release of engineered male mosquitoes|url = http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n9/abs/nbt.2350.html|journal = Nature Biotechnology|language = en|volume = 30|issue = 9|pages = 828–830|doi = 10.1038/nbt.2350|issn = 1087-0156|pmid=22965050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Carvalho|first = Danilo O.|last2 = McKemey|first2 = Andrew R.|last3 = Garziera|first3 = Luiza|last4 = Lacroix|first4 = Renaud|last5 = Donnelly|first5 = Christl A.|authorlink5=Christl Donnelly|last6 = Alphey|first6 = Luke|last7 = Malavasi|first7 = Aldo|last8 = Capurro|first8 = Margareth L.|title = Suppression of a Field Population of Aedes aegypti in Brazil by Sustained Release of Transgenic Male Mosquitoes|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003864|journal = PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003864|pmc = 4489809|pmid = 26135160|pages=e0003864}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed for use in diamondback moth (''Plutella xylostella''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Harvey-Samuel|first = Tim|last2 = Ant|first2 = Thomas|last3 = Gong|first3 = Hongfei|last4 = Morrison|first4 = Neil I|last5 = Alphey|first5 = Luke|date = 2014-05-01|title = Population-level effects of fitness costs associated with repressible female-lethal transgene insertions in two pest insects|journal = Evolutionary Applications|volume = 7|issue = 5|pages = 597–606|doi = 10.1111/eva.12159|issn = 1752-4571|pmc = 4055180|pmid = 24944572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Harvey-Samuel|first = Tim|last2 = Morrison|first2 = Neil I.|last3 = Walker|first3 = Adam S.|last4 = Marubbi|first4 = Thea|last5 = Yao|first5 = Ju|last6 = Collins|first6 = Hilda L.|last7 = Gorman|first7 = Kevin|last8 = Davies|first8 = T.

===Concerns===
There are concerns about using tetracycline on a routine basis for controlling the expression of lethal genes. There are plausible routes for resistance genes to develop in the [[bacteria]] within the guts of GM-insects fed on tetracycline and from there, to circulate widely in the environment.  For example, antibiotic resistant genes could be spread to [[E.coli]] bacteria and into fruit by GM-Mediterranean fruit flies (''[[Ceratitis capitata]]'').

==Releases==
In January 2016 it was announced that in response to the [[Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus outbreak]], Brazil's National Biosafety Committee approved the releases of more genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitos throughout their country. Previously in July 2015, [[Oxitec]] released results of a test in the [[Juazeiro]] region of Brazil, of so-called "self-limiting" mosquitoes, to fight dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses. They concluded that mosquito populations were reduced by about 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/29/heres-how-gm-mosquitos-with-self-destruct-genes-could-save-us-from-zika-virus/|title=Here's how GM mosquitos with 'self-destruct' genes could save us from Zika virus|year=2016|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitec-mosquito-works-to-control-aedes-aegypti-in-dengue-hotspo/|title=Press release: Oxitec mosquito works to control Aedes aegypti in dengue hotspot|year=2015|publisher=Oxitec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GM-insects were initially placed in cages for field trials. Earlier, the moth was the first crop pest to evolve resistance to [[DDT]]&lt;ref name=transgene/&gt; and eventually became resistant to 45 other insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Studies on the mechanism resistance to insecticides of diamondback moth |first1=Tadashi |last1=Miyata |first2=Tetsuo |last2=Saito |first3=Virapong |last3=Noppun |publisher=Laboratory of Applied Entomology and Nematology, Faculty of Agriculture, Nagoya University|accessdate=September 2015 |url=http://web.entomology.cornell.edu/shelton/diamondback-moth/pdf/85papers/1985DBM33.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, the moth has become immune to all synthetic sprays.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; The gene is a combination of DNA from a [[virus]] and a [[bacterium]].

The gene itself disappears after a few generations, requiring ongoing introductions of GM cultivated males. Modified moths can be identified by their red glow under [[ultraviolet light]], caused by a [[coral]] transgene.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

Opponents claim that the protein made by the synthetic gene could harm non-target organisms that eat the moths. The creators claim to have tested the gene's protein on mosquitoes, fish, beetles, spiders and [[parasitoids]] without observing problems. Farmers near the test site claim that moths could endanger nearby farms' [[organic certification]]. Legal experts say that national organic standards penalize only deliberate GMO use. The creators claim that the moth does not migrate if sufficient food is available, nor can it survive winter weather.&lt;ref name=moth&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/science/replacing-pesticides-with-genetics.html?_r=0 |title=Replacing pesticides with genetics |first= Devin |last=Powell |date=August 31, 2015 |accessdate=September 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediterranean fruit fly===
[[File:Fly October 2008-4.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Mediterranean fruit fly]]
The Mediterranean fruit fly is a global agricultural pest.  They infest a wide range of crops (over 300) including wild fruit, vegetables and nuts, and in the process, cause substantial damage.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28744701|publisher=BBC|title=Genetically modified flies 'could save crops'|author=Hogenboom, M.|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company [[Oxitec]] has developed GM-males which have a lethal gene that interrupts female development and kills them in a process called "pre-pupal female lethality".  After several generations, the fly population diminishes as the males can no longer find mates.  To breed the flies in the laboratory, the lethal gene can be "silenced" using the antibiotic [[tetracycline]].&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"/&gt;

Opponents argue that the long-term effects of releasing millions of GM-flies are impossible to predict.  Dead fly larvae could be left inside crops.  Helen Wallace from [[Genewatch]], an organisation that monitors the use of genetic technology, stated "Fruit grown using Oxitec's GM flies will be contaminated with GM maggots which are genetically programmed to die inside the fruit they are supposed to be protecting".  She added that the mechanism of lethality was likely to fail in the longer term as the GM flies evolve resistance or breed in sites contaminated with tetracycline which is widely used in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom" /&gt;

==Legislation==

In July 2015, the [[House of Lords]] (U.K.) Science and Technology Committee launched an inquiry into the possible uses of GM-insects and their associated technologies. The scope of the inquiry is to include questions such as "Would farmers benefit if insects were modified in order to reduce crop pests? What are the safety and ethical concerns over the release of genetically modified insects? How should this emerging technology be regulated?"&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2015/gm-insects-inquiry/|date=July 20, 2015|publisher=www.parliament.co.uk|accessdate= September 11, 2015|title=Genetically modified insects subject of new Lords inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rastafari}}
The '''''Holy Piby''''' is a proto-[[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] text written by an [[Anguilla]]n, [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]] (d. 1931), for the use of an [[Afrocentric]] [[religion]] in the [[West Indies]] founded by Rogers in the 1920s, known as the [[Afro-Athlican Constructive Gaathly]]. The [[theology]] outlined in this work saw [[Ethiopia]]ns (in the classical sense of all Africans) as the chosen people of God. The church preached self-reliance and self-determination for Africans, using the Piby as its guiding document.

The ''Holy Piby'' is made up of four books. The first, entitled "The First Book of Athlyi Called Athlyi", has only two chapters. The next, "The Second Book of Athlyi Called Aggregation", is the largest, with fifteen chapters, the seventh of which identifies [[Marcus Garvey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/piby/piby12.htm Marcus Garvey], [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] , Last Accessed May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as one of three apostles of God. The "Third Book of Athlyi Named The Facts of the Apostles" presents two prominent members of the [[UNIA-ACL]], [[Robert Lincoln Poston]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/piby/piby21.htm Apostles Anointed], [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] , Last Accessed May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/piby/piby22.htm#fr_4 God spoke to his Apostles], [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] , Last Accessed May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as the other apostles in the [[Holy Trinity]]. The title of the last book is "The Fourth Book of Athlyi Called Precaution". That book is followed by a series of [[catechism]]-style questions and answers wherein Garvey, Davis and Poston are proclaimed to be the saviors of the "down trodden children of [[Ethiopia]]".

Together with the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]'' by [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] and [[Leonard P. Howell]]'s ''[[The Promise Key]]'', the ''Holy Piby'' is today recognized as a root document of Rastafari thought.&lt;ref name="Price2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Price|title=Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OC399TZD2BwC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6768-9|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not strictly speaking a "Rastafari text", it was certainly a primary source of influence to many in the [[Rastafari movement]], who see His Imperial Majesty, [[Haile Selassie I|Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]], as [[Christ]] (or rather, his [[second coming]]). Some Rastafari see Emperor Haile Selassie I as Christ in His Kingly Character as written in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 5 and Marcus Mosia Garvey, as a [[prophet]].

The original edition of the ''Holy Piby'' was published in the United States, at [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 1924. It is very rare. There are no copies listed in either the [[Library of Congress]] nor the [[University of California]] catalogs. 

The ''Holy Piby'' was banned in [[Jamaica]] and other Caribbean Islands in the middle and late 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Hwangap''' ({{korean|hangul=환갑|hanja=還甲}}) in [[Korean language|Korean]], {{nihongo|'''Kanreki'''|還暦/かんれき}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or '''Jiazi''' ({{zh|c=甲子|labels=no}}) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], is a traditional way of celebrating one's 60th birthday in [[East Asia]]. The number 60 means accomplishing one big 60-year cycle and starting another one in one's life following the traditional [[sexagenary cycle|60-year calendar cycle]] of the [[lunar calendar]]. In the traditional way of counting ages, one began a new 60-year cycle on New Year's Day, when everyone became a year older. Thus people who were 60 and had completed their first 60-year cycle entered their second cycle on the New Year's Day when they turned 61 and returned to the same combination of zodiacal symbols that governed the year of their birth. Under the currently popular western method of counting ages, however, one enters one's second cycle on one's 60th birthday. The traditional cycles still remain, but the way of counting ages has changed by one year. 

In the past, a person's average [[life expectancy]] was much lower than 60, so Jiazi or Hwangap or Kanreki also meant a celebration of longevity. The celebration party is also a wish for an even longer and more prosperous life. This party is customarily thrown by the children of the person who is turning 60, unless that person does not have any children, in which case there's no party at all. On one's Hwangap family and relatives prepare a big birthday celebration with lots of food.

With the increasingly longer life spans of people these days, the Hwangap celebration has been given a lesser significance than before; typically, only close family members get together to have a big meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hyong|first1=Kie-joo|title=Korea Today|date=2005|publisher=Yoon Deok-hong|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Koreans now take trips with their families instead of having a big party to celebrate their 60th birthdays. Parties are also thrown when a person reaches 70 (called [[Gohi]] or [[Chilsun]]) or 80 ([[Palsun]]) years of age.

[[File:Mr and Mrs Maybrick.jpg|thumb|Florence and James Maybrick]]
'''James Maybrick''' (24 October 1838 – 11 May 1889) was a [[Liverpool]] cotton merchant. After his death, his wife, [[Florence Maybrick]], was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The "[[Aigburth]] Poisoning" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the [[Atlantic]]. 

More than a century after his death, Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], through his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In 2017, [[Bruce Robinson]] and a team of researchers, who believe the diary to be genuine, found new evidence to support their claim, but it is still (currently) inconclusive. 
A serial killer, who became known as the [[Servant Girl Annihilator]], preyed upon the city of [[Austin, Texas]], during 1884 and 1885, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.

==Life==
Maybrick was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], the son of William Maybrick, an engraver, and his wife, Susanna. He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter's Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks' third of seven sons.

Maybrick's cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the [[United States]] and in 1871 he settled in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted [[malaria]], which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life.
In 1880, Maybrick returned to the company's offices in Britain. Sailing from [[New York City|New York]] on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages{{spaced ndash}}he was 42 to her 18{{spaced ndash}}they began to plan their wedding immediately.

The wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James' Church, [[Piccadilly]], [[London]]. The couple returned to Liverpool to live at Maybrick's home, "Battlecrease House" in [[Aigburth]], a suburb in the south of the city.

They had two children: a son, James Chandler ("Bobo") born in 1882 and a daughter, Gladys Evelyn, born in 1886.

Maybrick continued to divide his time between the American and the British offices of his company and this may have caused difficulties within his marriage. He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband's infidelity.

In Maybrick's case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather's [[will (law)|will]] as "Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James".

==Death==

Maybrick's health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in [[Aigburth]]. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown.

Suspicion immediately fell on Florence and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at [[Liverpool Crown Court]] and, after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The way in which the judge conducted her trial was questioned and this was probably the reason her sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]], some of which she served in a prison in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], and then at the "House of Detention" at [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

A re-examination of her case resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations until her death on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never saw her children again.

==Family==
After their mother's conviction and imprisonment, Maybrick's children James and Gladys Evelyn were taken in by a Dr. Charles Chinner Fuller and his wife Gertrude, and the younger James changed his name to Fuller.

James Fuller became a mining engineer in [[British Columbia]]. In 1911, at the age of 29, while working at the Le Roi Gold Mine in Canada, he died after drinking [[cyanide]], apparently thinking it was just a glass of water. His sister Gladys went to live in [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]], with her uncle and aunt Michael and Laura (née Withers) Maybrick before marrying Frederick James Corbyn in [[Hampstead]], London, in 1912. She died in [[South Wales]] in 1971, where the couple lived in their later years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesmaybrick.org/ was he Jack The Ripper?]. James Maybrick.

James Maybrick’s brother, [[Michael Maybrick]], was a composer who published many pieces and songs under the name Stephen Adams. "Good Company" is one such example, but by far his best known work was the hymn [[The Holy City (song)|“The Holy City”]].

==Jack the Ripper diary==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
In 1992, a document presented as James Maybrick's diary surfaced, which claimed that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. The diary's author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick's established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified.

The diary was  first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a [[Public house|pub]]. When this was queried, the story changed.   Barrett's wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as ''The Diary of Jack the Ripper'' in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the "saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous."&lt;ref&gt;[http://casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/diaryinside.html Jack the Ripper – The Ripper Diary: The Inside Story]. Casebook. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests carried out on the ink used in the diary produced contradictory findings. The first test, using [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) revealed the ink contained no iron, and was based on a synthetic dye called [[nigrosine]],&lt;ref&gt;Baxendale, D.  1992. Report by David Baxendale, Birmingham, Document Evidence&lt;/ref&gt; patented and commercially available in 1867, and in general use in writing inks by the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, J.  1990.  Pen, Ink and Evidence, 978-0813117195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison&lt;/ref&gt; The second TLC test found nothing in the ink inconsistent with the date of 1888, and that the ink contained iron and sodium, but no nigrosine.&lt;ref&gt;Eastaugh, N.  1992.  A report on the analysis of samples from a diary purporting to be by James Maybrick – Conducted by Dr Nicholas Eastaugh – 2 October 1992.  Middlesex&lt;/ref&gt; The third TLC test found nothing inconsistent with the Victorian period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated341"&gt;Harrison, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth TLC test was attempted, but could not be carried out.&lt;ref name="autogenerated341"/&gt;

Several tests were carried out to find out whether the ink contained [[chloroacetamide]], a preservative, in an effort to definitively date the ink. According to one source, chloroacetamide was introduced into the [[Merck Index]] in 1857, but not used commercially in ink until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Dr Earl Morris of the [[Dow Chemical Company]] stated that chloroacetamide has been found in preparations as early as 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth test, this time using [[gas chromatography]], found chloroacetamide present, at 6.5 [[parts per million]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth TLC test found traces of chloroacetamide, but this was attributed to contamination from the [[Scientific control|control]].&lt;ref&gt;Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry. 1994. "Report for The Word Team on the Analysis of the Ink used to write the “Jack the Ripper” Diaries – 24th November 1994."  Leeds, Leeds University&lt;/ref&gt;  The test was carried out again, and no chloroacetamide was found.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry.  1994. "Presence of Chlorocetamide in ink used in diary attributed to “Jack the Ripper” – 1st December 1994." Leeds, Leeds University&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the investigators were sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] and document expert [[Kenneth W. Rendell]]. In Rendell's analysis, he was struck that the handwriting style seemed more 20th century than Victorian. He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies. Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Rendell. Forging History: The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate [[affidavit]]s that he was "the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://casebook.org/suspects/james_maybrick/mb-con.bjan5.html | title=Jack the Ripper – Michael Barrett's Confessions | publisher=Casebook | date=5 January 1995 | accessdate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation.

Some people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book's publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials "F. M." written on a wall behind the victim's body in what appears to be blood. These, they claim, refer to Florence Maybrick, James's wife, whose possible infidelities were the purported motivation for the murders. These claims are dismissed by the majority of experts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casebook.org/dissertations/maybrick_diary/ Jack the Ripper – Maybrick Diary Dissertations]. Casebook.

===Pocket watch===
In June 1993, a gentleman's [[pocket watch]], made by William Verity of [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]] (near [[Leeds]]) 
in 1847 or '48, was presented by Albert Johnson of [[Wallasey]]. The watch has "J. Maybrick" scratched on the inside cover, along with the words "I am Jack", as well as the initials of the five [[Jack the Ripper#Canonical five|canonical Ripper victims]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The watch was examined in 1993 by Dr Stephen Turgoose of the Corrosion and Protection Centre at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]], using an [[electron microscope]]. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the basis of the evidence...especially the order in which the markings were made, it is clear that the engravings pre-date the vast majority of superficial surface scratch marks...the wear apparent on the engravings, evidenced by the rounded edges of the markings and 'polishing out' in places, would indicate a substantial age...whilst there is no evidence which would indicate a recent (last few years) origin...it must be emphasised that there are no features observed which conclusively prove the age of the engravings. They could have been produced recently, and deliberately artificially aged by polishing, but this would have been a complex multi-stage process...many of the features are only resolved by the scanning electron microscope, not being readily apparent in optical microscopy, and so, if they were of recent origin, the engraver would have to be aware of the potential evidence available from this technique, indicating a considerable skill and scientific awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1994, the watch was taken to the Interface Analysis Centre at [[Bristol University]] and studied by Dr Robert Wild using an electron microscope and [[Auger electron spectroscopy]].  Dr Wild found that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Provided the watch has remained in a normal environment, it would seem likely that the engravings were at least several tens of years age...in my opinion it is unlikely that anyone would have sufficient expertise to implant aged, brass particles into the base of the engravings".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Kejimkujik_NP_Nova_Scotia_3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The point which today beats his name within the boundaries of [[Kejimkujik National Park]] which was the inspiration for the novel]]
'''''John Paul's Rock''''' is a [[novel]] published in 1932 by Canadian writer [[Frank Parker Day]], about a [[Mi'kmaq]] guide who fled into Nova Scotia to escape white man's law.&lt;ref&gt;"Nova Scotia Tragedy". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 20, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Minton, Balch &amp; Company, New York, 1932. Hardcover.

==Inspiration==
Jim Charles, who was the inspiration for the novel, was perhaps the most noted Indian guide in both fact and fiction. His notoriety comes not from his guiding expertise but from his discovery of gold and a subsequent brush with the law which led to his fleeing as a fugitive into the wilds of the interior. In the 1860s he was living in a cabin and tending a few heads of cattle and a horse on the point which today beats his name within the boundaries of [[Kejimkujik National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Mike | last = Parker | year = 1990 | title = Guides of the North Woods | publisher = Numbus Publishing Limited | isbn = 0-921054-37-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lan Zi.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Lanzi juggling seven swords, from a collection of Ming Dynasty woodcuts.]][[File:Iron sword and two bronze swords, Warring States Period.JPG|thumb|upright=1|Iron and bronze swords typical of what Lanzi may have juggled.]]

Although juggling in its western form involving props such as balls, rings, and clubs is rarely performed in modern China, at certain periods in Chinese history it was much more popular. In fact, some of the world's earliest known jugglers were Chinese warriors and entertainers who lived during the time of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of Chinese history. References to these artists in ancient Chinese literature have preserved records of their incredible achievements. From such references, it appears that juggling was a well-regarded and highly developed form of ancient Chinese art.

== Xiong Yiliao ==
'''Xiong Yiliao''' ({{zh|t=熊宜僚|p=Xióng Yiliáo}}), was a famous Chu warrior who fought under [[King Zhuang of Chu]] (ruled 613-591 BC) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. Ancient Chinese annals state that he practiced ''nongwan'' ({{zh|t=弄丸|p=nòngwán}}, "throwing multiple objects up and down without dropping"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdic.net/cd/ci/7/ZdicE5ZdicBCZdic84322888.htm] Zdic.net: 弄丸&lt;/ref&gt;), and he is often cited as one of the world’s earliest known jugglers. During a battle in about 603 BC between the states of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]  ({{zh|t=楚國|p=Chǔguó}}) and [[Song (state)|Song]] ({{zh|t=宋国|p=Sòngguó}}), Xiong Yiliao stepped out between the armies and juggled nine balls, which so amazed the Song troops that all five hundred of them turned and fled, allowing the Chu army to win a complete victory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=rmErT7njDI2I2gXG6qH1Dg&amp;id=k0MMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=chinese+acrobatics+through+the+ages&amp;q=xiong+yiliao#search_anchor] Chinese Acrobatics Through the Ages, by Fu Qifeng&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/4376749.htm] 熊宜僚:　楚庄王时勇士&lt;/ref&gt; As Xu Wugui ({{zh|t=徐无鬼|p=Xú Wúguǐ}}) recounts in Chapter 24 of the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]  ({{zh|t=庄子|p=Zhuāngzi}}), “Yiliao of Shinan juggled balls, and the conflict between the two states was ended.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/zhuangzi/xu-wu-gui#n2917] Zhuangzi, translated by James Legge, Xu Wu-gui, verse 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/39-1/39-1,p42.htm] All our Yesterdays: Juggle Magazine, Spring 1987, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lanzi ==
'''Lanzi''' ({{zh|t=蘭子|p=Lánzi}}), another juggler from the Spring and Autumn period who is mentioned in the Chinese annals, lived during the reign of Duke Yuan of [[Song (state)|Song]] ({{zh|t=宋元公|p=Sòng Yuángōng}}, 531-517 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Song (state)]] Wikipedia: Song (state) - Rulers of the State&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly translated, Chapter 8 of the [[Liezi]] ({{zh|t=列子|p=Lièzi}}), an ancient collection of [[Daoist]] sayings, reads as follows:

:In the State of Song there lived a man named Lanzi, who sought favor from Lord Yuan of Song for his skills. Lord Yuan of Song summoned him, and he performed on stilts that were twice as long as his body and attached to his legs. He walked and ran on them, and he also juggled seven swords, alternately throwing them and always keeping five swords in the air. Lord Yuan was amazed, and at once he granted Lanzi gold and silk. Later, Lanzi again returned to perform for Lord Yuan. Lord Yuan angrily said, “Before, I was astonished by your skill, and I was pleased to confer gold and silk. However I am displeased that you have again returned hoping for my reward.” Lanzi was arrested and they planned to kill him, but after a month he was freed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=37533] Liezi: Shuofu (列子說符), Chapter 8, paragraph 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Independent translation adapted from ''Zhang, Z. "Liezi Zhu (列子注)." Shijiazhuang: Hebei Renmin Chubanshe, 1986.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage states that Lanzi juggled the [[jian]] ({{zh|t=劍|p=jiàn}}), a straight, double-edged sword which was used during the Spring and Autumn period.  According to Jian Zhao in ''The Early Warrior and the Birth of the Xia'', Lanzi was a general term for itinerant entertainers in pre-Qin and Han times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nucba.ac.jp/themes/s_cic@cic@nucba/pdf/njlcc032/02ZHAO.pdf] Jian Zhao, ''The Early Warrior and the Birth of the Xia'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Göttingen-Karzer.Arrest.Cell.05.JPG|thumb|The ''Karzer'' at Göttingen University]]
[[File:Karzer Universitätsaula 2.JPG|thumb|Engraving by [[Winthrop Pickard Bell]] on a cell-door in the Karzer of Göttingen University]]
[[Image:Uni-Heidelberg_Studentenkarzer.jpg|thumb|200px|Graffiti in the Heidelberg ''Karzer'']]

A '''Karzer''' was a designated lock-up or detention room to incarcerate students as a punishment, within the jurisdiction of some institutions of learning in [[Germany]] and German-language universities abroad. Karzers existed both at universities and at [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] (similar to a grammar school) in Germany until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Marburg]]'s last Karzer inmate, for example, was registered as late as 1931. 
Responsible for the administration of the ''Karzer'' was the so-called ''[[bedel|Pedell]]'' (English: [[bedel]]), or during later times ''Karzerwärter'' (a [[Prison Warden|warden]]). While Karzer arrest was originally a severe punishment, the respect for this punishment diminished with time, particularly in the 19th century, as it became a matter of honour to have been incarcerated at least once during one's time at university. At the end of the 19th century, as the students in the cell became responsible for their own food and drink and the receiving of visitors became permitted, the "punishment" would often turn into a social occasion with excessive consumption of alcohol.

Karzers have been preserved at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [http://www.tu-freiberg.de/ Freiberg (School of Mines)], [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg]] in [[Erlangen]], and at [[University of Tartu|Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. The Karzer in [[Göttingen]] was known, after the [[bedel|Pedell]] Brühbach, as ''Hotel de Brühbach''; it was moved in the 19th century, because of the extension of the university library,  to the ''Aula'' building; a cell door, preserved from the old Karzer, shows [[graffiti]] by [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Bearing witness to how the students spent the time in the cell are the many memorable wall, table and door graffiti left by students in the cells and today shown as tourist attractions in the older German universities.

{{Critical pedagogy}}'''''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''''' is a 1977 book on [[education]], written by [[Great Britain|British]] social scientist and [[Cultural studies|cultural theorist]] [[Paul Willis]]. A [[Columbia University Press]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;edition, titled the "Morningside Edition," was published in the [[United States]] shortly after its reception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1981|isbn=0-231-05357-6|location=New York, NY|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's first major book, ''Learning to Labour'' relates the findings of his [[Ethnography|ethnographic study]] of [[Working class|working-class]] boys at a [[secondary school]] in [[England]]. In it, Willis attempts to explain the role of [[Youth|youths']] [[culture]] and [[socialization]] as mediums by which schools route working-class students into working-class jobs. [[Stanley Aronowitz]], in the preface to the Morningside edition, hails the book as a key text in [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[social reproduction]] theory about education, advancing previous work in education studies by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis|Herbert Gintis's]] [[Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|Schooling in Capitalist America]], as well as work by [[Michael Apple]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Learning to Labour'' has been recognized by [[Sociology|sociologists]], [[Critical pedagogy|critical pedagogues]], and researchers in education studies as a landmark study of schooling and culture, and is one of the most cited sociological texts in education studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor in New Times|last=Dolby|first=Nadine|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Greg|last7=|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2004|isbn=0-415-94854-1|editor-last=Dolby|editor-first=Nadine|location=New York, NY|pages=1–2|chapter=Learning to Labor in New Times: An Introduction|quote=|editor-last2=Dimitriadis|editor-first2=Greg|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arnot, Madeleine. "Male Working-Class Identities and Social Justice: A Reconsideration of Paul Willis's ''Learning to Labor'' in Light of Contemporary Research." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Learning to Labour'' represents Paul Willis's ethnographic [[Field research|fieldwork]] with twelve [[Working class|working-class]] British male students, attending their second-to-last year of schooling at "Hammertown Boys," a modern, boys-only school in a town in [[The Midlands|the British Midlands]]. Beginning in 1972, Willis followed the boys for about six months, observing their social behavior with each other and their school and interviewing them periodically. He also studied them at later points up until 1976. The makeup of Hammertown Boys, and Hammertown, is largely working-class, with some [[Immigration|immigrants]] from [[South Asia]] and the [[West Indies]]. At the time of the study, the local school system was expanding its infrastructure and exploring new pedagogical methods, thanks to the implementation of the [[Raising of school leaving age in England and Wales|Raising of School Leaving Age]] policies in September [[1972]] that were in line with [[education reform]]s that sought to keep youth in schools for a greater span of time, as well as offer them opportunities for gainful employment and [[Social mobility|socioeconomic mobility]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Willis's research was made possible by funding through the [[Social Science Research Council]]. Willis acknowledged the advice and support of members of the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], including cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], in writing in the book.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Summary ==
''Learning to Labour'' is organized into two sections: ethnography and analysis. In Part One, Willis describes and analyzes the nonconformist counter-school culture produced by Hammertown Boys' [[White people|White]], working-class boys (called "lads"). In this section, he applies [[thick description]] and ethnographic analysis to the counter-school culture of the lads, recognizing the legitimacy and reality of the students' own interpretive accounts of schooling. In Part Two, Willis analyzes his own ethnography to produce a theoretical account of how counter-school culture plays a vital role in leading working-class students into subordinate, low-wage labor positions in adult life, fulfilling what he calls their "self-damnation."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class youths' recognition of, and reaction against, the dominating, [[Discipline|disciplinary]] mechanisms of school help seal their future outcomes as workers, in turn enabling the social reproduction of [[Social class|class positions]].

=== Part One: Ethnography ===
Willis uses the [[qualitative research]] methods of participant observation and group interviews to study an informal (but socially cohesive) group of twelve lads at Hammertown Boys. He distinguishes between two distinct, informal groups of the working-class students at Hammertown Boys: lads and 'ear'oles. Whereas the lads are those nonconformist students who defy authority, 'ear'oles are those conformist students who invest themselves in formal learning and academic achievement, and therefore in the authority of teachers and the school system. The term "'ear'ole" recalls the earhole or [[earlobe]], signifying conformist students' passive reception of learning. This contrasts with lads' rowdy, active behaviour in school. The lads perceive themselves as more manly, more authentic, and more independent than the 'ear'oles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The lads informally socialise and organise themselves against the 'ear'oles and the school as an institution, producing a culture of nonconformity, rebellion, and opposition to their school's authority figures and strictures. It is not only important that the lads smoke and [[Heterosexuality|have sex with girls]], but are seen to smoke and recognized to have had sexual liaisons. Behaviours that define the forms of this culture, such as playing pranks on teachers, harassing conformist students, and refusing to inform teachers of each other's behaviour, also build a sense of solidarity and identity among their group. The lads' culture is also [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[Racism|racist]], as girls and non-Whites are excluded from their informal group. It also strongly identifies with the actual, working-class environment from which it originates. In terms of working-class identity, their culture has much in common with the culture of working-class shop floors. This includes the active search for producing moments of excitement, disorder, and enjoyment in what is an otherwise boring, routine, and meaningless span of time of work for adult workers, and [[school discipline]] for students.

Over the course of their time as Hammertown Boys, the lads were recognised by school authorities as a distinct "anti-school group." However, when they were of age to legally leave school, in their fifth year in secondary school, few of them did.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, as the lads took career-preparation lessons in school, they rejected the legitimacy of formal credentials and qualifications, prizing instead manual labour as superior to and more authentic than mental labour. This inverted the lessons' insinuation of mental labour’s being more desirable than [[manual labour]] by dint of its higher [[socioeconomic status]]. By the end of the ethnography, the lads were easily able to enter working-class jobs, including [[Plumber|plumbing]], [[Bricklayer|bricklaying]], and trainee [[Machinist|machine work]]. However, half of them left their job for another after one year of work, and one was unable to find work at all. Willis ended the ethnographic study in autumn 1976, with the lads routed into working-class labour with little hope of rising into the [[middle class]], even as they subjectively experienced manual labour and income as empowering. Willis writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a sense in which, despite the ravages -- fairly well contained at this point anyway -- manual work stands for something and is a way of contributing to and substantiating a certain view of life which criticises, scorns and devalues others as well as putting the self, as they feel it, in some elusive way ahead of the game. These feelings arise precisely from a sense of their own labour power which has been learnt and truly appropriated as insight and self-advance within the depths of the counter-school culture as it develops specific class forms in the institutional context. It is difficult to think how attitudes of such strength and informal and personal validity could have been formed in any other way. It is they, not formal schooling, which carry 'the lads' over into a certain application to the productive process. In a sense, therefore, there is an element of self-domination in the acceptance of subordinate roles in western capitalism. However, this damnation is experienced, paradoxically, as a form of true learning, appropriation and as a kind of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Part Two: Analysis ===
In the second half of ''Learning to Labour'', Willis synthesises his observations of the lads' counter-school culture at Hammertown Boys in order to produce a theory of social reproduction that integrates culture as a key element alongside education. He proposes that the working-class lads enter working-class jobs of their own apparent volition, but this is not to be understood as merely a psychological inclination toward these jobs, nor as merely the deterministic effect of capitalist [[ideology]] persuading them to select them. Rather, it is in school that the lads acquire a distorted [[class consciousness]] through their counter-school culture, in which they end up embracing working-class, manual labor as more affirming and authentic. A rebellious culture can successfully oppose the norms of capitalism transmitted in school, but the success is, in Willis's terms, a "pyrrhic victory," for they end up taking on working-class jobs as adults.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In his analysis, Willis defines and uses the following concepts: 
* '''Teaching paradigm:''' The teaching paradigm is the principal set of demands and incentives used by the school system. According to this paradigm, students consent to behave obediently and in deference to their teacher in exchange for promised credentials that will help them move upward socioeconomically. This paradigm, which helps the teacher with authority, implies the desirability of obedience, deference, and conformity for working-class students, and recalls the banking paradigm in [[Paulo Freire|Paulo Freire's]] ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2000|isbn=0-8264-1276-9|location=New York, NY|pages=72–75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Willis notes the importance of teachers' winning from their students consent to the teaching paradigm, as their exchange-based authority does not permit them to directly impose it on students.
* '''Differentiation''' and '''integration''': Willis describes differentiation as the process by which working-class students reinterpret, invert, criticize, and reject the teaching paradigm as failing to meet their objective interests as members of the working class. Aspects of differentiation constitute, in part, the lads' counter-school culture. Integration is the opposite of differentiation, the process by which agents of the school system, such as teachers, attempt to legitimise the role of schooling in improving students' lives. The tug-of-war between differentiation and integration is, in Willis's observation, continually manifested through day-to-day contests between teachers attempting to maintain their authority and lads attempting to subvert it. 
* '''Penetration''' and '''limitation''': These struggles between the lads and teachers occasionally lead to penetration, which denotes the lads' insights into their own class condition, as interpreted through the lens of their counter-school culture. It is through penetrations that working-class youth recognise the illusions of the teaching paradigm, and more generally of [[liberal democracy]] and [[Capitalism|capitalism's]] promises of advancement through education. Willis notes, however, that penetrations are, for anyone immersed in their own culture, partial and disorganised, meaning that they are culturally, subjectively distorted, and unable to bloom into [[Political radicalism|politically radical]] class consciousness. Later, he describes this partiality as limitations. The limitations of penetrations grant the lads a sense of freedom, affirmation, solidarity, and empowerment in their rebellion and embrace of working-class identity. For example, that the lads understand the teaching paradigm's valuation of mental labour as superior to manual labour is a penetration; on the other hand, that they respond by culturally affirming manual labour over mental labour, as more sensual and authentic, shows the partiality of their perpetration. Willis also identifies limitations in the intersection of patriarchy and capitalism: The lads approach manual labour as a means to accomplish a [[Masculinity|masculine identity]], and identify [[gender]] [[domestic labor|domestic labour]] and mental labour as girlish and "[[Sissy|cissy]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 147-149.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Ideology]]''': Drawing on the theory of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Willis argues that schools are also complicit in social reproduction as [[Ideological State Apparatus|state institutions for ideology]]. [[Career counseling]] programs in secondary school emphasise individual competition, promote the desirability of [[White-collar worker|white-collar labour]], and [[Reification (Marxism)|reify]] adult work as an inevitable and natural stage of life. Ideology also has the power to undo any successful penetrations, by acknowledging the facts of [[economic inequality]] and domination in the workplace by [[Supervisor|bosses]], without organising these facts in any kind of systematic framework of class, [[wage labour]], and exploitation. Ideology and penetration are at odds, and help determine the degree to which working-class youth identify with the working class. 
In ''Learning to Labour'', the informal, creative, counter-school culture of the lads is vital to understanding the reproduction of class structure. Willis notes that working-class cultures are distinct in that they have no stake in subscribing to the dominant capitalist ideology, and therefore have the potential to subvert it. Yet it is this subversion that routes the lads into working-class labour, seemingly of their own volition. They use culture to explain and interpret the structures of schooling and work that enfold them, but doing so also steers them into social reproduction.

Willis warns against an overtly deterministic mode of social reproduction, encouraging the consideration of culture in a mediating role. He also warns against policy that would focus strictly on changing culture as a means to change material outcomes in education and labour. ''Learning to Labour'' ends with several practical suggestions for changing education accordingly, including:
* Recognising the competition inherent to an educational [[meritocracy]] 
* Respecting the insights and logic of youth working-class culture 
* Communicating to students without denigrating their social identities 
* Discussing elements of students' own cultural forms, including wage labour, [[street fighting]], sexism, and rebellion 
* Recognising the limits of pedagogy and teaching paradigms in reaching disaffected working-class students, as well as the necessity of some authority in classrooms. Although Willis acknowledges the possibility of using radical pedagogical methods, he suggests they would be ineffective for students as the Hammertown Boys lads, who are likely to register a teacher's withdrawal from authority as simply their victory over him.
In his afterword to the Morningside Edition, Willis reflected that ''Learning to Labour'' contributed to the academic literature of education by advancing social reproduction theory and by asserting the complicity of both liberal educational policies and student in causing educational and socioeconomic inequality. While researchers must be skeptical of schools' purported role in improving social mobility, schools are not all-powerful in reproducing class:&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be a justified skepticism about liberal claims in education, but the "Reproduction" perspective moves too quickly to a simple version of their opposite. Apparently, education unproblematically does the bidding of the capitalist economy by inserting working class agents into unequal futures ... The actually varied, complex, and creative field of human consciousness, culture, and capacity is reduced to the dry abstraction of structural determination. Capital requires it, therefore schools do it! Humans become dummies, dupes, or zombies. Their innermost sensibilities are freely drawn on. The school is even the main site for this cosmic drawing; for all we are told of how this actually happens, schools may as well be "black boxes." This will not do theoretically. It certainly will not do politically. Pessimism reigns supreme in this, the most spectacular of secular relations of pre-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==
''Learning to Labour'' was received with wide acclaim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. x-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after its original release,  Willis discussed his research with a variety of educators and community groups, who provided both support and criticism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An anthology of essays, titled ''Learning to Labour in New Times'', was published in 2004, growing from a 2002 [[American Educational Research Association]] meeting to recognise ''Learning to Labour''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 25th anniversary. [[Jean Anyon]], Michael Apple, [[Peter McLaren]], and other academics contributed essays to the anthology, applying Willis's ethnography to contemporary issues of gender, race, [[neoliberalism]], [[Precarious work|work precarity]], [[globalization|globalisation]], media, and [[United States incarceration rate|mass incarceration in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Black people|Black]] youth in United States schools develop cultures of oppositionality, collective identity, and "tough fronts," similar to the Hammertown lads, but are led to incarceration instead of working-class jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Kathleen; Anyon, Jean.

In the wider field of cultural studies, ''Learning to Labour'' was recognized as an important text in [[youth studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodernism and Popular Culture|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0-203-16833X|location=New York, NY|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as working-class leisure and culture, whereas other contemporaneous leftist research in the social sciences tended to foreground employment, [[Trade union|labour unions]], and political organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|year=1980|title=Settling Accounts with Subcultures: A Feminist Critique|journal=Screen Education|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis acknowledged that shortly after its first release, some right-wing policymakers and politicians sought to appropriate its findings to justify [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] and legitimate educational inequality.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; While Willis repudiated this use of his work, he even more strongly criticised well-intending, liberal policies that sought to extirpate counter-school cultures: &lt;blockquote&gt;Besides, even in the worst case of interpretation and action taken on the book-the "oiling" paradigm-a cynical recognition of actual cultures is preferable to their attempted destruction as "pathological" cases, or their chimerical projection into shocking Satanic forms visited upon us from nowhere. "Solutions" based on such myths are likely to be cruel because their recipients were never seen as real people.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs.'' p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Willis further advanced concepts of profane, working-class youth culture and symbolic labour in his 1990 book ''Common Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Culture|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Open University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-8133-1097-0|location=Buckingham, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Peter; Scatamburlo-D'Annibale. "Paul Willis, Class Consciousness, and Critical Pedagogy." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Researchers in education and [[cultural studies]], including [[Angela McRobbie]], criticized ''Learning to Labour'' for neglecting girls and conformist male students in its study. McRobbie wrote that Willis's study took little concern with the overt and violent sexism of the lads falling into a wider pattern of cultural studies' failure to prioritise gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|date=2010|title=Reflections on Feminism, Immaterial Labour and the Post-Fordist Regime|journal=New Formations|volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Youth Culture: From Jackie to Just Seventeen|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1991|isbn=978-0333452646|location=Boston|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Willis acknowledged this sexism, but replied that he had indeed incorporated a construction of working-class [[masculinity]] as "self-entrapment."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's ethnography was also criticised for an unclear methodology, inviting questions of [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and generalization as a "fish 'n' chips ethnography.'"&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Gord (1980). "Cries from the School Corridors of North York, Birmingham and Tyneside." ''This Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also replied to ''Learning to Labour'' that cultures of resistance were absent in their own classrooms. In turn, Willis argued that such cultures are not immediately obvious, and may be interpreted as individualised behaviours. Moreover, studies of student culture require extensive fieldwork to generate [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], and quantitative methods such as surveys, which may produce greater reliability, cannot satisfactorily report on cultural forms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Merkur''''', subtitled '''''Deutsche Zeitschrift für europäisches Denken''''', is Germany's leading intellectual review, published monthly in [[Stuttgart]] by Klett Cotta.&lt;ref name="Economy Point"&gt;{{cite web|last=Economy Point|title=Merkur (magazine)|url=http://www.economypoint.org/m/merkur-magazine.html|publisher=Economy-point.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History and profile==
''Merkur'' has been published since 1947 and had an edition of approximately 4,800 copies as of July 2011.&lt;ref name="Economy Point"/&gt; The magazine was formerly headquartered in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="Eur2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Europe 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9QYndAPmuQC&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=30 November 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-152-0|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of its history, many influential scholars and public intellectuals have written for ''Merkur''. Among them were philosophers such as [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and [[Axel Honneth]], or sociologists such as [[Arnold Gehlen]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Hans Joas]], and [[Dirk Baecker]], but also writers such as [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Ilse Aichinger]], [[Alfred Andersch]], [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], and [[Kathrin Röggla]]. ''Merkur'' has been able to gather voices from both the left and the right, which is unusual in the divisive German intellectual landscape. 

In January 2016, the 800th issue was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klett-Cotta|title=MERKUR 2016|url=https://volltext.merkur-zeitschrift.de/journal/mr_2016_01|accessdate=29  December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bauhaus 3 Chair.jpg|thumb|Three versions of [[Marcel Breuer]]'s [[Wassily Chair]]"]]
'''Modern furniture''' refers to furniture produced from the late 19th century through the present that is influenced by [[modernism]]. Post-[[World War II]] ideals of cutting excess, [[commodification]], and practicality of materials in design heavily influenced the aesthetic of the furniture. It was a tremendous departure from all furniture design that had gone before it. There was an opposition to the [[decorative arts]], which included [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]], and [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] styles. Dark or gilded carved wood and richly patterned fabrics gave way to the glittering simplicity and geometry of polished metal. The forms of furniture evolved from visually heavy to visually light. This shift from decorative to minimalist principles of design can be attributed to the introduction of new technology, changes in philosophy, and the influences of the principles of architecture. As [[Philip Johnson]], the founder of the Department of Architecture and Design at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] articulates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Philip|year=1933 |title=Objects 1900 and Today: An Exhibition of Decorative and Useful Objects Contrasting Two Periods of Design|url= |location=New York, NY|publisher=Museum of Modern Art |pages=14 |accessdate= April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Today industrial design is functionally motivated and follows the same principles as modern architecture: machine-like simplicity, smoothness of surface, avoidance of ornament&amp;nbsp;... It is perhaps the most fundamental contrast between the two periods of design that in 1900 the Decorative Arts possessed&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With the machine aesthetic, modern furniture easily came to promote factory modules, which emphasized the time-managing, efficient ideals of the period. Modernist design was able to strip down decorative elements and focus on the design of the object in order to save time, money, material, and labour. The goal of modern design was to capture timeless beauty in spare precision.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;

==Philosophy==
Prior to the modernist design movement, there was an emphasis on furniture as an ornament. The length of time a piece took to create was often a measure of its value and desirability. The origins of design can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution and the birth of mechanized production. With new resources and advancements, a new philosophy emerged, one that shifted the emphasis of objects being created for decorative purposes to being designs that promote functionality, accessibility, and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiell|first=Charlotte &amp; Peter|title=Design of the 20th century|year=1999|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln [u.a.]|isbn=3822858730|pages=6–768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of accessible, mass-produced design that is affordable to anyone was not only applied to industrial mechanics, but also to the aesthetics of architecture and furniture. This philosophy of practicality came to be called [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. It became a popular "catchword" and played a large role in theories of modern design. Functionalism rejected the imitation of stylistic and historical forms and sought an establishment of functionality in a piece. Functionalist designers would consider the interaction of the design with its user and how many of the features, such as shape, colour, and size, would conform to the human posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=/ Gerd Hatje, Peter Kaspar ; translated by Robert E.|title=1601 decorating ideas for modern living : a practical guide to home furnishing and interior design|year=1974|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=978-0810901292|pages=15–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western design generally, whether architectural or design of furniture, had for millennia sought to convey an idea of lineage, a connection with tradition and history. 
However, the modern movement sought newness, originality, technical innovation, and ultimately the message that it conveyed spoke of the present and the future, rather than of what had gone before it.
&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kaplan, Wendy|title=Designing modernity : the arts of reform and persuasion : 1885-1945 ; selections from the Wolfsonian ; [the Wolfsonian, Miami Beach, November 11, 1995 - April 28, 1996 ...]|year=1995|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=0500237069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential Groups==
The modernist design seems to have evolved out of a combination of influences: technically innovative materials and new manufacturing methods. Following the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], new philosophies and artists emerged from the [[De Stijl]] movement in the Netherlands, the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] and the [[Bauhaus]] school, both located in Germany.

===De Stijl===
The De Stijl (The Style) movement, was founded in 1917 by Theo Van Doesburg in Amsterdam. The movement was based on the principles of promoting abstraction and universality by reducing excessive elements down to the essentials of form and colour. Dutch design generally has shown a preference for simple materials and construction, but De Stijl artists, architects, and designers strove to combine these elements to create a new visual culture. Characteristics of furniture from this movement include simplified geometry of vertical and horizontal compositions and pure primary colours and black and white. It was the rejection of the decorative excesses from Art Nouveau and promoted logicality through construction and function. Influential artists from this movement include [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Mies van der Rohe]], who continued to evolve the ideas of modernist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/ |title=Movements: De Stijl |publisher=Guggenheim Museum |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icons/&gt;{{rp|33–183}}

===Deutscher Werkbund===
Founded in 1907 in Munich, Germany, the Deutscher Werkbund was an organization of artists, designers, and manufacturers that pushed to create a cultural utopia achieved through a design and new ideas in the early twentieth century. They shared the Modern thought of "form follows function" as well as the "ethnically pure" design principles such as quality, material honestly, functionality, and sustainability. The DWB played a key role in advocating these ideas to other German artists and designers, which inspired the development of many Modern design institutions. Among the most notable architects and designers from the DWB are: [[Hermann Muthesius]], [[Peter Behrens]], and Ludwig [[Mies van der Rohe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumderdinge.org/institution/|work=Deutscher Werkbund |title=Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bauhaus School===
The Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, by architect [[Walter Gropius]], was an art school that combined all aspects of art. It eventually was forced to move to [[Dessau]], Germany, in 1925 due to political tensions, then Berlin, in 1932 until the doors of the school were closed from the pressure of the [[Nazi]] regime. With the change of location came a change of direction in the institution. The Bauhaus adopted an emphasis on production in Dessau, but maintained its intellectual concerns in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams]|first=Bauhaus-Archiv. [Ed.: Angelika Taschen. Engl. transl.: Karen|title=Bauhaus 1919 - 1933|year=2002|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=3822821055|edition=Engl. Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the goal of the institution was to combine intellectual, practical, commercial, and aesthetic concerns through art and technology. The Bauhaus promoted the unity of all areas of art and design: from typography to tableware, clothing, performance, furniture, art, and architecture. Prominent artists and designers from the Bauhaus include: [[Marcel Breur]], [[Marianne Brandt]], [[Hannes Meyer]] (who was Gropius's successor, only to be replaced by [[Mies van der Rohe]]).&lt;ref name=icons /&gt;{{rp|38–138}}&lt;ref&gt;Antonelli, Paola (2003). Objects of Design from the Museum of Modern Art. New York, NY: Museum of Modern Art. {{ISBN|9780870706110}}. Retrieved April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===African and Asian culture===
An aesthetic preference for the baroque and the complex was challenged not only by new materials and the courage and creativity of a few Europeans, but also by the growing access to African and Asian design. In particular the influence of Japanese design is legend: in the last years of the 19th century the [[Edo period]] in Japan, Japanese isolationist policy began to soften, and trade with the west began in ernest. The artifacts that emerged were striking in their simplicity, their use of solid planes of color without ornament, and contrasting use of pattern. A tremendous fashion for all things Japanese – [[Japonism]] – swept Europe. Some say that the western [[Art Nouveau]] movement emerged from this influence directly. Designers such as [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]] and [[Eileen Gray]] are known for both their modern and [[Art Deco]] work, and they and others like [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] are notable for a certain elegant blending of the two styles.

==Materials==
[[Image:Eames Wood Chair.jpg|thumb|[[Eames Lounge Chair Wood]] (LCW)]]
The use of new materials, such as steel in its many forms; glass, used by [[Walter Gropius]]; molded plywood, such as that used by [[Charles and Ray Eames]]; and of course [[plastics]], were formative in the creation of these new designs. They would have been considered pioneering, even shocking in contrast to what came before. This interest in new and innovative materials and methods - produced a certain blending of the disciplines of technology and art. And this became a working philosophy among the members of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. The Werkbund was a government-sponsored organization to promote German art and design around the world. Many of those involved with it including Mies van der Rohe, [[Lilly Reich]] and others, were later involved in the [[Bauhaus]] School, and so it is not surprising perhaps that the Bauhaus School took on the mantle of this philosophy. They evolved a particular interest in using these new materials in such a way that they might be mass-produced and therefore make good design more accessible to the masses.

===Gerrit Rietveld's Red-Blue Armchair===
The first versions of [[Gerrit Rietveld]]'s [[Red and Blue Chair|Red-Blue Armchair]] were created around 1917. However, they were originally stained black - the colour was eventually added to give characteristics of De Stijl in 1923. Rietveld's intent was to design a piece of furniture that could be cheaply mass-produced. He uses standard beechwood laths and pine planks that intersect and are fixed by wooden pegs. The functions of construction, the seat, the back and armrests are explicitly separated from one another visually. In fact, Rietveld saw the chair as the skeleton of an overstuffed armchair with all the excessive components removed. 
&lt;ref name=icons /&gt;{{rp|32–183}}

===Marcel Breuer's Wassily Chair===
This modernist creation is perhaps one of the most iconic furniture designs of all time.  The [[Wassily Chair]], also known as the Model B3 chair, was designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] in 1925-26 while he was the head of the cabinet-making workshop at the Bauhaus, in Dessau, Germany.

This piece is particularly influential because it introduces a simple, yet elegant and light-weight industrial material to be used in structures within the domestic space: chrome plated tubular steel. The design of the chair is revolutionary with its use of symmetrical, geometric planes framed by the tubular steel. Breuer uses simple straps on canvas for the seat, back and armrests to support the seated figure. The concept of the use of tubular steel, a never before seen the material in the domestic space was inspired by the handles of Breuer's bicycle. He reasoned that if such a material was light-weight yet strong enough to support the body in motion, it is likely to be able to support the body at rest. He applies uncomplicated essentials (the canvas strips) to create a functional aesthetic as well. Nonetheless, the Model B3 Chair (dubbed the Wassily Chair by the manufacturing company, Gavina after learning of the anecdote involving the painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]) inspired many artists and designers to include the use of chrome plated steel, including [[Le Corbusier]], who includes it as a structure for his Chaise Longue.

===Le Corbusier Chaise Longue===
Inspired by Marcel Breuer's use of chrome plated tubular steel in his Wassily Chair, in 1928, Le Corbusier creates a sleek steel support for the back and seat of his [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|Chaise Longue]]. The Chaise Longue features a movable seat section and an adjustable headrest, which is an early example of [[ergonomic]] design. With the tubular steel frames and leather or skin upholstery, the sleek Chaise Longue was initially manufactured for private French house commissions including the [[Villa Savoye]], Poissy (1929–31) and the [[Ville-d'Avray]]. This piece epitomizes the mass production of the industrial age through the use of materials and structure. However, unlike the Wassily Chair, the complex design made reproduction expensive.&lt;ref name=icons /&gt;{{rp|48–183}}

===Eileen Gray side table===
Designed in 1927 as a bedside table for the guest room in [[E-1027]], the home [[Eileen Gray]] designed for herself (and [[Jean Badovici]]) in Cap Martin, France, the asymmetry of this piece is characteristic of her "[[non-conformist]]" design style in her architectural projects and furniture. Eileen Gray had always been influenced by Japanese lacquer and furniture, and the minimalist lines and elegant structure found normally in traditional Japanese works are found in most of Gray's objects. The name, E-1027, can be seen in a somewhat romantic reading: The ''E'' stands for "Eileen" and the numbers, corresponding to their sequence in the alphabet, stand for ''J'', ''B'', and ''G''. The second and tenth letter allude to her friend and mentor, [[Jean Badovici]].Gray's emphasis on functionalist design is apparent in her use of tubular steel and the concentric symmetry of the surface. Notably, this piece also has specific utility, as it can be adjusted such that one can eat breakfast in bed on it. Gray's sister had requested such accommodation during her visits to E-1027.

===Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair===
The [[Barcelona chair]] has come to represent the Bauhaus design movement. Many consider it to be functional art, rather than just furniture. Designed by [[Mies Van Der Rohe]] and [[Lilly Reich]] in 1929 for the German Pavilion at the international design fair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emfurn.com/blogs/elite-modern-furniture-blog/15573833-barcelona-chair-real-or-fake|title=Barcelona Chair|publisher=emfurn.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]], it is said to have been inspired by both the folding chairs of the [[Pharaoh]]s, and the 'X' shaped footstools of the [[Roman citizen|Romans]], and dedicated to the Spanish royal families. Like other designers following Breuer's example, he incorporates the use of chrome-plated flat steel bars to create a single 'S'-shaped curve. The front legs cross the 'S' curve of the bars forming the seat and the back legs. It creates a sleek and intentionally simple aesthetic to the piece.

===Robin Day Polyrop chair===
In 1963 [[Robin Day (designer)|Robin Day]] designed the ''Polyprop'' chair for the British furniture design house [[Hille (furniture)|Hille]]. Made of moulded [[polypropylene]], the ''Polyprop'' sold in millions and became the world's best-selling chair. Today it is regarded as a modern design classic, and has been celebrated by [[Royal Mail]] with a [[commemorative postage stamp]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=The people's chair|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/13/weekend7.weekend2|accessdate=26 September 2015|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hille&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Day Polyside and Armchair|url=http://www.hille.co.uk/robin-day-polyside-and-armchair|website=hille.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112012225/http://www.hille.co.uk/robin-day-polyside-and-armchair|archivedate=12 January 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noguchi coffee table===
[[Noguchi table]] was designed by [[Isamu Noguchi]] (1904–1988), a sculptor, draftsman, potter, architect, landscape architect, product, furniture and stage designer. Half American, half Japanese, he is famous for his organic modern forms. He often stated, "Everything is sculpture, any materials, any idea without hindrance born into space, I consider sculpture." The [[Noguchi table]] – has become famous for its unique and unmistakable simplicity. It is refined and at the same time natural, it is one of the most sought-after pieces associated with the modern classic furniture movement.

==Chronology==
Chronologically the design movement that produced modern furniture design, began earlier than one might imagine. Many of its most recognizable personalities were born of the 19th or the very beginning of the 20th centuries.

*[[Walter Gropius]] 1883–1969
*[[Lilly Reich]] 1885–1947
*[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] 1886–1969
*[[Eileen Gray]] 1878–1976
*[[Le Corbusier]] 1887–1965
*[[Marcel Breuer]] 1902–1981

They were teaching and studying in Germany and elsewhere in the 1920s and 30s. At among other places the [[Bauhaus]] school of art and architecture. The furniture that was produced during this era is today known as "Modern Classic Furniture" or "[[Mid Century Modern]]".

Both the Bauhaus School and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] had as their specific creative emphasis the blending of technology, new materials and art.

==Transitional furniture==
Obviously not all furniture produced since this time is modern, for there is still a tremendous amount of traditional design being reproduced for today's market and then, of course, there is also an entire breed of design which sits between the two, and is referred to as [[transitional design]]. Neither entirely modern or traditional, it seeks to blend elements of multiple styles. It often includes both modern and traditional as well as making visual reference to classical Greek form and/or other non-western styles (for example Tribal African pattern, Asian scroll work etc.).

==Modern to contemporary==
Today contemporary furniture designers and manufacturers continue to evolve the design. Still seeking new materials, with which to produce unique forms, still employing simplicity and lightness of form, in preference to a heavy ornament. And most of all they are still endeavouring to step beyond what has gone before to create entirely new visual experiences for us.

The designs that prompted this paradigm shift were produced in the middle of the 20th century, most of them well before 1960. And yet they are still regarded internationally as symbols of the modern age, the present and perhaps even the future. Modern Classic Furniture became an icon of elegance and sophistication.

A '''mummy''' is a deceased [[human]] or an [[animal]] whose [[skin]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], extreme cold, very low [[humidity]], or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately [[embalming|embalmed]] with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally [[desiccation|desiccated]] bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD (See the section [[#Etymology and meaning|Etymology and meaning]]).

Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent,&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt; both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million [[animal mummies]] have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.&lt;ref name="pets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html|title=Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are [[sacred ibis]], and radiocarbon dating suggests  the Egyptian Ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S. El|last4=Ikram|first4=S.|last5=Curtis|first5=C.|last6=Holland|first6=B.|last7=Willerslev|first7=E.|last8=Millar|first8=C.D.|last9=Lambert|first9=D.M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of Sacred Ibis mummies from ancient Egypt|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X15301243|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=4|pages=355–361|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the well-known mummies of [[ancient Egypt]], deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The [[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave mummies]] of Fallon, Nevada in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the [[Chinchorro mummies]] found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartkusa |first=Luke |last2=Amarasiriwardena |first2=Dulasiri |last3=Arriaza |first3=Bernardo |last4=Bellis |first4=David |last5=Yañez |first5=Jorge |year=2011 |title=Exploring lead exposure in ancient Chilean mummies using a single strand of hair by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) |journal=Microchemical Journal |volume=98 |pages=267–274 |doi=10.1016/j.microc.2011.02.008 |issn=0026-265X |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a [[decapitation|severed head]] dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 AD at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America.&lt;ref name="head"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeometry.org/paleoamerican.htm|title=Andean Head Dated 6,000 Years Old|publisher=archaeometry.org|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology and meaning ==
&lt;!-- Do not change "Etymology" to "Egyptology" --&gt;
The English word ''mummy'' is derived from medieval Latin ''mumia'', a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word ''mūmiya'' (مومياء) and from a Persian word ''mūm'' (wax),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mummy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: mummy |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate= 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant an embalmed corpse, and as well as the bituminous embalming substance, and also meant "[[Asphalt|bitumen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mummy |title=origin of word "mummy" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}} Also "mummy" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed6barch#page/763/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']. Also "momie" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/momie CNRTL.fr (in French)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English|Medieval English]] term "mummy" was defined as "medical preparation of the substance of mummies", rather than the entire corpse, with [[Richard Hakluyt]] in 1599 AD complaining that "these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow".&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Mummy, 1", citing Hakluyr's "Voyages, II, 201"&lt;/ref&gt; These substances were defined as [[mummia]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] defines a mummy as "the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial", citing sources from 1615 AD onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 1, 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chamber's ''Cyclopædia'']] and the Victorian zoologist [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland]]&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 3c&lt;/ref&gt; define a mummy as follows: "A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow".

Wasps of the genus ''[[Aleiodes]]'' are known as "mummy wasps" because they wrap their caterpillar prey as "mummies".

While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Greece]], most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=1-2}} Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] novelties such as [[mummia]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=1}} The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first [[X-ray]] of a mummy came in 1903, when professors [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[Howard Carter]] used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of [[Thutmose IV]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=3}} British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=16}}

Pathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=14-15}} In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in [[Puerto de la Cruz]] on [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].  More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being integration of [[Medical research|biomedical]] and [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.{{sfn| Aufderheide|2003|p=2}}

In more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally "unwrap" mummies without risking damage to the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldock |first1=C |last2=Hughes |first2=SW |last3=Whittaker |first3=DK |last4=Taylor |first4=J |last5=Davis |first5=R |last6=Spencer |first6=AJ |last7=Tonge |first7=K |last8=Sofat |first8=A |year=1994 |title=3-D reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian mummy using x-ray computer tomography |url= http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29982/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue= |pages=806–808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in [[Stereoscopy|3-D]].&lt;ref name=Gewolb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gewolb |first=Josh |title=Computer identifies mummy |journal=Science |date=28 September 2001 |volume=293 |issue=5539 |page=2383 |doi=10.1126/science.293.5539.2383a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=DeChant&gt;{{cite web |last=De Chant |first=Tim |title=Did King Tut Die in a Chariot Accident? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/ancient/did-king-tut-die-in-a-chariot-accident/ |work=Nova Next |publisher=PBS |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Anthropogenic|Spontaneous|Natural}}Types ==

Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as [[Ötzi]], were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions such as those found in [[bog body|bogs]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=2}} While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}
The earliest [[ancient Egypt]]ian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In the era prior to 3500 BC,&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Egyptian Mummy |publisher=Penn Museum |url=http://www.penn.museum/long-term-exhibits/the-egyptian-mummy.html |accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Amandine [https://www.academia.edu/8963492/On_the_Origins_of_the_Egyptian_Mummification ON THE ORIGINS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIFICATION], Kmt 52, 2014, pp. 52-57&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians buried the dead in pit graves, without regard to [[social status]]. Pit graves were often shallow. This characteristic allowed for the hot, dry sand of the desert to [[dehydration|dehydrate]] the bodies, leading to natural mummification.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jimmy |title=An Overview of Mummification in Ancient Egypt |date=22 August 2011 |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/mummification.htm |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural preservation of the dead had a profound effect on [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Deliberate mummification became an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|2nd dynasty]] (about 2800 BC).&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; New research of an 11-year study by [[University of York]], [[Macquarie University]] and [[University of Oxford]] suggests mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought.&lt;ref name="uyork"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2014/research/mummification/ | title=Embalming study ‘rewrites’ key chapter in Egyptian history | publisher=University of York | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to [[Coffin Texts|living well in the afterlife]]. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy lead to the creation of elaborate [[tomb]]s, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Joann |title=Mummies Around the World |date=17 February 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/mummies_01.shtml |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve "true mummification" through a process of [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], followed by preserving the body in various minerals and oils.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.

The few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman period]]. The majority of the [[Papyrus|papyri]] that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as ''[[The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus|The Ritual of Embalming]]'' does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming, however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Riggs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Riggs |first=Christina |title=Funerary Rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods) |publisher=UCLA Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures |date=January 2010 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Wade |first2=Ronald S. |last=Brier |first=Bob |title=Surgical procedures during ancient Egyptian mummification |publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca |date=June 2001 |jstor=27802174 |volume=33 |pages=117–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few. The tomb of Tjay designated [[TT23]],  is one of only two known which show the wrapping of a mummy (Riggs 2014).&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggs |first=Christina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdtgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nh-TVd6yKsv8Ut30gaAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false |title=Unwrapping Ancient Egypt: The Shroud, the Secret and the Sacred (p.82-83) |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing 5 Jun 2014, 336 pages, {{ISBN|0857855077}} |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text that describes the processes being used in latter periods is [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]. Written in Book 2 of the ''Histories'' is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using [[natron]] in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Greek historian Herodotus on the process of mummification -- and he has been proven accurate| publisher = utexas.edu| url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| accessdate = 9 November 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023202442/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| archivedate = 23 October 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

By utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the [[cranial cavity]] of the skull.&lt;ref name="Jarus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarus |first=Owen |title=Oops! Brain-Removal Tool Left in Mummy's Skull |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=14 December 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/oops-brain-removal-tool-left-mummys-skull-160456836.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus' works that the rod had been a hook made of iron.&lt;ref name="Herodotus" /&gt; Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers [[Bob Brier]] and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of [[Gravitation|gravity]], as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece-by-piece with a hook.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

Through various methods of study over many decades, modern [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of [[linen]] cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small [[amulet]]s to guard the decedent from evil.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in a resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. Resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Riggs" /&gt;

=== Mummification and rank ===
Mummification is one of the defining customs in [[ancient Egyptian society]] for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to [[Herodotus]]. They range from "the most perfect" to the method employed by the "poorer classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Most perfect" method ====

The most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described serve one of these two functions.
[[File:Mòmia Nesi BMVB 2964.jpg|alt=Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain|thumb|Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). [[Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer]]. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain]]
First, the [[brain]] was removed from the [[cranium]] through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to [[wiktionary:liquefy|liquefy]] the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the [[Flank (anatomy)|flank]] with a sharp blade fashioned from an [[Ethiopia]]n stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.

The [[abdominal cavity]] was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including [[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], and, Herodotus notes, "every other sort of spice except [[frankincense]]", also to preserve the person.

The body was further dehydrated by placing it in [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt, for seventy days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than seventy days. Any shorter time and the body is not completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body is too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then wash the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.

At this point, the body was given back to the family. These "perfect" mummies were then placed in wooden cases that were human-shaped. Richer people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |pages=50–51 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Avoiding expense ====

The second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who "wish to avoid expense". In this method, an oil derived from [[Cedrus|cedar trees]] was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of [[canopic jar]]s and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the [[rectum]]. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a [[shaft tomb]]. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inexpensive method ====

The third and least-expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the [[intestines]] with an unnamed liquid, injected as an [[enema]]. The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=ToLiveForever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=52 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the [[African continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steyn|first=Maryna|last2=Binneman|first2=Johan|last3=Loots|first3=Marius|date=2007|title=The Kouga Mummified Human Remains|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/5758/Steyn_Kouga(2007).pdf?sequence=1|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=62|pages=3-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosothwane|first=Morongwa|date=2011|title=The Tuli Mummy: A Preliminary Report from Northeastern Botswana|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/19039/Mosothwane_Tuli(2011).pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=66|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Libya ====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist [[Fabrizio Mori]] to [[Libya]] during the winter of 1958–1959 in the natural cave structure of [[Uan Muhuggiag]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281}} After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000–8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated [[Autopsy|post-mortem]], possibly in an effort to preserve the remains.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=282}} A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Science: Older than Egypt?|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865145,00.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=21 December 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281-282}}&lt;ref name=Wan&gt;{{cite web|title=Wan Muhuggiag|url=http://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
[[File:Momie de Jingzhou.jpg|thumb|300px|Mummy in the history museum of [[Jingzhou]]]]

The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates, however these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard" /&gt;

==== China ====
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|left|The mummy of [[Xin Zhui]].]]
Mummies from various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] throughout [[China]]'s history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zolfagharifard |first=Ellie |title=The Chinese mummy that aged 300 years in a day: Experts baffled by 'perfectly preserved' body that turned BLACK just hours after its coffin was opened |publisher=Mail Online |date=15 October 2013 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2460931/The-Chinese-mummy-aged-300-years-day-Experts-baffled-perfectly-preserved-body-turned-BLACK-just-hours-coffin-opened.html |accessdate=9 November 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is [[Xin Zhui]]. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the [[Mawangdui]] archaeological site in [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonn-Muller |first=Eti |title=China's Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=10 April 2009 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mawangdui/ |accessdate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the wife of the marquis of Dai during the [[Han dynasty]], who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative.&lt;ref name="K.Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K.

Her corpse was so well-preserved that surgeons from the Hunan Provincial Medical Institute were able to perform an autopsy.&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller" /&gt; The exact reason why her body was so completely preserved has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="Orbit"&gt;{{cite web| title = Meet the Lady Dai . . .| publisher = redorbit.com| date = 4 November 2004| url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/100340/meet_the_lady_dai____of_145bc_/| accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more infamous mummies to be discovered in China are those termed [[Tarim mummies]] because of their discovery in the [[Tarim Basin]]. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day [[Xinjiang]] region.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |title=A Host of Mummies, a Forest of Secrets |publisher=New York Times |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16archeo.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot long wooden poles in the place of tombstones.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt; [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] data&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert J. |last=Saiget |title=Caucasians preceded East Asians in basin |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |work=The Washington Times |publisher=News World Communications |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2007-08-20 |quote=A study last year by [[Jilin]] University also found that the mummies' DNA had Europoid genes. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420224622/http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |archivedate=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--a major newspaper as is legitimate a source as any other publication.--&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, but unpublished research is not.

Later [[isotope|isotopic]] research on the other mummies returned similar dates, however, many of these individuals were found to be from a region that is not closely associated with the mine. It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt; Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt;

==== Siberia ====
In 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. [[Natalia Polosmak]] discovered the [[Siberian Ice Maiden]], a [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Siberian woman, on the [[Ukok Plateau]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] near the Mongolian border.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes"&gt;{{cite web| title = Siberian Princess reveals her 2,500 year old tattoos| publisher = The Siberian Times| date = 14 August 2012| url = http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/| accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adkins |first=Jan |title=Unquiet Mummies |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/unquiet-mummies.html |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her left arm and hand were tattooed with [[animal style]] figures, including a highly stylized [[deer]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the [[Altai Republic]], formed after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in [[Novosibirsk]] in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polosmak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polosmak |first=Natalya |title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven |journal=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |pages=80–103 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

==== Philippines ====
Philippine mummies are called [[Kabayan Mummies]]. They are common in [[Igorot]] culture and their heritage. The mummies are found in some areas named [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]] and among others. The mummies are dated between the 14th and 19th centuries.

=== Europe ===
The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/solved-the-mystery-of-britains-bronze-age-mummies-48475 |title=Solved: the mystery of Britain’s Bronze Age mummies |last=Booth |first=Tom |date=24 Nov 2015 |website=The Conversation |access-date=3 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest, and most infamous, mummies (nicknamed [[Ötzi]]) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st Century.

==== Bog bodies ====
{{Main article|Bog body}}
The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]] have produced a number of [[Bog body|bog bodies]], mummies of people deposited in [[bog|sphagnum bogs]], apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining [[stomach]] contents. A famous case is that of the [[Haraldskær Woman]], who was discovered by labourers in a bog in [[Jutland]] in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal [[sarcophagus]] at the Saint Nicolai Church, [[Vejle]], where she currently remains. Another famous bog body, also from Denmark, known as the [[Tollund Man]] was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. To this day, only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Library |first1=Silkeborg Public |last2=Museum |first2=Silkeborg |url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp |title=A Body Appears |work=The Tollund Man – A Face from Prehistoric Denmark |accessdate=22 September 2007 |publisher=Silkeborg Public Library |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Guanche mummies}}
The mummies of the [[Canary Islands]] belong to the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Guanches|Guanche]] people and date to the time before 14th Century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians; involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping of the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Ireland |first2=Robert |last=Horne |first=Patrick |title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization |journal=The Bryologist |year=1991 |volume=94 |issue=4 |page=407 |jstor=3243832 |publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society |doi=10.2307/3243832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockburn"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cockburn |editor1-first=Aidan |editor2-last=Cockburn |editor2-first=Eve |editor3-last=Reyman |editor3-first=Theodore A. |title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=University Press, Cambridge, UK |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Guanche+mummies |edition=2nd |accessdate=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic ====
[[File:Brno CZ Crypt at the Capuchin Monastery 02.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Mummies in the [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]]]]
The majority of mummies recovered in the [[Czech Republic]] come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=192}}&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu /&gt;

The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlické Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt;

The [[Klatovy]] catacombs currently house an exhibition of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674–1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies.

==== Denmark ====
[[File:Skrudstrupspigen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a grave mound in Denmark.]]
Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Eshøj mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the [[Egtved Girl]], who were all found inside burial mounds, or [[tumuli]].

In 1875, the Borum Eshøj grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties.&lt;ref name=Natmus /&gt; Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50–60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/familien_i_borum_eshoej/kvinden_fra_borum_eshoej/language/uk/ |title=The woman from Borum Eshøj – Oldtiden |publisher=Oldtiden.natmus.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351–1345 BC.&lt;ref name=Natmus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-bronze-age/the-family-from-borum-eshoej/ |title= The family in Borum Eshøj |publisher= http://natmus.dk/ |accessdate= 11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a [[tumulus]] in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18–19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the [[sprang]] technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaul |first=Flemming |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skrydstrup |title=Skrydstrup, We know where she lived – 1001 Stories of Denmark |publisher=Kulturarv.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egtved Girl]], dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a [[bodice]] and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an [[Bradawl|awl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

==== Hungary ====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church in [[Vác]], Hungary from the 1729–1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in [[Budapest]]. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.&lt;ref name=AtlObs1&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES OF VÁC, HUNGARY|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary|publisher=AtlasObscura|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
[[File:Monks' Corridor.jpg|thumb|right|Mummies in the Monks' Corridor of the [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]].]]
The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=193}} Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.

The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the [[Ötztal Alps]] on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed [[Ötzi]], the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the [[Tamins-Carasso-Isera]] cultural group of [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite web |last=Owen |first=James |title=5 Surprising Facts About Otzi the Iceman |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-otzi-ice-man-mummy-five-facts/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=11 November 2013 |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OtziCulture&gt;{{cite web|title=Which cultural group did Ötzi belong to?|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111110719/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by [[Walther Parson]] of [[Innsbruck Medical University]] revealed Ötzi has 19 living genetic relatives.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

The [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini|Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo]] were built in the 16th century by the monks of Palermo’s Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the most famous final burials being that of [[Rosalia Lombardo]]. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies. (See: [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]])

The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the [[crypt]] of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di [[Pievepelago]], Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.&lt;ref name=Huddersfield&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Stefano Vanin’s forensic expertise is used to learn lessons from the extraordinary Mummies of Roccapelago|url=http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|publisher=University of Huddersfield|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=24 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111111205/http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically-significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.&lt;ref name=Spirit /&gt;

{{Main article|Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi}}

[[Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi]] ("Long ago person found" in the [[Southern Tutchone]] language of the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations]]), was found in August 1999 by three First Nations hunters at the edge of a glacier in [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned [[Inuit]] settlement called [[Qilakitsoq]], in Greenland. The "Greenland Mummies" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James M. |title=World Mummies: Greenland Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |publisher=Mummy Tombs |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208160451/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hart Hansen |editor1-first=Jens Peder |editor2-last=Meldgaard |editor2-first=Jørgen |editor3-last=Nordqvist |editor3-first=Jørgen |title=The Greenland Mummies |location=London |publisher=British Museum Publications |year=1991 |isbn=0-7141-2500-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
[[File:Placid death.JPG|left|190px|thumb|A mummy from Guanajuato]]
Intentional mummification in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]] was practiced by the [[Aztec]] culture. These bodies are collectively known as [[Aztec mummy|Aztec mummies]]. Genuine Aztec mummies were "bundled" in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask.&lt;ref name=Langely&gt;{{cite web |last=Langely |first=James |title=NOTES I-3: TEOTIHUACAN INCENSARIOS: THE 'V' MANTA AND ITS MESSAGE |url=http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |publisher=Internet Journal for Teotihuacan Archaeology and Iconography |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112060653/http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture. (See: [[Aztec mummy]])

Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico, though the most famous are the [[mummies of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor unravels secrets of the Guanajuato mummies |newspaper=US Fed News Service, Including US State News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at ''El Museo de las Momias'' in the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] since 1970.

==== United States ====
[[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave Man]] was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to [[guano]] mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains are currently held at the [[Nevada State Museum, Carson City|Nevada State Museum]].

=== Oceania ===
[[File:Robley with mokomokai collection 2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Horatio Gordon Robley with his mokomokai collection.]]

Mummies from the [[Oceania]] are not limited only to [[Australia]]. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in [[New Zealand]], and the [[Torres Strait]],{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=289}} though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=277}} Prior to the 20th Century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.

==== Australia ====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in [[Australia]] are thought be related to those found in the [[Torres Strait]] islands,&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=Warren |title=Mummification in Australia and in America |journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1928 |volume=58 |pages=115–138 |jstor=4619529}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques (See:[[Mummy#Torres Strait|Torres Strait]]). Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;

==== Torres Strait ====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy.&lt;ref name=Melanesia&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James |title=Melanesia Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |accessdate=15 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015193124/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Melanesia /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main article|Mokomokai}}

Some [[Māori people|Māori]] tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare.&lt;ref name=Maori1 /&gt; They are also known as [[Mokomokai]]. In the 19th Century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of which being housed across France alone. In 2010, the Rouen City Hall of France returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.&lt;ref name=Maori1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummified Maori head returned to NZ|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=10 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204030056/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that some Maori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread.&lt;ref name=Orchiston&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orchiston |first=D.

There is still controversy, however, as to the nature of the mummification process. Some bodies appear to be spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of deliberate practices. General modern consensus tends to agree that there could be a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the ancient Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

=== South America ===
The [[South America]]n continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental.&lt;ref name="head" /&gt; The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Earliest Mummies| publisher = The Field Museum| url = http://mummies.fieldmuseum.org/behind-the-scenes/south-american-mummies| accessdate = 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings.&lt;ref name="Arriaza"&gt;{{cite web |last2=Hapke |first2=Russell A. |last3=Standen |first3=Vivien G. |last=Arriaza |first=Bernardo |title=Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=16 December 1998|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/ |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru.

==== Chinchorro mummies ====
[[File:Momia cultura chinchorro año 3000 AC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chinchorro mummies are the oldest deliberate mummies.]]
{{Main article|Chinchorro mummies}}
The [[Chinchorro mummies]] are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in [[5th millennium BC]] and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years,&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the [[Atacama Desert]], which aided in desiccation.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt;

==== Inca mummies ====
[[File:Llullaillaco mummies in Salta city, Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco]] mummy in [[Salta Province]] ([[Argentina]]).]]
Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] period (1438–1532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]. These are collectively known as "ice mummies".&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo Peak]] in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano [[Sabancaya]] melted away ice that covered the body.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Ice Mummies of the Inca |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ice-mummies-inca.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plomo Mummy|Mummy of El Plomo]] was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

[[Mummy Juanita]] was discovered near the summit of [[Ampato]] in the Peruvian section of the [[Andes]] mountains by archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]].&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of [[Cusco]], as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

More evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the [[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco mummies]] on the border of Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Yancey |title=Interview: "Inca Mummy Man" Johan Reinhard |publisher=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0621_050621_incamummy.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''.&lt;ref name="Handwerk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Handwerk |first=Brian |title=Inca Child Sacrifice Victims Were Drugged |publisher=National Geographic |date=29 July 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130729-inca-mummy-maiden-sacrifice-coca-alcohol-drug-mountain-andes-children/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&amp;rptregcampaign=20131016_rw_membership_r1p_us_se_w#finished |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[biochemistry|biochemical analysis]] of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of [[alcohol]] and [[coca]], possibly in the form of [[chicha]], in the months leading up to sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt; The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child's mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt;

'''Inca emperors.''' The bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death.  In 1533, the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them.  The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney&lt;/ref&gt;

The population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors.  This reverence seemed idolatry to the [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital.  The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;McCaa, Robert, Nimlos, Aleta, and Hampe Martinez, Teodoro (nd) "Why Blame Smallpox"; http://users.pop.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/why_blame_smallpox.pdf, accessed 27 Jan 2017; Pringle, Harriet (2011), "Inca Empire", ''National Geographic'', http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/inca-empire/pringle-text/2, accessed 27 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful.  The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty.  Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle &lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-mummification ==
{{Main article|Buddhist mummies|Sokushinbutsu}}
Monks whose bodies remain [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.

Many Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in [[lotus position]], put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or [[Calcium oxide|lime]]) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.

Bodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[pine]] bark, and ''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum|urushi]]'' tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~anomaly/japan/dbuddha.htm |title=The Buddhist Mummies of Japan |publisher=Sonic.net |date=24 August 1998 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mummies ==
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]] wished to be mummified after he died.]]

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
In the 1830s, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of [[utilitarianism]], left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the "horror at dissection originates in ignorance"; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miss Cellania |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |title=6 Restless Corpses |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119161451/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and "seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought". His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the [[University College London]].

=== Vladimir Lenin ===
During the early 20th century, the Russian movement of [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], as represented by [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s death, [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]] suggested to [[Cryonics|cryonically preserve]] his body and brain in order to revive him in the future.&lt;ref name="azbuka"&gt;See the article: А.М. и А.А. Панченко «Осьмое чудо света», in the book Панченко А.М. О русской истории и культуре. St. Petersburg: Azbuka, 2003. Page 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary equipment was purchased abroad, but for a variety of reasons the plan was not realized.&lt;ref name="azbuka" /&gt; Instead his body was [[Embalming|embalmed]] and placed on permanent exhibition in the [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin Mausoleum]] in Moscow, where it is displayed to this day. The mausoleum itself was modeled by [[Alexey Shchusev]] on the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Tomb of Cyrus]].

===Gottfried Knoche===
In late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named [[Gottfried Knoche]] conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near [[La Guaira]]. He developed an [[embalming fluid]] (based on an [[aluminum chloride]] compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.

=== Summum ===
In 1975, an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] organization by the name of [[Summum]] introduced "Modern Mummification", a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum's process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, [[Claude Nowell|Summum Bonum Amen Ra]], who died in January 2008.&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravitz |first=Jessica |title=Summum: Homegrown spiritual group, in news and in a pyramid |publisher=CNN |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/11/summum-a-belief-system-in-the-news-%E2%80%93-and-unlike-any-other/ |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summum is currently considered to be the only "commercial mummification business" in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Grant |title=Summum: Religious group performs mummification rituals in Utah pyramid |publisher=KSL.com |date=30 October 2010 |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=22660276 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alan Billis ===
In 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification. The process was filmed for television, for the documentary ''Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret''.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite news |last=Knight |first=Kathryn |title=Married to the mummy: Taxi driver Alan told his wife he'd agreed to be mummified after death, so how did she feel finally seeing 'Tutan-Alan'? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2052037/Mummifying-Alan-How-did-Alan-Billis-wife-Jan-feel-finally-seeing-Tutan-Alan.html |publisher=Mail Online |accessdate=15 November 2013 |location=London |date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret | series=Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret  | network = Channel 4| airdate = 2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billis made the decision to allow his body to be mummified after being diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2009. His body currently resides at London's Gordon Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/gordon/newsevents/newsrecords/2012/Feb/Museums-final-resting-place-for-modern-mummy.aspx|title=King's College London – Museum's final resting place for modern mummy|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastination ===
{{Main article|Plastination}}
[[Plastination]] is a technique used in [[anatomy]] to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.

The technique was invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] when working at the anatomical institute of the [[Heidelberg University]] in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the [[Body Worlds]] traveling exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com |title=Body Worlds Official Web Site |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in [[Heidelberg]].

More than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.plastination.org/ |title=International Society for Plastination |publisher=Isp.plastination.org |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment of ancient mummies in modern times ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], based on a mistranslation from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the [[Desiccation|sun-desiccated]] corpses of criminals, slaves and [[Suicide|suicidal]] people were substituted by mendacious merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bodies/cases/case18.html | title = What was mummy medicine? | accessdate =8 February 2008 | publisher = [[Channel 4]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] in powdered form as in [[mellified man]].&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daly |first=N. |year=1994 |title=That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=24–51 |doi=10.2307/1345912 |jstor=1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as [[mummy brown]], based on ''[[mummia]]'' (sometimes called alternatively ''[[caput mortuum]]'', Latin for ''death's head''), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm Mumie - nicht lieferbar!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215033915/http://www.kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm |date=15 February 2012 }} article by Kremer Pigmente GmbH &amp; Co NYC,  (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;   Many thousands of mummified cats were also sent from Egypt to England to be processed for use in [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wake |first=Jehanne |author-link=Jehanne Wake |title=Kleinwort, Benson: the history of two families in banking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-828299-0 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm1fHrcgZuoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA118&amp;dq=mummified+cats+fertilizer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, Egyptology was a huge fad in Europe, especially in [[Victorian era|Victorian England]]. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions.&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping" /&gt; These sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.

The use of mummies as [[fuel]] for [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] was documented by [[Mark Twain]] (likely as a joke or humor),&lt;ref name="Straight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020222.html | publisher = [[The Straight Dope]] |  title = Do Egyptians burn mummies as fuel? | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate =16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the truth of the story remains debatable. During the [[American Civil War]], mummy-wrapping linens were said to have been used to manufacture paper.&lt;ref name="Straight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Capital Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pronovost |first=Michelle |url=http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106183429/http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2008 |date=17 March 2005 |publisher=[[Capital Weekly]] |title=Necessity of paper was the 'mummy' of invention}} &lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the reality of these claims is still equivocal.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Nicholson |authorlink=Nicholson Baker |title=''[[Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper]]'' |year=2001 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-375-50444-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dane"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dane |first=Joseph A. |year=1995 |title=The Curse of the Mummy Paper |journal=Printing History |volume=17 |pages=18–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69360">'''Music education''' is a field of study associated with the [[teaching]] and [[learning]] of [[music]].  It touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and significant ways, the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including [[music appreciation]] and sensitivity.  Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common in most nations because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human [[culture]] and [[human behavior|behavior]]. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.

During the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method ([[eurhythmics]]) was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The [[Kodály Method]] emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The [[Orff Schulwerk]] "approach" to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.

The [[Suzuki method]] creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through ''[[audiation]]'', Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind ''with understanding''. Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED034358&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED034358|title=A Sensory-Motor Approach to Music Learning. Book I - Primary Concepts.|first=Carabo-Cone,|last=Madeleine|date=30 November 1968|website=ed.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular music pedagogy]] is the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MMCP]] (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving. 

== Overview ==
In [[primary schools]] in [[Western world|European]] countries, children often learn to play instruments such as [[Music keyboard|keyboards]] or [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of music and [[history of music]]. In countries such as [[India]], the [[harmonium]] is used in schools, but instruments like keyboards and violin are also common. Students are normally taught basics of [[Hindustani classical music|Indian Raga music]]. In [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[choir]], [[orchestra]], or [[school band]]: [[concert band]], [[marching band]], or [[jazz band]]. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In [[junior high school]] or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="HDoM"&gt;Randel, D. (Ed.) (1986). Education in the United States. In '''''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music''''' (pp. 276–278). London/Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and humanities programs receive academic credit for music courses such as music history, typically of Western art music, or [[music appreciation]], which focuses on listening and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities offer music ensembles – such as choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra – that are open to students from various fields of study. Most universities also offer degree programs in music education, certifying students as primary and secondary music educators. Advanced degrees such as the [[D.M.A.]] or the [[Ph.D]] can lead to university employment. These degrees are awarded upon completion of music theory, music history, technique classes, private instruction with a specific instrument, ensemble participation, and in depth observations of experienced educators. Music education departments in North American and European universities also support interdisciplinary research in such areas as [[music psychology]], music education [[historiography]], educational [[ethnomusicology]], [[sociomusicology]], and [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|philosophy of education]].

The study of western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of outside the Western art music canon, including [[music of West Africa]], of Indonesia (e.g. [[Gamelan music]]), Mexico (e.g., [[mariachi]] music), Zimbabwe ([[marimba]] music), as well as [[popular music]].

Music education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and in community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take [[music lessons]], short private sessions with an individual teacher.

==Instructional methodologies==
While instructional strategies are determined by the music teacher and the music [[curriculum]] in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional [[methodology|methodologies]] that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century.

===Major international music education methods===

====Dalcroze method====
{{Main|eurhythmics}}
The Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts − the use of [[solfège]], improvisation, and [[eurhythmics]]. Sometimes referred to as "rhythmic gymnastics," eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that engages all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to who we are. American proponents of the Dalcroze method include Ruth Alperson, Ann Farber, Herb Henke, Virginia Mead, Lisa Parker, Martha Sanchez, and Julia Schnebly-Black.  Many active teachers of Dalcroze method were trained by Dr. Hilda Schuster who was one of the students of Dalcroze.

====Kodály method====
{{Main|Kodály method}}
[[File:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfège hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
[[Zoltán Kodály]] (1882–1967) was a prominent [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic [[music theory]] and [[music notation]] in various verbal and written forms. Kodály's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodály's trademark teaching methods include the use of [[solfège]] hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm [[solmization]] (verbalization). Most countries have used their own folk music traditions to construct their own instruction sequence, but the United States primarily uses the Hungarian sequence. The work of Denise Bacon, Katinka S. Daniel, John Feierabend, Jean Sinor, Jill Trinka, and others brought Kodaly's ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States.

====Orff Schulwerk====
{{Main|Orff Schulwerk}}
[[Carl Orff]] was a prominent German composer. Orff Schulwerk is considered an "approach" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach fosters student self-discovery, encourages improvisation, and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill. [[Carl Orff]] developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[metallophone]], [[drum]], and other [[percussion instrument]]s to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses. Experts in shaping an American-style Orff approach include Jane Frazee, Arvida Steen, and Judith Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/orff-approach-emc/ "Orff Approach"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Doreen Hall, Keith Bissell, Emily-Jane Orford. 02/07/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suzuki method====
{{Main|Suzuki method}}
The Suzuki method was developed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] in Japan shortly after World War II, and uses music education to enrich the lives and [[moral character]] of its students.  The movement rests on the double premise that "all children can be well educated" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful.  The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by [[Genichi Kawakami]] in association with the [[Yamaha Music Foundation]].

===Other notable methods===
In addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:

====Gordon's Music Learning Theory====
{{Main|Gordon Music Learning Theory}}
Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others in the larger field of [[Music Learning Theory]]. It provides music teachers with a comprehensive framework for teaching musicianship through [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#audiation|audiation]], Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding and comprehension when the sound is not physically present.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. 1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of instructions is Discrimination Learning and Inference Learning. Discrimination Learning, the ability to determine whether two elements are the same or not the same using aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis. Inference Learning, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise unfamiliar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Willie J. |title=Gordon's Music Learning on Piano |url=https://pianoin21days.com/how-to-play-piano/ |website=PI21 |publisher=Owensboro |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills and content sequences within the Audiation theory help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giml.org/home.php GIML: The Gordon Institute for Music Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824082226/http://www.giml.org/home.php |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a Learning Theory for Newborns and Young Children in which the Types and Stages of Preparatory Audiation are outlined.

====World Music Pedagogy====
The growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and artist-musicians to establish instructional practices rooted in musical traditions.  'World music pedagogy' was coined by [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]] to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs.  Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist, William M. Anderson, and Will Schmid, influenced a second generation of music educators (including J. Bryan Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to music teachers of various levels and specializations. The pedagogy advocates the use of human resources, i.e., "culture-bearers," as well as deep and continued listening to archived resources such as those of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Teaching Music Globally (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversational Solfège====
Influenced by both the Kodály method and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfège was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, former chair of music education at the [[Hartt School]], [[University of Hartford]].  The program begins by immersing students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American.  Music is seen as separate from, and more fundamental than, notation.  In twelve learning stages, students move from hearing and singing music to decoding and then creating music using spoken syllables and then standard written notation. Rather than implementing the Kodály method directly, this method follows Kodály's original instructions and builds on America's own folk songs instead of on Hungarian folk songs.

==== Carabo-Cone Method ====
This early-childhood approach, sometimes referred to as the Sensory-Motor Approach to Music, was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone.  This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"/&gt;

====Popular Music Pedagogy====
{{Main|Popular music pedagogy}}
'Popular music pedagogy' — alternatively called rock music pedagogy, modern band, popular music education, or rock music education — is a recent development in music education consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisation,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and is more commonly associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MMCP ====
{{Main|MMCP}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 as a response to declining student interest in school music. This creative approach aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving.  Rather than imparting factual knowledge, this method centers around the student, who learns through investigation, experimentation, and discovery.  The teacher gives a group of students a specific problem to solve together and allows freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum. MMCP is viewed as the forerunner to projects in creative music composition and improvisation activities in schools.

==History of music education in the United States==

===18th century===
After the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in [[Boston]]  for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies.  Music education continued to flourish with the creation of the Academy of Music in Boston. Reverend John Tufts published ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation'' which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 and 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201838/http://www.bsu.edu/classes/bauer/hpmused/colonial.html The Colonial Period: 1600-1800] - Timeline: Music Education History/Philosophy (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Music began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.

===19th century===
In 1832, [[Lowell Mason]] and George Webb formed the [[Boston Academy of Music]] with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music.  Mason published his ''Manuel of Instruction'' in 1834 which was based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].  This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837–1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration.  This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States.  In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music.  In later years [[Luther Whiting Mason]] became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school).  During the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Martha Chrisman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3344928 "Portrait of a Nineteenth-Century School Music Program"], Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1990), pp. 79–89, MENC: The National Association for Music Education&lt;/ref&gt; Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the [[Normal School]] in Potsdam. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: ''[[Music education in the United States]]'') While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, "later, it was accepted that [[Women in music|women would have a role in music education]], and they became involved in this field...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

===Early 20th century===
In the United States, teaching colleges with four-year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music.  [[Oberlin Conservatory]] first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School.  Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:
* Founding of the Music Supervisor's National Conference (changed to Music Educators National Conference in 1934, later [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]] in 1998, and currently [http://nafme.org/ The National Association for Music Education – NAfME]) in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] in 1907.
* Rise of the school band and orchestra movement leading to performance oriented school music programs.
* Growth in music [[method (music)|methods]] publications.
* [[Frances Elliot Clark]] develops and promotes phonograph record libraries for school use.
* [[Carl Seashore]] and his ''Measures of Musical Talent'' music aptitude test starts testing people in music.

Music course offerings and even entire degree programs in [[online music education]] developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of [[world music pedagogy]] and [[popular music pedagogy]] have also seen notable expansion.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, social aspects of teaching and learning music came to the fore. This emerged as praxial music education,&lt;ref&gt;http://bern.library.nenu.edu.cn/upload/soft/0000/11.1goble{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt; critical theory,&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rider.edu/~vrme/v6n1/visions/Regelski%20Critical%20Theory%20as%20a%20Foundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1461380032000182849 | volume=6 | title=Feminist theory in music education research: grrl‐illa games as nomadic practice (or how music education fell from grace) | journal=Music Education Research | pages=67–79| year=2007 | last1=Gould | first1=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance are the colloquia and journals of the MayDay Group, "an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maydaygroup.org/about-us/|title=About the MayDay Group – Mayday Group|author=|date=|website=www.maydaygroup.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a new focus on social aspects of music education, scholars have analyzed critical aspects such as music and race,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bradley5_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gender,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Lamb3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0027432112442944 | volume=98 | issue=4 | title=Social Class and School Music | journal=Music Educators Journal | pages=33–37| year=2012 | last1=Bates | first1=Vincent C }}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional belonging,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Froehlich6_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates10_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Institutional music education was started in colonial India by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] after he founded the [[Visva-Bharati University]]. At present, most universities have a faculty of music with some universities specially dedicated to fine arts such as [[Indira Kala Sangeet University]], [[Swathi Thirunal College of Music]] or [[Rabindra Bharati University]].[[Indian classical music]] is based on the [[Guru Shishya parampara|gurushyshyaparampara]] system. The [[teacher]], known as [[Guru]], transmit the musical knowledge to the student, or shyshya. This is still the main system used in [[India]] to transmit musical knowledge. Although European art music became popularized in schools throughout much of the world during the twentieth century (East Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Africa), India remains one of the few highly populated nations in which non-European indigenous music traditions have consistently received relatively greater emphasis. That said, there is certainly much western influence in the popular music associated with [[Bollywood]] film scores.

==Africa==
The [[South African Department of Education]] and the ILAM Music Heritage Project SA teach African music using western musical framework. ILAM's ''Listen and Learn'' for students 11–14 is "unique" in teaching curriculum requirements for western music using recordings of traditional African music.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' ed. Jonathan McCollum and [[David G. Hebert]], p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time that Africa was colonized up to 1994, indigenous music and arts being taught in schools was a rare occurrence. The African National Congress (ANC) attempted to repair the neglect of indigenous knowledge and the overwhelming emphasis on written musical literacy in schools. It is not well known that the learning of indigenous music actually has a philosophy and teaching procedure that is different from western “formal” training. It involves the whole community because indigenous songs are about the history of its people. After the colonization of Africa, music became more centered on Christian beliefs and European folk songs, rather than the more improvised and fluid indigenous music.  Before the major changes education went through from 1994 to 2004, during the first decade of the democratic government, teachers were trained as classroom teachers and told that they would have to incorporate music into other subject areas. The few colleges with teaching programs that included instrumental programs held a greater emphasis on music theory, history of western music, western music notation, and less on making music. Up until 1999, most college syllabi did not include training in indigenous South African Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Anri|last2=de Wet|first2=Jacques|last3=Rijsdijk|first3=Susan|title=A Survey of Music Education in the Primary Schools of South Africa's Cape Peninsula|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|date=2005|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260–283|doi=10.2307/3598684|jstor=3598684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In African cultures music is seen as a community experience and is used for social and religious occasions. As soon as children show some sign of being able to handle music or a musical instrument they are allowed to participate with the adults of the community in musical events. Traditional songs are more important to many people because they are stories about the histories of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nketia|first1=J. H. Kwabena|title=Music Education in Africa and the West: We Can Learn from Each Other|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=1970|volume=57|issue=3|pages=48–55|doi=10.2307/3392906|jstor=3392906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Among the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, music was used in ceremonies and rituals to teach the history of their civilizations and was also used for worship. The Aztec people were mainly educated by their priests. Music remained an important way to teach religion and history and was taught by priests for many centuries.  When Spain and Portugal colonized parts of South America, music started to be influenced by European ideas and qualities. Several priests of European descent, such as Antonio Sepp, taught European systems of music notation and theory based on their knowledge of playing instruments throughout the 1700-1800s. Since music was taught to the general public by rote, very few knew how to read music other than those who played instruments until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The development of music in South America mainly followed that of European development. Choirs were formed to sing masses, chants, psalms, but secular music also became more prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Couve|first1=Alicia C.|last2=Pino|first2=Claudia Dal|last3=Frega|first3=Ana Lucía|title=An Approach to the History of Music Education in Latin America|jstor=40214944|journal=The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education|pages=10–39|doi=10.2307/40214944|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education in Latin America today has large emphasis on folk music, masses, and orchestral music. Many classrooms teach their choirs to sing in their native language as well as in English. Several Latin American Schools, specifically in Puerto Rico and Haiti, believe music to be an important subject and are working on expanding their programs. Outside of school, many communities form their own musical groups and organizations. Community performances are very popular with the local audiences. There are a few well-known Latin American choral groups, such as "El Coro de Madrigalistas" from Mexico. This famous choral group tours around Mexico, showing students around the country what a professional choral ensemble sounds like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawler|first1=Vanett|title=Music Education in Fourteen Latin-American Republics|jstor=3386758|journal=Music Educators Journal|pages=20–30|doi=10.2307/3386758|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-Cultural Music Education==
The music, languages, and sounds we are exposed to within our own cultures determine our tastes in music and affect the way we perceive the music of other cultures. Many studies have shown distinct differences in the preferences and abilities of musicians from around the world. One study attempted to view the distinctions between the musical preferences of English and Japanese speakers, providing both groups of people with the same series of tones and rhythms. The same type of study was done for English and French speakers. Both studies suggested that the language spoken by the listener determined which groupings of tones and rhythms were more appealing, based on the inflections and natural rhythm groupings of their language.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bicknell|first1=Jeanette|title=Cross-Cultural Research and the Nature of Music|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-music-moves-us/201303/cross-cultural-research-and-the-nature-music|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study had Europeans and Africans try to tap along with certain rhythms. European rhythms are regular and built on simple ratios, while African rhythms are typically based on irregular ratios. While both groups of people could perform the rhythms with European qualities, the European group struggled with the African rhythms. This has to do with the ubiquity of complex polyrhythm in African culture and their familiarity with this type of sound.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

While each culture has its own musical qualities and appeals, incorporating cross-cultural curricula in our music classrooms can help teach students how to better perceive music from other cultures. Studies show that learning to sing folk songs or popular music of other cultures is an effective way to understand a culture as opposed to merely learning about it. If music classrooms discuss the musical qualities and incorporate styles from other cultures, such as the Brazilian roots of the Bossa Nova, the Afro-Cuban clave, and African drumming, it will expose students to new sounds and teach them how to compare their cultures’ music to the different music and start to make them more comfortable with exploring sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilari|first1=Beatriz|last2=Chen-Hafteck|first2=Lily|last3=Crawford|first3=Lisa|title=Singing and cultural understanding: A music education perspective|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0255761413487281|website=International Journal of Music Education|pages=202–216|language=en|doi=10.1177/0255761413487281|date=1 May 2013|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and assessment==
Achievement standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]], created nine voluntary content standards, called the ''National Standards for Music Education''.{{ref|standardfoot}} These standards call for:
# [[Singing]], alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Performing]] on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Improvising]] melodies, variations, and accompaniments.
# [[Musical composition|Composing]] and arranging music within specified guidelines.
# [[Reading (activity)|Reading]] and notating music.
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
# Evaluating music and music performances.
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture.

Many states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.

==Integration with other subjects==

Some schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English, believing that integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education.

One example is the [[Kennedy Center]]'s "Changing Education Through the Arts" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm CETA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512034843/http://www.surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lullabies-of-europe.org/ Lullabies of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; FolkDC (for primary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkdc.eu/|title=home|author=|date=11 February 2011|website=folkdc.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/PopuLLar-Music-and-Language-Learning/181858685219155|title=PopuLLar - Music and Language Learning|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ARTinED project is also using music for all subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artined.eu/home.html|title=ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts|author=|date=|website=www.artined.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===

A number of researchers and music education advocates have argued that studying music enhances [[academic achievement]],&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement." [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB&amp;_r=0 Joanne Lipman, New York Times]. October 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; such as William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, who claimed that "Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training."&lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Steven J | year = 1994 | title = Music students and academic growth | url = | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 33–36 | doi=10.2307/3398812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Wisconsin suggested that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = F. | last2 = Zupan | first2 = M.A. | year = 2000 | title = Classroom Keyboard Instruction Improves Kindergarten Children's Spatial-Temporal Performance: A Field Experiment | url = | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 215–228 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2006(00)00050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment by Wanda T. Wallace setting text to melody suggested that some music may aid in text recall.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = W | year = 1994 | title = Memory for music: Effect of melody on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471–1485 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse with different music.  A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music.  A third experiment studied text recall without music.  She found the repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall, suggesting music can serve as a mnemonic device.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"/&gt;

Smith (1985) studied background music with word lists.  One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later.  Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later.  Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | year = 1985 | title = Background music and context-dependent memory | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 591–603 | doi=10.2307/1422512| jstor = 1422512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing studies that support music education's involvement in intellectual development and academic achievement, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that: "Music education enhances intellectual development and enriches the academic environment for children of all ages; and Music educators greatly contribute to the artistic, intellectual and social development of American children and play a key role in helping children to succeed in school."&lt;ref&gt;(H. Res. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbett (1990) suggests that most public school music programs have not changed since their inception at the turn of the last century. "…the educational climate is not conducive to their continuance as historically conceived and the social needs and habits of people require a completely different kind of band program."&lt;ref&gt;Bobbett, G. C. (1990). Rural Appalachian Band Directors' Academic Preparation: Musical Preparation, Facilities, Monetary Resources, and Methods of Student Evaluation, and Their Students' Musical Independence. [S.l.]: Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse.&lt;/ref&gt;    A 2011 study conducted by Kathleen M. Kerstetter for the Journal of Band Research found that increased non-musical graduation requirements, block scheduling, increased number of non-traditional programs such as magnet schools, and the testing emphases created by the No Child Left Behind Act are only some of the concerns facing music educators. Both teachers and students are under increased time restrictions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerstetter | first1 = Kathleen M | year = 2011 | title = Investigating High School Band Recruitment Procedures Using Educational Marketing Principles | url = | journal = Journal of Band Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Patricia Powers states, "It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface.  It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways." &lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994" /&gt; Comprehensive music education programs average $187 per pupil, according to a 2011 study funded by the national Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fermanich | first1 = M. L. | year = 2011 | title = Money for music education: a district analysis of the how, what, and where of spending for music education | url = | journal = Journal of Education Finance | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmusicworkshop.com/advocacy/benefits.html|title=Benefits of Music Education - How do students benefit from music?|author=|date=|website=childrensmusicworkshop.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-musical benefits===
Studies have shown that music education can be used to enhance cognitive achievement in students. In the United States an estimated 30% of students struggle with reading, while 17% are reported as having a specific learning disability linked to reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23| pmid = 17419662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using intensive music curriculum as an intervention paired alongside regular classroom activities, research shows that students involved with the music curriculum show increases in reading comprehension, word knowledge, vocabulary recall, and word decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | pmid = 17419662 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student is singing a melody with text, they are using multiple areas of their brain to multitask. Music effects language development, increases IQ, spatial-temporal skills, and improves test scores. Music education has also shown to improve the skills of dyslexic children in similar areas as mentioned earlier by focusing on visual auditory and fine motor skills as strategies to combat their disability.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, K. (2000). Dyslexia, temporal processing and music: The potential of music as an early learning aid for dyslexic children. Psychology of Music 28(2). 218–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research in this area is sparse, we cannot convincingly conclude these findings to be true, however the results from research done do show a positive impact on both students with learning difficulties and those who are not diagnosed. Further research will need to be done, but the positive engaging way of bringing music into the classroom cannot be forgotten, and the students generally show a positive reaction to this form of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butzlaff | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = Can music be used to teach reading? | url = | journal = The Journal of Aesthetic Education | volume = 34 | issue = 3/4| pages = 167–178 | doi=10.2307/3333642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education has also been noted to have the ability to increase someones overall IQ, especially in children during peak development years.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schellenberg | first1 = E.G. | year = 2004 | title = Music lessons enhance IQ | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 511–514 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spacial ability, verbal memory, reading and mathematic ability are seen to be increased alongside music education (primarily through the learning of an instrument).&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"/&gt; Researchers also note that a correlation between general attendance and IQ increases is evident, and due to students involvement in music education, general attendance rates increase along with their IQ.

Fine motor skills, social behaviours, and emotional well being can also be increased through music and music education. The learning of an instrument increases fine motor skills in students with physical disabilities. Emotional well being can be increased as students find meaning in songs and connect them to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosacki | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Early adolescents' emotional perceptions and engagement with popular music activities in everyday life | url = | journal = International Journal of Adolescence and Youth | volume =  20| issue = 2| pages =  228–244| doi = 10.1080/02673843.2013.785438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through social interactions of playing in groups like jazz and concert bands, students learn to socialize and this can be linked to emotional and mental well being.

===Music advocacy===
In some communities – and even entire national education systems – music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called "music advocacy". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples controversially rely on emotion, anecdotes, or unconvincing data.

Recent high-profile music advocacy projects include the "[[Mozart Effect]]", the [[National Anthem Project]], and the movement in  [[World Music Pedagogy]] (also known as  [[Cultural Diversity in Music Education]]) which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance.  The Mozart effect is particularly controversial as while the initial study suggested listening to Mozart positively impacts [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], later studies either failed to replicate the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F | year = 1999 | title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6747| pages = 826–827 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid = 10476958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Karen E. | last3 = Crook | first3 = Melissa D. | year = 1999 | title = The Mystery of the Mozart Effect: Failure to Replicate | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 366–369 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Črnčec, Sarah J. Wilson and Margot Prior, "No Evidence for the Mozart Effect in Children," ''Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Vol. 23, No. 4 (2006): 305–318. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.305]&lt;/ref&gt; or suggested the music of Mozart could be substituted for any music children enjoy in a term called "enjoyment arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Schellenberg | first2 = E.G. | last3 = Husain | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Mood, arousal, and the Mozart effect | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 248–251 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that even if listening to Mozart may temporarily enhance a student's spatial-temporal abilities, learning to play an instrument is much more likely to improve student performance and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;(Rauscher, F. H., &amp; Hinton, S. C. (2006). The Mozart Effect: Music Listening is Not Music Instruction. Educational Psychologist, 41(4), 233–238.  Abstract: This paper clarifies the position of the author's earlier works.)&lt;/ref&gt; Educators similarly criticized the [[National Anthem Project]] not only for promoting the educational use of music as a tool for non-musical goals, but also for its links to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bradley, "Oh That Magic Feeling! Multicultural Human Subjectivity, Community, and Fascism's Footprints," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (2009): 56, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Music education philosophers]] such as [[Bennett Reimer]], [[Estelle Jorgensen]], [[David J. Elliott]], [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]], and [[Keith Swanwick]] support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as [[Ellen Winner]] conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music,&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Wu, "Entrepreneurship in Research: Ellen Winner on Why We Need the Arts," ''Entrepreneurship Review,'' (2013): [2 http://miter.mit/edu/ellen-winner-on-why-we-need-the-arts/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt; her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example.&lt;ref name="David J 2015"&gt;David J. Elliot and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 38&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers [[Glenn Schellenberg]] and [[Eugenia Costa-Giomi]] also criticize advocates [[Correlation does not imply causation|incorrectly associating correlation with causation]], Giomi pointing out that while there is a "strong relationship between music participation and academic achievement, the ''causal'' nature of the relationship is questionable."&lt;ref name="David J 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Costa-Giomi, "Music Education and Intellectual Development in Children: Historical, Research, and Educational Perspectives," 2012, Conference Proceeding, Anais Do II Simpom 2012 – Simposio Brasileiro de Pos-Graduandos Em Musica, 21, [http://www.seer.unirio.br/index.php/simpom/article/viewFile/2601/1929]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[David J. Elliott|David Elliott]] and [[Marissa Silverman]] suggest that more effective advocacy involves shying away from "[[dumbing down]]" values and aims through slogans and misleading data, energy being better focused into engaging potential supporters in active music-making and musical-affective experiences,&lt;ref&gt;David J. Elliott and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; these actions recognizing that music and music-making are inherent to human culture and behavior, distinguishing humans from other species.&lt;ref name="Yudkin, J. 2008 p. 4"&gt;Yudkin, J.

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in music education}}
[[File:Roman Catholic Elementary School- Life at St Joseph's, Upper Norwood, 1943 D14456.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A music teacher leading a music ensemble in an elementary school in 1943.]]
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "...[[Women in music|women]] [composers] lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php|title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1|author=|date=|website=parlorsongs.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;"Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences. A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination."

After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers|title=A historical view of women in music education careers|first=|last=bigbadbariguru|date=5 July 2012|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

'''Old Aramaic''' (code: oar) refers to the earliest stage of the [[Aramaic language]], considered to give way to [[Middle Aramaic]] by the 3rd century (a conventional date is the rise of the [[Sasanian Empire]] in 224 AD).

Emerging as the language of the city-states of the [[Arameans]] in the [[Levant]] in the [[Early Iron Age]], Old Aramaic was adopted as a ''[[lingua franca]]'', and in this role was inherited for official use by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during [[classical antiquity]]. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic [[dialect continuum]] and the development of differing written standards.

==Ancient Aramaic==
"Ancient Aramaic" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the ''lingua franca'' of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Bahrain]]. It was the language of the Aramaean city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hama]]th and [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]].

[[Image:Bar-rakib.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ingot|Silver ingot]] of Bar-Rakib, son of Panammuwa II,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1986%2018/Younger18.pdf Panammuwa II and Bar-Rakib: Two Structural Analyses, K. Lawson Younger, Jr., University of Sheffield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002734/http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1986%2018/Younger18.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; King of [[Sam'al|Sam‘al]] (now called ''Zincirli Höyük'').]]
There are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BCE. The inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic then seems to be based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]] of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian. Distinctive royal inscriptions at [[Sam'al]] have led to some scholars suggesting a distinctive "Sam'alian" or "Ya'udic" variant of Old Aramaic.

From 700 BCE, the language began to spread in all directions but lost much of its [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Homogeneity|homogeneity]]. Different dialects emerged in [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. However, the Akkadian-influenced Aramaic of Assyria, and then [[Babylon]], started to come to the fore. As described in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 18:26, [[Hezekiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], negotiates with Assyrian ambassadors in Aramaic so that the common people would not understand. Around 600 BCE, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, used Aramaic to write to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].

"Chaldee" or "Chaldean Aramaic" used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]].

The first old Aramaic inscription to be found in Europe was the Carpentras stele, published by Rigord in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|last1=Porten|first1=Bezalel|authorlink1=Bezalel Porten|last2=Yardeni|first2=Ada|authorlink2=Ada Yardeni|title=Textbook of Aramaic documents from ancient Egypt: Ostraca &amp; assorted inscriptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1wPAQAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Hebrew University, Dept. of the History of the Jewish People|isbn=978-965-350-089-1}} and {{cite web|title=Aramaic - Examples of writing|url=http://lila.sns.it/mnamon/index.php?page=Esempi&amp;id=2&amp;lang=en&amp;PHPSESSID=fpxoeogttmuhz|website=Mnamon : Ancient writing systems in the Mediterranean|language=en}}. The stele is known as KAI 269. [[Maurice Pope (linguist)]] writes,
{{quote|The story begins just before the century opened. In 1692 a long band of material from a mummy burial was unwrapped in the presence of M. de Maillet, the French Consul in Cairo. It carried figures drawn in the ancient Egyptian style which were accompanied by an ink-written text in a hitherto unknown sort of writing. It was cut up, presumably at the time of unwrapping, into seven or eight pieces, and sent to France. One of the pieces came to the notice of Jean-Pierre Rigord, a collector of antiquities, who discussed the find in the Memoires de Trevoux of June 1704. Rigord's article was illustrated with plates of an ordinary hieroglyphic inscription, a specimen of the mummy text, and another stone inscription from Egypt from his collection. With the aid of the passage about Egyptian writing in Clement, he identified the first as 'symbolical hieroglyphic', the second as either 'hieratic' or as 'cyriological hieroglyphic', and the third as 'epistolographic'. He thought that this last one, written from right to left, was probably Phoenician. The script was said to have been in public use, and Phoenician might have come in as a mercantile language with the Shepherd Kings. The divergence of the language from Hebrew (the original tongue of mankind) had obviously reached the point of unintelligibility in Joseph's day for an interpreter to have been considered necessary between him and his brothers, and Jerome had said that Phoenician was half-way between Hebrew and Egyptian. Finally, Rigord suggested that the language might have been the same as Punic.}}{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 539 BCE, following the [[Achaemenid Assyria|Achaemenid conquest of Mesopotamia]] under [[Darius I]], the Achaemenids adopted the local use of Aramaic. {{quote|When the Achaemenids extended their rule westward, they adopted this language as the vehicle for written communication between the various regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|aramaic-|Aramaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an "official language", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G. R. Driver's "Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C."|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=18|issue=3/4|year=1955|pages=456–461|doi=10.2307/2718444|last2=Driver|first2=G. R.|jstor=2718444}} p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ''lingua franca'' of Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of [[Old Persian]] gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BCE), Imperial Aramaic or a similar dialect would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and, as ideograms, Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the [[Persepolis]] fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John A. Matthew|last=Stolper|title=What are the Persepolis Fortification Tablets?|journal=The Oriental Studies News &amp; Notes|issue=winter|year=2007|pages=6–9|url=http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html|accessdate=2007-02-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070214035646/http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html| archivedate= 14 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], [[Elephantine]] in particular (see: [[Elephantine papyri]]). Of them, the best known is the ''Wisdom of [[Story of Ahikar|Ahiqar]]'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]].

Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional [[loanword]] from a local language.

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] has been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the fourth century BCE Achaemenid administration of Bactria and [[Sogdia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria |series= Studies in the Khalili Collection |last1=Naveh |first1=Joseph |last2=Shaked |first2=Shaul |isbn=  978-1874780748 |publisher= Khalili Collections |location= Oxford |year=2006 |editor=Joseph Naveh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Aramaic and [[Biblical Hebrew]] both form part of the group of [[Northwest Semitic languages]], and during antiquity, there may still have been substantial mutual intelligibility. In [[Pesachim (Talmud)|Pesahim]], Tractate 87b, [[Hanina bar Hama]] said that God sent the exiled Jews to Babylon because "[the Babylonian] language is akin to the ''[[Lashon Hakodesh|Leshon Hakodesh]]''".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Post-Achaemenid Aramaic==
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Alexander the Great]] bearing an Aramaic language inscription]]
[[Image:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription (Greek and Aramaic) by [[Ashoka]], thirdrd century BCE at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
The conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the fifth century BCE can be found right up to the early second century BCE. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] imposed [[Koine Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the third century BCE, Koine Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the [[Syrian Desert]] and into [[Arabian Peninsula|northern Arabia]] and [[Parthia]].

[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the term for the Aramaic passages interspersed in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. These passages make for a small fraction of the entire text (of the order of 1%), and most of it is due to the Aramaic parts of the [[Book of Daniel]]:
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 31:47&amp;nbsp;– translation of a Hebrew place-name.
* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26&amp;nbsp;– documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BCE) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11&amp;nbsp;– a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* Daniel 2:4b–7:28&amp;nbsp;– five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. According to [[historical criticism]], defiant Jewish propaganda shaped the Aramaic [[Book of Daniel]] during [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule. These stories might have existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the Greek [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] of Judaea (142–37 BCE). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian Targumic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the "official" [[targum]]s. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

The [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean language]] was the Western Aramaic variety used by the Nabateans of the [[Negev]], including the kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BCE–106 CE) covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Ancient North Arabian]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: "l" is often turned into "n", and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE. The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with Arabic.

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the city state of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.

The use of written Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of [[Pahlavi scripts|Aramaic-derived scripts]] to render a number of [[Middle Iranian]] languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic "words" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic "words" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as ''signs'' (i.e. [[logograms]]), much like the sign {{angle brackets|&amp;}} is read as "and" in English and the original Latin ''et'' is now no longer obvious. Under the early third-century BCE [[Parthian Empire]], whose government used Koine Greek but whose native language was [[Parthian language|Parthian]], the Parthian language and the Aramaic-derived writing system used for Parthian both gained prestige. This in turn influenced the adoption of the name ''pahlavi'' (&lt; ''parthawi'', "of the Parthians") for their use of Aramaic script with logograms. The [[Sasanian Empire]], which succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century CE, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer. p. 28 n. 27; {{Cite book |title= Ancient Persia |pages=118–20 |last1= Wiesehöfer |first1= Josef |last2=Azodi |first2= Azizeh |isbn= |publisher= |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That particular Middle Iranian dialect, [[Middle Persian]], i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] by the Arabs in the seventh-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by the Arabic script in all but [[Middle Persian literature|Zoroastrian usage]], which continued to use the name ''pahlavi'' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.

==Late Old Eastern Aramaic==
[[Image:Mandaic.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] [[Incantation bowl|magical "demon trap"]]]]
The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside them, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, the regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BCE and reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic. They show a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.&lt;ref&gt;"Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages," in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 341 (2006), pp. 53-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kingdom of [[Osroene]], centred on [[Edessa]] and founded in 132 BCE, the regional dialect became the official language: [[Syriac language|Old Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony known as the ''[[Diatessaron]]'', came from the [[Seleucid Empire]] and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (''c.''&amp;nbsp;70 CE). The everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

==Late Old Western Aramaic==
{{further information|Language of Jesus|Syriac language}}
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the 1st century BC and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the 4th century CE.

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the [[Book of Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BCE). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the 2nd century CE. Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judaean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the 1st century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

In the 1st century CE, Jews in [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]] primarily spoke Aramaic (besides [[Koine Greek]] as the international language of the Roman administration and trade). 
In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on Hasmonaean and Babylonian there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven dialects of [[Aramaic language#Late Old Western Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] were spoken in the vicinity of Judaea in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi]] had the Southeastern Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants [[he (letter)|he]], {{Transl|sem|[[heth]]}} and [[ayin]] all became pronounced the same as [[aleph]], presumably a [[glottal stop]]. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the  [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

The three languages influenced one another, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like ''{{Transl|sem|‘ēṣ}}'' "wood"). Vice versa, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like ''māmmôn'' "wealth" but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew ''rā’ûi'', "seen" mean "worthy" in the sense of "seemly", which is a loan translation of Aramaic ''{{Transl|sem|ḥāzê}}'' meaning "seen" and "worthy").

The Greek of the [[New Testament]] often preserves non-Greek ''semiticisms'', including transliterations of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words:
* Some are Aramaic like ''talitha'' (ταλιθα) that can represent the noun ''{{Transl|sem|ṭalyĕṯā}}'' (Mark 5:41).
* Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like ''Rabbounei'' (Ραββουνει), which stands for "my master/great one/teacher" in both languages (John 20:16).

The '''Privy Seal of Japan''' is one of the [[National seals of Japan|national seals]] and is the [[Emperor of Japan]]'s official seal. It is cubic, and its inscription 天皇御璽 ("The Emperor's Imperial Seal") is written in {{nihongo|[[seal script]]|篆書|tensho}}. It has two lines of [[vertical writing]], with the right-hand side containing the characters 天皇 (''Tenno'', emperor), and on the left-hand side containing the characters 御璽 (''Gyoji'', imperial seal). The seal is printed on Imperial rescripts, [[proclamation]] of sentences of [[law]]s, [[Cabinet of Japan|cabinet]] orders, [[treaty|treaties]], instruments of [[ratification]], [[ambassador]]s' credentials and their dismissal documents, documents of [[Power of attorney|general power of attorney]], [[Consul (representative)|consul]]ar commissions, letters authorizing foreign [[Consul (representative)|consul]]s, letters of appointment or dismissal of [[Official|government officials]], whose appointment requires the Emperor's attestation, and [[Imperial Investiture|appointment]] documents and documents of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] and [[Chief Justice of Japan|Chief Justice]], and their respective dismissals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Privy Seal and State Seal|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/seido/seido09.html|publisher=[[Imperial Household Agency]]|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the Privy Seal of Japan dates back to the [[Nara period]]. Although it was originally made from copper, it was manufactured from stone in 1868 ([[Meiji period|Meiji]]) and later, was made from pure gold.  The present Privy Seal is pure gold and is about 3 [[Japanese units of measurement#Length|sun]] (about 9&amp;nbsp;cm) in size and weighs 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg. The master-hand of the seal was Abei Rekido (安部井 櫟堂; 1805-1883), of Kyoto. He was commissioned to manufacture the [[State Seal of Japan]] within one year, in 1874 (Meiji 7).  When not in use, the seal is kept in a [[leather]] bag. The seal is used with special [[vermilion|cinnabar]] seal ink specially made by the [[National Printing Bureau]].

If the State Seal or the Privy Seal are illegally reproduced, the penalty is at least two years or more of terminable penal servitude according to the first clause of Article 164 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?re=02&amp;vm=&amp;id=1960#en_pt2ch20at1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Translation sidebar}}

In [[translation]], '''Realia ''' (plural noun) are words and expressions for culture-specific material elements. The word ''realia'' comes from medieval [[Latin]], in which it originally meant “the real things”, i.e. material things, as opposed to abstract ones. The [[Bulgaria]]n translators Vlahov and Florin, who were the first to carry out an in-depth study of realia, coined the modern sense of the word. They indicate that since realia carry a very local overtone, they often pose a challenge for translation.&lt;ref&gt;Vlahov, S. and Florin, S. “Neperovodimoe v perevode. Realii”, in [[Bruno Osimo]]. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Realia must not be confused with terminology: the latter is primarily used in the scientific literature to designate things that pertain to the scientific sphere, and usually only appears in other kinds of texts to serve a very specific stylistic purpose. Realia, on the other hand, are born in popular culture, and are increasingly found in very diverse kinds of texts. [[Fiction]], in particular, is fond of realia for the exotic touch they bring.

==Types and examples of realia==
Vlahov and Florin classify them into various categories:

===Geography===
* '''physical geography''': [[fjord]], [[mistral (wind)|mistral]], [[steppe]], [[tornado]], [[tsunami]]…
* '''geographic objects tied to man’s activity''': [[polder]]…
* '''endemic species''': [[kiwi]], [[koala]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|sequoia]], [[yeti|Abominable Snowman]]…

===Ethnography===

==Translating realia==

To translate realia, various strategies exist : they range from phonetic transcription to  translation of the overall meaning. Israeli scholar [[Gideon Toury]] offers one way of defining such solutions. According to his characterization, each of these can be placed between two extremes: '''adequacy''' (closeness to the original) and '''acceptability''' (making the word entirely consistent with the target culture). Here are the various possibilities at hand for translating realia:

* [[transcription (linguistics)|Transcribing]] (i.e. copying) the word, character by character. This is called [[transliteration]] when the original word is written in a different alphabet.
* Transcribing according to the target language’s pronunciation rules. For instance, the Hindi word ''Kašmir '' becomes ''cachemire'' in French.
* Creating a new word or a [[calque]], such as the English ''flea market'' inspired by the French ''marché aux puces''
* Creating a new word, analogous to the original one, but which has a more local ring to it, e.g.  ''muezzin'' from the Arabic ''mu'adhdhin''
* Using a different but related word from the source language, passing it off as the original word. For instance, the Italian word ''cappuccino'' is often translated into English as ''latte'', which in Italian means “milk”.
* Making the meaning explicit, such as ''jewish temple'' for ''synagogue''
* Replacing the word with a similar, local one, such as the French ''art nouveau'' (literally “new art”) for ''Jugendstil''
* Replacing the word with one that is more generic or international, such as ''red wine'' for ''Beaujolais''
* Adding an adjective to help the reader identify the origin of the element of realia, as in ''the Argentine pampa''
* Translating the overall meaning. For example, the English sentence ''Does the National Health Service cover this drug?'' could become, in an American context, ''Is this drug expensive?''&lt;ref&gt;Osimo, Bruno. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

How suitable each of these solutions is depends on various factors. One of them is the type of text that is being translated. Adequate translations (in Toury's sense) of realia add some exoticism, a quality that is often desirable in fiction. For non-fiction, nowadays adequacy is usually preferred to acceptability, so as to avoid the ambiguity that can arise from the use of more culturally neutral translations – though the opposite preference has prevailed in the past. One must also consider how the element of realia relates to the source culture in terms of importance and familiarity. If, for instance, it is rather common in the source culture, then providing an adequate translation creates an exotic note that wasn’t there in the first place (though this can be justified by the fact that, after all, one is not dealing with an original, but a translation). If, on the contrary, the source culture perceives the element of realia as unusual, unless the translator renders such an element more culturally neutral, readers of the translation will most likely also perceive it as unusual. Another thing to keep in mind when establishing a translation strategy is that not all languages are equally open to “foreignisms”, and how familiar speakers of that language may be with the realia one introduces. Some languages, such as Italian, welcome such words and frequently integrate them into their vocabulary. Other languages, on the contrary, have the opposite tendency: they are wary of foreign words and are very impermeable to them. French is a good example of such protectionism. Lastly, the expected readership (which may or may not be similar to that of the original) influences the choice of a suitable translation strategy. For example, the name of a chemical compound will be translated differently depending on whether one expects the text to be read by chemists or schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.logos.it/pls/dictionary/linguistic_resources.cap_3_38?lang=en “How Realia Can Be Translated”] “Logos”, accessed on May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63889">Over the course of some fourteen centuries, the [[Romans]] and other peoples of Italy employed a system of nomenclature that differed from that used by other cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean, consisting of a combination of [[given name|personal]] and [[surnames|family names]].  Although conventionally referred to as the ''tria nomina'', the combination of [[praenomen]], nomen, and [[cognomen]] that have come to be regarded as the basic elements of the Roman name in fact represent a continuous process of development, from at least the seventh century BC to the end of the seventh century AD.  The names developed as part of this system became a defining characteristic of Roman civilization, and although the system itself vanished during the early Middle Ages, the names themselves exerted a profound influence on the development of European naming practices, and many continue to survive in [[modern languages]].

==Overview==
The distinguishing feature of Roman nomenclature was the use of both [[given name|personal names]] and regular [[surnames]].  Throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, other ancient civilizations distinguished individuals through the use of single personal names, usually [[wikt:dithematic|dithematic]] in nature.  Consisting of two distinct elements, or "themes", these names allowed for hundreds or even thousands of possible combinations.  But a markedly different system of nomenclature arose in Italy, where the personal name was joined by a hereditary surname.  Over time, this [[wikt:binomial|binomial]] system expanded to include additional names and designations.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970), "Names, Personal."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salway"&gt;[[Benet Salway]], "What's in a Name?  A Survey of Roman Onomastic Practice from c. 700 B.C. to A.D. 700", in ''[[Journal of Roman Studies]]'', vol. 84, pp. 124–145 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Etruskischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|An [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] musician, fresco from the [[Tomb of the Triclinium]], near [[Tarquinia|Tarquinii]], c. 470 BC]]
The most important of these names was the ''nomen gentilicium'', or simply ''nomen'', a hereditary surname that identified a person as a member of a distinct [[gens]].  This was preceded by the [[praenomen]], or "forename", a personal name that served to distinguish between the different members of a family.  The origin of this binomial system is lost in prehistory, but it appears to have been established in [[Latium]] and [[Etruria]] by at least 650 BC.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;  In written form, the nomen was usually followed by a [[Roman naming conventions#Filiation|filiation]], indicating the personal name of an individual's father, and sometimes the name of the mother or other antecedents.  Toward the end of the [[Roman Republic]], this was followed by the name of a citizen's [[Roman tribe#the Servian tribes|voting tribe]].  Lastly, these elements could be followed by additional surnames, or [[cognomen|cognomina]], which could be either personal or hereditary, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

The Roman grammarians came to regard the combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen as a defining characteristic of Roman citizenship, known as the ''tria nomina''. However, although all three elements of the Roman name existed throughout most of Roman history, the concept of the ''tria nomina'' can be misleading, because not all of these names were required or used throughout the whole of Roman history.  During the period of the Roman Republic, the praenomen and nomen represented the essential elements of the name; the cognomen first appeared among the [[Roman aristocracy]] at the inception of the Republic, but was not widely used among the [[Plebs|plebeians]], who made up the majority of the Roman people, until the second century BC.  Even then, not all Roman citizens bore cognomina, and until the end of the Republic the cognomen was regarded as somewhat less than an official name.  By contrast, in imperial times the cognomen became the principal distinguishing element of the Roman name, and although praenomina never completely vanished, the essential elements of the Roman name from the second century onward were the nomen and cognomen.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

[[Naming conventions for women in ancient Rome|Naming conventions for women]] also varied from the classical concept of the ''tria nomina''.  Originally Roman women shared the binomial nomenclature of men; but over time the praenomen became less useful as a distinguishing element, and women's praenomina were gradually discarded, or replaced by informal names.  By the end of the Republic, the majority of Roman women either did not have or did not use praenomina.  Most women were called by their nomen alone, or by a combination of nomen and cognomen. Praenomina could still be given when necessary, and as with men's praenomina the practice survived well into imperial times, but the proliferation of personal cognomina eventually rendered women's praenomina obsolete.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

In the later empire, members of the Roman aristocracy used several different schemes of assuming and inheriting nomina and cognomina, both to signify their rank, and to indicate their family and social connections.  Some Romans came to be known by alternative names, or ''signia'', and due to the lack of surviving epigraphic evidence, the full nomenclature of most Romans, even among the aristocracy, is seldom recorded.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

Thus, although the three types of names referred to as the ''tria nomina'' existed throughout Roman history, the period during which the majority of citizens possessed exactly three names was relatively brief.  Nevertheless, because most of the important individuals during the best-recorded periods of Roman history possessed all three names, the ''tria nomina'' remains the most familiar conception of the Roman name.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

For a variety of reasons, the Roman nomenclature system broke down in the centuries following the collapse of imperial authority in the west.  The praenomen had already become scarce in written sources during the fourth century, and by the fifth century it was retained only by the most conservative elements of the old Roman aristocracy.  Over the course of the sixth century, as Roman institutions and social structures gradually fell away, the need to distinguish between nomina and cognomina likewise vanished.  By the end of the seventh century, the people of Italy and western Europe had reverted to single names.  But many of the names that had originated as part of the ''tria nomina'' were adapted to this usage, and survived into modern times.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

==Origin and development==
[[File:Mignard - The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife.jpg|thumb|''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife''&lt;br/&gt;Nicolas Mignard, 1606–1668]]
As in other cultures, the early peoples of Italy probably used a single name, which later developed into the praenomen.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] wrote that the earliest Italians used simple names.&lt;ref name="De Praenominibus"&gt;Gaius Titius Probus, ''De Praenominibus'', epitome by Julius Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  Names of this type could be honorific or aspirational, or might refer to deities, physical peculiarities, or circumstances of birth.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;  In this early period, the number of personal names must have been quite large; but with the development of additional names the number in widespread use dwindled.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;  By the early Republic, about three dozen Latin praenomina remained in use, some of which were already rare; about eighteen were used by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897), "Nomen."&lt;/ref&gt;  Barely a dozen praenomina remained in general use under the Empire, although aristocratic families sometimes revived older praenomina, or created new ones from cognomina.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

The development of the nomen as the second element of the Italic name cannot be attributed to a specific period or culture.  From the earliest period it was common to both the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Italic peoples]] and the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]].  The historian [[Livy]] relates the adoption of ''Silvius'' as a nomen by the [[kings of Alba Longa]] in honour of their ancestor, [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]].{{efn-lr|Livy refers to this as a ''cognomen'', or "surname", which in later Roman practice was the ''third'' element of the Roman ''tria nomina''; but it must be remembered that the word ''nomen'' simply means "name", and before the adoption of a second name, this is how the praenomen would have been called; thus, the first surnames adopted would have been known as ''cognomina'' before their gradually-increasing importance caused the word ''nomen'' to refer to them, while the original personal name became known as the ''praenomen'', or "forename".&lt;ref name="Livy:i.3"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Livy:i.3"&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of Rome's foundation myth, this statement cannot be regarded as historical fact, but it does indicate the antiquity of the period to which the Romans themselves ascribed the adoption of hereditary surnames.{{efn-lr|Although a few individuals mentioned in relation to the period of and before Rome's legendary foundation in the eighth century BC are known by only a single name, it is equally difficult to discern which of these represent actual historical figures, and if so, whether their names were accurately remembered by the historians who recorded these myths centuries later. [[Romulus and Remus]], together with their foster-father, the herdsman [[Faustulus]], are among those easily remembered; but even supposing that Romulus and Remus are the names of historical persons, they belonged, in theory, to the royal house of the Silvii; or they might have borne no surname because they were said to have been fathered by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself.  Meanwhile, Faustulus may represent a mythical personage interjected into Rome's foundation legend; although it may be noted that his name is a diminutive of the Latin praenomen [[Faustus (praenomen)|Faustus]].  Almost all other persons mentioned as part of the traditions surrounding Romulus as the first [[King of Rome]] have both praenomen and nomen.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' i. 4–16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Latin, most nomina were formed by adding an adjectival suffix, usually ''-ius'', to the stem of an existing word or name.  Frequently this required a joining element, such as ''-e-, -id-, -il-'', or ''-on-''.  Many common nomina arose as [[patronymic surname]]s; for instance, the nomen ''Marcius'' was derived from the praenomen ''Marcus'', and originally signified ''Marci filius'', "son of Marcus".  In the same way, ''Sextius'', ''Publilius'', and ''Lucilius'' arose from the praenomina ''Sextus'', ''Publius'', and ''Lucius''.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;{{efn-lr|So common was this practice that nearly all Latin praenomina gave rise to patronymic nomina, including many that were uncommon in historical times.}}  This demonstrates that, much like later European surnames, the earliest nomina were not necessarily hereditary, but might be adopted and discarded at will, and changed from one generation to the next.  The practice from which these patronymics arose also gave rise to the [[Roman naming conventions#Filiation|filiation]], which in later times, once the nomen had become fixed, nearly always followed the nomen.  Other nomina were derived from names that later came to be regarded as cognomina, such as ''Plancius'' from ''Plancus'' or ''Flavius'' from ''Flavus''; or from place-names, such as ''Norbanus'' from ''[[Norba]]''.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

The binomial name consisting of ''praenomen'' and ''nomen'' eventually spread throughout Italy.  Nomina from different languages and regions often have distinctive characteristics; Latin nomina tended to end in ''-ius, -us, -aius, -eius, -eus'', or ''aeus'', while Oscan names frequently ended in ''-is'' or ''-iis''; Umbrian names in ''-as, -anas, -enas'', or ''-inas'', and Etruscan names in ''-arna, -erna, -ena, -enna, -ina'', or ''-inna''.  Oscan and Umbrian forms tend to be found in inscriptions; in Roman literature these names are often Latinized.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;

Many individuals added an additional surname, or ''cognomen'', which helped to distinguish between members of larger families.  Originally these were simply personal names, which might be derived from a person's physical features, personal qualities, occupation, place of origin, or even an object with which a person was associated.  Some cognomina were derived from the circumstance of a person's adoption from one family into another, or were derived from foreign names, such as when a freedman received a Roman praenomen and nomen.  Other cognomina commemorated important events associated with a person; a battle in which a man had fought ([[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis|Regillensis]]), a town captured ([[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]]); or a miraculous occurrence ([[Marcus Valerius Corvus|Corvus]]).  The late grammarians distinguished certain cognomina as ''agnomina''.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

Although originally a personal name, the cognomen frequently became hereditary, especially in large families, or ''[[gens|gentes]]'', in which they served to identify distinct branches, known as ''stirpes''.  Some Romans had more than one cognomen, and in aristocratic families it was not unheard of for individuals to have as many as three, of which some might be hereditary and some personal.  These surnames were initially characteristic of patrician families, but over time cognomina were also acquired by the [[plebs|plebeians]].  However, a number of distinguished plebeian gentes, such as the [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]] and the [[Maria (gens)|Marii]], were never divided into different branches, and in these families cognomina were the exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

Cognomina are known from the beginning of the Republic, but were long regarded as informal names, and omitted from most official records before the second century BC.  Later inscriptions commemorating the early centuries of the Republic supply these missing surnames, although the authenticity of some of them has been disputed.  Under the Empire, however, the cognomen acquired great importance, and the number of cognomina assumed by the Roman aristocracy multiplied exponentially.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

Adding to the complexity of aristocratic names was the practice of combining the full nomenclature of both one's paternal and maternal ancestors, resulting in some individuals appearing to have two or more complete names.  Duplicative or politically undesirable names might be omitted, while the order of names might be rearranged to emphasize those giving the bearer the greatest prestige.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

Following the promulgation of the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' in AD 212, granting Roman citizenship to all free men living within the Roman Empire, the praenomen and nomen lost much of their distinguishing function, as all of the newly enfranchised citizens shared the name of ''Marcus Aurelius''.  The praenomen and sometimes the nomen gradually disappeared from view, crowded out by other names indicating the bearer's rank and social connections.  Surviving inscriptions from the fifth century rarely provide a citizen's full nomenclature.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

In the final centuries of the Empire, the traditional nomenclature was sometimes replaced by alternate names, known as ''signa''.  In the course of the sixth century, as central authority collapsed and Roman institutions disappeared, the complex forms of Roman nomenclature were abandoned altogether, and the people of Italy and western Europe reverted to single names.  Modern European nomenclature developed independently of the Roman model during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. However, many modern names are derived from Roman originals.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

==''Tria nomina''==
The three types of names that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Roman were the ''praenomen, nomen'', and ''cognomen''.  Together, these were referred to as the ''tria nomina''.  Although not all Romans possessed three names, the practice of using multiple names having different functions was a defining characteristic of Roman culture that distinguished citizens from foreigners.

===Praenomen===
{{main|Praenomen}}
[[File:Peristyle.jpg|thumb|A Roman child.&lt;br&gt;''In the Peristyle'' (1874),&lt;br&gt;John William Waterhouse, 1849–1917]]
The praenomen was a true [[given name|personal name]], chosen by a child's parents, and bestowed on the ''dies lustricius'', or "day of lustration", a [[ritual purification]] performed on the eighth day after the birth of a girl, or the ninth day after the birth of a boy.{{efn-lr|In his treatise, ''De Praenominibus'', Probus cites [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]], an authority on [[Roman law]], for the proposition that boys did not receive a praenomen before assuming the ''[[Toga]] virilis'', signifying the transition into adulthood, and that girls did not receive a praenomen before marriage.&lt;ref name="De Praenominibus"/&gt;  But this appears to refer to some sort of formal ceremony in which a praenomen was granted or confirmed, rather than the original act of naming.  The funerary inscriptions of many Romans who died in childhood conclusively demonstrate that [[children of Ancient Rome|Roman children]] had praenomina.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;}}  Normally all of the children in a family would have different praenomina.{{efn-lr|As usual, there were exceptions to this policy as well; for instance, among the [[Fabia (gens)#Fabii Maximi|Fabii Maximi]], several brothers in a single family were all named ''Quintus''; in the first century AD, the [[Flavia (gens)#Flavii Sabini|Flavii Sabini]] all bore the praenomen ''Titus'', but were distinguished in each generation by the use of different cognomina.  Also, because praenomina had grammatical gender, a brother and sister could have the same praenomen, in masculine and feminine forms, and still be easily distinguished.}}  Although there was no law restricting the use of specific praenomina,{{efn-lr|A few exceptions are noted by the ancient historians; for example, supposedly no member of the [[Junia (gens)|Junia gens]] was named ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'' or ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'' after two brothers of this name, sons of the consul [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], were put to death for plotting to restore the Roman monarchy.  The [[Manlia (gens)|Manlia gens]] is said to have forbidden the use of ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'' after the condemnation of [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and after the death of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] and the execution of his son, it was decreed that none of the [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]] should ever again be named Marcus.  However, all of these supposed prohibitions were subsequently broken.}} the choice of the parents was usually governed by custom and family tradition.  An eldest son was usually named after his father, and younger sons were named after their father's brothers or other male ancestors.  In this way, the same praenomina were passed down in a family from one generation to the next.  Not only did this serve to emphasize the continuity of a family across many generations, but the selection of praenomina also distinguished the customs of one gens from another.  The patrician gentes in particular tended to limit the number of praenomina that they used far more than the plebeians, which was a way of reinforcing the exclusiveness of their social status.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, there were many exceptions to these general practices.  A son might be named in honour of one of his maternal relatives, thus bringing a new name into the gens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], epitome of [[Marcus Verrius Flaccus]], ''De Verborum Significatu'', ''s.v.'' "Numerius."&lt;/ref&gt;  Because some gentes made regular use of only three or four praenomina, new names might appear whenever there were several younger sons.  Furthermore, a number of the oldest and most influential patrician families made a habit of choosing unusual names; in particular the [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Furia (gens)|Furii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]] all used praenomina that were uncommon amongst the patricians, or which had fallen out of general use.  In the last two centuries of the Republic, and under the early Empire, it was fashionable for aristocratic families to revive older praenomina.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

About three dozen Latin praenomina were in use at the beginning of the Republic, although only about eighteen were common.  This number fell gradually, until by the first century AD, about a dozen praenomina remained in widespread use, with a handful of others used by particular families.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;  The origin and use of praenomina was a matter of curiosity to the Romans themselves; in ''De Praenominibus'', Probus discusses a number of older praenomina and their meanings.&lt;ref name="De Praenominibus"/&gt;  Most praenomina were regularly abbreviated, and rarely written in full.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;  Other praenomina were used by the Oscan, Umbrian, and Etruscan-speaking peoples of Italy, and many of these also had regular abbreviations.  Lists of praenomina used by the various people of Italy, together with their usual abbreviations, can be found at [[praenomen]].

Roman men were usually known by their praenomina to members of their family and household, ''[[patronage in ancient Rome|clientes]]'' and close friends; but outside of this circle, they might be called by their nomen, cognomen, or any combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen that was sufficient to distinguish them from other men with similar names.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt; In the literature of the Republic, and on all formal occasions, such as when a [[Roman Senate|senator]] was called upon to speak, it was customary to address a citizen by praenomen and nomen; or, if this were insufficient to distinguish him from other members of the gens, by praenomen and cognomen.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;

In imperial times, the praenomen became increasingly confused by the practices of the aristocracy. The [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] usually prefixed ''Imperator'' to their names as a praenomen, while at the same time retaining their own praenomina; but because most of the early emperors were legally adopted by their predecessors, and formally assumed new names, even these were subject to change.  Several members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] exchanged their original praenomina for cognomina, or received cognomina in place of praenomina at birth.  An emperor might emancipate or enfranchise large groups of people at once, all of whom would automatically receive the emperor's praenomen and nomen.  Yet another common practice beginning in the first century AD was to give multiple sons the same praenomen, and distinguish them using different cognomina; by the second century this was becoming the rule, rather than the exception.  Another confusing practice was the addition of the full nomenclature of maternal ancestors to the basic ''tria nomina'', so that a man might appear to have two praenomina, one occurring in the middle of his name.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

Under the weight of these practices and others, the utility of the praenomen to distinguish between men continued to decline, until only the force of tradition prevented its utter abandonment.  Over the course of the third century, praenomina become increasingly scarce in written records, and from the fourth century onward their appearance becomes exceptional.  The descendants of those who had been granted citizenship by the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' seem to have dispensed with praenomina altogether, and by the end of the western empire, only the oldest Roman families continued to use them.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

===Nomen===
The ''[[nomen gentilicium]]'', or "gentile name",{{efn-lr|Although this use of the term ''gentile'' has the same origin as the term used to distinguish non-Jews from the Jewish population, its meaning is purely civil, and has nothing to do with ethnic or religious identity; in this use it simply refers to a member of a gens, distinguished by his or her surname, and in this sense the term ''gentile name'' is used today without any religious connotation, despite (or perhaps because of) the use of ''Christian name'' to refer to personal names.  In this sense, Romanized Jews could also be gentiles, and gentiles could be Jewish! This is also the origin of the term ''gentleman''; the association of gentlemen with courtesy developed later.}} designated a Roman citizen as a member of a [[gens]].  A gens, which may be translated as "race", "family", or "clan", constituted an extended Roman family, all of whom shared the same nomen, and claimed descent from a common ancestor.  Particularly in the early Republic, the gens functioned as a state within the state, observing its own sacred rites, and establishing private laws, which were binding on its members, although not on the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970), "Gens."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognomen===
{{main|cognomen}}
[[File:N26FabiusCunctator.jpg|thumb|[[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], surnamed "Cunctator".&lt;br&gt;''Maximus'' was the branch of the [[Fabia (gens)|Fabia gens]] to which he belonged; ''Verrucosus'' was a personal cognomen referring to a wart above his upper lip; ''Cunctator'' a ''cognomen ex virtute'' referring to his delaying strategy against [[Hannibal]].&lt;br&gt;Statue at [[Schönbrunn Palace]], [[Vienna]]]]
The cognomen, the third element of the ''tria nomina'', began as an additional personal name.  It was not unique to Rome, but Rome was where the cognomen flourished, as the development of the gens and the gradual decline of the praenomen as a useful means of distinguishing between individuals made the cognomen a useful means of identifying both individuals and whole branches of Rome's leading families.  In the early years of the Republic, some aristocratic Romans had as many as three cognomina, some of which were hereditary, while others were personal.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

Like the nomen, cognomina could arise from any number of factors: personal characteristics, habits, occupations, places of origin, heroic exploits, and so forth. One class of cognomina consisted largely of archaic praenomina that were seldom used by the later Republic, although as cognomina these names persisted throughout Imperial times.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;George Davis Chase, "The Origin of Roman Praenomina", in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', vol. VIII (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cognomina had unusual terminations for Latin names, ending in ''-a, -o'', or ''-io'', and their meanings were frequently obscure, even in antiquity; this seems to emphasize the manner in which many cognomina originally arose from nicknames.  The ''-ius'' termination typical of Latin nomina was generally not used for cognomina until the fourth century AD, making it easier to distinguish between nomina and cognomina until the final centuries of the western empire.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

Unlike the nomen, which was passed down unchanged from father to son, cognomina could appear and disappear almost at will.  They were not normally chosen by the persons who bore them, but were earned or bestowed by others, which may account for the wide variety of unflattering names that were used as cognomina.  Doubtless some cognomina were used ironically, while others continued in use largely because, whatever their origin, they were useful for distinguishing among individuals and between branches of large families. New cognomina were coined and came into fashion throughout Roman history.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

Under the Empire, the number of cognomina increased dramatically.  Where once only the most noble patrician houses used multiple surnames, Romans of all backgrounds and social standing might bear several cognomina.  By the third century, this had become the norm amongst freeborn Roman citizens.  The question of how to classify different cognomina led the grammarians of the fourth and fifth centuries to designate some of them as ''agnomina''.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;

For most of the Republic, the usual manner of distinguishing individuals was through the binomial form of praenomen and nomen.  But as the praenomen lost its value as a distinguishing name, and gradually faded into obscurity, its former role was assumed by the versatile cognomen, and the typical manner of identifying individuals came to be by nomen and cognomen; essentially one form of binomial nomenclature was replaced by another, over the course of several centuries.  The very lack of regularity that allowed the cognomen to be used as either a personal or a hereditary surname became its strength in imperial times; as a hereditary surname, a cognomen could be used to identify an individual's connection with other noble families, either by descent, or later by association. Individual cognomina could also be used to distinguish between members of the same family; even as siblings came to share the same praenomen, they bore different cognomina, some from the paternal line, and others from their maternal ancestors.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

Although the nomen was a required element of Roman nomenclature down to the end of the western empire, its usefulness as a distinguishing name declined throughout imperial times, as an increasingly large portion of the population bore nomina such as ''Flavius'' or ''Aurelius'', which had been granted ''en masse'' to newly enfranchised citizens.  As a result, by the third century the cognomen became the most important element of the Roman name, and frequently the only one that was useful for distinguishing between individuals.  In the later empire, the proliferation of cognomina was such that the full nomenclature of most individuals was not recorded, and in many cases the only names surviving in extant records are cognomina.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

By the sixth century, traditional Roman cognomina were frequently prefixed by a series of names with Christian religious significance. As Roman institutions vanished, and the distinction between nomen and cognomen ceased to have any practical importance, the complex system of cognomina that developed under the later empire faded away.  The people of the western empire reverted to single names, which were indistinguishable from the cognomina that they replaced; many former praenomina and nomina also survived in this way.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

====Agnomen====
{{main|agnomen}}
The proliferation of cognomina in the later centuries of the Empire led some grammarians to classify certain types as ''agnomina''.  This class included two main types of cognomen: the ''cognomen ex virtute'', and cognomina that were derived from nomina, to indicate the parentage of Romans who had been adopted from one gens into another.  Although these names had existed throughout Roman history, it was only in this late period that they were distinguished from other cognomina.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;

=====''Cognomina ex virtute''=====
The ''cognomen ex virtute'' was a surname derived from some virtuous or heroic episode attributed to the bearer.  Roman history is filled with individuals who obtained cognomina as a result of their exploits: [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis]], who commanded the Roman army at the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]]; [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus]], who captured the city of [[Corioli]]; [[Marcus Valerius Corvus]], who defeated a giant [[Gauls|Gaul]] in single combat, aided by a raven; [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (consul 347 BC)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], who likewise defeated a Gaulish giant, and took his name from the [[torc|torque]] that he claimed as a prize; [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]], who carried the [[Second Punic War]] to Africa, and defeated [[Hannibal]].  Ironically, the most famous examples of this class of cognomen come from the period of the Republic, centuries before the concept of the ''agnomen'' was formulated.

=====Adoptive cognomina=====
{{main|adoption in ancient Rome}}
Adoption was a common and formal process in Roman culture.  Its chief purpose had nothing to do with providing homes for children; it was about ensuring the continuity of family lines that might otherwise become extinct.  In early Rome, this was especially important for the patricians, who enjoyed tremendous status and privilege compared with the plebeians.  Because few families were admitted to the patriciate after the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expulsion of the kings]], while the number of plebeians continually grew, the patricians continually struggled to preserve their wealth and influence.  A man who had no sons to inherit his property and preserve his family name would adopt one of the younger sons from another family.  In time, as the plebeians also acquired wealth and gained access to the offices of the Roman state, they too came to participate in the Roman system of adoption.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Adoption"&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897), "Adoption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970), "Adoption."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the primary purpose of adoption was to preserve the name and status of the adopter, an adopted son would usually assume both the praenomen and nomen of his adoptive father, together with any hereditary cognomina, just as an eldest son would have done.  However, adoption did not result in the complete abandonment of the adopted son's birth name.  The son's original nomen (or occasionally cognomen) would become the basis of a new surname, formed by adding the derivative suffix ''-anus'' or ''-inus'' to the stem.  Thus, when a son of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] was adopted by [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (priest)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]], he became [[Scipio Aemilianus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus]]; in his will, the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] adopted his grandnephew, Gaius Octavius, who became known as [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]].&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper's:Adoption"/&gt;

==Filiation==
Apart from the praenomen, the ''filiation'' was the oldest element of the Roman name.  Even before the development of the nomen as a hereditary surname, it was customary to use the name of a person's father as a means of distinguishing him or her from others with the same personal name; thus Lucius, the son of Marcus would be ''Lucius, Marci filius''; Paulla, the daughter of Quintus, would be ''Paulla, Quinti filia''.  Many nomina were derived in the same way, and most praenomina have at least one corresponding nomen, such as Lucilius, Marcius, Publilius, Quinctius, or Servilius.  These are known as patronymic surnames, because they are derived from the name of the original bearer's father.  Even after the development of the nomen and cognomen, filiation remained a useful means of distinguishing between members of a large family.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Nomen"/&gt;

[[File:Dedicatory inscription Ostia Antica 2006-09-08.jpg|thumb|400px|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Dedicated by the emperor Caesar, son of the divine Marcus Antoninus Pius, brother of the divine Commodus, grandson of the divine Antoninus Pius, great-grandson of the divine Hadrian, great-great-grandson of the divine Trajan, conqueror of Parthia, great-great-great-grandson of the divine Nerva, Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus Arabicus Adiabenicus, father of his country, Pontifex Maximus, holding the tribunician power for the fourth year, in the eighth year of his imperium, consul for the second time; and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar"]]
Filiations were normally written between the nomen and any cognomina, and abbreviated using the typical abbreviations for praenomina, followed by {{Smallcaps|f.}} for ''filius'' or ''filia'', and sometimes {{Smallcaps|n.}} for ''nepos'' (grandson) or ''neptis'' (granddaughter).  Thus, the inscription {{Smallcaps|S. Postumius A. f. P. n. Albus Regillensis}} means "Spurius Postumius Albus Regillensis, of Aulus the son, of Publius the grandson".  "Tiberius Aemilius Mamercinus, the son of Lucius and grandson of Mamercus" would be written {{Smallcaps|Ti. Aemilius L. f. Mam. n. Mamercinus}}.  The more formal the writing, the more generations might be included; a great-grandchild would be {{Smallcaps|pron.}} or {{Smallcaps|pronep.}} for ''pronepos'' or ''proneptis'', a great-great-grandchild {{Smallcaps|abn.}} or {{Smallcaps|abnep.}} for ''abnepos'' or ''abneptis'', and a great-great-great-grandchild ''adnepos'' or ''adneptis''.{{efn-lr|Also spelled ''atnepos'' and ''atneptis''.}}  However, these forms are rarely included as part of a name, except on the grandest of monumental inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Chidester Egbert, Jr.]], ''Introduction to the Study of Latin Inscriptions'' (American Book Company, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

The filiation sometimes included the name of the mother, in which case ''gnatus''{{efn-lr|Also spelled ''natus''; this could be abbreviated {{Smallcaps|gn.}}, {{Smallcaps|gnat.}}, or, perhaps confusingly, {{Smallcaps|n.}}}} would follow the mother's name, instead of ''filius'' or ''filia''.{{efn-lr|Evidently there were exceptions to this as well.  [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] ii. 4566 gives the name {{Smallcaps|Fabia Domitia Ɔ. f. Secunda}}, in which Ɔ. f. can only be read "Gaiae filia" (the use of an inverted {{Smallcaps|C.}} for "Gaia" was common in the filiations of freedmen, but apparently not restricted to them; see below); this may be the same woman referred to as {{Smallcaps|Fabia Domitia D. f. Secunda}}, CIL ii. 1806, in the latter case giving her father's name.  Both inscriptions are from Roman Spain, and are also notable for the doubled nomen and for the cognomen Secunda, which in this case is really a praenomen placed after the filiation, a common practice in Roman women's names of this period.}}  This is especially common in families of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] origin.  The names of married women were sometimes followed by the husband's name and ''uxor'' for "wife".  {{Smallcaps|N. Fabius Q. f. M. n. Furia gnatus Maximus}} means "Numerius Fabius Maximus, son of Quintus, grandson of Marcus, born of Furia",{{efn-lr|Note that while the names of the father and grandfather are genetive (''Quinti filius, Marci nepos''), the mother's name is ablative; the translation "born of" is simply idiomatic in English.  "Born to" would also be idiomatic, but could imply the dative case.}} while {{Smallcaps|Claudia L. Valeri uxor}} would be "Claudia, wife of Lucius Valerius".

[[Slavery in ancient Rome|Slaves]] and [[Slavery in ancient Rome|freedmen]] also possessed filiations, although in this case the person referred to is usually the slave's owner, rather than his or her father.  The abbreviations here include {{Smallcaps|s.}} for ''servus'' or ''serva'' and {{Smallcaps|l.}} for ''libertus'' or ''liberta''.  A slave might have more than one owner, in which case the names could be given serially.  In some cases the owner's nomen or cognomen was used instead of or in addition to the praenomen.  The ''liberti'' of women sometimes used an inverted "C", signifying the feminine praenomen ''Gaia'', here used generically to mean any woman; and there are a few examples of an inverted "M", although it is not clear whether this was used generically, or specifically for the feminine praenomen ''Marca'' or ''Marcia''.&lt;ref name="Chase"/&gt;

An example of the filiation of slaves and freedmen would be: {{Smallcaps|Alexander Corneli L. s.}}, "Alexander, slave of Lucius Cornelius", who upon his emancipation would probably become {{Smallcaps|L. Cornelius L. l. Alexander}}, "Lucius Cornelius Alexander, freedman of Lucius"; it was customary for a freedman to take the praenomen of his former owner, if he did not already have one, and to use his original personal name as a cognomen.  Another example might be {{Smallcaps|Salvia Pompeia Cn. Ɔ. l.}}, "Salvia Pompeia, freedwoman of Gnaeus (Pompeius) and Gaia"; here ''Gaia'' is used generically, irrespective of whether Pompeius' wife was actually named ''Gaia''.  A freedman of the emperor might have the filiation {{Smallcaps|Aug. l.}}, ''Augusti libertus''.

Although filiation was common throughout the history of the Republic and well into imperial times, no law governed its use or inclusion in writing.  It was used by custom and for convenience, but could be ignored or discarded, as it suited the needs of the writer.

==Tribe==
{{Main|Roman tribe}}

From the beginning of the [[Roman Republic]], all [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] were enumerated in one of the [[Roman tribe#The Servian tribes|tribes]] making up the ''[[Tribal Assembly|comitia tributa]]'', or "tribal assembly".  This was the most democratic of Rome's three main [[legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic]], in that all citizens could participate on an equal basis, without regard to wealth or social status.  Over time, its decrees, known as ''plebi scita'', or "plebiscites" became binding on the whole Roman people.  Although much of the assembly's authority was usurped by the emperors, membership in a tribe remained an important part of Roman citizenship, so that the name of the tribe came to be incorporated into a citizen's full nomenclature.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Tribus"&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897), "Tribus."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD:Tribus"&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970), "Tribus."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897), "Comitia."&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of tribes varied over time; tradition ascribed the institution of thirty tribes to [[Servius Tullius]], the sixth [[King of Rome]], but ten of these were destroyed at the beginning of the Republic.  Several tribes were added between 387 and 241 BC, as large swaths of Italy came under Roman control, bringing the total number of tribes to thirty-five; except for a brief experiment at the end of the Social War in 88 BC, this number remained fixed.  The nature of the tribes was mainly geographic, rather than ethnic; inhabitants of Rome were, in theory, assigned to one of the four "urban" tribes, while the territory beyond the city was allocated to the "rural" or "rustic" tribes.&lt;ref name="Harper's:Tribus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD:Tribus"/&gt;

Geography was not the sole determining factor in one's ''tribus''; at times efforts were made to assign freedmen to the four urban tribes, thus concentrating their votes and limiting their influence on the ''comitia tributa''.  Perhaps for similar reasons, when large numbers of provincials gained the franchise, certain rural tribes were preferred for their enrollment.  Citizens did not normally change tribes when they moved from one region to another; but the [[Roman censor|censors]] had the power to punish a citizen by expelling him from one of the rural tribes and assigning him to one of the urban tribes.  In later periods, most citizens were enrolled in tribes without respect to geography.&lt;ref name="OCD:Tribus"/&gt;

Precisely when it became common to include the name of a citizen's ''tribus'' as part of his full nomenclature is uncertain.  The name of the tribe normally follows the filiation and precedes any cognomina, suggesting that it occurred before the cognomen was recognized as a formal part of the Roman name; so probably no later than the second century BC.  However, in both writing and inscriptions, the ''tribus'' is found with much less frequency than other parts of the name; so the custom of including it does not seem to have been deeply ingrained in Roman practice.  As with the filiation, it was common to abbreviate the name of the tribe. For the names of the thirty-five tribes and their abbreviations, see [[Roman tribe#The Servian tribes|Roman tribe]].&lt;ref name="Harper's:Tribus"/&gt;

==Women's names==
{{main|Naming conventions for women in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Leighton, Frederic - Invocation.jpg|thumb|A Roman woman, attired as a [[Vestal Virgin|Priestess of Vesta]], performing sacred rites.&lt;br/&gt;''Invocation''&lt;br/&gt;[[Frederic Leighton]] (1830–1896)]]
In the earliest period, the binomial nomenclature of praenomen and nomen that developed throughout Italy was shared by both men and women.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;  Most praenomina had both masculine and feminine forms, and a number of praenomina common to women were seldom or never used by men.  Just as men's praenomina, women's names were regularly abbreviated instead of being written in full.&lt;ref name="Kajava"&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Mika Kajava|fi|3=Mika Kajava}}, ''Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  A list of women's praenomina can be found at [[Praenomen#Feminine names|praenomen]].

But for a variety of reasons, women's praenomina became neglected over the course of Roman history, and by the end of the Republic, most women did not have or did not use praenomina.  They did not disappear entirely, nor were Roman women bereft of personal names; but for most of Roman history women were known chiefly by their nomina or cognomina.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

The first of these reasons is probably that the praenomen itself lost much of its original utility following the adoption of hereditary surnames.  The number of praenomina commonly used by both men and women declined throughout Roman history.  For men, who might hold public office or serve in the military, the praenomen remained an important part of the legal name.  But, as in other ancient societies, Roman women played little role in public life, so the factors that resulted in the continuation of men's praenomina did not exist for women.

Another factor was probably that the praenomen was not usually necessary to distinguish between women within the family.  Because a Roman woman did not change her nomen when she married, her nomen alone was usually sufficient to distinguish her from every other member of the family.  As Latin names had distinctive masculine and feminine forms, the nomen was sufficient to distinguish a daughter from both of her parents and all of her brothers.  Thus, there was no need for a personal name unless there were multiple sisters in the same household.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

When this occurred, praenomina could be and frequently were used to distinguish between sisters. However, it was also common to identify sisters using a variety of names, some of which could be used as either praenomina or cognomina.  For example, if Publius Servilius had two daughters, they would typically be referred to as ''Servilia Major'' and ''Servilia Minor''.  If there were more daughters, the eldest might be called ''Servilia Prima'' or ''Servilia Maxima'';{{efn-lr|However, the eldest daughter, who might have been called by her nomen alone for several years, might continue to be so called even after the birth of younger sisters; in this case only the younger sisters might receive distinctive personal names.}} younger daughters as ''Servilia Secunda, Tertia, Quarta'', etc.  All of these names could be used as praenomina, preceding the nomen, but common usage from the later Republic onward was to treat them as personal cognomina; when these names appear in either position, it is frequently impossible to determine whether they were intended as praenomina or cognomina.&lt;ref name="Chase"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kajava"/&gt;

Although women's praenomina were infrequently used in the later Republic, they continued to be used, when needed, into [[Roman Empire|imperial times]].  Among the other peoples of Italy, women's praenomina continued to be used regularly until the populace was thoroughly Romanized.  In the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] culture, where women held a markedly higher social status than at Rome or in other ancient societies, inscriptions referring to women nearly always include praenomina.&lt;ref name="Kajava"/&gt;

[[File:0293 - Roma - S. Silvestro in Capite - Lapide romana - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 11-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|{{Smallcaps|Avlia L.F. Secunda}}&lt;br/&gt;Aulia Secunda, daughter of Lucius]]
Most Roman women were known by their nomina, with such distinction as described above for older and younger siblings.  If further distinction were needed, she could be identified as a particular citizen's daughter or wife.  For instance, [[Cicero]] refers to a woman as ''Annia P. Anni senatoris filia'', which means "Annia, daughter of Publius Annius, the senator".&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;  However, toward the end of the Republic, as hereditary cognomina came to be regarded as proper names, a woman might be referred to by her cognomen instead, or by a combination of nomen and cognomen; the daughter of [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] was usually referred to as ''[[Caecilia Metella Dalmatica|Caecilia Metella]]''.  Sometimes these cognomina were given diminutive forms, such as ''Agrippina'' from the masculine ''Agrippa'', or ''Drusilla'' from ''Drusus''.&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

In imperial times, other, less formal names were sometimes used to distinguish between women with similar names.  Still later, Roman women, like men, adopted ''signa'', or alternative names, in place of their Roman names.

With the fall of the western empire in the fifth century, the last traces of the distinctive Italic nomenclature system began to disappear, and women too reverted to single names.

==Foreign names==
As Roman territory expanded beyond Italy, many foreigners obtained Roman citizenship, and adopted Roman names.  Often these were discharged auxiliary soldiers, or the leaders of annexed towns and peoples.  Customarily a newly enfranchised citizen would adopt the praenomen and nomen of his patron; that is, the person who had adopted or manumitted him, or otherwise procured his citizenship.  But many such individuals retained a portion of their original names, usually in the form of cognomina.  This was especially true for citizens of [[Ancient Greece|Greek origin]].  A name such as {{Smallcaps|T. Flavius Aristodemus}} or {{Smallcaps|[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]}} would be typical of such persons, although in form these names are not distinguishable from those of freedmen.{{efn-lr|In such cases, the filiation, if present, would indicate if someone were a freedman; but in these particular instances the nomina suggest citizens of provincial origin, who have been enfranchised by imperial decree.}}&lt;ref name="OCD:Names"/&gt;

The ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' promulgated by [[Caracalla]] in AD 212 was perhaps the most far-reaching of many imperial decrees enfranchising large numbers of non-citizens living throughout the empire.  It extended citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire, all of whom thus received the name ''Marcus Aurelius'', after the emperor's praenomen and nomen.  The result was that vast numbers of individuals who had never possessed praenomina or nomina formally shared the same names.  In turn, many of the "new Romans" promptly discarded their praenomina, and ignored their nomina except when required by formality.  As a result, the cognomina adopted by these citizens, often including their original non-Latin names, became the most important part of their nomenclature.&lt;ref name="Salway"/&gt;

==Imperial names==
During the Republic, a person's names were usually static and predictable, unless he were adopted into a new family or obtained a new surname.  In imperial times, however, names became highly variable and subject to change.  Perhaps no names were more variable than those of the emperors.

For example, the first emperor, known conventionally as [[Augustus]], began life as {{Smallcaps|C. Octavius C. f.}}, or Gaius Octavius, the son of [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]].  His ancestors had borne the same name for at least four generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|6|41023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Octavia (gens)|Octavii]] were an old and distinguished plebeian family, the gens was not divided into ''stirpes'' and had no hereditary cognomina; Octavius' father had put down a slave revolt at [[Thurii]] and was sometimes given the surname ''Thurinus'' (a cognomen ''ex virtute''), but this name was not passed down to the son.

At the age of eighteen in 44 BC, Octavius was nominated ''[[magister equitum]]'' by his granduncle, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], who held the office of [[Roman dictator|dictator]].  On the [[Ides of March]], Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]], without legitimate children; but in his will he adopted his nephew, who then became {{Smallcaps|C. Julius C. f. Caesar Octavianus}}, "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, son of Gaius".  Thus far, his name follows the Republican model, becoming that of his adoptive father, followed by his original nomen in the form of an agnomen.

Two years later, Caesar was deified by the [[Roman Senate]], and Octavian, as he was then known, was styled {{Smallcaps|Divi f.}}, "son of the divine (Caesar)", instead of {{Smallcaps|C. f.}}.  Still later, after having been acclaimed ''[[Imperator]]'' by the troops under his command, Octavian assumed this title as an additional praenomen, becoming {{Smallcaps|Imp. C. Julius Divi f. Caesar Octavianus}}; in some inscriptions his original praenomen is discarded altogether.  In 27 BC, the Senate granted him the title of ''Augustus'', which would ever after be affixed as a cognomen to the names of the Roman emperors.

A similar pattern was followed by Augustus' heirs.  The emperor's stepson and eventual successor was born ''[[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]];'' after his adoption by the emperor, he became ''Tiberius Julius Caesar'' (retaining his original praenomen).  His brother, born ''[[Nero Claudius Drusus|Decimus Claudius Nero]]'', subsequently became ''Nero Claudius Drusus'', exchanging his original praenomen for his paternal cognomen, and assuming a new cognomen from his maternal grandfather.  Other members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] used praenomina such as ''Drusus'' and ''Germanicus''.

In subsequent generations, all reigning emperors assumed ''Imperator'' as an additional praenomen (usually without foregoing their original praenomina), and ''Augustus'' as a cognomen.  ''Caesar'' came to be used as a cognomen designating an heir apparent; and for the first two centuries of the empire, most emperors were adopted by their predecessors. The result was that each emperor bore a series of names that had more to do with the previous emperor than the names with which he had been born. They added new cognomina as they fought and conquered enemies and new lands, and their filiations recorded their descent from a series of gods.  As the names of the emperors themselves changed, so did the names of the members of their families.

==Later development==
During the Empire, superficially the naming conventions appear to dissolve into anarchy. In fact, this was not the case: new conventions developed, which were themselves internally coherent.&lt;ref name=Salway145&gt;Salway, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binary nomenclature and polyonymy===
Under the "High Empire", the new aristocracy began adopting two or more nomina – a practice which has been termed 'binary nomenclature'.&lt;ref name=Salway131&gt;Salway, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; This arose out of a desire to incorporate distinguished maternal ancestry in a name or, in order to inherit property, an heir was required by a will to incorporate the [[testator]]'s name into his own name.&lt;ref name=Salway132&gt;Salway, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the suffect consul of AD 118/9, [[Gaius Bruttius Praesens (consul AD 139)|Gaius Bruttius Praesens Lucius Fulvius Rusticus]], has a name which is composed of two standard sets of tria nomina: he was the natural son of a Lucius Bruttius, and added the nomina of his maternal grandfather, Lucius Fulvius Rusticus, to his paternal nomina.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt;

In order to reflect an illustrious pedigree or other connections, the aristocracy expanded the binary nomenclature concept to include other nomina from an individual's paternal and maternal ancestry.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt; There was no limit to the number of names which could be added in this way (known as polyonomy), and, for example, the consul of 169 AD, (usually called [[Quintus Pompeius Senecio Sosius Priscus|Q. Sosius Priscus]]) had thirty-eight names comprising fourteen sets of nomina reflecting a complex pedigree stretching back three generations.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt;

===Cognomen replaces praenomen===
The praenomen, even under the classic system, had never been particularly distinctive because of the limited number of praenomina available.&lt;ref name=Flower&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|last=Flower|first= Harriet (ed.)|isbn=978-0-521-00390-2|page=119|date=2004-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the late Republic and the second century AD, the praenomen gradually became less used and eventually disappeared altogether.&lt;ref name=Salway131/&gt; Even among the senatorial aristocracy it became a rarity by about 300 AD.&lt;ref name=Salway131/&gt; In part this came about through a tendency for the same praenomen to be given to all males of a family, thereby fossilizing a particular preaenomen/nomen combination and making the praenomen even less distinctive e.g. all males in the emperor [[Vespasian]]'s family (including all his sons) had the praenomen/nomen combination Titus Flavius:&lt;ref name=Salway130&gt;Salway, p.130&lt;/ref&gt;
* grandfather: [[Titus Flavius Petro]]
* father: [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]] (married [[Vespasia Polla]])
* elder brother: [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], whose son was [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 69)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]] and grandsons were [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]] and [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]].
* ''Titus Flavius Vespasianus'', emperor, known as ''Vespasianus'' (married [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla]])
* eldest son: Titus Flavius Vespasianus, emperor, known as ''[[Titus]]''
* youngest son: Titus Flavius Domitianus, emperor, known as ''[[Domitian]]us''
The cognomen, as in Vespasian's family, then assumed the distinguishing function for individuals; where this happened, the cognomen replaced the praenomen in intimate address.&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt; The result was that two names remained in use for formal public address but instead of praenomen + nomen, it became nomen + cognomen.&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt;

===Constitutio Antoniniana===
With the [[Constitutio Antoniniana]] in 212, the emperor [[Caracalla]] granted Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire. It had long been the expectation that when a non-Roman acquired citizenship he, as part of his enfranchisement, took on a Roman name.&lt;ref name=Salway133&gt;Salway, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass enfranchisement of 212, the new citizens adopted the nomen "Aurelius" in recognition of Caracalla’s beneficence&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt; (the emperor's full name was Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Augustus, with Aurelius as the nomen). "Aurelius" quickly became the most common nomen in the east and the second most common (after "Julius") in the west.&lt;ref name=Salway134&gt;Salway, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The change in the origins of the new governing elite that assumed control of the empire from the end of the third century can be seen in their names: seven of the thirteen emperors between [[Gallienus]] and [[Diocletian]] bore the name "Marcus Aurelius"&lt;ref name=Salway136&gt;Salway, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Although praenomina were not adopted by the new citizens, reflecting the pre-existing decline amongst "old" Romans,&lt;ref name=Salway133/&gt; in the west the new names were formulated on the same basis as the existing Roman practices.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt; In the east, however, the new citizens formulated their names by placing "Aurelius" before versions of their non-Roman given name and a patronymic.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt; Ultimately, the ubiquity of "Aurelius" meant that it could not function as a true distinguishing nomen, and became primarily just a badge of citizenship added to any name.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt;

===Traditional nomen replaced===
Although a nomen would long be required for official purposes, and, in isolated corners of the empire and in parts of Italy, its usage would persist into the seventh century, the nomen was generally omitted from the name (even of emperors) by the third century.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt;

Two factors encouraged its frequent non-use. Firstly, the cognomen increasingly became the distinguishing name and general name of address.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt; As a result, "New Romans" and, under their influence, "old Romans" too, either dropped the nomen from their name&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt; or, in some cases, treated the nomen as a praenomen.&lt;ref name=Salway136&gt;Salway, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, with the nomen becoming an increasingly fossilized formality, non-Italian families, even those who had acquired citizenship and a nomen prior to 212, began to ignore their nomen.&lt;ref name=Salway135&gt;Salway, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; When a nomen was required for official purposes they would simply put the default nomen of "Aurelius" in front of their name, rather than use their actual nomen.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt;

{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Samaritan Aramaic''', or ''Samaritan'', was the dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] used by the [[Samaritan]]s in their sacred and scholarly literature.  This should not be confused with the [[Samaritan Hebrew]] language of the Scriptures. Samaritan Aramaic ceased to be a spoken language some time between the 10th and the 12th centuries.

In form it resembles the Aramaic of the [[Targum]]im, and is written in the [[Samaritan alphabet]].

Important works written in Samaritan include the translation of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] in the form of the targum paraphrased version.  There are also legal, exegetical and liturgical texts, though later works of the same kind were often written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

==Sample==

[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] XX.1-6:

# Umellel Elâ'e yet kel milleyya aalen elmimar.
# Ana Šema Eluek deppiqtek men ara Mişrem mibbet awadem.
# La ya'i lak ela'en uranem al eppi.
# La tewed lak efsel ukel demu debšumeyya millel wedbaraa millera wedbameyya millera laraa.
# La tisgad lon ula tešememminon ala anaki Šema elaak el qana fuqed ob awaan al banem wel telitaem wel rewi'a'em elsenai.
# Wabed esed lalafem elra'emi welnateri fiqqudi.

Notice the similarities with [[Judeo-Aramaic]] as found in [[Targum Onqelos]] to this same passage (some expressions below are paraphrased, not literally translated):

{{Hebrew|1=&lt;span dir="rtl"&gt;
# וּמַלֵּיל יְיָ יָת כָּל פִּתְגָמַיָּא הָאִלֵּין לְמֵימַר
# אֲנָא יְיָ אֱלָהָךְ דְּאַפֵּיקְתָּךְ מֵאַרְעָא דְּמִצְרַיִם מִבֵּית עַבְדוּתָא
# לָא יִהְוֵי לָךְ אֱלָהּ אָחֳרָן, בָּר מִנִּי
# לָא תַּעֲבֵיד לָךְ צֵילַם וְכָל דְּמוּ דְּבִשְׁמַיָּא מִלְּעֵילָא וְדִבְאַרְעָא מִלְּרַע וְדִבְמַיָּא מִלְּרַע לְאַרְעָא
# לָא תִּסְגּוֹד לְהוֹן וְלָא תִּפְלְחִנִּין  אֲרֵי אֲנָא יְיָ אֱלָהָךְ אֵל קַנָּא מַסְעַר חוֹבֵי אֲבָהָן עַל בְּנִין מָרָדִין עַל דָּר תְּלִיתַאי וְעַל דָּר רְבִיעַאי לְסָנְאָי כַּד מַשְׁלְמִין בְּנַיָּא לְמִחְטֵי בָּתַר אֲבָהָתְהוֹן
# וְעָבֵיד טֵיבוּ לְאַלְפֵי דָּרִין לְרָחֲמַי וּלְנָטְרֵי פִּקּוֹדָי

[[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute, or "Sawney Mucklemon"]], the Scottish Prime Minister, offers [[William Hogarth]] (with a thistle in his hat) a pension to suppress a satirical print.]]
[[File:A Scotsman in Highland dress seated with his legs down two l Wellcome V0011288.jpg|thumb|''Sawney in the bog house'', 1779, attributed to [[James Gillray]].]]
'''Sawney''' (sometimes '''Sandie/y''', or '''Sanders''', or '''Sannock''') was an [[England|English]] nickname for a [[Scotland|Scotsman]], now obsolete, and playing much the same linguistic role that "[[Scottish people|Jock]]" does now.  The name is a [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] [[diminutive]] of the favourite Scottish first name Alexander (also Alasdair in [[Scottish Gaelic]] form, anglicised into Alistair) from the last two syllables. The English commonly abbreviate the first two syllables into "Alec". 

From the days after the accession of [[James I of England|James VI]] to the English throne under the title of James I, to the time of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Bute]] administration, when Scotsmen were exceedingly unpopular and Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] - the great Scotophobe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samueljohnson.com/scotland.html#33 |title=Quotes on Scotland: The Samuel Johnson Sound Bite Page |publisher=SamuelJohnson.com |accessdate=11 August 2010 |quote="The noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England!" }}&lt;/ref&gt; and son of a Scottish bookseller at [[Lichfield]] - thought it prudent to disguise his origin, and overdid his prudence by maligning his father's countrymen, it was customary to designate a Scotsman a "Sawney". This vulgar epithet, however, was dying out fast by the 1880s, and was obsolete by the 20th century.

Sawney was a common figure of fun in English cartoons.  A particularly [[racist]] example, ''Sawney in the [[Outhouse|Bog House]]'', shows a stereotypical Scots Highlander using a communal bench toilet by sticking one of his legs down each of the holes.  This was originally published in London in June 1745,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1478257&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=1868,0808.12385&amp;page=1 British Museum example]&lt;/ref&gt; just over a month before "[[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]" landed in Scotland to begin the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].  In this version Sawney's excreta emerge from below his kilt and flow across the bench.  The idea was revived in a different and slightly more decorous version of 1779, which is attributed to the young [[James Gillray]].  An inscription reads: 

:'Tis a bra' bonny seat, o' my saul, Sawney cries,
:I never beheld sic before with me Eyes,
:Such a place in aw' Scotland I never could meet,
:For the High and the Low ease themselves in the Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1472016&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=No+Popery&amp;page=1 ''Sawney in the bog-house''], British Museum, 1779&lt;/ref&gt;  

It has also been suggested that the [[Galloway]] cannibal [[Sawney Bean]] may have been a fabrication to emphasise the alleged savagery of the Scots.

Sometimes also used in the term "Sawney Ha'peth", meaning "Scots [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]]worth" implying "Scottish fool".  At the time of the [[Acts of Union 1707|political union of Scotland and England]] in 1707, the [[Pound Scots]] was worth 1/12 of the [[Pound Sterling]], thus a "Scots halfpennyworth" implies worthlessness.

The word "sawney" survives in the current [[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]] (OSPD), which validates the word in Scrabble tournament play, and is defined as "a foolish person".

[[File:Screen tone example.svg|thumb|Three shapes overlaid with different screentone patterns]]
'''Screentone''' is a technique for applying [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]]s and [[shading|shade]]s to [[drawing]]s, used as an alternative to [[hatching]]. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to [[paper]] from preprinted sheets,&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kinsella, ''Adult Manga: Culture and Power in Contemporary Japanese Society'', Routledge, 2000, p59. {{ISBN|0-7007-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the technique is also simulated in [[computer graphics]].  It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|71456830 |Zip-A-Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Chart-Pak (1949&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72055435|Chart-Pak}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Letratone (1966, from [[Letraset]]&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72322600|Letratone}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A traditional screentone sheet consists of a flexible transparent backing, the printed texture, and a [[wax]] [[adhesive]] layer. The sheet is applied to the paper, adhesive down, and rubbed with a stylus on the backing side. The backing is then peeled off, leaving the [[ink]] adhered to the paper where pressure was applied.

A screentone saves an artist's time by allowing quick application of textures to [[line art]] where a hand-shaded area would not be reproduced in a timely or acceptable manner. Much like [[halftone]], the size and spacing of black dots, lines, or hatches determine how light or dark an area will appear. Visual artists need to take into account how much an image will be reduced when prepared for publication when choosing the [[Dot pitch|pitch]] of a screentone. Screentones can also be layered to produce [[interference pattern]]s such as [[moire effect]]s, or to simulate multiple sources of shadow in an image.

==Styles==
Different styles of screentone exist, variously intended to depict clothing, clouds, emotions, backgrounds, [[image gradient|gradients]] and even objects such as trees. While the sheets are most commonly produced with black ink, there are also varieties in solid and patterned colors. Screentones can also be modified by lightly scratching the backing with an [[X-Acto]] blade to produce [[Starburst (symbol)|starburst]]s and other special effects.

Screentones are widely used by illustrators and artists, especially for [[cartoon]]s and [[advertising]]. Use of the original medium has been declining since the advent of [[graphics software]] and [[desktop publishing]], but it is still used, for example in [[manga]].

While computer graphics software provides a variety of alternatives to screentone, its appearance is still frequently simulated, to achieve consistency with earlier work or avoid the appearance of computer-generated images. It is sometimes accomplished by [[image scanner|scanning]] actual screentone sheets, but original vector or bitmap screen patterns are also used.

A '''social welfare model''' is a system of [[social welfare]] provision and its accompanying [[value system]]. It usually involves [[social policies]] that affect the welfare of a country's citizens within the framework of a market or mixed economy.

==Elements of a social welfare model==

===Taxation===
Taxation is concerned with how the state taxes the people, whether by a [[flat tax]], [[regressive tax]] or a [[progressive tax]] system. The most common guiding rule of taxation is to levy taxes by the ability to pay.

===Social insurance===
Social insurance is concerned with how the state implements [[social welfare|benefits]] for the unemployed, pensions, maternity and paternity leave and [[disabilities]].

===Public services===
Services such as [[health care]] can be almost entirely state funded, private [[insurance]]-based, or somewhere in-between. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has an almost entirely publicly funded health service, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and [[Canada]] offers public health care offered at a [[province|provincial]] level. Conversely, in the [[United States]], individuals have to rely on health insurance policies in the event of hospitalization, and a minimal amount of state support for the poorer people exists. Another element can be [[public transport]], as some countries have nationalized rapid transit systems, while others have privatized them (in the UK for example, public transport has been privatised in [[Great Britain]] but not in [[Northern Ireland]]).

===Employment===
Economies with a more [[laissez-faire]] approach to employment will do nothing to provide job security. Other countries will rely on some degree of [[regulation]] to protect workers from arbitrary firings. A high degree of regulation such as expensive severance fees is often cited reason for making employers reluctant to hire and causing unemployment.

==Examples==

=== European welfare models ===
{{main|European social model}}

==== British Model====
Used by the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and the [[South Asia|South Asian countries]] the British model tends to have a [[welfare state]] of roughly average size, relative to [[High income country|high-income]] [[OECD]] countries, but less comprehensive than those in [[Scandinavia]] and much of continental Europe. They have somewhat more poverty and higher inequality. Despite having a smaller welfare state than most Western European countries, the UK, Ireland and Canada do provide, among other things, universal single payer health care, redistribute income and guarantee an income at subsistence level.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004), ''Economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continental European ====
Used by [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the Continental model has strict rules on job protection and a large amount of regulation in [[industry]]. However, the [[labour market]] has proven to be inflexible and slow to react to [[globalization]]. Generous insurance-based [[unemployment benefits]] and a well funded welfare state are used to reduce poverty and provide high quality health care. This model can generally be seen as middle ground between the British and Nordic models.

==== Mediterranean ====
Used by [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], the [[Mediterranean]] model is similar to the Continental model, but focuses welfare on generous state-pensions. The labour market is inflexible with the same job protectionism as in the Continental model, but is not good at reducing poverty within the [[Working class|lower end]] of society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== The Nordic Model ====
The [[Scandinavian welfare model|Nordic Model]], mainly refers to Nordic countries  [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]] but some include the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Nordic+model&lt;/ref&gt; also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because of strong influence of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] elements such as [[labor union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As a result of the policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in [[Satisfaction with Life Index|world happiness surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360517.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-happiest-places-on-earth-are-heavily-taxed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United States of America ===
{{see also|American way of life}}
Before the Great Depression, the United States adhered to a social model that could be summarized by the term "rugged individualism": the understanding that because most people are capable of taking care of themselves, each person should be left to succeed or fail on their own, only fettered by the bounds of the law, and the government should be limited to protection of [[civil liberties]]. The United States had very little in the way of a [[social safety net]] for its citizens, with most people depending on their families and private social organizations if they were unable to provide for themselves; this partially explains the enduring greater emphasis on family and religion in American society and politics today than in other comparably developed countries in [[Western Europe]].

As a result of increased modernization in the late 19th century, this view changed in the emergence of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], which held that the government can and should have a greater role in regulating the economy, so as to promote a better life for all of its citizens. The biggest change came with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], during which time the American government intervened extensively in the economy, guided often by [[Keynesian economics]]. New programs included relief for the poor, unemployed, and those who cannot work due to youth, old age, or disability.

However, since the [[Great Depression]], the United States has not followed other developed democracies in the establishment of a more comprehensive model for assuring its citizens' well being. One possible explanation for this is that the U.S was not affected in the same way by World War II as Europe was: while Europeans relied on strong centralized governments to help rebuild their economies after two world wars, the United States was enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth due to its being one of the few industrialized countries on the planet whose productive capacity had not been destroyed by enemy nations. But now, with the rise of industrial and geo-political competition in Europe and Asia, growing income inequality, high energy prices, and mounting public debt, there is renewed debate over the role of government in modern society.

'''Swapnasandhani''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: {{audio|Bn-স্বপ্নসন্ধানী.oga|''Shopnoshondhānī''}}) is a Bengali theater group from [[Kolkata]]. The group was founded on 29 May 1992.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;  Swapnasandhani has been marked by the acting and direction of [[Kaushik Sen]]. In November 2017, Sen stopped directing the group in order to bring change and "explore the creativity of the group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/kaushik-sen-quits-debesh-takes-over-theatre-group/articleshow/61796070.cms|title=Kaushik Sen quits, Debesh takes over theatre group | newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 November 2017 | first=Shamayita | last=Chakraborty | accessdate=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
From 2006, Swapnasandhani began performing on a regular basis at the [[Sujata Sadan]] every Saturday. This eliminated their need to wait in queue for free slots at the major theatres like the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata|Academy of Fine Arts]], [[Madhusudan Mancha]] etc.

'''Swimwear''' is [[clothing]] designed to be worn by people engaging in a water-based activity or [[List of water sports|water sports]], such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[surfing]], or sun-orientated activities, such as [[sun bathing]]. Different types may be worn by men, women, and children. Swimwear is described by a number of names, some of which are used only in particular locations, including '''swimsuit''', '''bathing suit''', '''swimming costume''', '''bathing costume''', '''swimming suit''', '''swimmers''', '''swimming togs''', '''bathers''', '''cossie''' (short for "costume"), or '''swimming trunks''' for men, besides others.

A swimsuit can be worn as an [[undergarment]] in sports that require a wetsuit such as [[water skiing]], [[scuba diving]], [[surfing]], and [[wakeboarding]]. Swimsuits may also be worn to display the wearer's [[physical attractiveness|physical attributes]], as in the case of [[beauty pageant]]s or [[bodybuilding]] contests, and [[glamour photography]] and magazines like the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'' feature models and sports personalities in swimsuits.

There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits available, which vary as to body coverage and materials. The choice of style may depend on community standards of [[modesty]], as well as current [[fashions]], and personal preferences. The choice will also consider the occasion, for example whether it is to be worn for a passive occasion such as sunbathing or for an activity such as surfing or [[swimsuit competition]]. Swimwear for men usually exposes the chest, while suits for women usually cover at least the breasts.

==Materials==
[[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html|work=The Houston Chronicle|accessdate=August 29, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019123822/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html|archivedate=October 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic,&lt;!-- Rayon also had the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadolph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author1=Kadolph, Sara J.  |author2=Langford, Anna L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and [[silk]] also sometimes being used.&lt;ref name=glamoursurf&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear Timeline|url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|publisher=Glamoursurf.com|accessdate=August 29, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142213/http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|archivedate=October 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, new materials were being developed and use in swimwear, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], and swimsuits gradually began hugging the body,&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626130548/http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |archivedate=2017-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially women's swimsuits.

==Swimsuit styles==
In western culture, men's swimsuit styles include [[boardshorts]], [[jammer (swimwear)|jammers]], [[Trunks (clothing)|swim trunks]], [[swim briefs|briefs]] or "[[Speedo (suit style)|speedos]]", [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], and [[g-string]]s, in order of decreasing lower body coverage, and Women's swimsuits include [[one-piece swimsuit|one-piece]], [[bikini]]s, or [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]s. While they go through many trends in pattern, length and cut there is not much modification to the original variety of suit. A recent innovation is the [[burqini]], favored by some Muslim women, which covers the whole body and head (but not face) in a manner similar to a diver's [[wetsuit]]. These are an updated version of full-body swimwear, which has been [[sea bathing|available for centuries]], but conforms with [[Islam]]'s traditional emphasis on modest dress. In [[Egypt]], the term "[[Sharia]] swimsuit" is used to describe full-body swimwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/910379.stm |title=Warm welcome for 'Sharia swimsuit' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-01-10 |last=Hawley |first=Caroline |date=2000-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217020533/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/910379.stm |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Image:USC Waterpolo Player.jpg|100px]]
| valign="top" | Swim briefs, often made of wool and held in place with a military-style canvas belt at the waist, go back at least to the 1930s.  They can be seen in hundreds of print ads, worn by muscleman [[Charles Atlas]], and were very popular.  Although in a style that today appears similar to underwear [[briefs]], it is likely that the swimwear preceded the underwear,   A nylon version (without the belt), pictured at left, was launched at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]] by [[Speedo]]. Swim briefs are now often made of a [[nylon]] and [[spandex]] composite, while some longer lasting suits are made from [[polyester]]. The style varies from a full seat to [[Thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]]. Most swim briefs have a beige or white lining on the inside front made of a similar fabric.
|-
| [[Boardshorts]]
| [[File:Boardshorts.jpg|Boardshorts|100px]]
| valign="top" | Boardshorts are a longer version of trunks that come to or past the knee. They usually have a non-elastic waistband, and will give a tight fit around the torso. Boardshorts were originally developed for various "board sports" such as [[surfing]], [[paddleboarding]], [[Wakeboarding]]. The looser fitting design provided less material that could catch as one mounted their board.
|-
| Trunks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(also known as boardshorts in Australia or shorts in UK)&lt;/small&gt;
| [[Image:Boy in Swimming Trunks.JPG|100px]]
| valign="top" | In the US, this describes a loose, mid-thigh style of swimwear,  made of 100% [[polyester]] or 100% [[nylon]] fabric. They are usually shorter than [[boardshorts]] but longer than [[boxer shorts]]. They feature a polyester liner inside the shorts. Although trunks have been used as swimwear since the 1940s, their heyday was in 1990s when they were highly popularised thanks in part to TV shows like ''[[Baywatch]]''. Today, they have been eclipsed by boardshorts among teenagers and young adults. They remain the norm with older age groups and young children.

In other cultures (particularly the UK) the term 'trunks' is used to describe swim briefs, although it has been increasingly common for any men's swimwear to be generically described as 'trunks'.

==Body coverage==

Swimsuits can be [[skin-tight clothing|skin-tight]] or loose-fitting. They are often lined with another layer of fabric if the outer fabric becomes [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] when wet.

Swimsuits range from designs that almost completely cover the body to designs that expose almost all of the body. The choice of swimsuit will depend on personal and community standards of [[modesty]] and on considerations such as how much or how little [[Sun protective clothing|sun protection]] is desired, and prevailing [[Fashion#Clothing|fashion]]s. Almost all swimsuits cover the [[genitals]] and [[pubic hair]], while most except [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]] or [[G-string]] cover much or all of the [[buttocks]].&lt;ref name=menkes&gt;Suzy Menkes, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Runways: Remembrance of Thongs Past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202185622/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |date=2009-02-02 }}", ''The New York Times'', July 18, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Most swimsuits in [[western culture]] leave at least the head, shoulders, arms, and lower part of the leg (below the knee) exposed. Women's swimsuits generally cover at least the [[areola]] and bottom half of the [[breast]]s, but some are designed for the top part of the swimsuit to be removed. In many countries, young girls and sometimes women choose not to wear a swimsuit top, and this can vary with the occasion, location, age, etc.

Both men and women may sometimes wear swimsuits covering more of the body when swimming in cold water (see also [[wetsuit]] and [[dry suit]]). In colder temperatures, the swimwear is needed to conserve body heat and protect the body core from hypothermia.

==Swimwear and hygiene==
Germs, bacteria, and mold can grow very quickly on wet bathing suits. Medical professionals warn that wearing damp swimwear for long periods of time can cause a number of infections and rashes in children and adults, and warn against sharing bathing suits with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/child-safety-public-swimming-pool-49723.html|title=Child Safety: Public Swimming Pool|date=16 May 1986|work=Essortment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730021624/http://www.essortment.com/child-safety-public-swimming-pool-49723.html|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/disease/hot_tub_rash.html|title=Hot Tub Rash - Hygiene-related Diseases - Hygiene - Healthy Water - CDC|work=cdc.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830112532/https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/disease/hot_tub_rash.html|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that changing out of a wet bathing suit right away can help prevent vaginal infections, itching and/or jock itch.&lt;ref name=Drexel&gt;Nyirjesy and Bayer [http://www.drexelmed.edu/Home/HealthEncyclopediaArticles/DiseasesandConditions/Vaginalyeastinfection.html Vaginal yeast infection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413060128/http://www.drexelmed.edu/Home/HealthEncyclopediaArticles/DiseasesandConditions/Vaginalyeastinfection.html |date=2012-04-13 }}, Drexel University College of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003159.htm Vaginal itching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704213442/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003159.htm |date=2016-07-04 }}.

In public swimming pools in France for reasons of hygiene, it is only permitted to wear closer fitting styles of swimwear.

== History ==
{{main|History of swimwear}}

===Pre-20th century===
[[Image:Bathing suit 1858.png|thumb|150px|1858 Woman's bathing suit]]
In [[classical antiquity]] swimming and bathing were done naked. There are Roman murals which show women playing sports and exercising wearing two-piece suits covering the areas around their breasts and hips in a fashion remarkably similar to the present-day bikini. However, there is no evidence that they were used for swimming. All classical pictures of swimming show nude swimmers.

In various cultural traditions one swims, if not in the nude, in a version in suitable material of a garment or undergarment commonly worn on land, e.g. a [[loincloth]] such as the Japanese man's [[fundoshi]].

In the United Kingdom until the mid-19th century there was no law against nude swimming, and each town was free to make its own laws. For example, the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for men:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is Ordered Established and Decreed by this Corporation that no Male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a Pair of [[Undergarment|Drawers]] and a [[Waistcoat]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name=Bath&gt;Quoted in Byrde, Penelope. "That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath", Costume, No 21, 1987, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In rivers, lakes, streams and the sea men swam in the nude, where the practice was common. Those who didn't swim in the nude, stripped to their underwear. The English practice of men swimming in the nude was banned in the United Kingdom in 1860. Drawers, or [[caleçon]]s as they were called, came into use in the 1860s. Even then there were many who protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. [[Francis Kilvert]] described men's bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as "a pair of very short red and white striped drawers".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cec Cinder, PhD: ''The Nudist Idea'', Ultraviolet Press, Riverside, California: 1998, p. 333. {{ISBN|978-0-9652085-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch - Masculine beauty retouched1.png|thumb|Cartoon by [[George du Maurier]] in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1877, showing men's and children's bathing suits]]
Female bathing costumes were derived from those worn at Bath and other spas. It would appear that until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and that after that time women bathed clothed. Celia Fiennes gave a detailed description of the standard ladies' bathing costume in 1687:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ladyes go into the bath with Garments made of a fine yellow canvas, which is stiff and made large with great sleeves like a parson’s gown; the water fills it up so that it is borne off that your shape is not seen, it does not cling close as other linning, which Lookes sadly in the poorer sort that go in their own linning. The Gentlemen have drawers and wastcoates of the same sort of canvas, this is the best linning, for the bath water will Change any other yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Byrde, Penelope. "That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath", Costume, No 21, 1987, pp.48–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No Female person shall at any time hereafter go into a Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a decent [[Chemise|Shift]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name=Bath /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Expedition of Humphry Clinker'' was published in 1771 and its description of ladies’ bathing costume is different from that of Celia Fiennes a hundred years earlier:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen, with chip hats, in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Smollett |first=Tobias George |date=1906 |title=The Expedition of Humphry Clinker |url= |location=New York |publisher=The Century Company |pages=38-39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Penelope Byrde points out that Smollett’s description may not be accurate, for he describes a two-piece costume, not the one piece shift or smock that most people describe and is depicted in contemporary prints. His description does, however, tally with Elizabeth Grant’s description of the guide’s costume at Ramsgate in 1811. The only difference is in the fabric the costumes are made of. Flannel, however, was a common fabric for sea bathing costumes as many believed the warmer fabric was necessary in cold water.&lt;ref name=Austen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514035307/http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|title=Bathing - Jane Austen at the seaside|archivedate=14 May 2013|work=jasa.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century women wore "bathing gowns" in the water; these were long dresses of fabrics that would not become transparent when wet, with weights sewn into the hems so that they would not rise up in the water. The men's swim suit, a rather form-fitting wool garment with long sleeves and legs similar to long [[underwear]], was developed and would change little for a century.

In the 19th century, the woman's double suit was common, comprising a gown from shoulder to knees plus a set of trousers with leggings going down to the ankles.

In the [[Victorian era]], popular beach resorts were commonly equipped with [[bathing machine]]s designed to avoid the exposure of people in swimsuits, especially to people of the opposite sex.

In the United States, [[beauty pageant]]s of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
[[Image:BathingMachineDontBeAfraid.jpg|thumb|right|Man and woman in swimsuits, c.1910; she is exiting a [[bathing machine]]]]

In 1907, the swimmer [[Annette Kellerman]] from [[Australia]] visited the United States as an "underwater ballerina", a version of [[synchronized swimming]] involving diving into glass tanks. She was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck. Kellerman changed the suit to have long arms and legs and a collar, still keeping the close fit that revealed the shapes underneath. She later starred in several [[film|movies]], including one about her life. She marketed a line of bathing suits and her style of one-piece suits came to be known as "the Annette Kellerman". The Annette Kellerman was considered the most offensive style of swimsuit in the 1920s and became the focus of censorship efforts.&lt;ref name="www1.assumption.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/vanities/default.html |title=Vanities |publisher=.assumption.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530160551/http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/vanities/default.html |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Meagan Hess |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/hess/fashion/inthiscorner3.html |title=Skirting the Skirts at the Bathing Beach |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619153105/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/hess/Fashion/inthiscorner3.html |archivedate=2013-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite opposition from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It was not long before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then legs up to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around the neck down to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.&lt;ref&gt;http://modadellacqua.com/blogs/news/32188611-history-of-male-swimwear-the-origins-of-the-bathing-suit-1880-1930-modesty-and-transgression{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the figure-hugging nature of these garments, [[glamour photography]] since the 1940s and 1950s has often featured people wearing swimsuits. This type of glamour photography eventually evolved into swimsuit photography exemplified by the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. Beauty contests also required contestants to wear form-fitting swimsuits.

The first [[bikinis]] appeared just after [[World War II]]. Early examples were not very different from the women's two pieces common since the 1920s, except that they had a gap below the breast line allowing for a section of bare midriff. They were named after [[Bikini Atoll]], the site of several nuclear weapons tests, for their supposed explosive effect on the viewer.

Through the 1950s, it was thought proper for the lower part of the bikini to come up high enough to cover the [[navel]]. From the 1960s on, the bikini shrank in all directions until it sometimes covered little more than the nipples and genitalia, although less revealing models giving more support to the breasts remained popular. At the same time, [[fashion designer]] [[Rudi Gernreich]] introduced the [[monokini]], a topless suit for women consisting of a modest bottom supported by two thin straps. Although not a commercial success, the suit opened eyes to new design possibilities. In the 1980s the [[thong (bikini, underwear)|thong]] or "tanga" came out of [[Brazil]], said to have been inspired by traditional garments of native tribes in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. However, the one-piece suit continued to be popular for its more modest approach.

Men's swimsuits developed roughly in parallel to women's during this period, with the shorts covering progressively less. Eventually racing-style "speedo" suits became popular&amp;mdash;and not just for their speed advantages. [[Thong (clothing)|Thongs]], [[G-strings]], and [[bikini]] style suits are also worn. Typically these are more popular in more [[tropical]] regions; however, they may also be worn at public [[swimming pools]] and inland lakes. But in the 1990s, longer and baggier shorts became popular, with the hems often reaching to the knees. Often called boardshorts and swim trunks, these were often worn lower on the hips than regular shorts.

==Alternatives to swimsuits==
Since the early twentieth century a [[naturist]] movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities.&lt;ref name=BNWeb&gt;{{Citation| title =British Naturism (BN)| date =| year =| url =http://www.bn.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_Id=3| issn =0264-0406| accessdate =2011-08-30| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120331110705/http://www.bn.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_Id=3| archivedate =2012-03-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered. The practice is often described as "[[toplessness]]" or "[[topfreedom]]".  In some places around the world, [[nude beach]]es have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude.

As an alternative to a swimsuit, some people wear [[trousers]], [[underpants]] or a [[T-shirt]] either as a makeshift swimsuit or because they prefer [[Wetlook|regular clothes over swimsuits]]. Using a T-shirt can also provide extra protection against sunburn. In some countries, such as Thailand and Philippines, swimming in regular clothes is the norm while swimsuits are rare. At beaches, this may be more accepted than at swimming pools, which tend not to permit the use of underwear as swimwear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpasotexas.gov/parks/_documents/Appendix%20D%20-%20Swimming%20Pool%20Rules.pdf|format=PDF|title=El Paso, Texas, swimming pool rules Rules for swimmers.

==Setting and synopsis==
The series is set in a fantasy world where humans and elves are in conflict. Long ago, the humans used dark magic, and were driven off by the dragons and elves to one end of the continent. Now, after humans killed the dragon king and his egg, war is imminent. As forces gather, the elves attempt to assassinate the human king Harrow and his heir, the young prince Ezran. One among the elves, the young Rayla, along with Ezran and his older half-brother Callum, discover that the dragon king's egg wasn't in fact destroyed, but stolen. Together they undertake to return the egg to the dragons to prevent war. But the mage Viren, King Harrow's advisor, is intent on war.

==Plot==
Treehorn is a young boy who begins shrinking after playing a strange board game. Treehorn discovers that he is getting smaller, when he cannot reach the gumballs and candy bars he has hidden on a previously accessible shelf.

"'''Where My Country Gone?'''" is the second episode of the [[South Park (season 19)|nineteenth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 259th episode overall, written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] on September 23, 2015. It parodies [[illegal immigration to the United States]] and the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential candidacy]] of [[Donald Trump]], along with [[Caitlyn Jenner]] and [[political correctness]].

==Plot==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is unwillingly honored at the [[White House]] by [[Barack Obama]] for his acceptance of [[Caitlyn Jenner]] (in [[Stunning and Brave|the previous episode]]). His reward is to be driven back home by Jenner, who runs over a pedestrian while leaving the White House (in reference to Jenner's real life [[Caitlyn Jenner#Legal issues|collision]]&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6707835/south-park-caitlyn-jenner-donald-trump|title='South Park' Takes on Caitlyn Jenner's Car Crash &amp; Donald Trump in NSFW Episode|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=September 24, 2015|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Mr. Garrison]] observes that many Canadians have entered the [[United States]] illegally, placing many Canadian students in South Park Elementary. When he reacts intolerantly to a group of them disrupting his class, [[List of South Park Elementary staff#PC Principal|PC Principal]] forces the entire faculty to take "Canadian-language" night classes to better help their Canadian students. Garrison reacts to this by composing a song, "Where My Country Gone?" lamenting how immigration has ruined his country. He uses the song to rally the townspeople to his cause. When Garrison interrupts a school presentation on Canadian history he is fired, stirring tension between American and Canadian students. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his friends decide that the only way to bring peace is to encourage a romantic relationship between the factions: they appoint [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to ask out a Canadian girl.

Garrison gets the entire town behind his proposal to literally "fuck the Canadians to death", then build a wall to prevent further illegal immigration from Canada. However, it is discovered that Canada has already built an immense border wall of its own, to (according to a Canada border guard) prevent Americans from raping Canadian women and preserve Canada's "cool shit". To find out what "cool shit" they are hiding, Garrison sneaks into Canada by going over [[Niagara Falls]] in a barrel.

Meanwhile, Butters begins dating a Canadian girl named Charlotte. The two find themselves falling in love. At dinner with her family, he learns that they and other Canadians left Canada unwillingly. Charlotte's father explains that during the last Canadian election there was a brash candidate (a parody of [[Donald Trump]] and his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Illegal immigration and border security|positions on immigration]]&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/24/south-park-where-my-country-gone-review|title=South Park: "Where My Country Gone?"

Everyone thought it was funny and, thus, did not take him seriously as a candidate. He was elected, to their chagrin, because they let the joke go on for too long and neglected to vote against him.  After dinner, Butters reveals his romantic feelings for Charlotte, who reciprocates.

Barely surviving his jaunt across the border, Garrison finds that Canada has become a deserted wasteland and heads to the President's office. There, a physical altercation ensues between the two, which ends when Garrison gains the upper hand and rapes the Canadian President to death. Upon hearing the news that the Canadian President is dead, the [[Emigration|emigrants]] - including Charlotte's family - return to Canada. Back in the United States, Garrison attributes the "win" to his policy. Kyle starts to point out that the conflict actually stemmed from such hostile policies but suddenly goes silent because "no one wants another speech". Garrison tells the people of South Park that he will join the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 campaign]] for [[President of the United States]] with his running mate, Caitlyn Jenner. The two leave for [[Washington, DC|Washington]] in a car driven by Jenner, who immediately runs over another pedestrian.

==Reception==
"Where My Country Gone?" received positive reviews. [[IGN]]'s Max Nicholson gave the episode a 8.0 out of 10, concluding "This week's South Park improved on the first, offering both a scathing satire and a clear target: Donald Trump. With the help of both Mr. Garrison and Butters (and Canadian Donald Trump), 'Where My Country Gone?' proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable entry".&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Chris Longo from [[Den of Geek]] rated it 4 out of 5 stars and said in his review that "this was an episode that should be satisfying even for those who have been put off by the constant flavor of the week references and faux cameos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/south-park/249295/south-park-where-my-country-gone-review|title=South Park: Where My Country Gone Review|last=Longo|first=Chris|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Dan Caffrey gave an A- rating to the episode, enjoying the way that it had built on the previous episode and the parody of Donald Trump, although finding Caitlyn Jenner's physical appearance "more than a little nasty".&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jon Blistein praised Mr. Garrison's campaign to rid America of Canadians as "hilariously ignorant".&lt;ref name=RollingStone/&gt;
