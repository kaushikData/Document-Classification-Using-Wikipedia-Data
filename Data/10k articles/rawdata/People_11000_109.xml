'''Alvin Cushman Graves''' (November 4, 1909 – July 19, 1965) was an [[Americans|American]] [[nuclear physicist]] who served at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous [[nuclear weapons test]]s during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the [[demon core#Second incident|1946 laboratory criticality accident]] in Los Alamos that killed [[Louis Slotin]], but recovered.

== Early life ==
Alvin Cushman Graves was born on November 4, 1909 in [[Washington, DC]],&lt;ref name="FG"&gt;{{Find a Grave | grid = 6602447 | name = Alvin Cushman Graves | date= July 19, 1965 | accessdate = October 11, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of six children. He was the son of Herbert C. Graves, an engineer with the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] and member of the [[American Commission to Negotiate Peace]] after [[World War I]]. Graves attended [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], and graduated at the top of his class from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a year, but found that jobs were hard to come by during the [[Great Depression]]. He received a graduate fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his [[Ph.D.]], writing his thesis on "Packing Fraction Differences Among Heavy Elements".&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Becker |first=Bill |title=The Man Who Sets Off Atomic Bombs |newspaper=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=April 19, 1952| pages=32–33, 185–188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Packing Fraction Differences Among Heavy Elements |last=Graves |first=Alvin C. |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume = 55 |issue = 9 |pages = 863–867 |date = May 1939 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.863|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55..863G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Chicago, Graves met and married Elizabeth Riddle, a physics major there,&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; who was known as "Diz".&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; [[Elizabeth Riddle Graves]] earned her Ph.D., writing her thesis on "Energy Release from Beryllium-9 (Alpha, Alpha) Lithium-7 and the Production of Lithium-7".{{cn|date=August 2017}} Graves remained at the University of Chicago as a research fellow and an assistant professor until 1939, when he moved to the [[University of Texas]].&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Unfortunately, Elizabeth was unable to secure a job there as well due to its anti-[[nepotism]] rules.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
In 1942 Graves  was invited back to the University of Chicago by [[Arthur H. Compton]]. Graves had already received a request from the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] to work on [[radar]], and he asked if he could contribute more to Compton's project. Compton replied that he could.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; He joined the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], and helped build the first nuclear reactor, the [[Chicago Pile-1]].&lt;ref name=fal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/cp1-pioneers/ |title=The Chicago Pile 1 Pioneers |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves, [[Harold V. Lichtenberger]] and [[Warren Nyer]] formed [[Enrico Fermi]]'s "suicide squad" or "liquid-control squad", assigned to smash {{convert|5|USgal|adj=on}} glass bottles containing a solution of [[cadmium]] sulfate over the reactor with hammers if something went wrong.&lt;ref name="ornl.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://web.ornl.gov/info/reporter/no19/scram.htm |title="Scram!" - Reactor veteran recalls account of the birth of a key word in the nuclear vernacular|first=Edwin |last=Blackburn  |date=September 2000 |accessdate=25 October 2014|journal=ORNL Reporter|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoE"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/The%20First%20Reactor.pdf |title=The First Reactor |editor-first=Jack M. |editor-last=Holl|chapter=The first Pile|first1=Corbin |last1=Allardice |first2=Edward R. |last2=Trapnell |page= 14|date=December 1982|publisher=US Department of Energy|volume=DOE/NE-0046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadmium is a strong neutron absorber and Fermi hoped that this would halt a runaway nuclear chain reaction, if the reactor [[control rods]] proved to be incapable of halting it in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=February 1953 |volume=9 |issue=1 |last=Allison |first=Samuel K. |authorlink=Samuel K.

Graves and Elizabeth moved to work at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico when it opened in 1943.&lt;ref name=fal&gt;{{harvnb|Fradkin|1989|pp=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it a condition of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she was one of the few physicists who had experience with a [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]]—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; At the time of the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to [[Samuel K. Allison]]'s countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the [[radioactive fallout]] from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with survey meters.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

Graves was badly injured in the [[demon core#Second incident|1946 laboratory criticality accident]] at Los Alamos that killed [[Louis Slotin]].&lt;ref name=fal /&gt;&lt;ref name=hempelman /&gt; Slotin, who was training Graves to replace him in his position as chief bomb assembler for Los Alamos, was demonstrating the dangerous "tickling the dragon's tail" test to Graves and several other scientists when the accident occurred. Graves, who was nearest to Slotin, suffered an estimated dose of 390 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]],&lt;ref name=fal264&gt;{{harvnb|Fradkin|1989|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a 50 percent chance of survival.  This caused severe radiation poisoning, loss of hair and a zero [[semen]] count. After two weeks of  hospitalization and a several weeks of convalescence, he seemed to have recovered fully, and in a few months was back at work and skiing vigorously, with only a bald spot on the head to show for the experience. Two years later he and his wife had a healthy child, their second,&lt;ref name=fal /&gt;&lt;ref name=hempelman&gt;{{cite conference|last=Hempelman|first=Louis Henry|last2=Lushbaugh |first2=Clarence C. |last3=Voelz |first3=George L.|title=What Has Happened to the Survivors of the Early Los Alamos Nuclear Accidents?|conference=Conference for Radiation Accident Preparedness|date=October 19, 1979|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/pdf/accidentsurvivorslanl.pdf|accessdate=January 5, 2013|publisher=[[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]]|location=Oak Ridge|id=LA-UR-79-2802}} Dr. Graves is identified in this paper as "Case 4".&lt;/ref&gt; a son they named Alvin Palmer.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Graves became dismissive of the radiation risks from [[nuclear test]]ing while serving as test director for the Nevada Test Site shots during the 1950s. He announced that the risks from fallout were "concocted in the minds of weak malingerers."{{sfn|Welsome|1999|p=186}} As a spokesman for the [[Nevada Test Site]], he spoke in local areas around Nevada assuring the population of no danger from the activities there.{{sfn|Welsome|1999|pp=185-186}} As the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory's J (Test) Division,&lt;ref name=fal /&gt; he was the scientific director or deputy director of most of the nuclear tests from 1948 through the 1950s, including the [[Desert Rock exercises]] which exposed military personnel to radiation, and the [[Castle Bravo]] test that irradiated many native islanders and test personnel.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fal /&gt; Asked to testify before the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] on the danger of radiation causing [[cancer]], Graves replied:{{quote|The danger is not that this will happen to you. The danger is that it is more likely to happen to you. Maybe the more likely is not very much more likely, but it is still more likely.&lt;ref name=fal /&gt;}}

Graves was a pillar of the Los Alamos community. He was an active member of the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the encouragement of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the [[cello]],&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], for lessons.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{harvnb|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.&lt;ref name=fal /&gt;

Graves died of a heart attack on July 19, 1965 while skiing in [[Del Norte, Colorado]], twenty years after the Slotin accident, at the age of 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,834164,00.html |title=Milestones |date= August 6, 1965 |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had suffered from hypertension even before the 1946 accident, and had a minor heart attack in December 1955.&lt;ref name=hempelman /&gt; His father had also died of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=fal264 /&gt; A 1978 follow-up study of the Slotin accident victims suggested that latent systemic damage from the accident contributed to heart failure.&lt;ref name=hempelman /&gt; He was interred in the Guaje Pines Cemetery in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="FG" /&gt;

'''Antonio Villavicencio y Verástegui''' (January 9, 1775 – June 6, 1816) was a statesman and soldier of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], born in [[Quito]], and educated in Spain. He served in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as an officer in the [[Spanish Navy]] with the rank of [[Second Lieutenant]]. He was sent as a representative of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] to [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], where his arrival was used as an excuse in [[Santa Fe (Bogotá)|Santafé de Bogotá]] to start a revolt; this was known as the [[Florero de Llorente]], which culminated in the proclamation of independence from Spain. After this incident he resigned his office and joined the cause of independence. He was later captured and became the first martyr executed during the reign of terror of [[Pablo Morillo]].

==Early life==

Villavicencio was born on January 9, 1775, in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], which at the time formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. His parents were Juan Fernando de Villavicencio y Guerrero, II Count of the Real Agrado&lt;ref&gt;''Titulos nobiliarios en el Ecuador'' (Page 88) BY José Alejandro Guzman&lt;/ref&gt; and Knight of the [[Order of Santiago]],&lt;ref&gt;''Antonio de Villavicencio (el protomartir) y la Revolución de la independencia'' (Page 4), By José Dolores Monsalve&lt;/ref&gt; and Joaquina Verástegui y Dávila, daughter of the [[Oidor]] and Mayor of the [[Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogota]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biografías de los mandatarios y ministros de la Real Audiencia(1671 a 1819)'' By José María Restrepo Sáenz&lt;/ref&gt;

Villavicencio attended [[Our Lady of the Rosary University]] in Bogotá and afterwards his parents sent him to Spain to study in the ''Real Colegio de Nobles Americanos'' (Royal College of Noble Americans) in the city of [[Granada]]. There he joined the [[Spanish Navy]] (''Armada Española'') and attained the rank of [[Second Lieutenant]]. He then returned to [[Cartagena de Indias]] in New Granada as Lieutenant of a [[frigate]] patrolling the Atlantic Coast.

In 1804 he returned to Spain and served in the navy in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on October 25, 1805, serving as Second Lieutenant of [[Antonio de Escaño]].

==Villavicencio as representative of the Crown==

In 1810 the Regency in Spain was concerned how news of the dissolution of the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]] had been received in America. The Court decided to send Regency commissioners to serve as its ambassadors to America and to explain the situation in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Colombia and the United States, 1765-1934'' (Page 63) By E. Taylor Parks [https://books.google.com/books?id=NG6kyaHzgnQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA63&amp;ots=hTvWBAylSv&amp;dq=Antonio+Villavicencio+1810&amp;sig=zJVrWDT9l_FrK3-E2MDOqJ78Cws]&lt;/ref&gt; Two ''[[Criollo people|Criollos]]'' and one ''[[Peninsulares|Peninsular]]'' were chosen to go to South America: [[Carlos Montúfar]] as envoy to [[Quito]], [[José de Cos Iriberri]] as ambassador to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], and Villavicencio as envoy to New Granada.

===Caracas===
Villavicencio and his colleagues left [[Cádiz]] aboard the [[schooner]] ''La Carmen'' on March 1,&lt;ref&gt;''Biblioteca de historia nacional'' (Page 158) By Colombian Academy of History&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at [[La Guaira]] on March 18.&lt;ref&gt;''Ecuatoriana de Estudios Historicos Americanos.'' (Page 165) by Ecuadorian Academy of History&lt;/ref&gt; There they were urged to sail on to [[Caracas]], where they arrived in time to witness the events of April 19, the day on which the people of Caracas deposed the Captain General of Venezuela, [[Vicente Emparán]], and established a Venezuelan Supreme Junta, which gave way to the start of the [[First Republic of Venezuela]].

===Cartagena de Indias===
After his stop in Venezuela, Villavicencio headed to [[Cartagena de Indias]], where he arrived on May 8.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independence of Spanish America'' (Page 150) By Jaime E.

The people of Cartagena had called for an [[Cabildo (council)|open ''cabildo'']], a sort of public forum, to discuss the situation and devise a solution, but the Governor was opposed to this proposal. Antonio Villavicencio, however, was not, and using his position as an official representative of the Crown, called for the open ''cabildo''.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia eclesiástica y civil de Nueva Granada: Escrita sobre documentos auténticos'' (pages 53-56) By José Manuel Groot [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXn9_kMxyAwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Antonio+Villavicencio+Cartagena#PPA54,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10 the [[Ayuntamiento]] of Cartagena formed a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|junta]], composed of native-born Spaniards ''(peninsulares)'' and locally born people of Spanish ancestry ''(criollos)'' alike; among them were: Antonio Villavicencio, Carlos Montúfar, Governor Francisco Montes, and [[José María García de Toledo]]. The Junta recognized the Crown of Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as King of Spain, rather than Napoleon's brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], whom he had installed on the Spanish throne as José I. Villavicencio found no reason to oppose the desire for local autonomy as long as the Junta de Cartagena acknowledged the supremacy of the Crown. This event set off a wave of revolution across the land, and was soon followed by other juntas declaring independence: [[Santiago de Cali]] on July 3, [[Pamplona, Norte de Santander|Pamplona]] on July 4, and [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] on July 9.&lt;ref&gt;''La Independencia de Colombia'' (Pages 139-144) By Rafael Gómez Hoyos&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santafé de Bogotá===
In Santafé de Bogotá, capital of the Viceroyalty, word arrived of the events in Cartagena, and of the arrival of the Regency Commissioner Villavicencio in that city. The people of Santafé had been waiting anxiously for his arrival, as they hoped it would further their drive for independence.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Colombia'' (Page 200) By Jesús María Henao, Gerardo Arrubla [https://books.google.com/books?id=XJsjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Antonio+Villavicencio+1810&amp;dq=Antonio+Villavicencio+1810&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of July 20, 1810, [[Joaquín Camacho]] visited the Viceroy [[Antonio José Amar y Borbón]] to see if his request to open a cabildo had been granted, but the viceroy dismissed the idea with arrogance. This caused the revolutionaries to begin devising a plot to launch their revolution. Using the arrival of Villavicencio as an excuse, they went to the house of [[José Gonzales Llorente]] to borrow a flower vase; he refused, and insulted them as well. [[Francisco José de Caldas]] seized on this incident to incite the crowds to stand up to the [[Peninsulars]], forcing [[José Miguel Pey]], the mayor of Bogotá, to step in and save Llorente. By that night the situation had heated up so much that a special Cabildo was called in session. This led to its issuing the declaration of independence of New Granada from Spain.

While he was in [[Honda, Tolima|Honda]], Villavicencio was informed of the events of July 20 by Juan Merino, the [[alcalde]] of Honda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/villanto.htm ''Antonio Villavicencio'', Javier Ocampo Lopez]&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived in Bogotá he was informed that the Junta no longer recognized the authority of the Regency Commission; he responded by resigning from the commission and embracing the patriotic cause.

Villavicencio immersed himself in the fight for independence, and was appointed commander of a battalion in the southern campaign of [[Antonio Nariño]]. In 1814 he was made the [[military advisor]] to the [[United Provinces of New Granada]].

==Triumvirate==

On October 5, 1814, The Congress of the United Provinces replaced the presidency with a [[Triumvirate]], a three-member executive body, to govern the nation. [[Custodio García Rovira]], one of the members of the Triumvirate, presented his resignation on July 11, 1815 to Congress. Congress named Villavicencio to replace him.&lt;ref name="lablaa.org"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/primera/santafe2.htm Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810232102/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/primera/santafe2.htm |date=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villavicencio accepted and on August 12, he resigned his post as Governor of Tunja,&lt;ref name="lablaa.org"/&gt; and headed to Santafé de Bogotá, where he was inaugurated as President of the Triumvirate of the United Provinces of the New Granada.

His presidency was short lived, however; on November 15, 1815, Congress once again changed the executive power, entrusting it to a President Dictator and a Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;''Estudios constitucionales sobre los gobiernos de la América Latina'' By Justo Arosemena&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture, trial and execution==

After serving in the triumvirate, Villavicencio became Governor of [[Honda, Tolima|Honda]],&lt;ref&gt;''El precursor: Documentos sobre la vida pública y privada del General Antonio Nariño'' (Page XIX) By Eduardo Posada [https://books.google.com/books?id=9aYOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=%22Antonio+Villavicencio%22+Honda&amp;as_brr=1]&lt;/ref&gt; where on May 20, 1816&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nUgLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=%22Antonio+Villavicencio%22+Honda&amp;as_brr=1#PPA250,M1 ''Biblioteca de historia nacional'' By Colombian Academy of History]&lt;/ref&gt; he was captured by the Royalist Army and transported to Santafé. On June 1 the Permanent Council of War sentenced Villavicencio to death. On June 6, he was taken out of his cell and his military insignia removed to degrade him, and then he was [[Execution by firing squad|executed]] by a firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;''La Patria Boba'' By J. A. Vargas Jurado, José María Caballero, José Antonio de Torres y Peña  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mqYOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=%22Antonio+Villavicencio%22+Honda&amp;as_brr=1#PPA250,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Villavicencio, whose visit to Santafé had aroused the anger of the royalists and led to the colony breaking away from Spain, became the first victim of the reign of terror begun with the ''pacificación'' (pacification) campaign of the Spanish general, [[Pablo Morillo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Obras completas de Diego Barros Arana''(Page 309) By Diego Barros Arana [https://books.google.com/books?id=snUCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA309&amp;dq=nacio+%22Antonio+Villavicencio%22]&lt;/ref&gt; under which many other revolutionaries were sentenced to death, imprisoned or exiled.

'''Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau Nieto''' (born 20 January 1964) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealist]] [[painter]], specialist in historical military paints that portray different times of the [[Spanish Armed Forces]], with great naturalism and detail.

== Biography and work ==
[[File:Pintando_Rocroi_2011.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrer Dalmau painting ''Rocroi, el último tercio'' (English: ''Rocroi, the last tercio'').]]
Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau Nieto was born in [[Barcelona]] in a family of the Catalan bourgeoisie linked to [[Carlism]] (he is the great-nephew of the Carlist journalist and historian ([[:es:Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer Dalmau]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fe, un romántico homenaje juvenil del Pintor de Batallas al Tradicionalismo|url=http://www.ahorainformacion.es/blog/fe-un-romantico-homenaje-juvenil-del-pintor-de-batallas-al-tradicionalismo/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[Jesuit]] college of San Ignacio in [[Sarrià, Barcelona|Sarriá]].&lt;ref&gt; Francisco, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1980s he worked as a textile designer for different firms, always maintaining his passion for [[oil painting]].&lt;ref&gt; Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fernández y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His vocation for military and history also led him to paint this subject from a very young age and write a book (Batallón Román),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batallon roman|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Rom%C3%A1n_Garrido}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} although his first independent and self-taught works were landscapes, especially seascapes.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fernández y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, inspired by the work of [[Antonio López García]], he focused on urban environments and captured in his canvases the spots of his native Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fernández y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited in art galleries, and garnered hits and good reviews. The work of this time is collected in a monograph of the author and in several general books of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Paisatgistes editado por V. Coromina. Depósito legal B-4657497. Figures editado por V. Coromina. Depósito Legal GI-66-2000. Interiors editado por V. Coromina. Depósito Legal GI-516/03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Recasens (2001). Artistes de Catalunya.

Depósito Legal GI-1302-2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1990s he decided to specialize in the historical-military theme and began to produce canvases where the landscape is mixed with military elements such as soldiers and cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fernández y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work and diffusion is managed by the company Historical Outline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Outline SL|url=http://www.historicaloutline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his paintings illustrate numerous books, covers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portada de "Sereno en el peligro", de Lorenzo Silva|url=http://www.lorenzo-silva.com/libros/sereno.html|access-date=2017-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225073138/http://www.lorenzo-silva.com/Libros/Sereno.html|archive-date=2016-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and magazines, especially of history.

Ferrer-Dalmau has been in the zone of operations of an international conflict like [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and Lebanon, making sketches, taking notes and painting, while living with the Spanish [[ISAF]] troops in 2012 and in 2014 in the [[Helmand Province|province of Helmand]] with the [[Georgian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrer-Dalmau, primer español en pintar para otro país en zona de conflicto|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/04/22/agencias/1398170186_101682.html|editor=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painter shared experiences with the ASPFOR XXXI contingent, trained at the base of the [[Paratrooper Brigade (Spain)|Parachute Brigade]], at [[Qala i Naw]] and at the Ricketts Combat Outpost (COP) in [[Muqur District, Badghis|Moqur]]. It is the first time that a Spanish painter goes to a mission abroad to collaborate with the Ministry of Defense of Spain. However, it is not an exceptional practice because other armies have war artists, such as the US Marine Corps, which currently has three official artists, one of them [[Michael D. Fay]], president of ''The International Society of War Artists'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society of War Artist: Art on the Front Line|url=http://gallandbooks.com/Ferrer-Dalmau2.pdf|editor=Military History Magazine|access-date=2017-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912070748/http://gallandbooks.com/Ferrer-Dalmau2.pdf|archive-date=2014-09-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which Ferrer-Dalmau is a member.

Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau left [[Catalonia]] in 2010 due to nationalist pressures. The painter has sometimes expressed his rejection of Catalan nationalism, stating:
{{quote |
 «''Em sento molt català i molt espanyol, (…) Molts catalans estem fastiguejats del nationalism''»&lt;br&gt; 
("I feel very Catalan and very Spanish ... Many Catalans are tired of nationalism.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://dolcacatalunya.com/2014/01/31/el-pintor-ferrer-dalmau-molts-catalans-estem-fastiguejats-del-nacionalisme/ El pintor Ferrer Dalmau: “molts catalans estem fastiguejats del nacionalisme”], en ''Dolça Catalunya'', 31 de enero de 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Art exhibitions ==
In addition to private collections, his work can be seen in different museums, such as the Museum of the Royal Guard ([[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], Madrid), the Army Museum, the Museum of the General Military Academy ([[Zaragoza]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Aniversario de la Creación de la Academia General Militar |url= http://ferrerdalmaunoticias.blogspot.com.es/2013/02/el-dia-20-de-febrero-de-2013.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Naval Museum of Madrid]], the Museum of Intendance ([[Ávila, Spain|Avila]]), the Naval Military Academy of Marín ([[Pontevedra]]), and the Museum of Modern Art of the Republic of Georgia, can also be seen in the [[Royal Palace of Valladolid]].

Throughout his professional career he has held individual exhibitions in private galleries in [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fernández y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and institutional centers such as:

[[Image:Samedi.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Baron Samedi.]]
[[Image:CrossOfBaronSamedi.jpg|right|thumb|Cross of Baron Samedi.]]

'''Baron Samedi''' ({{lang-en|Baron Saturday}}) also written '''Baron Samdi''', '''Bawon Samedi''', or '''Bawon Sanmdi''', is one of the [[loa]] of [[Haitian Vodou]]. Samedi is a loa of the dead, along with Baron's numerous other incarnations [[Baron Cimetière]], [[Baron La Croix]], and [[Baron Kriminel]]. He is syncretized with [[Saint Martin de Porres]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

He is the head of the [[Guédé]] family of [[loa]]. His wife is the loa [[Maman Brigitte]].

== Portrayal ==
He is usually depicted with a top hat, black tail coat, dark glasses, and cotton plugs in the nostrils, as if to resemble a corpse dressed and prepared for burial in the Haitian style. He is frequently depicted as a skeleton (but sometimes as a Black man that merely has his face painted as a skull), and speaks in a nasal voice. The former President for Life of Haiti, [[François Duvalier]], modeled his [[cult of personality]] on Baron Samedi; he was often seen speaking in a deep nasal tone and wearing dark glasses.&lt;ref&gt;thedictatorship.com/biographies/papadoc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He is noted for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and having a particular fondness for [[tobacco]] and [[rum]]. Additionally, he is the [[loa]] of [[resurrection]], and in the latter capacity he is often called upon for healing by those near or approaching death, as it is only the Baron that can accept an individual into the realm of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 83, "Baron Samedi"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 83, "&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Samedi spends most of his time in the invisible realm of [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] spirits. He is notorious for his outrageous behavior, swearing continuously and making filthy jokes to the other spirits. He is married to another powerful spirit known as [[Maman Brigitte]], but often chases after mortal women. He loves smoking and drinking and is rarely seen without a cigar in his mouth or a glass of rum in his bony fingers. Baron Samedi can usually be found at the crossroads between the worlds of the living and the dead. When someone dies, he digs their grave and greets their soul after they have been buried, leading them to the underworld.

== Connection to other loas ==
Baron Samedi is the leader of the [[Guédé]], [[loa]] with particular links to magic, ancestor worship and death.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 157, "Ghede"&lt;/ref&gt; These lesser spirits  are dressed like the Baron and are as rude and crude but not nearly as charming as their master.  They help carry the dead to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Creole religions of the Carbbean'', Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert. New York: NYU Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-8147-2720-1}}. Pg. 113 - 114&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
As well as being master of the dead, Baron Samedi is also a giver of life. He can cure any mortal of any disease or wound, if he thinks it is worthwhile. His powers are especially great when it comes to vodou curses and [[black magic]]. Even if somebody has been afflicted by a [[Curse|hex]] that brings them to the verge of death, they will not die if the Baron refuses to dig their grave. So long as this mighty spirit keeps them out of the ground, they are safe.

He also ensures that all corpses rot in the ground to stop any soul from being brought back as a brainless [[zombie]]. What he demands in return depends on his mood. Sometimes he is content with his followers wearing black, white or purple clothes or using sacred objects;{{Citation needed|reason=This just sounds improbable|date=June 2017}} he may simply ask for a small gift of cigars, rum, black coffee, grilled peanuts, or bread. But sometimes the Baron requires a vodou ceremony to help him cross over into this world{{Citation needed|reason=How d o we know this, also some of this list sounds made up, e.g. peanuts and bread some of the time
 women to have sex with|date=October 2017}}.

'''Arthur Frederic Basil Williams''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[OBE]]}} (4 April 1867 – 5 January 1950) was an [[England|English]] [[historian]]. 

Williams was born in [[London]], the son of a [[barrister]].  He was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and then read Classics at [[New College, Oxford]]. He was a clerk in the House of Commons. One of his duties was to attend the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the responsibility for the [[Jameson raid]], and he became familiar with [[Cecil Rhodes]], whose biography he later wrote. 

Williams served in the [[Second Boer War]], where one of his companions was [[Robert Erskine Childers|Erskine Childers]], of whom he later wrote a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Basil|authorlink= Basil Williams (historian)|title=Erskine Childers, 1870–1922: A Sketch|publisher=Privately published—Molly Childers|year=1926|location= London|url=|id=|oclc=34705727}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905 he married Dorothy Caulfeild{{sic}}. She died two years before him.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Williams came back to the UK briefly, then returned to South Africa as a civilian, in the service of [[Lord Milner]]. He also worked as an assistant to Lionel Curtis, the town clerk of [[Johannesburg]]. In 1910 he was twice unsuccessful in [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|UK parliamentary elections]] standing in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] interest, in turn for the seats of [[Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)|Lewes]] and [[Rugby (UK Parliament constituency)|Rugby]]. During [[World War I]], he served as an education officer in the [[Royal Field Artillery]] and in 1919 was awarded the OBE for his services.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pares|first1=Richard|last2=Matthew|first2=H. C. G.|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=25 May 2006|doi=|chapter=Williams, (Arthur Frederic) Basil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams had already made an impression as an academic, with a series of articles on Sir [[Robert Walpole]]'s foreign policy in the ''English Historical Review'' (1900&amp;ndash;1). He became Kingsford Professor of History at [[McGill University]] in 1921, and then professor of History at [[Edinburgh University]] from 1925 to 1937 when he retired. In 1935 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor (Arthur Frederick) Basil Williams {{!}} British Academy|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/fellows/professor-arthur-frederick-basil-williams|website=British Academy|accessdate=11 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote biographies of [[William Pitt, Earl of Chatham]] (1913), and Stanhope (1932), [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Carteret]] and [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Newcastle]] (1943). He retained his interest in South Africa, and this became a secondary sphere of historical interest. In 1946 he produced a book on [[Louis Botha|Botha]], [[Louis Botha|Smuts]] and South Africa. He also contributed a volume entitled ''The Whig Supremacy'' to the ''[[Oxford History of England]]'', later updated by [[C. H. Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN| 9780198217107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4578">'''Cesare Rossi''' (born 21 September 1887 in [[Pescia]] – died 9 August 1967 in [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fascism|fascist]] leader who later became estranged from the regime.

==Syndicalism==
Rossi began his political career on the [[left-wing politics|left]] with the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and as a writer for various [[syndicalist]] journals.&lt;ref name="Rees1"&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; However he left the Socialists in 1907 to serve in the [[Italian Army]] and did not rejoin following his demobilisation.&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt; Instead he embraced syndicalism fully by becoming a leading member of the ''[[Unione Sindacale Italiana]]''.&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt; He joined the ''Fasci di Azione Rivoluzionaria'' in 1914 and by 1919 this had led to him joining the ''[[Fasci italiani di combattimento]]''.&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt;

==Fascism==
A leading writer for ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'', Rossi was recognised as one of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s closest advisers in the early days of the fascist movement.&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt; Rossi soon gained a reputation for his moderation and was instrumental in the [[Pact of Pacification]], a 1921 agreement that temporarily slowed down the violence of the [[Blackshirts]].&lt;ref name="Rees2"&gt;Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Mussolini he also developed a strategy of trying to win over the left into a [[cross-class alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945'', 2001, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He attained the rank of assistant secretary of the movement in 1921 and was effective leader in [[Tuscany]] whilst he went on to sit on the [[National Fascist Party]] national council and the [[Grand Council of Fascism]].&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt;

He was the leader of a fasci and an important figure in the [[March on Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=New American Library|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this seizure of power Rossi was appointed director of Mussolini's Press and Propaganda Office.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; He was also central in organising not only the [[Italian general election, 1924|1924 election]] but also the reprisals against the areas that had rejected fascism which followed.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; A potential conflict of interest had arisen in February 1923 when Mussolini banned Fascist Party members from involvement in [[Freemasonry]] but ultimately the ban was not enforced as Rossi was just one of a number of Freemasons prominent within the party.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Farrell, ''Mussolini: A New Life'', Phoenix, 2004, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of murder==
Rossi's rise through the ranks of the fascist state came to an abrupt end in 1924 with the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]] after he was accused of being responsible. It was argued that Rossi, who had flown into a rage after one of the two speeches that sealed Matteotti's fate, had ordered his deputy [[Amerigo Dumini]] to kill the Socialist deputy for his [[anti-fascism]].&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; The incident, which angered even some fascists, led to a split between Rossi and Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=New American Library|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossi fled to [[France]] and then [[Switzerland]] to escape prosecution and became a critic of fascism in his exile.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; He was tricked into returning to Italy in 1928 and was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for his part in the murder.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; He was released after the fall of fascism and, following some investigations into his own past that acquitted him of involvement in the excesses of fascism, he returned to [[journalism]] and left politics behind.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt;

'''Collin McKinney''' (April 17, 1766 &amp;ndash; September 9, 1861) was a land surveyor, merchant, politician, and lay preacher.  He is best known as an important figure in the [[Texas Revolution]], as one of the five individuals who drafted the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] and the oldest person to sign it.'''

==Biography==

McKinney was born in [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey]], the second of 10 children born to Daniel and Mercy (Blatchley) McKinney.  The family moved to [[Virginia]] in the 1770s, and while Daniel fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Collin McKinney supported the family; thus, he had no formal schooling.  After the war, the family moved to an outpost in what is now [[Lincoln County, Kentucky]].

McKinney married twice in his lifetime, first to Annie (Amy) Moore on Feb 10, 1794, with whom he had four children (James, Ashley, Polly, and Emeline) before her death in 1804, and then again in 1805 to Elizabeth Leek, with whom he had seven more children (William C, twins Amy and Margaret, Anna C, Samuel L, Eliza S, and Younger S).

From 1818 to 1821, McKinney managed the Tennessee estates of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[George W. Campbell]], who was serving as minister to [[Russia]] at the time.  He also opened a trading post before giving it up and returning to Kentucky.  Later, McKinney and many of his relatives moved to [[Hempstead County, Arkansas]], where he was elected as a [[justice of the peace]].

In 1826, McKinney became a friend of Benjamin R. Milam, who was recruiting settlers for the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] Colony in [[Northeast Texas]] of Empressario and British General [[Arthur G. Wavell]]. The land grant was an area claimed by both the United States settlers as part of [[Miller County, Arkansas]], as well as by [[Mexico]].

In 1836, McKinney was one of five delegates from the Red River Colony to the [[Convention of 1836]], which called for Texas to declare its independence from Mexico.  He was one of five appointed to draft the Texas Declaration of Independence, and at age 70, he was the oldest to sign it.  He later became a member of the committee that drafted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]] and also served as a delegate from [[Red River County, Texas|Red River District and County]], Texas, to the First, Second, and Fourth Congresses of the [[Republic of Texas]].

In 1846 at age 80, he moved one last time, as a result of one of the worst known floods on the Red River, to the northern portion of the rich blackland prairie of Collin County, Texas, to be near several of his children, although the exact boundary line between [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]] and [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson Counties]] would not be surveyed and clearly identified for several years. He lived just a few miles southeast of Liberty, Texas, which was soon renamed [[Mantua, Texas|Mantua]] by Younger Scott McKinney, who was the founder.

Collin McKinney died at his home in Collin County on September 9, 1861, and was buried in the nearby Van Alstyne Cemetery in the McKinney family plot. A [[historical marker]] erected by the [[Texas Historical Commission]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;honors this Texan who lived over 95 years under the flags of four different nations (United States, Mexico, Texas, Confederacy at the end).

Around 1873, 12 years after Collin McKinney's death, the few inhabitants of Mantua moved several miles northeast to [[Van Alstyne, Texas]], on the new [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] from [[Sherman, Texas|Sherman]] to [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]] and on to [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]. Today, Mantua is a ghost town of Collin County, with just an old, unmarked cemetery.

Both Collin County and McKinney, Texas, its county seat, were named in his honor by the [[Texas Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA194|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinney is credited with suggesting to the Texas Legislature that, as new counties were later created in North and West Texas, the boundaries should be about 30 miles square.  This would allow a rider to travel to the [[county seat]], conduct necessary business, and return home, all in one day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9460">'''David Barish Feinberg''' (November 25, 1956 – November 2, 1994) was an American writer and [[AIDS]] activist.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] to Jewish parents, Feinberg grew up in [[Syracuse, New York]]. He attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], majoring in [[mathematics]] and studying [[creative writing]] with novelist [[John Hersey]], graduating in 1977.&lt;ref name="nypl"&gt;{{Cite web|last=O'Keefe |first=Laura |title=David B. Feinberg papers, 1976-1994. |publisher=New York Public Library |date=November 1995, revised February, 1999 |url=http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/feinberg.html |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706181930/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/feinberg.html |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
He subsequently worked as a computer programmer for the [[Modern Language Association of America]] (MLA) and also pursued a Master's degree in [[linguistics]] at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="nypl"/&gt; He completed his first novel, ''Calculus'', in 1979, although it has never been published. Feinberg himself described the novel as "godawful", telling one interviewer that it was a novel that "only an MIT math major could have written".&lt;ref name="nypl"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, he joined a gay men's writing group, eventually creating the character B. J. Rosenthal, a young gay Jewish man, much like Feinberg himself who became the central character in virtually all of Feinberg's later writing. He contributed a humour column to the gay magazine ''[[Mandate magazine|Mandate]]'' in 1986 and 1987, which in turn led to his first book deal. The novel ''Eighty-Sixed'' was published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and won Feinberg the [[Lambda Literary Award]] for Gay Men's Fiction and the American Library Association Gay/Lesbian Award for Fiction.

Feinberg tested positive for [[HIV]] in 1987, and joined the activist organization [[ACT UP]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{Citation

  | accessdate = 2009-12-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
He participated in ACT UP demonstrations including [[Stop the Church]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;
In 1991, he published his second novel, a sequel to  ''Eighty-Sixed'' entitled ''Spontaneous Combustion,'' a selection of both the [[Book of the Month Club]] and the [[Quality Paperback Book Club]]. For the next few years, Feinberg balanced writing and political activism with working full-time. Stories, articles, and reviews by him appeared in ''[[The New York Times|The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[OutWeek]]'', ''[[Tribe magazine|Tribe]]'', ''[[NYQ]]'', ''[[QW (magazine)|QW]]'', ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'', ''[[The Body Positive]]'', ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)|Gay Community News]]'', ''[[Art &amp; Understanding]]'', ''[[The James White Review]]'', ''[[Diseased Pariah News]]'', ''[[Poz (magazine)|Poz]]'', and both ''Men on Men 2: Best New Gay Fiction'' and ''Men on Men 4''.

===Death===
In July 1994, failing health led him to take disability leave. That fall, he was admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan, which was, until it closed, the flagship hospital of the St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers located in Greenwich Village, where he died early in November at the age of 37. Even while hospitalized, he continued to write. His final book, a collection of essays called ''Queer and Loathing: Rants and Raves of a Raging AIDS Clone'', was published shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body of work==
B. J. Rosenthal, the main character of Feinberg's first two published books and a wise-mouthed, perpetually libidinous urbanite, was something of an alter ego for his creator. "He and I aren't the same person exactly," Feinberg told ''[[New York Newsday]]'' in 1992. "I'd say he's 60 to 70 percent me. We're both gay, of course, and HIV-positive. But...I write novels, and he doesn't. And while he's more well-endowed, I'm a better lover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

''Queer and Loathing'', by contrast, was "as close to the truth as I can get," as Feinberg wrote in the book's introduction. The essays were his attempt "to capture what is to me a painfully obvious reality that is rarely written about: what it is like to be HIV-positive in the 90s; what it is like to outlive one therapist, two dentists, two doctors, and one gastroenterologist."

"He exemplified the best of the gay humor we use to endure impossible situations," said Ed Iwanicki, Feinberg's editor at Viking Penguin. "No one was able to find that humor in the most dire situations as well as he was."&lt;ref name="washblade"&gt;{{Citation

"It was so biting and so satirical, and it had a very New York edge," said author Jameson Currier, who knew Feinberg as a fellow member of ACT UP. "He was the first to write in that style about AIDS, and he created quite a bit of controversy. He broke a lot of ground in that respect."&lt;ref name="washblade"/&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
Feinberg's voice reading from ''Queer and Loathing'' was used in the 1995 [[PBS]] series ''Positive: Life with HIV'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Feinberg's papers are held by the [[New York Public Library]]'s Manuscripts and Archives Division.&lt;ref name="nypl"/&gt;

Reviewers suggest that the character Zach in John Weir's 2006 novel ''What I Did Wrong'' is based on Feinberg, who was a friend of Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The poem, "The Square Root of Three" is recited by Kumar Patel, in order to reconnect with Vanessa Fanning during the final confrontation of the comedic film ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', is often mistakenly attributed to him. The poem instead was written by a Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor also named David Feinberg.

Scott''' was killed during a [[police raid]] on October 2, 1992 as they attempted to serve a warrant to search for [[marijuana]] at his remote [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] ranch in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]].&lt;ref name="official report"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fear.org/chron/scott.txt | title=REPORT ON THE DEATH OF DONALD SCOTT by VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MICHAEL D. BRADBURY | publisher=fear.org | date=1993-03-30 | first=Michael | last=Bradbury }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon forcible entry into his residence, an officer shot and killed Scott. Scott, recovering from a cataract operation, was wielding a firearm over his head when he entered the room where his wife was yelling "Don't shoot me." No marijuana plants or other evidence of drug sales were found on the property.&lt;ref name="Superior Court"/&gt;

==The raid==
Early on the morning of October 2, 1992, 31 officers from the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]], [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and Park Service entered the  Scott's {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} ranch.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fear.org/chron/scotlst.txt | title=PERSONS PRESENT WHEN WARRANT EXECUTED | publisher=fear.org | date=1993-03-30 |first=Michael | last=Bradbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; They planned to arrest Scott for allegedly running a 4,000-plant marijuana plantation.&lt;ref name="official report" /&gt; When deputies broke down the door to Scott's house, Scott's wife would later tell reporters, she screamed, "Don't shoot me. Don't kill me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fear.org/scott15.html | title=L.A. Forfeiture Squads Kill California Millionaire | publisher= [[Forfeiture Endangers American Rights]] | date=November 1992| first=Brenda | last=Grantland |authorlink = Brenda Grantland }}&lt;/ref&gt; That brought Scott staggering out of the bedroom, blurry-eyed from a cataract operation—holding a .38 caliber Colt snub-nosed revolver over his head.&lt;ref name="saveourguns"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.saveourguns.com/scott001.htm | title=Donald Scott Case - killing for land | publisher=saveourguns.com | date=2000-01-23 | first=Paul | last=Ciotti }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he emerged at the top of the stairs, holding his gun over his head, the officers told him to lower the gun. As he did, they shot him to death.  According to the official report, the gun was pointed at the officers when they shot him.&lt;ref name="official report" /&gt;

Later, the lead agent in the case, sheriff's deputy Gary Spencer and his partner John Cater posed for photographs smiling arm-in-arm outside Scott's cabin.&lt;ref name="saveourguns" /&gt;

Despite a subsequent search of Scott's ranch using helicopters, dogs, searchers on foot, and a high-tech [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] device for detecting trace amounts of [[sinsemilla]], no marijuana—or any other illegal drug—was found.&lt;ref name="village voice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9338,cotts,11865,1.html |title=The Pot Plot |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=June 9–15, 1993 |first=Cynthia |last=Cotts |authorlink=Cynthia Cotts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212023422/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9338%2Ccotts%2C11865%2C1.html |archivedate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Scott's widow, the former [[Frances Plante]], along with four of Scott's children from previous marriages, subsequently filed a $100 million wrongful death suit against the county and federal government. For eight years the case dragged on, requiring the services of 15 attorneys and some 30 volume binders to hold all the court documents. In January 2000, attorneys for Los Angeles County and the federal government agreed to settle with Scott's heirs and estate for $5 million, even though the sheriff's department still maintained its deputies had done nothing wrong.&lt;ref name="village voice" /&gt;

Michael D. Bradbury, the [[District Attorney]] of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] conducted an investigation into the raid and the aftermath, issuing a report on the events leading up to and on October 2, 1992.&lt;ref name="official report" /&gt;  He concluded that [[asset forfeiture]] was a motive for the raid.&lt;ref name="DA motive"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fear.org/chron/denoce.txt | title=District Attorney County of Ventura Report of Forfeiture Motive for raid | publisher=fear.org | date=1993-03-31 | first=Michael | last=Bradbury }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appendix D"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fear.org/chron/denoce.txt | title=Appendix D: Letter from Assistant D.A. Kevin DeNoce | publisher=www.fear.org | date=1993-03-31 | first=Kevin | last=DeNoce }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department issued their own report in response, clearing everyone involved of wrongdoing while [[California Attorney General]] [[Dan Lungren]] criticized District Attorney Bradbury.  Sheriff Spencer sued D.A. Bradbury for [[defamation]] in response to the report.&lt;ref name="saveourguns" /&gt;  The court ruled in favor of Michael Bradbury and ordered Sheriff Spencer to pay $50,000 in Bradbury's legal bills.&lt;ref name="Superior Court"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/caselaw/california-courts-of-appeal-cases/bradbury-v-superior-court/ | title=Bradbury v.

==Disposition==
Scott was cremated and the ashes given to his widow. The ashes were later destroyed when his ranch home was burnt in a 1993 wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyers|first=Jeff|title=Scott's Widow Vows to Remain at Ranch : Destruction: Frances Plante Scott, whose husband was slain in a raid a year ago, says she will rebuild like 'they rebuilt the Alamo.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-30/local/me-51279_1_frances-scott|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=L.A Times|date=October 30, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
{{moresources|section|date=December 2017}}

In 1961, he married Lynda Lou Bennett, with whom he has two sons and two daughters. From 1961 to 1963, he served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. He gained his [[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv.) from [[Emory University]]'s [[Candler School of Theology]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="afa.net"&gt;[http://media.afa.net/newdesign/spokespersonsdw.asp Donald Wildmon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115045720/http://media.afa.net/newdesign/spokespersonsdw.asp|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was ordained as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[United Methodist Church]] in 1964 and served as a pastor until 1977, when he left the pastoral ministry to campaign against pornography and violence in the media.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In June 1977, he moved to [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to establish the National Federation for Decency (NFD), the predecessor to the modern American Family Association, because after watching television one night in December 1976 he felt that no primetime television program was appropriate for his family with young children.&lt;ref name="MBC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Limberg|first=Val E.|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/wildmondona/wildmondona.htm|title=Wildmon, Donald|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=2009-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530011245/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/wildmondona/wildmondona.htm|archive-date=2009-05-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 1989"&gt;{{citation|last=Winbush|first=Don|title=Interview with Rev.

And I asked my children to change the channel again. This was in [[1976–77 United States network television schedule|1976]], and we had three networks plus [[PBS]].

In February 1980, Wildmon founded the Coalition for Better Television (CBTV), this time with the help of [[Jerry Falwell]] and claiming a nationwide membership of 5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="MBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,951754,00.html|title=Sanitizing the Small Screen|last=Clarke|first=Gerald|date=June 29, 1981|work=Time|volume=117|issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a dispute with Falwell, the organization disbanded two years later. That same year, Wildmon formed a new organization, Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (CLEAR-TV).{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Wildmon's son Tim is president of AFA and ran a news organization called Agape Press, which went offline in early 2007, when it merged with AFR News to create online newswire ''One News Now''.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Campaign for Decency===
Throughout the late 1970s, Wildmon actively protested television series that he thought promoted immoral lifestyles. He spoke against such programs as ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/threescompa/threescompa.htm|publisher=museum.tv|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television &amp;#124; ''Three's Company'' archives|accessdate=2017-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904164445/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/threescompa/threescompa.htm|archive-date=2013-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other productions and organizations against which he has campaigned include:
* [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]/[[Walt Disney World]]&lt;ref name="afa.net" /&gt; for not actively preventing LGBT community groups from hosting "gay days" at the park.
* ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]''
* [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" video
* [[Blockbuster Video]] for stocking [[NC-17]] rated movies
* [[Howard Stern]] for discussing sexual topics on the radio
* ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' for allegedly showing the title character "snorting cocaine".

=== Radio host ===
Up until mid-April 2007, Wildmon hosted the daily radio program ''AFA Report'', which can be heard weekdays on AFR or anytime on AFR's website. Wildmon left the program because he felt he didn't have adequate time to prepare for it each day, and he needed more time to fulfill other duties. He returned to the program in late April 2008, after receiving letters from listeners asking for him to come back, and after expansions in staff and studio space allowed him more preparation time. In early September, however, Wildmon suddenly left the program once again, this time for undisclosed reasons. He also hosted ''My Turn with Don Wildmon'', a short devotional segment, which no longer airs.

=== ''Damned in the USA'' ===
In 1991, the British film ''Damned in the USA'', directed by [[Paul Yule]], chronicled the battle between Wildmon and artists [[Andres Serrano]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]. The documentary won the International Emmy for Best Documentary, amongst several other awards. Wildmon sued the producers for $8&amp;nbsp;million in damages after a distributor got the rights to show the film in the United States, stating that he had signed a contract with the producers that prevented distribution in the USA. A federal court found that Wildmon's contract did not support his claim concerning distribution of the film and the documentary was released in 50 cities nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-10/entertainment/ca-479_1_british-documentary|title=Wildmon Fails in Bid to Thwart Film|date=September 10, 1992|accessdate=2011-09-07|first=Robert|last=Koehler|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108032935/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-10/entertainment/ca-479_1_british-documentary|archive-date=2012-11-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illness and retirement ===
On August 18, 2009, Tim Wildmon released the news via email that his father had been admitted to the North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo over the weekend of August 15–16, with what was thought to be a serious case of [[meningitis]]. After running tests, however, doctors determined that he had [[St. Louis encephalitis]], a disease usually contracted from mosquitoes. He spent 121 days in the hospital and rehab, and later underwent surgery for cancer on his left eye. On March 3, 2010, it was announced that Wildmon was stepping down as chairman of the American Family Association. His son Tim was expected to become the new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hed6vrMOh4ttOoflFBLm_9_o5EYQD9E7ADKG0 |title=Donald Wildmon retires as Chairman of the American Family Association |access-date=2016-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308021757/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hed6vrMOh4ttOoflFBLm_9_o5EYQD9E7ADKG0 |archive-date=2010-03-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clint Eastwood]] was born May 31, 1930 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to Clinton Eastwood Sr. and Margaret Ruth (née Runner).

==Early life==
He was a large baby at 11&amp;nbsp;lb 6 oz (5.16&amp;nbsp;kg) and was named "Samson" by the nurses at the [[Saint Francis Memorial Hospital|St. Francis Hospital]].{{sfn|Schickel|1996|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama guardian.co.uk Gentle man Clint, November 2, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Paul|authorlink=|title=Clint Eastwood a Cultural Production|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1993|location=Minnesota|pages=|url=|isbn=0-8166-1958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder of two siblings, he has a younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt, born in 1934. His father worked as a salesman and briefly a detective in San Francisco, according to U.S. Census records,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/people/pe/Clint_Eastwood.html adherents.com The Religious Affiliation of actor/director Clint Eastwood].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and at different jobs along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/03/Sunday/main671541.shtml CBS Evening News interview, February 6, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the Eastwoods settled in [[Piedmont, California]] and did not move again until after Clint reached adulthood.&lt;ref name="McGilliganp34"&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood often drops references to the [[Great Depression]] in interviews, implying that he comes from a poor family, but according to [[Sondra Locke]], "Actually they were never poor, they lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each drove his own car."&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=Sondra|title= The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly – A Hollywood Journey|publisher= [[William Morrow and Company]]|year= 1997|ISBN=978-0-688-15462-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oakland Tech High School.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oakland Technical High School]]]]
Eastwood was a weak student and records indicate he had to attend summer school.&lt;ref name="McGilliganp34"/&gt; He was held back at [[Piedmont Junior High School]] due to poor academic scores, and later attended [[Piedmont High School (California)|Piedmont High School]] from January 1945 to at least January 1946. Despite his athletic and musical talents, Eastwood shunned school teams and the band.&lt;ref name="McGilliganp34"/&gt; He was told he would make a good basketball player, but he was interested in individual pursuits like tennis and golf, a passion he retains today.&lt;ref name="McGilliganp34"/&gt; He transferred to [[Oakland Technical High School]], where the drama teachers encouraged him to take part in school plays, but was not interested. According to Eastwood, all he had on his mind were "fast cars and easy women".&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilligan37"&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He took auto mechanic courses and studied aircraft maintenance, rebuilding both aircraft and car engines.&lt;ref name="McGilligan37"/&gt; Eastwood also became a pianist; according to a friend, he "would actually play the piano until his fingers were bleeding".&lt;ref name="McGilligan37"/&gt; He was scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, although it is not clear if he ever did.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]] notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major," joked classmate Don Kincaid.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere."&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; "I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," explained Fritz Manes,&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s.

By early 1949 his father moved to a plant in [[Seattle]]. Eastwood moved in with a friend in Oakland named Harry Pendleton. He was invited to a house party in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where he met the film director [[Howard Hawks]] who, with [[John Ford]], would influence his career.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood rejoined his family in Seattle, where he worked at the Weyerhaeuser Company pulp mill in [[Springfield, Oregon]] with his father.&lt;ref&gt;The King of Western Swing - Bob Wills Remembered. Rosetta Wills. 1998. p. 165 {{ISBN|0-8230-7744-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked briefly as a [[lifeguard]] after obtaining a certificate from a [[Red Cross]] course,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p.43&lt;/ref&gt; and played [[ragtime]] piano at a bar in [[Oakland, Oregon|Oakland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Military service==
In 1951, Eastwood was drafted by the [[United States Army]] and assigned to [[Fort Ord]] in California, where he was appointed as a lifeguard and projectionist of training films.&lt;ref name="Eliot23"&gt;Eliot, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings.&lt;ref name="McGilligan49"&gt;McGilligan, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his $67 a month salary he held a part-time job on a loading dock for the Spreckels Sugar Refining Company. He visited [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] for the first time and remarked "someday I'd like to live here", although he confessed he had gained unwanted attention from a 23-year-old school teacher, after a one-night stand, who stalked him and threatened to kill herself.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1951, while returning from a prearranged tryst with a girlfriend in Seattle,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), pp. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was in the radar operator's compartment of an [[A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-1Q]] dive bomber that crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the [[Point Reyes Peninsula]] near San Francisco.{{sfn|Schickel|1996|pp=51–55}}&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Navy |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/northbaygeographer/albums/72157629225279927 |title=Accident Report: AD-1Q BU#409283 Eastwood |year=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft had departed from [[Naval Station Puget Sound|Sand Point Naval Air Station]] near Seattle, bound for northern California.{{refn|Different sources report different intended destinations. Schickel says it was [[Alameda Naval Air Station]] near [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. Zmijewsky says it was [[Mather Air Force Base]] at [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The Navy's accident report says it was [[San Diego]], with a stop at [[McClellan Air Force Base]] in Sacramento.|group=n|name=destination}} During the flight, the rear door would not stay closed, the oxygen system proved inoperable, and the navigation systems and intercom failed. Eventually, during the late afternoon, the plane ran out of fuel and the pilot was forced to [[water landing|ditch]] the aircraft in the sea several miles off [[Point Reyes]].{{refn|Accounts of the crash location also differ slightly. Schickel says "they could see the cliffs at Point Reyes, three or four miles away. Zmijewsky says it was north of Drake's Bay and two miles offshore. The Navy's accident report indicates that it was west of Kehoe Beach.|group=n|name=ditchlocation}}

Both Eastwood and the pilot were uninjured and Eastwood was able to swim to shore using a life raft.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; After some difficulty getting onto the beach, Eastwood made his way past [[Abbotts Lagoon]] and over a high fence towards a bright light that was nearer to him than [[Point Reyes Lighthouse]]. This turned out to be the [[KPH (radio station)|KPH]] [[RCA#International and marine communication|RCA]] receiving station.{{sfn|Schickel|1996|pp=51–55}} The single operator at the station initially had trouble understanding Eastwood's explanation of the plane crash, but ultimately called the Coast Guard. He was taken to a "Coast Guard Station" (probably the [[Point Reyes Lifeboat Station]]) and reunited with the pilot, who had drifted further north. The next day, Eastwood was taken to the [[San Francisco Presidio]] and told that he would likely have to testify to an inquiry, which in the event was not the case. He later reflected on his thoughts during the crash, "I thought I might die. But then I thought, other people have made it through these things before. I kept my eyes on the lights on shore and kept swimming."&lt;ref name="Z16"&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schickel|1996|pp=51–55}} A search is currently underway to locate the submerged wreck of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20180419/NEWS/180419780 |title=Clint Eastwood’s downed plane off Point Reyes subject of search |last=Prado |first=Mark |date=April 19, 2018 |website=marinij.com |publisher=''Marin Independent Journal'' |accessdate=April 21, 2018}} (includes text reprint of its original October 1, 1951 newspaper report on the incident)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/eastwoodskyraider/ |title=The Hunt for Clint Eastwood's AD-1 Skyraider |last=Holm |first=Walt |website=openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his military service Eastwood became friends with future successful TV actors [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]], [[Martin Milner]] and [[David Janssen]].{{sfn|Schickel|1996|p=50}}

Eastwood left Fort Ord in the spring of 1952 and moved back up to Seattle where he worked as a lifeguard for some time. However, as he had little money and few friends in Seattle, he moved down to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p.54&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he worked managing an apartment house in [[Beverly Hills]] by day (into which he then moved) and worked at a Signal Oil gas station by night.&lt;ref name="McGilligan55"&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Z17"&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1953, Eastwood met 22-year-old secretary Margaret Neville Johnson on a [[blind date]]. They married shortly before Christmas 1953 in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] with friend Harry Pendleton as his best man, and honeymooned in Carmel.&lt;ref name="McGilligan55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan (1999), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding his part-time work, he briefly attended [[Los Angeles City College]] and held several jobs digging foundations for residential swimming pools,&lt;ref name="Z17"/&gt; which he continued in between his early films.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Etzel Cardeña is the Thorsen Professor of Psychology (including [[parapsychology]] and [[hypnosis]]) at [[Lund University]], Sweden where he is Director of the Centre for Research on Consciousness and Anomalous Psychology (CERCAP). A native of [[Mexico]], Cardeña  studied at the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] in México and completed an MA in clinical psychology at York University in Toronto, Canada and an MA and PhD in Personality Psychology at the [[University of California, Davis]]. His doctoral thesis under the supervision of [[Charles Tart]] was on the phenomenology of deep states of hypnosis. He subsequently went on to do post-doctoral work  in the area of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and [[hypnosis]] at [[Stanford University]] under [[David Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parapsych.org/members/e_cardena.html |title=Edzel Cardena |publisher=Parapsych.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927201411/http://parapsych.org/members/e_cardena.html |archive-date=2010-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardeña has held academic posts at Georgetown University, the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USUHS) and the [[University of Texas–Pan American]], among others. He has served as President of the Society of Psychological Hypnosis (APA Division 30) for 2000–2001,&lt;ref name=div30/&gt; the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis for 2001–2003,&lt;ref name=sceh/&gt; and the [[Parapsychological Association]] for the year 2008-2009. He has expressed views in favour of the validity of some [[paranormal]] phenomena. In a recent paper in [[American Psychologist]] he wrote that "The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them."&lt;ref&gt;Cardeña, E. (2018). The experimental evidence for parapsychological phenomena: A review. American Psychologist, 73(5), 663-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of  interviews with Swedish Newspapers he has said that there is evidence for [[telepathy]], [[psychokinesis]] and [[precognition]] and that he himself has had experiences that could be interpreted as supporting the psi hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salongk.se/artiklar/import/2006/9/7/4470/index.xml ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930214511/http://www.salongk.se/artiklar/import/2006/9/7/4470/index.xml |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parapsychological Association]] honored Cardena with the 2013 [[Charles Honorton]] Integrative Contributions Award.&lt;ref name=honorton/&gt; Cardena has written more than 300 publications. His edited book ''[[Varieties of Anomalous Experience]]: Examining the Scientific Evidence'' published in 2000 and a second edition in 2014 is a scholarly volume on anomalous experiences.&lt;ref name=vae/&gt; His two volumes ''Altering Consciousness'' discusses the importance of altered states across history, culture, and in many disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, psychology, biology, and various others.&lt;ref name=altcon/&gt;

In addition to his professional work in psychology Etzel Cardeña is the Artistic Director of the International Theatre of Malmö and has worked in theatre as a director, actor and playwright in Mexico, the USA and Sweden. He did graduate studies in theatre directing at the [[University of California, Davis]], after having worked professionally in theatre in México&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.internationaltheatremalmo.se/creative_team.html|title=Creative team|publisher=International Theatre of Malmö|accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been offered scholarships from the Polish and Canadian governments to do graduate work in acting.

'''Franz Joseph I''' or '''Francis Joseph I''' (Franz Joseph Karl; 18 August 1830 – 21 November 1916) was [[Emperor of Austria]], [[Apostolic King of Hungary|King of Hungary]], and monarch of many other states of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], from 2 December 1848 to his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/216776/Francis-Joseph Francis Joseph], in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 19 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the [[German Confederation]]. He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the third-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history, after [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann II of Liechtenstein]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=1}}

In December 1848, [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Emperor Ferdinand]] abdicated the throne at [[Olomouc]], as part of [[Minister-president]] [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Felix zu Schwarzenberg]]'s plan to end the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Hungary. This allowed Ferdinand's nephew Franz Joseph to accede to the throne. Largely considered to be a [[reactionary]], Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting [[constitutionalism]] in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and most of its claim to [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy–Venetia]] to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], following the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] in 1859 and the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] (23 August 1866) settled the [[German question]] in favour of Prussia, which prevented the [[Unification of Germany]] from occurring under the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/franz-joseph-of-austria |title=Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: '&amp;#39;Francis Joseph'&amp;#39; |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which granted greater autonomy to [[Hungary]] and transformed the Austrian Empire into the [[Dual Monarchy]] of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, the [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian of Mexico]] in 1867, the suicide of his only son and heir, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]], in 1889, and the assassination of his wife, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]], in 1898.

After the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the [[Balkans]], which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests with the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Bosnian Crisis]] was a result of Franz Joseph's annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, which had been [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied by his troops]] since the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878).

On 28 June 1914, the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of his nephew, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in [[Sarajevo]] resulted in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was Russia's ally. That activated a system of alliances which resulted in [[World War I]].

Franz Joseph died on 21 November 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years as one of the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest reigning monarchs in modern history]]. He was succeeded by his grandnephew [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]].

==Early life==
[[File:Sophiebayern franzjoseph.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz R Joseph and his mother [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]] (by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]])]]
Franz Joseph was born in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]] (on the 65th death anniversary of [[Francis of Lorraine]]), the eldest son of [[Franz Karl, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Franz Karl]] (the younger son of [[Francis II of Austria|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]), and his wife [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Princess Sophie of Bavaria]]. Because his uncle, from 1835 the Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], was weak-minded, and his father unambitious and retiring, the young Archduke "Franzl" was brought up by his mother as a future Emperor with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence. Franzl came to idolise his grandfather, ''der Gute Kaiser Franz'', who had died shortly before the former's fifth birthday, as the ideal monarch. At the age of thirteen, Franzl started a career as a colonel in the Austrian army. From that point onward, his fashion was dictated by army style and for the rest of his life he normally wore the uniform of a military officer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=61}} Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] of [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]]); [[Archduke Charles Louis of Austria|Archduke Karl Ludwig]] (born 1833, father of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]), and [[Archduke Ludwig Viktor]] (born 1842), and a sister, [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1835-1840)|Maria Anna]] (born 1835), who died at the age of four.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=101}}

Following the resignation of the Chancellor [[Prince Metternich]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the young Archduke, who it was widely expected would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of [[Bohemia]] on 6 April, but never took up the post. Instead, Franz was sent to the front in Italy, joining [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Field Marshal Radetzky]] on campaign on 29 April, receiving his [[baptism of fire]] on 5 May at [[Battle of Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]]. By all accounts he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity. Around the same time, the Imperial Family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of [[Innsbruck]], in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. Soon, the Archduke was called back from Italy, joining the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June. It was at Innsbruck at this time that Franz Joseph first met his cousin Elisabeth, his future bride, then a girl of ten, but apparently the meeting made little impression.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=33}}

Following victory over the Italians at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Custoza]] in late July, the court felt it safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them. But within a few months Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September the court left once more, this time for [[Olomouc]] (Olmütz) in [[Moravia]]. By now, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz|Prince Alfred I]] of [[Windisch-Graetz|Windisch-Grätz]], an influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young Archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly, but mentally unfit Ferdinand.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=8}}

By the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father, the mild-mannered Franz Karl, Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olomouc on 2 December. At this time he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name. The name "Franz Joseph" was chosen to bring back memories of the new Emperor's great-granduncle, Emperor [[Josef II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], remembered as a modernising reformer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=6}}

==Domestic policy==
Under the guidance of the new prime minister [[Felix Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] the Third, the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in early 1849. At the same time, a military campaign was necessary against the Hungarians, [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|who had rebelled against Habsburg central authority]] in the name of their ancient liberties. Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the fighting in Italy, with King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] taking advantage of setbacks in Hungary to resume the war in March 1849. However, the military tide began to swiftly turn in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats. Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]] and forced to sue for peace, as well as to renounce his throne. In Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], in order "to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity".&lt;ref&gt;Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1976. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian troops entered Hungary in support of the Austrians and the revolution was crushed by late summer of 1849. With order now restored throughout his Empire, Franz Joseph felt free to renege on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament meeting at [[Kremsier]] had behaved—in the young Emperor's eyes—abominably. The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Bach]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}

The next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848–1849. Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the Emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}

===Assassination attempt in 1853===
[[File:J.Reiner - Attentat auf Kaiser Franz Joseph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Assassination attempt on the emperor, 1853]]
On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count [[Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell]], on a city [[bastion]], when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}}

O'Donnell, hitherto only a Count by virtue of his Irish nobility (as a descendant of the Irish noble dynasty [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]]&lt;ref&gt;''O'Domhnaill Abu – [[O'Donnell]] Clan Newsletter'' no. 7, Spring 1987 (ISSN 0790-7389))&lt;/ref&gt;), was made a Count of the [[Habsburg]] Empire (''[[Reichsgraf]]''). Another witness who happened to be nearby, the butcher Joseph Ettenreich, swiftly overpowered Libényi. For his deed he was later elevated to the nobility by the Emperor and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Libényi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted [[regicide]]. He was executed on the Simmeringer Heide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simmeringerhaide.at/chronik.html|title=Kleingartenanlage Simmeringer Haide|last=Decker|first=Wolfgang|website=www.simmeringerhaide.at|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this unsuccessful attack, the Emperor's brother [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]], later Emperor of [[Mexico]], called upon Europe's royal families for donations to construct a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a [[votive offering]] for the survival of the Emperor. It is located on [[Ringstraße]] in the district of [[Alsergrund]] close to the [[University of Vienna]], and is known as the [[Votivkirche]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}}

===Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867===
[[File:Ferenc József koronázása Budán.jpg|thumb|Franz Joseph's coronation as Apostolic King of Hungary]]
The 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy: the [[Crimean War]], the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, which resulted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=169}}

Political difficulties in Austria mounted continuously through the late 19th century and into the 20th century. However, Franz Joseph remained immensely respected; the Emperor's patriarchal authority held the Empire together while the politicians squabbled among themselves.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;:[[Will Johnston|William M. Johnston]], ''The Austrian Mind: An Intellectual and Social History, 1848–1938'' (University of California Press, 1983), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Czech question===
[[File:Franz Joseph of Bohemia 1861.jpg|thumb|Franz Joseph I in the regalia of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], with the [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]] next to him (painting by [[Eduard von Engerth]] for the Bohemian Diet, 1861)]]
Following the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. The autonomous position of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] was to be expressed by the coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836). His new government installed the system of [[neoabsolutism]] in Austrian internal affairs to make the Austrian Empire a unitary, centralised and bureaucratically administered state. When Franz Joseph returned to constitutional rule after the debacles in Italy at [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] and summoned the diets of his lands, the question of his coronation as king of Bohemia returned to the agenda, as it had not since 1848. On 14 April 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph received a delegation from the Bohemian Diet with the words (in Czech):

{{quote|I will have myself crowned King of Bohemia in Prague, and I am convinced that a new, indissoluble bond of trust and loyalty between My throne and My Bohemian Kingdom will be strengthened by this holy rite.&lt;ref name="lecaine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Caine Agnew|first1=Hugh|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Unowsky|editor2-first=Daniel L.|title=The limits of loyalty : imperial symbolism, popular allegiances, and state patriotism in the late Habsburg monarchy|date=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781845452025|pages=86–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_SOie5SJQwC&amp;dq=|accessdate=17 November 2016|language=en|chapter=The Flyspecks on Palivec's Portrait: Franz Joseph, the Symbols of Monarchy, and Czech Popular Loyalty}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to his predecessor Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] (who spent the rest of his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems, and in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following the [[Battle of Königgrätz|defeat at Hradec Králové (Königgrätz)]] was also unsuccessful. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Instead of celebrating a coronation in Prague, they had to witness the coronation in Budapest (8 June 1867). In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and even open air mass protest meetings. The Czechs were disillusioned. According to the Czech newspaper ''[[Národní listy]]'', the Czechs had not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into the "other" half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called "[[Cisleithania]]".&lt;ref name="lecaine"/&gt;

The Czech hopes were revived again in 1870–1871. In an imperial rescript of 26 September 1870, Franz Joseph referred again to the prestige and glory of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and to his intention to carry out a coronation. Under Minister-President [[Karl Hohenwart]] in 1871, the government of Cisleithania negotiated a series of fundamental articles spelling out the relationship of the Bohemian Crown to the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. On 12 September 1871, Franz Joseph announced:

{{quote|Having in mind the constitutional position of the Bohemian Crown and being conscious of the glory and power which that Crown has given us and our predecessors… we gladly recognise the rights of the kingdom and are prepared to renew that recognition through our coronation oath.&lt;ref name="lecaine"/&gt;}} 

[[File:László Portrait of Franz Joseph I 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1899]]
For the planned coronation, the composer [[Bedřich Smetana]] had written the opera ''[[Libuše (opera)|Libuše]]'', but the ceremony did not take place. The creation of the [[German Empire]], domestic opposition from German-speaking liberals (especially [[Sudeten Germans|German-Bohemians]]) and from Hungarians doomed the [[Fundamental Articles of 1871|Fundamental Articles]]. Hohenwart resigned and nothing changed. Whenever Franz Joseph visited Bohemia, he was greeted as the uncrowned Bohemian king rather than as the emperor and the omnipresent decorations with depictions of the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]] reminded him of his unfulfilled promise of a coronation in Prague.&lt;ref name="lecaine"/&gt;

Many Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and others. Masaryk served in the ''Reichsrat'' (Imperial Council) from 1891 to 1893 in the [[Young Czech Party]] and again from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party|Realist Party]] (which he had founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped [[Hinko Hinković]]'s defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribićević]]), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Czech question would remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph's political career.

==Foreign policy==
===The German question===
[[File:Fuerstentag Frankfurt 1863 263-022.jpg|thumb|Emperor Franz Joseph (centre in white uniform) at the Congress of German princes in Frankfurt am Main, 1863]]
The main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the [[unification of Germany]] under the [[House of Habsburg]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=149}} This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, with only one period of interruption under the [[Wittelsbach]]s, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=150}} However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]] in the event of German unification proved problematic. There quickly developed two factions: one party of German intellectuals favouring a [[Greater Germany]] (''Großdeutschland'') under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a [[Lesser Germany]] (''Kleindeutschland''). The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the [[German Confederation]], and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} If Greater Germany was to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go the [[Emperor of Austria]], but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria—the [[King of Prussia]]. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and [[Prussia]]. After Prussia decisively won the [[Seven Weeks War]], this question was solved; Austria lost no territories as long as they remained out of German affairs.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} 

Franz Joseph's German identity was made explicitly clear during a meeting in August 1908 between himself and [[Edward VII]] when the latter tried to persuade him to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England, Franz Joseph replied that he was a "loyal ally" and "I am a German prince."&lt;ref&gt;"Sir, ich bin ein deutscher Fürst." Walter Wiltschegg: Österreich, der "zweite deutsche Staat"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, p. 41. (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bassett, For God and Kaiser: The Imperial Austrian Army, 1619-1918, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Three Emperors League ===
In 1873, two years after the unification of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the [[League of Three Emperors]] (''Dreikaiserbund'') with [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany]] and [[Tsar Alexander II|Tsar Alexander II of Russia]], who was succeeded by [[Tsar Alexander III]] in 1881. The league had been designed by the German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe. It would last intermittently until 1887.

=== The Vatican ===
In 1903, Franz Joseph's [[Jus exclusivae|veto]] of Cardinal [[Mariano Rampolla]]'s election to the papacy was transmitted to the [[Papal conclave, 1903|Papal conclave]] by Cardinal [[Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko]]. It was the last use of such a veto, as the new [[Pope Pius X]] prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=127}}&lt;ref&gt;See also http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05677b.htm (discussing the papal veto from the perspective of the Catholic Church)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===

During the mid-1870s a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals. Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary. In the Budapest Conventions of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex [[Bessarabia]], and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|pending war]] with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}} A scant 15 months later, the Russians imposed on the Ottomans the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which reneged on the Budapest accord and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}} That treaty was overturned by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which allowed sole Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces.{{clarifyme|date=June 2016}} That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=37}} However, by 1897, under a new tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise "an extensive question requiring special scrutiny".{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}}

In 1908, the Russian foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], offered Russian support, for the third time, for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the [[Bosporus Strait]] and the [[Dardanelles]] to Russian warships. Austria's foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Alois von Aehrenthal]], pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the ''quid pro quo'' understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal without the knowledge of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] or his government in St. Petersburg, or any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.

Based upon the assurances of the Buchlau Conference and the treaties that preceded it, Franz Joseph signed the proclamation announcing the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the Empire on 6 October 1908. However a diplomatic crisis erupted, as both the Serbs and the Italians demanded compensation for the annexation, which the Austro-Hungarian government refused to entertain. The incident was not resolved until the revision of the Treaty of Berlin in April 1909, exacerbating tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs.

Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-663-0|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a visit to Sarajevo. When he heard the news of the assassination, Franz Joseph said that "one has not to defy the Almighty. In this manner a superior power has restored that order which I unfortunately was unable to maintain."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Freiherr von Margutti: Vom alten Kaiser. Leipzig &amp; Wien 1921, S. 147f. Zitiert nach Erika Bestenreiter: Franz Ferdinand und Sophie von Hohenberg. München (Piper), 2004, S. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

While the emperor was shaken, and interrupted his holiday to return to Vienna, he soon resumed his vacation at his imperial villa at [[Bad Ischl]]. Initial decision-making during the "July Crisis" fell to [[Count Leopold Berchtold]], the Austrian foreign minister; [[Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], the chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian army and the other ministers.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=328}} The ultimate resolution of deliberations by the Austrian government during the weeks following the assassination of the Archduke was to give Serbia [[July_Crisis#Austro-Hungarian_ultimatum|an ultimatum]] of itemized demands which it was virtually certain Serbia would be unable or unwilling to comply with, thus serving as a "legal basis for war." However, the general movement toward war with Serbia was already in motion prior to assassination of the Archduke as evidenced by a June 14 memo of Berchtold recommending the "elimination of Serbia" as a state, which Franz Josef [[July_Crisis#Germany_and_war|expressed agreement with]] in a letter delivered to Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin on July 5. In that letter, Franz Josef "...explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war." 

A week after delivery of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, on 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as [[World War I]]. On 6 August, Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war against Russia.

==Death==
[[File:Funeral Franz-Joseph.webm|thumb|right|Film of the funeral procession of Franz Joseph I]]
Franz Joseph died in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86. His death was a result of developing [[pneumonia]] of the right lung several days after catching a [[Common cold|cold]] while walking in Schönbrunn Park with the [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SN19161125.2.74# |title=Sausalito News 25 November 1916 — California Digital Newspaper Collection |publisher=Cdnc.ucr.edu |date=1916-11-25 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his grandnephew [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]], who reigned until the collapse of the Empire following its defeat in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the [[Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna, where flowers are still left by [[Monarchism|monarchists]].

== Family ==
[[File:Franz Joseph of Austria family portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Franz Joseph I with his family]]
It was generally felt in the court that the Emperor should marry and produce heirs as soon as possible. Various potential brides were considered: [[Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria|Princess Elisabeth of Modena]], [[Princess Anna of Prussia]] and [[:de:Sidonie von Sachsen (1834–1862)|Princess Sidonia of Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_rlZKhgaekC Twilight of the Habsburgs: The Life and Times of Emperor Francis Joseph By Alan Palmer]''&lt;/ref&gt; Although in public life Franz Joseph was the unquestioned director of affairs, in his private life his formidable mother still wielded crucial influence. Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsburg]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]]—descending from the latter house herself—and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria|Ludovika's]] eldest daughter, [[Duchess Helene in Bavaria|Helene]] ("Néné"), who was four years the Emperor's junior. However, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with Néné's younger sister [[Elizabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth]] ("Sisi"), a beautiful girl of fifteen, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi's appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|St. Augustine's Church]], Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=242}}

Their marriage would prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual and Sisi never truly acclimatised to life at court, and was frequently in conflict with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf]] died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous [[Mayerling Incident]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=127}}

In 1885 Franz Joseph met [[Katharina Schratt]], a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was—to a certain degree—tolerated by Sisi. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in [[Bad Ischl]] for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=120}} Though their relationship lasted for thirty-four years, it remained platonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Frederic|title=Thunder at Twilight: Vienna 1913/1914|year=1989|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion ''maven'' who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by [[Luigi Lucheni|an Italian anarchist]] in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, [[Robert I, Duke of Parma|Robert of Parma]] wrote in a letter to his friend [[Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal|Tirso de Olazábal]] that "It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief."&lt;ref&gt;The letter is available [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Letter_from_Robert,_Duke_of_Parma,_to_Tirso_de_Olaz%C3%A1bal_(Sep._1898).pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]] he told his relatives: "You'll never know how important she was to me" or, according to some sources, "You will never know how much I loved this woman."{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=117}}

===Relationship with Franz Ferdinand===
[[File:Kaiser Franz Joseph I. and Otto (15.09.1914).jpg|thumb|upright|The emperor and his great-grandnephew [[Otto von Habsburg]], in 1914]]
[[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] became [[heir presumptive]] (''Thronfolger'') to the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig. The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]], a match that was out of the question in the mind of the emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank. Although the emperor received letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=288}} He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]] and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=289}} The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at [[Zákupy|Reichstadt]]. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and distrusted each other.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=120}}

Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Franz Joseph's daughter, Marie Valerie, noted that her father expressed his greater confidence in the new heir presumptive: his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor admitted to his daughter, regarding the assassination: "For me, it is a relief from a great worry."{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=324}}

His official grand title after the ''[[Ausgleich]]'' of 1867 was: "Francis Joseph the First, by the Grace of God [[Emperor of Austria]], Apostolic King of [[Hungary]], King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], King of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia]], [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia and Lodomeria]] and [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–49)|Illyria]]; King of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] etc., Archduke of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]; Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Grand Duchy of Cracow|Cracow]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], of [[Duchy of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] and of [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]]; Grand Prince of [[Grand Principality of Transylvania|Transylvania]]; Margrave of [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]]; Duke of [[Austrian Silesia|Upper and Lower Silesia]], of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]], [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Duchy of Piacenza|Piacenza]] and [[Duchy of Guastalla|Guastalla]], of [[Duchy of Oświęcim|Oświęcim]], [[Duchy of Zator|Zator]] and [[Duchy of Teschen|Ćeszyn]], [[Duchy of Friuli|Friuli]], Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]) and Zara ([[Zadar]]); Princely Count of [[Habsburg]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]], [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca|Gorizia and Gradisca]]; Prince of Trent (Trento) and Brixen; Margrave of [[Upper Lusatia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lusatia|Lower]] [[Lusatia]] and in [[Margraviate of Istria|Istria]]; Count of [[County of Hohenems|Hohenems]], [[County of Feldkirch|Feldkirch]], [[County of Bregenz|Bregenz]], [[County of Sonnenberg|Sonnenberg]], etc.; Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro (Kotor), and over the [[Windic march]]; [[Grosswojwod|Grand Voivode]] of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar|Voivodship of Serbia]]."&lt;ref&gt;The official title of the ruler of Austrian Empire and later the Austria-Hungary had been changed several times: by a patent from 1 August 1804, by a court office decree from 22 August 1836, by an imperial court ministry decree from 6 January 1867 and finally by a letter from 12 December 1867. Shorter versions were recommended for official documents and international treaties: "Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia etc. and Apostolic King of Hungary", "Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary", "His Majesty The Emperor and King" and "His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty". The term ''[[Kaiserlich und königlich]]'' (''K.u.K.'') was decreed in a letter from 17 October 1889 for the military, the navy and the institutions shared by both parts of the monarchy.&lt;br /&gt;From the [[Otto's encyclopedia]] (published during 1888–1909), subject 'King', [http://encyklopedie.seznam.cz/heslo/285233-kral online in Czech].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Austria 1910 10k Franz Josef.JPG|thumb|upright|Stamp issued by [[Österreichische Post]] in 2016 on the 100th anniversary of the emperor's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlineshop.post.at/onlineshop/briefmarken---philatelie/briefmarken/sondermarken/100-todestag-kaiser-franz-joseph_13438 ''100. Todestag Kaiser Franz Joseph'' (100th Anniversary of the death of Emperor Francis Joseph)].  The stamp uses the design issued on his 80th birthday, which in turn is based on a 1908 design by [[Koloman Moser]] to commemorate the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[archipelago]] [[Franz Josef Land]] in the Russian high Arctic was named in his honour in 1873 by the [[Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition]] which first reported finding it.
The [[Franz Josef Glacier]] in New Zealand's South Island also bears his name.

Franz Joseph founded in 1872 the ''Franz Joseph University'' (Hungarian: ''Ferenc József Tudományegyetem'', Romanian: ''Universitatea Francisc Iosif'') in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (at that time a part of Austria-Hungary under the name of Kolozsvár). The university was moved to [[Szeged]] after Cluj became a part of Romania, becoming the [[University of Szeged]].

In certain areas, celebrations are still being held in remembrance of Franz Joseph's birthday. The Mitteleuropean People's Festival takes place every year around 18 August, and is a "spontaneous, traditional and brotherly meeting among peoples of the Central-European Countries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitteleuropa.it/uk Associazione Culturale Mitteleuropa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514200334/http://www.mitteleuropa.it/uk/ |date=14 May 2013 }}. Retrieved 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The event includes ceremonies, meetings, music, songs, dances, wine and food tasting, and traditional costumes and folklore from [[Mitteleuropa]].

'''Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer''' (10 October 1749 – 14 December 1830) was a [[Germans|German]] [[physician]] from [[Gotha]], [[Thuringia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uX4DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA992| title = Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://geo.viaregia.org/testbed/Material.Datenbank/Geschichte/Einzelereignisse.Geschichten.Personen/Ronneburg/Friedrich.Gabriel.Sulzer.html|title =Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer (10.10.1749 – 14.12.1830)| author = Wolf, Gustav}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|37|147|150|Sulzer, Johann Kaspar| Albert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulzer had a large collection of minerals and published also new results from new species. In 1791, Sulzer published together with [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] their results on a new mineral he had acquired. He named the mineral [[strontianite]] ([[strontium carbonate]]) and made clear that it was distinct from the [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]]) and stated that it contained a new element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=gCY7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 | journal = [[Bergmännisches Journal]] | title = Über den Strontianit, ein Schottisches Foßil, das ebenfalls eine neue Grunderde zu enthalten scheint.| language = German | last1 =Sulzer| first1 =Friedrich Gabriel | first2 = Johann Friedrich | last2 = Blumenbach| year =1791 | pages = 433–436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was head of a [[veterinary school]] and a [[midwifery]] school and chief physician for the local spa in [[Ronneburg, Thuringia|Ronneburg]], Thuringia. Additionally, he was the physician for [[Dorothea von Medem]] and her sister [[Elisa von der Recke]]. He was part of the ''Musenhof der Herzogin von Kurland''.

&lt;!-- this a copy from the hamster article--&gt;
In 1774, Sulzer, a companion of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], devoted a whole academic [[monography]] in the domain of [[social science]]s and [[natural history]] to [[hamster]]s, entitled "An approach to a natural history of the hamster" ("''Versuch einer Naturgeschichte des Hamsters''"). In several instances, he used the hamster to document the equal rights of all beings, including ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sulzer, Friedrich Gabriel |title=Versuch einer Naturgeschichte des Hamsters| language = German | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKI-AAAAcAAJ|accessdate=19 December 2011|year=1774|publisher= [[Johann Christian Dieterich|Dieterich]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geoffrey C. Ward.jpg|thumb|Geoffrey C. Ward]]
'''Geoffrey Champion Ward''' (born 1940) is an American editor, author, historian and writer of scripts for American history documentaries for public television. He is the author or co-author of 18 books, including five companion books to the documentaries he has written. He is the winner of five [[Emmy Awards]].

== Biography ==

===Youth===
Ward was born in [[Newark, Ohio]], and is a graduate of [[Oberlin College]] (1962).  His father was F. Champion Ward, educator and a devisor of the [[MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/obituaries/18ward.html?_r=1|title=F. C. Ward, Who Helped Devise ‘Genius Award,’ Dies at 96|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=18 June 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward spent some of his boyhood years in India.

===Career===

====Early career====
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
Ward was the founding editor of ''Audience Magazine'' (1970-1973) and the editor of ''[[American Heritage Magazine]]'' (1977-1982). His 1989 biography of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], ''A First-class Temperament: the Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt'', won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Francis Parkman Prize]] of the Society of American Historians and was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

====Later career====
The principal writer of the television mini-series ''[[The Civil War (documentary)|The Civil War]]'' (1990), Ward has collaborated with its co-producer [[Ken Burns]] on most of the documentaries he has made since, including ''[[Jazz (documentary)|Jazz]]'', ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]'', ''[[The War (documentary)|The War]]'', and ''Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony''. This work has garnered him five [[Emmy Award]]s. He also won two Emmys for the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, including ''The Kennedys'' (1992), and  ''TR, The Story of Theodore Roosevelt'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/about/award/broadcast, www.pbs.org/kenburns/about/geoffreycward.html&lt;/ref&gt;
His script for the documentary ''[[Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson]]'', won the [[Writers Guild of America]] Award in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id%3D1493 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012215422/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1493 |archivedate=2013-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the accompanying book won the 2006 [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/6189040.stm |title=Johnson biog named book of year  |work=[[BBC news]] |author=[[Staff writer]] |date=27 November 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/2351279/Johnsons-tale-floors-five-rivals.html |title=Johnson's tale floors five rivals |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Andrew Baker |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anisfield-Wolf Award]] for best biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anisfield-wolf.org/Anisfeld-Wolf Book Awards]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Organization of American Historians]] gave Ward their [[Friend of History Award]] for his outstanding contributions to American history: &lt;blockquote&gt;Over the last twenty years Geoffrey Ward's writings on American History have had a greater influence and reached a wider audience than those of any other American writer and historian. [His] work is always his own, but he has also helped free ideas that otherwise might have been imprisoned in the academy and helped them find a wider world. He has helped academic historians understand the possibilities, limits, and demands of what has become the medium through which most Americans now get their history."&lt;ref&gt;Organization of American Historians Awards Ceremony and Presidential Address Booklet 2006, page 4.  [http://www.www.oah.org/ Organization of American Historians]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2011 Burns/Ward collaboration, ''[[Prohibition (miniseries)|Prohibition]]'', brought Ward his seventh Emmy for Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emmys.tv/awards/64th-primetime-emmy-awards&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that project, he worked with Ken Burns on ''[[The Roosevelts (film)|The Roosevelts: An Intimate History]]'', a seven-part documentary miniseries depicting the lives of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], (broadcast on PBS in September 2014), and a multi-part TV series "[[The Vietnam War (film)|The Vietnam War]]", with [[Lynn Novick]] and Ken Burns (broadcast on PBS in September 2017).

In 2012, Ward published a biography of his great grandfather [[Ferdinand Ward]] (1851–1925), known as the greatest swindler of the Gilded Age. ''A Disposition to be Rich'' was written with the assistance of private family materials.

=== India ===
Ward spent some of his boyhood years in India and has remained involved with India and in Indian issues. Working and writing about the ongoing struggle to save the Bengal tiger in the wild has meant friendships with great tiger men like [[Fateh Singh Rathore]] &lt;ref&gt;Fateh Singh Rathore, the 'Tiger Guru,' Dies at 73 - NYTimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Billy Arjan Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tiger-Wallahs: Encounters with the Men Who Tried to Save the Greatest of the Cats'' (with Diane Raines Ward), HarperCollins, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  His essays and pieces on India have appeared in a wide array of publications, including ''[[GEO (magazine)|Geo]]'', ''[[National Audubon Society#Audubon Magazine|Audubon]]'', ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]'' and others.  In 2011, he wrote an introduction for the book ''Varanasi: Portrait of a Civilization,'' (Collins, India,) by the photographer ''Raghu Rai,'' with whom he has collaborated on magazine pieces. He is currently at work on a book about the partition of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="book review"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/books/review/india-becoming-by-akash-kapur.html |author=Geoffrey C. Ward |title=State of Paradox |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jazz ===
Ward is involved in the world of jazz and has collaborated with ''[[Wynton Marsalis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life (With Wynton Marsalis) Random House, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.'' After the documentary ''[[Jazz (documentary)|Jazz]]'' was aired on public television, in an interview in the New York Times, Ward spoke of playing ''West End Blues'' by [[Louis Armstrong]], as a 15-year-old student, so often that the bartender in the Paris cafe across the street from his student housing called him 'Satchmo':  "I must have played it a thousand times," he  remembered. "I think jazz music is so important to this country.... I find these characters, Armstrong, Ellington, working in a Jim Crow world, genuinely heroic.""&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, January 12, 2001, pg. B2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Ward is married to the writer &lt;ref&gt;Water Wars: Drought, Flood, Folly and the Politics of Thirst, Riverhead Books, 2003 and 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and social/environmental activist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hornstohavana.org:Building Bridges India, www.facebook.com/BuildingBridgesIndia; "[[Prakratik Society]]", Rajasthan, India&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Raines Ward. He has three children.

When he was nine years old, Ward contracted [[poliomyelitis]], and wears leg braces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/arts/television/the-roosevelts-documentary-series-on-pbs.html?_r=2 'The Roosevelts', Documentary Series on PBS - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; He later cited Franklin Roosevelt as a source of inspiration on how to overcome his handicap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/63186-revisiting-the-roosevelts-pw-talks-with-geoffrey-c-ward.html Revisiting the Roosevelts: PW Talks With Geoffrey C. Ward]&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed for ''The Roosevelts'', Ward "was determined not to get emotional", as Ken Burns said later, when discussing the "terror" felt by FDR during his ordeal in 1921; Burns did not mention Ward's disability on camera, but he had waited until the end of their interview before getting to questions on FDR's polio, at which point Ward "was taken aback and the emotions caught him".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/docsoup/2014/09/ken-burnss-the-roosevelts-the-truth-outside-the-frame/ Ken Burns's 'The Roosevelts': The Truth Outside the Frame | Doc Soup | POV Blog | PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Ingham Barnett''' (1815–1898) was an architect from [[St. Louis, MO]].  He was called ''The Dean of St. Louis Architecture'' for his contributions to the buildings of St. Louis as well as for his influence on other architects in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, Robert. ''American City, St. Louis Architecture, Three Centuries of Classic Design''. The Images Publishing Group, 2010, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life in England==
Barnett was born in [[Nottingham]], England.  He completed a classical education by the age of 16, then trained with [[Thomas Chambers Hine|Sir Thomas Hine]] at a builder in Nottingham, and then took on an apprenticeship with an architectural firm in London.  Barnett left England for the United States in early 1839, remaining in New York City for six months before departing for St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, William &amp; Conard, Howard Louis. ''Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis''. The Southern History Company, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in St. Louis and Illinois==
Barnett designed hundreds of buildings in St. Louis, many in [[Greek Revival]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] design.  Barnett did not deviate from classical designs, and his portfolio was largely responsible for establishing [[Classicism]] as St. Louis' dominant architectural influence.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, Robert. ''American City, St. Louis Architecture, Three Centuries of Classic Design''. The Images Publishing Group, 2010, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  His works included houses, churches, commercial, and civic structures.  Among his best known structures are renovations to the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], the [[Missouri Governor's Mansion|Missouri Governor's mansion]], the structures of the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Tower Grove Park]], and the Southern Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, Robert. ''American City, St. Louis Architecture, Three Centuries of Classic Design''. The Images Publishing Group, 2010, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Samuel''' Moody Grubbs House in LItchfield Illinois. The only structure in Illinois he designed. It is a second Empire design.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Influence on other architects==
Barnett's son, [[Thomas P. Barnett]], trained with the elder Barnett and went on to design such American landmarks as the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]] and the [[Adolphus Hotel]] in [[Dallas]].  His other son, George D. Barnett, and his son-in-law, John Ignatius Haynes, joined Tom Barnett to form the architectural firm of [[Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, John W. ''The Book of St. Louisans''. The St. Louis Republic, 1906, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  His eldest son, Absalom J. Barnett, became a successful architect in [[San Francisco]].

Other notable architects who apprenticed under Barnett included Henry G. Isaacs, [[Alfred H. Piquenard]], Charles F. May, William Kirchner, Isaac Taylor, and George Strafford Mills.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, William &amp; Conard, Howard Louis. ''Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis''.

[[Brigadier-General]] '''Giuseppe Garibaldi II''' (29 July 1879 &amp;ndash; 19 May 1950), better known as '''Peppino''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] soldier, patriot and revolutionary, grandson of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

==Biography==
Garibaldi was born in [[Melbourne, Australia]], the son of [[Ricciotti Garibaldi]] and Harriet Constance Hopcraft.&lt;ref name= "Heyriès p. 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Heyriès|2005|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his father, he took part in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] alongside the Greeks and afterwards fought with the liberals against [[Cipriano Castro]] in [[Venezuela]], and in other conflicts in [[South America]]. He volunteered and served with great distinction in the [[British Army]] during the [[Second Boer War]], carrying with him a sword given to his grandfather by the working men of [[Tyneside]], [[England]], in 1854.&lt;ref name= "Bell p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a lieutenant colonel (''teniente coronel'') in the army of [[Francisco I. Madero]] during the initial victories of the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Plaza Garibaldi]] in [[Mexico City]] was named in honor of his actions in the battle of [[Nuevo Casas Grandes]]. [[Pancho Villa]] sacked Lt Col Garibaldi because of a bitter controversy over the credit for the victory at [[Battle of Ciudad Juárez (1911)|first battle of Ciudad Juárez]] in 1911, but the name of the plaza (formerly ''Pila de la Habana'') stuck nonetheless, despite the way he left the Army of the Revolution.

Garibaldi again served with the Greek Army during the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Garibaldi joined the [[French army]] at the head of the [[4e régiment de marche du 1er étranger]]&lt;ref name= "Heyriès p. 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Heyriès|2005|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and later fought on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian front]] for Italy. In November 1915 his unit was the one that planted the Italian flag on the summit of [[Col di Lana]]. For this he received a promotion to colonel.&lt;ref name= "The Ogden Standard p. 1"&gt;{{harvnb|The Ogden Standard|1915|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[brigadier-general]] in June 1918, retiring from the military one year later.

Garibaldi opposed the [[National Fascist Party]] régime of [[Benito Mussolini]] which came to power in 1922 (while his younger brother [[Ezio Garibaldi|Ezio]] favored it). He eventually left Italy for the United States, where he married Madalyn Nichols Taylor. In 1940 he returned to Italy, where in 1943 the German authorities arrested and imprisoned him in the [[Regina Coeli (prison)|Regina Coeli]] prison in Rome. After the war he retired to private life.

He died in Rome in 1950, aged 70.

'''Ida Silverman''' (31 October 1882 – 1 November 1973) was a Jewish philanthropist, who with her husband helped found approximately 100 [[synagogue]]s, mostly in Israel. She is the only woman to have served as vice president of the [[Zionist Organization of America]] and the [[American Jewish Congress]].

A Russian immigrant, Silverman arrived in the United States before she was a year old. Her family settled in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where she completed her schooling, married and had four children. While doing relief work during the [[World War I|First World War]], she became aware of the depth of social problems and the effects of war on refugees. Joining the [[Zionist]] movement in the 1900s, within a decade she became a motivational speaker, advocating for the establishment of a permanent Jewish home in Palestine.

Between 1925 and the late 1940s, she logged over 600,000 air-miles traveling throughout the world, speaking and fund raising for the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. Even during [[World War II]], she received special permission to travel into war-torn areas to evaluate conditions. At the war's end, Silverman turned her efforts toward building infrastructure in the new nation of Israel, but was also involved in philanthropy in her home state of Rhode Island, raising funds for hospitals and mental health organizations.

She received many honors and awards for her philanthropy including Jewish Mother of the Year, the Mizrachi Women's Organization of America's "Silver Medal" for building Israel, honorary doctorates, and jointly with her husband was inducted into the [[Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame Women Inductees|Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame]] in 1971.

==Biography==
Ida Marcia Camelhor was born on 31 October 1882 in [[Kovno Governorate|Kovno, Russia]] to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1973|p=480}} (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn).

Archibald continued to work his way up and eventually became president of a bank and a philanthropist for Jewish causes.{{sfn|Browning|Hollander|Tec|2007|p=18}} Though Ida was the spokesperson and "presence" of the causes in which the couple were involved, Archibald fully supported her participation and gave his time, moral support, and monetary contributions to further their philanthropy.{{sfn|Foster|Horvitz|Cohen|1998|p=96}} He also understood and accepted that her work for others would always take precedence over her own household duties.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=115}}

==Career==
[[File:Ida Silverman and daughter 1925.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ida Silverman and daughter 1925]]By age 20, Silverman had two children,{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1973|p=480}} and would soon have two more.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=115}} She was involved in the community of Providence and social betterment programs. She founded and served as president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Jewish Orphanage of Rhode Island.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1973|p=480}} By 1906, she was involved in the American [[Zionist Movement]] and rose to the national position of vice president of the [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]].&lt;ref name="resignation Hadassah"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Archibald Silverman Resigns as Vice President of Hadassah|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3911777/the_wisconsin_jewish_chronicle/|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle|date=4 May 1928|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief work during World War I awakened her to the broad variety of social needs and she became an advocate of health care, poverty relief, and finding a permanent solution for Jewish refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liber|first1=Libby|title=Women's Whirl|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/imageserver.pl?oid=JPOST19460201-01&amp;getpdf=true|accessdate=29 December 2015|issue=Vol. 14 No. 5 Indiana Edition|work=The National Jewish Post|date=1 February 1946|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915, Silverman founded the second Hadassah chapter in New England in Providence.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=112}} She was a "skilled propagandist", developing a wide following between 1915 and 1919, and was known as a vigorous leader and talented orator.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=116}}

Her first acknowledgement on the national level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, [[Reform Judaism|Reform tradition]].{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=116}} By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=117}} Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=118}}

===1920s===
In 1925 Silverman made her first trip to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and was able to use her experiences to gain speaking engagements in a variety of venues.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=119}} Throughout the remainder of the 1920s, Silverman served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and vice chair of the hospital building fund for the [[Hebrew University]].

[[File:Ida Silverman National Jewish Fund.jpg|thumb|300px|Ida Silverman National Jewish Fund]] Silverman was an outspoken proponent for Israeli statehood, traveling throughout the Americas and Europe advocating for a Jewish homeland.{{sfn|Goodwin|Smith|2004|p=xv}} She depicted the Jews who had resettled in Palestine as simple farmers, seeking an agrarian life to alleviate the hunger they had experienced elsewhere. Silverman stressed that the settlers' intent was not to industrialize and vie with the international powerhouse nations, but simply to provide for their basic needs.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=119}} Throughout 1927 and 1928, her itinerary included a speaking engagement in [[Savannah, Georgia]] with Sir [[Wyndham Deedes]], prior chief secretary of Palestine;{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|pp=120–121}} a tour of hospitals, clinics and public health programs in the Holy Land to determine how Hadassah could improve the health of the entire region, "without regard to race or creed";&lt;ref name="local, state, national" /&gt; and attendance at the World Zionist Congress in [[Basel, Switzerland]].{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|pp=120–121}} Silverman resigned from Hadassah in 1928 in a policy dispute&lt;ref name="resignation Hadassah" /&gt; over the high salaries being paid to administrators rather than using the funds for charitable works.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|pp=121–122}}

===1930s===
[[File:Ida Silverman 1938 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Silverman in 1938]]
Despite the [[Great Depression]], Silverman's travels expanded in the 1930s, when she began spending 6 months each year outside the U.S.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=124}} As early as 1932, land purchase programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were being pursued by Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Settling Jewish Ex-soldiers Who Fought in Palestine on Palestine Soil|url=http://www.jta.org/1932/06/09/archive/settling-jewish-ex-soldiers-who-fought-in-palestine-on-palestine-soil|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=June 9, 1932|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power, Silverman's pleas for a safe haven for Jews became more urgent{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=125}} and her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland&lt;ref name=travels&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Silverman to be Guest Speaker at JNF's David Ben-Gurion Dinner|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3912211/the_wisconsin_jewish_chronicle/|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle|date=28 December 1956|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained explicit accounts of conditions.{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=126}} In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children to Palestine.

Because riots had broken out in the late 1930s over British proposals to [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition Palestine]],{{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1980|p=126}} and U.S. diplomats including [[Sumner Welles]] proposed American alternatives,&lt;ref name="Sosúa, Dominican Republic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Ben|title=Between You and Me|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3915671/the_wisconsin_jewish_chronicle/|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle|date=5 December 1941|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=6|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memories of the Forty-Niners |url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/imageserver.pl?oid=JPOST19410718-01&amp;getpdf=true|accessdate=29 December 2015|issue=Vol. 10, No. 6 Indiana Edition|work=The National Jewish Post|date=18 July 1941|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverman embarked on several tours of South America and the Caribbean in the early 1940s to determine if, as an alternative to Palestinian resettlement, European Jews could be established in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Peru]], or [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sand|first1=Nathan|title=Report on Inter-American Conference in Baltimore, Nov. 23&amp;ndash;24&amp;ndash;25|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3915601/the_wisconsin_jewish_chronicle/|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle|date=5 December 1941|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reported on her findings at the Inter-American Conference in Baltimore, describing the alternatives as unfavorable and the attempt in the Dominican Republic, as a "failure".&lt;ref name="Sosúa, Dominican Republic" /&gt; She also wrote articles under the byline ''Mrs. Archibald Silverman'', urging the emigration of Jews to Palestine rather than to other places &amp;ndash; such as a Jewish colony in [[Sosúa]], [[Dominican Republic]], promoted by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] in the early 1940s; a plan to settle Jews in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of Australia; and another proposal for a Jewish colony in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]]. Her articles were filled with vitriol against what she perceived as the "schemes" of Jewish organizers opposed to Zionism; in a 1948 article titled "The Surinam Nightmare", she "described 'diabolical plans' to abandon Jewish 'guinea pigs' to 'terrifying tropical diseases'". Eventually the alternative emigration plans were scrapped in the wake of the 1948 declaration of independence by the State of Israel.{{sfn|Rovner|2014|pp=213–215}}

[[File:Ida Silverman presents scroll.jpg|thumb|Ida Silverman presenting a scroll to Israeli Defense Minister [[Joseph Jacobsen (politician)|Joseph Jacobsen]]]]
After the Inter-American Conference in Baltimore, Silverman continued her travels in South America, and then obtained special permission to travel through England, Scotland, and Ireland to raise money. {{sfn|Jewish Historical Notes|1973|p=481}} Her collections were a resounding success, which she attributed to the acute understanding of homelessness experienced by British citizens who had been displaced during [[The Blitz|bombing raids]].&lt;ref name="london bombings" /&gt; Anticipating the war's end, Silverman increased efforts to buy land in Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zionists Launch Big Drive to Buy Refugees Land|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1943/01/25/page/15/article/zionists-launch-big-drive-to-buy-refugees-land|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=25 January 1943|location=Chicago, Illinois|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; believing that if Jewish organizations owned land, when the Peace Conference occurred, bargaining would be in their favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palestine Only Haven, Declares Mrs. Silverman|url=http://jtn.stparchive.com/Archive/JTN/JTN11021942P08.php|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=The Jewish Transcript|date=2 November 1942|location=Seattle, Washington|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaiah Bakish''' ({{lang-he|ר׳ ישעיה בקיש}}, {{abbr|fl.|floruit}} 1590s – 1610s) was a rabbi of Spanish origin.&lt;ref&gt;His names {{lang|he|בקיש}} {{lang|he|ישעיה }} are also written : Baqish, Bakich, etc.  Yécha’ya, Isaiah, Ichaya, Yishaya, Yésha’ya, Isaïe, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was dayan (judge) in the [[Beth Din]] (rabbinical court) of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. His writings deal with [[takkanot]] (sing. takkanah), [[exegesis]] and [[kabbalah]].

==The Kabbalist==
Kabbalistic writings of Bakish were included in manuscript compilations containing also quotes from famous Kabbalists such as: [[Nahmanides]] (Ramban, R’ Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi); Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] (R’ Ari zal); Rabbi [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]]; R’ [[Abraham Azulai]].&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.hevratpinto.org/tsadikim_n/rabbi_avraham_azoulay.html&lt;/ref&gt; The microfilmed collections of the [[National Library of Israel]] in Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Microfilmed Manuscripts and Manuscripts Dept., [[Jérusalem]].http://jnul.huji.ac.il/imhm/&lt;/ref&gt; contain several of these manuscripts or microfilm manuscripts from other libraries.

In his work on [[Kabbalah]] in [[North Africa]] since the 16th c., Moshé Hallamish mentioned Isaiah Bakish.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 43 ; 119; 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;
In his ''Shorshei Hashemot'' the Italian Kabbalist [[Moses ben Mordecai Zacuto]] included long quotations of the  R' Isaiah Bakish (16-17th c.).&lt;ref&gt;See ed. 2010: Tome 1, 6-79, p. 234;  30-28, p. 379; 40-35, p. 373; 40-52, p. 801; 90-2-5, p. 477a-478b; 90-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

The son of Mr. and Mrs. Will Angelle, he served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. In 1948, he graduated from the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], then known as '''Southwestern Louisiana Institute'''. In 1949, he began a two-year position as the assistant county agent in [[Natchitoches Parish]] in northwestern [[Louisiana]]. From 1951 to 1984, he was the president of the Angelle [[Ford]] dealership in Breaux Bridge. He was elected to the St. Martin Parish Police Jury in 1952 and served for two terms until 1960.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=James Burton Angelle, Sr.|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]|date=August 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelle was elected in 1964 as state representative, a position which he held until 1972. Representative Angelle helped to establish the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]], known as CODOFIL.&lt;ref name=scotta/&gt; In 1967, he defeated the comeback attempt waged by his predecessor as representative, [[Bob Angelle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=1967785204So2d581_1694.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985|title=Angelle v.

In his last year in office, 1972, he represented [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]], as well as his own St. Martin.&lt;ref name=lahouse/&gt; After his legislative terms, Angelle joined the new administration of Governor [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] as the  director/secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries]]. He held the Cabinet position during the first three of Edwards' four nonconsecutive terms as governor, 1972 to 1980 and 1984 to 1988.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Coincidentally, Angelle was first succeeded in both the state House and at Wildlife and Fisheries by the same man, [[Jesse J. Guidry]], a fellow Democrat from [[Cecilia, Louisiana|Cecilia]] in St. Martin Parish.

Angelle was a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] father of nine children by his wife, the former Shirley Dauterive (1930-2010). One of their daughters, Catherine Louise "Cathy" Angelle (1964-1983) was killed while driving her brother Scott's car en route from [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] to Breaux Bridge while he had gone on a [[fishing]] trip with a friend.&lt;ref name=scotta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/politics/state/2015/08/29/angelle-local-guy-long-term-vision/71398046/|title=Angelle: Local guy with a long-term vision|author=Ken Stickney|date=August 29, 2015|work=[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Angelle's death, the couple had three other sons, Burton, Jr., and wife, Shan, of [[Sunset, Louisiana|Sunset]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry Parish]], Glenn Angelle and wife, Becky, and Brian Angelle, all of Breaux Bridge, and four other daughters, Sharon Thomassee and husband, Phillip, of Lafayette, Brenda Garrett of [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]], Julie Theriot and husband, Neil, of [[Kingwood, Houston]], and Nanette Angelle of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4951">'''J. M. Condé''' was an early 20th century "golden age" book illustrator and comic strip artist best known for his ink and watercolor illustrations for books by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] and [[Albert Bigelow Paine]]. He also worked on at least two comic strips, one of which was derived from Harris's "[[Br'er Rabbit]]" stories.

[[File:Conde-Uncle-Remus-c1918.jpg|thumb| Illustration for "The Most Beautiful Bird" in [[Joel Chandler Harris]], ''Uncle Remus Returns'', 1918 ]]

==Career==

Condé worked in what is known as the golden age of American illustration in the early 20th century. His energetic line work calls to mind the work of his contemporary  [[A. B. Frost]], while his use of vivid color evokes [[Winsor McKay]]. He specialized in illustrations of animals in books for children.

Condé  illustrated the "Hollow Tree" books of Albert Bigelow Paine and some of Joel Chandler Harris's "Uncle Remus" stories, as well as books by [[Martha Strudwick Young]] and ''[[Aesop's Fables]]''. Like some other illustrators of the day, Condé attempted to show animals as if drawn from life, though he also followed the 'humanizing' line of traditional animal fables and usually clothed his animal characters in trousers and coat or shirt, and sometimes shoes as well.&lt;ref name=kensinger/&gt;&lt;ref name=ui/&gt;

From June to October 1906, the McClure Syndicate ran a Sunday color comic strip entitled ''Brer Rabbit'' (sometimes referred to as ''Uncle Remus Stories''), based on Harris's stories and drawn by Condé. There were 16 episodes in the series, each with its own title, such as "Brer Rabbit &amp; the Gold Mine."&lt;ref name=strippersguide/&gt;

Another comic strip from Condé was ''Aubrey of the Tenements'' (1904), which featured a cat named Aubrey and his nameless friend, a talkative and rude parrot who gets them both into all kinds of mischief after they move from the slums to an upper-class home.&lt;ref name=barnacle/&gt;

'''John Curtis Holmes''' (August 8, 1944 – March 13, 1988), better known as '''John C. Holmes''' or '''Johnny the Wadd''' (after the lead character he portrayed in a series of related films), was at the time he was active, one of the most prolific male [[pornographic film|adult film]] actors, with documented credit for at least 544 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=JHolmes/gender=M/john-holmes.htm#perflist|title=Internet Adult Film Database|website=www.iafd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes was best known for his exceptionally large [[Human penis|penis]], which was heavily promoted as the longest, thickest and hardest in the [[porn|adult film]] industry, although no documented measurement of Holmes' actual penis length, [[Girth (geometry)|girth]] or [[tumescence]] has ever been confirmed.&lt;ref name=wadd&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Paley, Cass (Director) | date=September 9, 1999 | title=Wadd: The Life &amp; Times of John C. Holmes | medium=Motion picture | location=Lebanon | publisher=Paley, Cass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, Holmes attained notoriety for his reputed involvement in the [[Wonderland murders]] of July 1981 and eventually for his death from [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] caused by [[AIDS]] in March 1988. Holmes was the subject of several books, a lengthy [[essay]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and two feature-length documentaries, and was the [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for two [[Hollywood]] movies (''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Wonderland (2003 film)|Wonderland]]'').

== Early life ==
Holmes was born John Curtis Estes on August 8, 1944, in the small rural town of [[Ashville, Ohio|Ashville]], [[Ohio]], about {{convert|25|mi}} south of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. He was the youngest of four children born to 26-year-old Mary June (Barton) Holmes, but the name of his father, railroad worker Carl Estes, is left blank on his [[birth certificate]]. Mary had married Edgar Harvey Holmes, who was the father of her three older children - Dale, Edward and Anne. She and Holmes were married and [[divorce]]d three times, as is documented by wedding certificates dated April 13, 1936, August 13, 1945, and September 12, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Marriage records for Mary Barton Holmes and Edgar Holmes as researched at Familysearch.org  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-FHK9-R, https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-F8D8-K https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9392-B19G-F7&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of their first marriage in 1936, Edgar was 35 years old and divorced, while Mary was 17.&lt;ref name="Ohio marriage records"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio marriage records|url= https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9392-B19G-F7|website=FamilySearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing for the third and final time, Edgar and Mary each married one more time.&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-FH4R-X   https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;englishSubcountryName=Ohio&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3Amary~%20%2Bsurname%3Aholmes~%20%2Bspouse_surname%3Abowman~%20%2Brecord_country%3A%22United%20States%22%20%2Brecord_subcountry%3A%22United%20States%2COhio%22&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary changed John's [[surname]] to Holmes when he was a child. In 1986, when Holmes applied for a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]] for the first time prior to a trip to [[Italy]], his mother reportedly provided him with the handwritten copy of his original birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes.

Holmes' mother was said to be a devout [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and with her children regularly attended church in [[Millport, Pickaway County, Ohio|Millport]]. In contrast, his [[stepfather]] Edgar was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who would come home inebriated, stumble about the house and even [[vomiting|vomit]] on the children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed a reprieve from his turbulent home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (née Gillenwater) Barton.&lt;ref name="Ohio marriage records"/&gt; Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a toddler and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a [[affordable housing|low-income]] apartment project with a friend of Mary's and her own two children. The two women worked as clerks and waitresses in order to support their young children.

When Holmes was age seven, his mother married Harold Bowman on December 31, 1951. Shortly afterward, Holmes and his family moved from Columbus and settled in the small town of [[Pataskala, Ohio|Pataskala]], about 10 miles east. Holmes recalled that Bowman was a good father until Holmes' younger half-brother David was born, at which point Bowman reportedly lost interest in his stepchildren and began [[child neglect|neglecting]] them.&lt;ref name=amerson/&gt;&lt;ref name=wadd/&gt;

Holmes left home at age 15 and enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with his mother's written permission. He spent most of the three years of his military service in [[West Germany]] in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].&lt;ref name=wadd/&gt; Upon his [[Military discharge|honorable discharge]] in 1963, Holmes moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he worked in a variety of jobs, including selling goods [[door-to-door]] and tending the vats at a [[Pearson Candy Company, Inc.#Signature Product: Pearson Coffee Nip|Coffee Nips]] factory. During his stint as an [[ambulance]] driver, Holmes met a nurse named Sharon Gebenini in December 1964. They married on August 21, 1965 in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=+givenname:John~++surname:holmes~++spouse_givenname:Sharon~++spouse_surname:Gebenini~|title=FamilySearch|website=www.familysearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Holmes turned 21.&lt;ref name="scary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sager|first=Mike|title=Scary Monsters and Super Freaks: Stories of Sex, Drugs, Rock 'N' Roll and Murder|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003|page=10|isbn=978-1-56025-563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1965, Holmes found work as a [[forklift]] driver at a [[meat packing industry|meatpacking]] warehouse in nearby [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]]. However, repeated exposure to the freezing air in the large walk-in freezer after being outside inhaling the desert-hot air caused him severe health problems, leading to a [[pneumothorax]] of his right lung on three separate occasions during the two years he worked there.&lt;ref name=scary/&gt; Sharon also had health problems, as during the first 17 months of her marriage to Holmes, she [[Miscarriage|miscarried]] three times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=John Holmes, a Life Measured in Inches|last1=Sugar |first1=Jennifer |last2=Nelson |first2=Jill C. |date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Film career ===
{{quote|John Holmes was to the adult film industry what [[Elvis Presley]] was to [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]. He simply was The King.|[[Cinematography|Cinematographer]] [[Bob Vosse]] in the documentary ''[[Wadd: The Life &amp; Times of John C. Holmes]]''.}}

In 1971, Holmes' career began to take off with an [[adult film]] series built around a [[private investigator]] named Johnny Wadd, written and directed by [[Bob Chinn (film director)|Bob Chinn]]. The success of the film ''Johnny Wadd'' created an immediate demand for follow-ups, so Chinn followed up the same year with ''Flesh of the Lotus.'' Most of the subsequent Johnny Wadd films were written and directed by Chinn and produced by the Los Angeles-based company Freeway Films.

With the success of ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972), ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973), [[porn chic|porn became chic]], although its legality was still hotly contested. Holmes was arrested during this time for [[pimp]]ing and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]], but he avoided prison time by reputedly becoming an [[informant]] for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]].&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web |title=John Holmes and the Wonderland Murders: Wadd the Informer |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/3.html |publisher=crimelibrary.com |accessdate=2008-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417013100/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/3.html |archivedate=April 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' "handler" during his time as an informant was LAPD vice detective Thomas Blake. Of his involvement with Holmes, Blake said, "It was a pleasure working for him."&lt;ref&gt;Interview segment with Detective Blake in the documentary, Wadd:The Life and Times of John C. Holmes, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, Holmes was alleged to be earning as much as $3,000 per day as a porn performer.&lt;ref name=amerson/&gt;&lt;ref name=library/&gt; Around this time, his consumption of [[cocaine]] and [[freebasing]] were becoming an increasingly serious problem. Professionally, it affected his ability to maintain an [[erection]], as is apparent from his flaccid performance in ''[[Insatiable (1980 film)|Insatiable]]'' (1980). To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, [[Prostitution|prostituting]] himself to both men and women, as well as committing [[credit card fraud]] and various acts of [[petty theft]]. In 1976, Holmes met 15-year-old Dawn Schiller, whom he [[Child grooming|groomed]] and abused. After he became desperate for money, he forced her into prostitution and often beat her, which he did at least once in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holmes' Confession in Bathtub: Told Wife of Role in 4 Murders|date=April 14, 1988 |work=Los Angeles Times|author=Robert W.

=== Number and gender of partners ===
In the 1981 biographical feature documentary ''Exhausted, John C. Holmes, The Real Story'', from director and Holmes confidante Julia St. Vincent, Holmes claimed during an interview segment that he had [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with 14,000 women.&lt;ref name=library/&gt; The number had in fact been invented by Holmes to help salvage his waning image.&lt;ref name=amerson/&gt; The true number of women (and men) with whom Holmes had sex during his career would never be known.

=== Drugs and the Wonderland murders ===
{{details|Wonderland murders}}
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
In late 1980, a mutual friend introduced Holmes to Chris Coxx, who owned the Odyssey [[nightclub]]. In turn, Coxx introduced Holmes to [[Eddie Nash]], a drug dealer who owned several nightclubs, including the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mb/peejay/kingdong4.html|title=King Dong|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Holmes was closely associated with the [[Wonderland Gang]], a group of [[heroin]]-addicted cocaine dealers, so called for the [[rowhouse]] located on Wonderland Avenue in the [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, out of which they operated. Holmes frequently sold drugs for the gang. Gang members included [[Ron Launius|Ronnie Lee Launius]], [[David Clay Lind]], Joy Gold Miller, Billy DeVerell, and their wheel-man, [[Tracy McCourt]].

After using more than his share of the gang's drugs,&lt;ref name="In Too Deep"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Too Deep|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes was in trouble with the gang. In June 1981, Holmes told the gang's leaders, [[David Clay Lind]] and Ron Launius, about a large stash of drugs, money and jewelry Nash had in his house. Holmes helped to set up a [[Wonderland Gang#Nash robbery|home invasion and armed robbery]] that was committed on the morning of June 29, 1981. Although Holmes was not present during the robbery, Nash apparently suspected he had a part in it. After forcing Holmes to confess to his participation and threatening his life and those of Holmes' family, Nash dispatched enforcers and Holmes to exact [[revenge]] against the gang.

In the early hours of July 1, 1981, four of the gang's members were found murdered and a fifth severely battered and near death in their rowhouse. Holmes was allegedly present during the murders and left a left palm print (not "bloody" as Los Angeles media outlets covering the story erroneously reported) over one victim's [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]], but it is unclear whether he participated in the killings. Holmes was questioned but was released due to lack of evidence; he refused to cooperate with the investigation. After spending nearly five months on the run with Schiller, Holmes was arrested in [[Florida]] on December 4, 1981 by former LAPD homicide detectives Frank Tomlinson and Tom Lange (who later gained fame for his involvement in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]]).  Holmes was [[extradition|extradited]] to Los Angeles, and in March 1982, he was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week trial, he was [[acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges except committing [[contempt of court]] on June 26, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scheeres |first=Julia |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |title=Miami — The Wonderland Murders — Crime Library |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=2014-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184736/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder trial was a landmark in the history of American trial procedure, as it was the first in which [[videotape]] was introduced as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;"Wadd: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes," statement made by his lawyer, Earl Hanson.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death ==
After his release from [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles County Jail]] for contempt of court in November 1982, Holmes quickly resumed his film career with a new generation of porn stars. His drug addiction continued off-and-on, and although work was still plentiful, it was no longer as lucrative as it had been with the advent of cheaply made videotapes that saturated the porn market. Most of the feature porn films and videos he made during the 1980s were little more than [[cameo appearances]].

In February 1986, five or six months after testing negative, Holmes was diagnosed as [[HIV]]-positive. According to his second wife [[Misty Dawn|Laurie Holmes]], he claimed that he never used [[hypodermic needle]]s and that [[fear of needles|he was deathly afraid of them]]. Gebenini and friend/former colleague [[Bill Amerson]] separately confirmed later that Holmes could not have contracted HIV from intravenous drug use because he never used needles.&lt;ref name=amerson/&gt;

During the summer of 1986, Holmes was offered a lucrative deal from Paradise Visuals, which was unaware he was HIV-positive, to travel to Italy to film what were to be his last two pornographic films. Holmes' penultimate film was ''The Rise of the Roman Empress'' (originally released in Italy as ''Carne bollente'') for director [[Riccardo Schicchi]]. The film starred Holmes, the later [[Italian Parliament]] member [[Ilona Staller|Ilona "Cicciolina" Staller]], [[Tracey Adams]], [[Christoph Clark]], and [[Amber Lynn]].&lt;ref name="book2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Huge | publisher=STARbooks Press | author=John Patrick | year=2008 | page=13 | isbn=978-1-934187-29-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final film was ''The Devil In Mr. Holmes'', starring Adams, Lynn, [[Karin Schubert]], and [[Marina Hedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=86797 |title=Paradise Visuals Inks Distribution Deal With Anabolic |accessdate=2009-04-11 |author=Steve Javors |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=XBIZ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709100516/http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=86797 |archivedate=July 9, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These last films created a furor when it was revealed later that Holmes had consciously chosen not to reveal his HIV status to his co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the filming.&lt;ref name="book2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=940CE0DF1F3AF931A25752C0A9679C8B63

== Personal life ==
=== Significant others ===
* In August 1965, Holmes married a young nurse named Sharon Ann Gebenini at [[Fort Ord, California]].&lt;ref name=scary/&gt; Their divorce was finalized on October 19, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/search/collection/results?count=20&amp;query=+givenname:John~++surname:Holmes~++spouse_givenname:Sharon~&amp;collection_id=2015584|title=FamilySearch|website=www.familysearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975, he met Julia St. Vincent on the set of his film, ''Liquid Lips'', which was being produced by her uncle Armand Atamian. Holmes and St. Vincent remained close until 1981 and the Wonderland murders. St. Vincent produced the [[ersatz]] biographical film of Holmes' life, ''Exhausted'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wadd: The Life &amp; Times of John C. Holmes]]'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In her memoir, ''The Road Through Wonderland: Surviving John Holmes'' (2009), Schiller also described her and her sister Terry's observations that Holmes was a [[voyeur]], who looked through their [[bungalow]] windows in [[Glendale, California]] as well as strangers' hotel windows at the [[Biltmore hotels|Biltmore]] in [[Palm Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schiller, Dawn|title=The Road Through Wonderland: Surviving John Holmes|publisher=Medallion Press|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penis size ==
Holmes' signature asset in the porn business was his exceptionally large [[human penis|penis]]. No definitive measurement or documentation verifying his penis' length or girth exists, leaving its exact size unknown. Holmes was [[foreskin|uncircumcised]].

Holmes|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, medical studies of human penis size have consistently found erections average between about 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, K.; Eardley, I. (2007). "Penile size and the 'small penis syndrome'". BJU International 99 (6): 1449–1455. doi:10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06806.x. {{PMID|17355371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wessells, H; Lue, TF; McAninch, JW (1996).

So celebrated was the size of Holmes' [[penis]] that it was used as a promotional tool for films in which he did not even appear. The film ''Anybody But My Husband'' ran a promotional tag line of, "Tony 'The Hook' Perez has a dick so big he gives John Holmes a run for his money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnholmes.com|title=johnholmes.com|website=www.johnholmes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of his career, Holmes claimed to have had his penis insured by [[Lloyd's of London]] for $14 million. Holmes reveled in claiming he was insured "for $1 million an inch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Tied up in Knots (Interview with John C. Holmes)|work=Penthouse Magazine|date= July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To think that he walked among us with that massive tool, like a [[dinosaur]] with that thump, thump, thump! But it wasn't his feet hitting the floor. It was his balls hitting the floor, it was his DICK hitting the floor!".| Adult industry publisher and commentator [[Al Goldstein]] in the documentary ''[[Wadd: The Life &amp; Times of John C. Holmes]].}}

Another controversy was regarding whether Holmes ever achieved a full erection, although much of his early work clearly revealed he was able to achieve a substantial erection. A popular joke in the 1970s porn industry held that Holmes was incapable of achieving a full erection because the blood flow from his head into his penis would cause him to [[Syncope (medicine)|pass out]].&lt;ref name=haven/&gt; Fellow film actress [[Annette Haven]] stated that his penis was never particularly hard during intercourse, likening it to "doing it with a big, soft kind-of [[loofah]]".&lt;ref name=haven&gt;{{cite news|title= Annette Haven interview |work=Wadd: The Life &amp; Times of John C. Holmes|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"How big is it?" My fans would scream. "Bigger than a payphone, smaller than a Cadillac" was my reply. | Actor John C. Holmes in his posthumously-released autobiography, ''Porn King''.}}

After Holmes' death, the length of his penis continued to be used to market Holmes-related material. For example, at the premiere of the film ''[[Wonderland (2003 film)|Wonderland]]'' (2003), patrons were given 13{{frac|1|2}}-inch rulers as gag gifts.&lt;ref name=wond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/wonderlandmurders.htm |title=John Holmes and the Wonderland Murders |publisher=Franksreelreviews.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business activities and endeavors ==
In 1979, along with his younger half-brother David Bowman, Holmes opened a Los Angeles [[Locksmithing|locksmith]] shop managed by Bowman and an attached used goods store called The Just Looking Emporium, named by Gebinini and managed by Schiller. However, because of Holmes' escalating drug addiction, which distracted him from buying inventory for the Emporium and siphoned its [[working capital]], the Emporium "close[d] its doors forever by the end of September 1980".&lt;ref name="John Holmes 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schiller, Dawn|title=The Road Through Wonderland}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schiller, "David [kept] his part of the business open while John remove[d] our inventory and [sold] it all for coke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schiller, Dawn|title=The Road Through Wonderland}} Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, after Holmes' acquittal, he and Amerson founded and operated Penguin Productions, where Holmes could be a [[Triple threat (entertainer)|triple-threat]]: writing, directing and performing.&lt;ref name="John Holmes 1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Devil in John Holmes|work=Rolling Stone|author=Sager, Mike|url=http://longform.org/stories/the-devil-and-john-holmes|date=May 1989|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917214413/http://longform.org/stories/the-devil-and-john-holmes|archivedate=September 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes appeared in seven of Penguin's 20 productions between 1985 and 1988. After requesting permission to use the name "Johnny Wadd" from his old director and friend Bob Chinn, Holmes reprised the role for Penguin's ''The Return of Johnny Wadd'' (1986) – one of his last films.

== Holmes mythology ==
Holmes' career was promoted with a series of outrageous claims that he made over the years (many made up on the spur of the moment by Holmes himself). The most dubious ones include:
* Holmes' penis was so big that he had to stop wearing [[undergarment|underwear]] because: "I was getting erections and snapping the elastic waist band four or five times a month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John Holmes interview |work=Exhausted''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Holmes had degrees in [[physical therapy]], medicine and [[political science]] from [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Holmes and the Wonderland Murders: 12.5 Inches|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/2.html|publisher=crimelibrary.com|accessdate=2008-05-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411161323/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/2.html|archivedate=April 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes was in fact a [[High school dropouts|high-school dropout]] who never returned to school and, according to Bill Amerson, "the closest John ever got to UCLA was breaking into cars in the school's parking lot".&lt;ref name=amerson/&gt;
* Holmes and [[Ken Osmond]], who played [[Eddie Haskell]] in the TV series ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', were the same person. In reality, the two men simply shared a passing resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stengel|first=Richard|title=When Eden Was in Suburbia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925676-2,00.html|date=August 9, 1982|work=TIME|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the filming of a gay feature film, Holmes inadvertently killed two male performers and was tried for [[manslaughter]]. The judge in the case sentenced Holmes to abstain from performing [[anal sex]] in any future films. However, this is an unproven [[urban myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wadds Up?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">[[File:Johannes von Rostov.jpeg|thumb|John the Merciful of [[Rostov]]]]
Blessed '''John the Hairy''' ({{lang-ru|Иоанн Власатый}}, also known as '''John the Merciful of [[Rostov]]''') was a [[holy fool]] ([[Yurodivy]]), of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in the second half of the 16th century.  He endured a great many trials in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=OCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Blessed John "the Hairy" and Fool-For-Christ at Rostov|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2017/11/12/103288-blessed-john-the-hairy-and-fool-for-christ-at-rostov|website=Orthodox Church in America|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He did not have a permanent shelter, and at times took his rest at the house of his spiritual Father, a priest at the church of the All-Holy, or with one of the aged widows."

According to [[Orthodox Church in America]] sources, Blessed John,
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
Living in humility, patience and unceasing prayer... spiritually nourished many people, among them [[St Irenarchus]], [[Hermit]] of Rostov (January 13). After a long life of pursuing [[asceticism]], he died on September 3, 1580 and was buried, according to his final wishes, beside the church of [[Saint Blaise]] beyond the altar.&lt;ref name=OCA /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He had "hair upon his head abundantly," therefore he was called "Hairy." The title "Merciful" was given to Blessed John because of the many healings that occurred at his grave, and also in connection with the memory of the holy Patriarch [[John the Merciful]] (November 12), whose name he shared.&lt;ref name=OCA /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blessed John the Hairy is commemorated on November 12 in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=OCA /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14369">'''Jossy Mehsen Mansur''' (June 7, 1934, Aruba, – October 15, 2016, Aruba ) was the editor of the [[Papiamento]]-language newspaper'' [[Diario (Aruba)|Diario]]'' in Aruba.  He wrote two dictionaries for the Papiamento language and a history of Aruba among other books.

==Powerful Aruban business family==
Mansur was a descendant of a family which originally came from Lebanon and settled on the island of [[Aruba]]. The Mansur family made its fortune as cigarette manufacturers and in the import-export business. With a licence of [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], they were the major suppliers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] in the Caribbean basin for many years (the licence has been withdrawn). The Mansurs sponsored the Marlboro Red Tigers baseball team as well as the [[Aruban People's Party]] (Arubaanse Volkspartij, AVP) of former Prime Minister [[Henny Eman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.groene.nl/1996/49/Braaf_aruba Braaf Aruba], De Groene Amsterdammer, December 4, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snuffel&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.burojansen.nl/snuffel/Hfst3-Sn.pdf Veiligheidsdienst Aruba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916045029/http://www.burojansen.nl/snuffel/Hfst3-Sn.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, in Buro Jansen &amp; Janssen, 2002. ''De Snuffelstaat: Nederland en de BVD'', Amsterdam: Fagel {{ISBN|90-5914-121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family owns their own bank, the Interbank, the biggest hotel and time-sharing complex, La Cabana, and the Royal Cabana casino. They also have import-export businesses in the [[Free Trade Zone]].&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tni.org/archives/tblick/aruba.htm The Rothschilds of the Mafia on Aruba], by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

US President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1996 publicly identified Aruba "as a major drug-transit country" and noted that "a substantial portion of the free-zone's businesses in Aruba are owned and operated by members of the Mansur family, who have been indicted in the United States on charges of conspiracy to launder trafficking proceeds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=8277747973+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Illicit Drug-Producing and Drug-Transit Countries]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, December 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, an investigator for Senator [[John Kerry]]'s committee investigating the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], interviewing drug traffickers in a West Miami prison kept hearing about the Mansurs. "Who are the Mansurs?" he would ask. Answer: "The big family in Aruba we used for laundering money and moving cocaine."&lt;ref name=wsj290597/&gt;

==Alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling and money laundering==
The Mansur family was involved in cigarette smuggling from Aruba to Colombia. For over 50 years, [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]]' main distributor in Latin America was the Mansur Free Zone Trading Company, NV. Cigarettes were shipped to Aruba or Panamanian free trade zones operated by the Mansurs and then into Colombia's special customs zone, [[Maicao]], just across the border from Venezuela. One of Philip Morris main distributors within Colombia was [[Samuel Santander Lopesierra]], at one time a senator in the Liberal Party. Dubbed "the Marlboro Man" by the Colombian media, in reference to his alleged cigarette smuggling activities, Lopesierra is named in a U.S. federal court affidavit filed in conjunction with the Mansur money-laundering indictment.&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;&lt;ref name=icij310100&gt;[http://www.public-i.org/report.aspx?aid=335 Major Tobacco Multinational Implicated In Cigarette Smuggling, Tax Evasion, Documents Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825154646/http://www.public-i.org/report.aspx?aid=335 |date=2005-08-25 }}, by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, January 31, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icij030301&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/report.aspx?aid=355 Tobacco Companies Linked to Criminal Organizations in Cigarette Smuggling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130163115/http://www.publicintegrity.org/report.aspx?aid=355 |date=2006-11-30 }}, by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, March 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the Venezuelan intelligence agency, the DISIP, "in Venezuela the Mansurs are implicated in money laundering with Lopesierra.&lt;ref name=sem180494&gt;{{es icon}} [http://72.35.86.196/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=45950 El Hombre Marlboro]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semana, April 18, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20020506&amp;s=schapiro Big Tobacco], by Mark Schapiro, The Nation, May 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Every month Lopesierra  're-invested' 20 million dollars 'with the help of a well-known entrepreneur called Mansur'."&lt;ref name&gt;See: Javier Ignacio Mayorca, 'Santa' Lopesierra encabeza brazo político del Cartel Maicao', "El Nacional" (Caracas), 5 June 1995.

Lopesierra and his group were responsible for smuggling shipments of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the United States, and for laundering the proceeds so they could be repatriated through Puerto Rico, New York, and Miami back to Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2006/June/06_crm_410.html Colombian National Convicted On Cocaine Charges], Department of Justice press release, June 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mansur family has gained international prominence for alleged money laundering. Two family members, the cousins Eric and Alex Mansur, have been indicted by the U.S. attorney in [[Puerto Rico]]. They reportedly funneled US$500,000 in campaign cash to Colombian President [[Ernesto Samper]] through the wife of a jailed Cali cartel boss during the 1994 election campaign. Mr. Samper denied it. The Mansurs subsequently were awarded a monopoly for Colombian gambling, which was canceled in 1997 by a government watchdog agency that smelled impropriety.&lt;ref name=wsj290597&gt;[http://thekomisarscoop.com/2006/08/18/drug-smugglers-dutch-treat/ Drug Smugglers’ Dutch Treat], by [[Lucy Komisar]], The Wall Street Journal, May 29, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: Juan O. Tamayo &amp; Gerardo Reyes, 'Intrigue in Colombia: Who has the $500,000?', The Miami Herald, 21 February 1996. Quoted in [http://www.tni.org/archives/tblick/aruba.htm The Rothschilds of the Mafia on Aruba], by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sem310397&gt;{{es icon}} [http://72.35.86.196/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=33550 El fantasma de La Monita]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semana, March 31, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris International broke its contract with the Mansurs at the end of 1998 "for business reasons." A source close to the family said the two sides agreed to a $422 million settlement and that the Mansurs continue to work with Philip Morris' non-tobacco product lines.&lt;ref name=icij310100/&gt;

==Suing the Netherlands==
In 1999 Jossy Mansur and his brother Luis Mansur and sister Lisa Thomson Mansur sued the [[Netherlands]] government before the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] for disseminating what the Aruban government termed a ''top secret report'' that claimed that the Mansurs were involved in organized crime. 
The report by the Dutch Internal Security Service describes security in Aruba, saying that foreign organizations fighting crime in the region are almost unanimous in their view of the Aruban business community as providing services for (laundering specialists of) regional drug cartels.&lt;ref name=sjocrona/&gt;

The report mentions the Mansurs by name and portrays them as criminals who were associated with criminal organizations involved in drugs trafficking, gun trafficking and laundering money obtained from criminal activities. Despite the fact that the report was classified as top secret, it was leaked to the press and its contents became public. The suit was dismissed on procedural grounds for failure to exhaust Mansur's civil remedies in the Netherlands courts.&lt;ref name=sjocrona&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view883.htm Messrs. L. E. and J. Mansur (represented by Dr. Jan M. Sjöcrona and Mr. John H. van der Kuyp) v. the Netherlands],'' Communication No. 883/1999, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/883/1999 (9 November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspaper editor==
Mansur is known for his weekly editorials which are often critical of the local government of Prime Minister [[Nelson Oduber]]. The ongoing disagreement between Mansur and Oduber dates back many years. During the election campaign in 2001 Oduber's party even had stickers made stating "Don’t believe '' [[Diario (Aruba)|Diario]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipiapa.org/pulications/informe_aruba2005o.cfm Country report 2005], Inter American Press Association  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023144133/http://www.sipiapa.org/pulications/informe_aruba2005o.cfm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansur has strongly advocated a point of view in the cases of [[Eduardo Mathew]] and [[Natalee Holloway]]. He appeared regularly on [[Fox News]] and [[Nancy Grace]]'s [[CNN]] [[Headline News]] show commenting on the disappearance of Natalee Holloway on Aruba in 2005. Mansur formed his own "investigative team" and his newspaper repeatedly published new leads. According to some observers, Mansur jumped on the bandwagon as part of his own feud with the Aruban government.&lt;ref name=vanity&gt;[http://scrux.com/clonedpages/vanityfairoriginal.htm Nightmare in Paradise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001705/http://scrux.com/clonedpages/vanityfairoriginal.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}, by Bryan Burrough, Vanity Fair, January 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Jossy Mansur died on October 15, 2016 in Colombia.&lt;ref name=jossy151016&gt;[http://www.24ora.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=114382%3Aprensa-arubano-ta-di-luto-periodista-jossy-mansur-donjo-di-diario-a-fayece Prensa Arubano ta di luto: Periodista Jossy Mansur donjo di Diario a fayece], 24ora.com, October 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kkc-curacao.com/noticiacla-bekend-journalist-en-eigenaar-diario-jossy-mansur-overleden/comment-page-1/ |title=Bekend journalist en eigenaar Diario, Jossy Mansur overleden |language=Dutch |publisher=Knipselkrant Curacao |date=16 October 2016 |accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
As a writer, editor and translator Mansur has been variously involved in a number of publications over a 35-year period ranging from an English–Papiamento dictionary to a History of Aruba to psychological historical romance and fiction, to Aruban republications and Papiamento translations of classics of English and world literature such as Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Hans Christian Andersen and Alexandre Dumas.  While the quality of work varies, Mansur's eclectic interests may provide more psychological insight into him.  While he is rumored to have made liberal use of ghost writers and editors,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Mansur's literary aspirations are undeniable, documenting both Aruban social and cultural history and keeping the linguistic aspirations of Papiamento alive through both linguistic editorial and translation work.

==History==
{{further|History of Nepal|Kingdom of Nepal}}

The Kingdom of Nepal was founded on 25 September 1768 by [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] king who succeeded in [[Unification of Nepal|unifying]] the kingdoms of [[Kathmandu]], [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Patan]], and [[Bhaktapur]] into a single state under his [[Shah dynasty]]. The Kingdom of Nepal was ''de jure'' an [[absolute monarchy]] for most of its history. However, from 1846 until the [[Revolution of 1951]], the country was ''de facto'' ruled by the hereditary [[List of Prime Ministers of Nepal|Prime Ministers]] from the [[Rana dynasty]], reducing the role of the Shah monarch to that of a [[figurehead]]. In November 1990, after the [[People's Movement I (1990)|Jana Andolan]] movement, the new [[Constitution of Nepal|Constitution]] was adopted and the country became a [[constitutional monarchy]].

On 13 February 1996, the [[Nepalese Civil War]] was launched by the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], with the aim of overthrowing the kingdom and establishing a "People's Republic". On 1 February 2005, as the security situation deteriorated in the civil war, King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] declared a [[state of emergency]], suspended the Constitution and assumed direct control over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff writer | title=Nepal's king declares emergency | date=2005-02-01 | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4224855.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2006, after the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|Loktantra Andolan]] movement, the king agreed to give up absolute power and to reinstate the dissolved [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sengupta | first=Somini | title=In a Retreat, Nepal's King Says He Will Reinstate Parliament | date=25 April 2006 | publisher=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/world/asia/25nepal.html?hp&amp;ex=1146024000&amp;en=8fe71bf94d2a73c8&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title=Full text: King Gyanendra's speech | date=24 April 2006 | publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4940876.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2006, the Civil War ended with the signing of the [[Comprehensive Peace Accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peace deal ends Nepal's civil war |publisher=BBC News |date=21 November 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6169746.stm |accessdate=22 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January 2007, the King was suspended from exercising his duties by the newly formed [[Interim legislature of Nepal|interim legislature]]. Finally, on 28 May 2008, the kingdom was officially abolished by the [[1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly|1st Constituent Assembly]] and [[Nepal|Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal]] was declared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7424302.stm Nepal votes to abolish monarchy]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of subnational monarchs|subnational monarchies]] in [[Upper Mustang|Mustang]], [[Bajhang District|Bajhang]], [[Salyan District, Nepal|Salyan]], and [[Jajarkot District|Jajarkot]] were also abolished in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/08/content_10167598.htm Abolishment of subnational monarchies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==
[[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] was the first ruler of "unified" [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]]. However, prior to 1768, the modern-day Nepal consisted of various small kingdoms, among which Shah Kings continued to rule in a few of them (notably in [[Gurkha|Gorkha]]). So the actual history of the [[Shah dynasty]] dates much before Prithvi Narayan Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoclub.com.np/nepal/history |title=The History of Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816173643/http://www.infoclub.com.np/nepal/history/ |archivedate=2009-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Masculinity]], [[femininity]] and ''"ghenos"'' or [[Kinship|lineage]] linked to legendary progenitors were fundamental concepts of [[family]] identity in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Ancient Greek]] eras. The Greeks demonstrated the principles of family functionality in the mythological lives of [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Hestia]] and [[Hermes]]. These included communal dining, and ''"charis"'' a form of [[Principle of charity|charity]] that Vittoro Cigoli and Eugena Scabini described as being "deployed to oppose the core of violence inherent in the family relationship". Etrusco-Roman culture, developed from the Greek where each ''"gens"'' (family or house) had their own deified hero, prince or demi-god along with various household deities. The expansion of family trees to include heroic or legendary ancestors was used to boost social status and amass personal finances. Rome's patriarchal families, along with later [[Europe]]an dynasties engaged in power struggles, such as that to be elected [[Pope]] based on this change in family culture.&lt;ref name="CigoliScabini2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vittorio Cigoli|author2=Eugenia Scabini|title=Family Identity: Ties, Symbols, And Transitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmip0m4k8y0C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=1 April 2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-0-8058-5231-8|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peoples from all over the world have supposed themselves descended from various different eponymic or mythical progenitors. The [[Italy|Italian]]s claimed ancestry from [[Italus]], [[Lydia]]ns from [[Lydus]], [[Phoenicia]]ns associated with [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], [[Sicily|Sicilian]]s legendary progenitor was [[Siculus]], [[Pelasgians]] revered [[Pelasgus]], [[Dorians]] traced lineage to [[Dorus]], [[Aeolians]] were linked to [[Aeolus]] and [[Hellenes]] looked up to [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]. Legendary progenitors also gave their names to places, [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] was alleged to have been built by [[Menes]] and [[Ninevah]] by [[Ninus]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Taylor|title=Words And Places Or Etymological Illustrations Of History, Ethnology And Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-4rutCY2csC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=30 January 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-7157-2|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later times, [[place name]]s in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were given the names of legendary [[Tribal chief|chief]]tains or [[Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies|Anglo-Saxon King]]s. [[Isaac Taylor]] suggests that "minute fragments of historic truth have been conserved". He notes however that the "greatest caution must be exercised as to the conclusions which we allow ourselves to draw. The traditions are generally vague and obscure and the personages whose names are associated with these sites have often only a mythical, or, to speak technically, an ''eponymic'' existence."&lt;ref name="Taylor2005"/&gt;

==Europe==

In various [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] myths, [[Melampus]] is the "legendary founder and progenitor of a great and long-continued family of [[prophet]]s". Along with his brother [[Bias]], they became kings of territory in the Argeian and was acknowledged as a leader in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]]. His grandson is recorded as the prophet [[Theoklymenos]].&lt;ref name="Esq.1854"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Grote, Esq.|title=History of Greece; I. Legendary Greece, II.

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] discussed how in [[Ancient Rome]], both [[Aeneas]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] and [[Romulus]] were both who said to have been the legendary founders. He considered how people's view of history could be influenced by the preference of one progenitor over another, saying "if whoever examines the building of [[Rome]] takes Aeneas for its first progenitor (primo progenitore), it will be of those cities built by foreigners, while if he takes Romulus it will be of those built by men native to the place". Machiavelli does not take a preference and suggests Rome had "a free beginning, without depending on anyone".&lt;ref name="Benner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Erica Benner|title=Machiavelli's Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IKMh7mCI-MC&amp;pg=PA419|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=26 October 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-14177-0|pages=419–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Míl Espáine]] is recorded in [[Christian]] writings to be the legendary progenitor of the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Gael]]s or [[Goidelic languages|Goidels]].

In 1952 he went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], to read Natural Sciences, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1956; from 1956 to 1959 he worked and studied at the [[University College Hospital]], [[London]], and 1959 was awarded a Medical and Surgery diploma from Cambridge. Peters worked for the [[BBC]] from 1955 to 1968, on their Africa programmes.

While at Cambridge he was elected president of the African Students' Union, and interested himself in [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] politics. He also began writing poetry and plays, as well as starting work on his only novel, ''The Second Round'' (published in 1965). Peters worked in hospitals in [[Guildford]] and [[Northampton]] before returning to the Gambia, where he had a surgical practice in Banjul.

{{Redirect|Andrew Savage|the American rock musician|Parquet Courts}}
''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' is an American [[reality television]] show, based on the Swedish program, ''[[Expedition Robinson]]''. Contestants are referred to as "castaways", and they compete against one another to become the "Sole Survivor" and win one million [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]. First airing in 2000, there have been a total of 36 seasons aired; the program itself has been filmed on five different continents. Most recently, the 36th season, ''[[Survivor: Ghost Island]]'', premiered on February 28, 2018 and concluded on May 23, 2018.

Contestants usually apply to be on the show, but the series has been known to recruit contestants for various seasons. For ''[[Survivor: Fiji]]'', the producers had hoped to have a more racially diverse cast, and hoped that a more diverse group would apply after the success of the racially segregated ''[[Survivor: Cook Islands]]''. When this did not happen, the producers turned to recruiting and in the end, only one contestant had actually submitted an application to be on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Susan|last = Young|title = New 'Survivor: Fiji' divides haves and have-nots "Survivor: Fiji"|url = http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/02/08/new-survivor-fiji-divides-haves-and-have-nots/|work = [[East Bay Times]] |date = 8 February 2007 |accessdate = 4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, contestants are virtually unknown prior to their ''Survivor'' appearance, but occasionally some well-known people are cast.

A total of 536 participants have competed, and 91 of them have competed in multiple seasons: 69 of them competed in two seasons, 18 competed three times, and four competed four times. Eleven seasons have featured returning players: four with all-returnees (''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'' in 2004, ''[[Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains]]'' in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/survivor-heroes-vs-villains-cast-revealed-wbna34739276 |title='Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains' cast revealed |publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |date=6 January 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Survivor: Cambodia]]'' in 2015, and ''[[Survivor: Game Changers]]'' in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2015/05/06/%E2%80%98survivor-second-chance%E2%80%99-invites-viewers-to-select-the-castaways/|title=‘Survivor: Second Chance’ Invites Viewers to Select the Castaways|publisher=Xfinity|first=Gordon|last=Holmes|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; four with two or three returning players, each on a tribe with new players (''[[Survivor: Guatemala]]'' in 2005, ''[[Survivor: Redemption Island]]'' in 2011, ''[[Survivor: South Pacific]]'', also in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = 'Survivor': They're baaaaaaaack!

On two occasions, contestants have been cast but ultimately withdrew before the game began: a 20th contestant, Mellisa McNulty was originally cast in ''[[Survivor: Fiji]]'', but dropped out and returned home the night before the show began because of panic attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivor Bombshell: Fiji's "Babe" Reveals Why She Bailed!|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Rudolph, Ileane|date=2007-02-07|accessdate=2010-11-11|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Survivor-Bombshell-Fijis-37658.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''[[Survivor: San Juan del Sur]]'', the 19th and 20th contestants, sisters So and Doo Kim, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/06/02/survivor-nicaragua-two-contestants-leave/|title='Survivor': Two contestants left show before filming began in Nicaragua -- EXCLUSIVE|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|publisher=EW.com|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the removed contestants were unreplaced. ''Fiji'' and ''San Juan del Sur'' proceeded with an uneven gender balance. This occurrence made ''Fiji'' the only season in the history of the show to have an odd number of players.

==Contestants==
All information is accurate as of the time the season was filmed, and thus may vary from season to season for returning players.

'''Matt Tees''' (born 13 October 1939) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] player.

Originally a [[machinist]] at a [[carpet]] factory, he was discovered while playing for local leagues in [[Scotland]] with  [[Cambuslang Rangers]]. After a spell with [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]], he played for [[Grimsby Town]] (two spells), [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Luton Town]] before ending his career with [[Boston United]] in the [[Northern Premier League]].

==Career==
After beginning his career in the local leagues in [[Scotland]] with [[Cambuslang Rangers]] before joining professional [[Association football|football]] with [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]]. He then joined [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and back to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], during his second spell at Grimsby, Tees was part of the [[1971–72 in English football|1971–72]] team that won the [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.football.co.uk/snapshot_tables/1971_1972/2/may/grimsby_town/index.shtml |title=Historical league tables |publisher=Stats.football.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A sea of 23,000 fans"/&gt;

A 2017 [[BBC]] documentary on [[dementia]] among retired footbllers included a visit to Tees' family home, where it was confirmed he had an advanced stage of the condition; it was suggested that the cause may be the high number of times he headed the ball during his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/11/12/alan-shearer-dementia-football-review-impassioned-thoughtful1/|title=Alan Shearer: Dementia, Football and Me review – an impassioned and thoughtful documentary |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 November 2017|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naser al-Din Shah Qajar'''&lt;ref&gt;''Naser al-Din'' is pronounced as ''Nāser-ad'din'', and less formally as ''Nāser-ed'din''.&lt;/ref&gt; (16 July 1831 – 1 May 1896) ({{lang-fa|ناصرالدین شاه قاجار}}), also '''Nassereddin Shah Qajar''', was the [[King]] of [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] from 5 September 1848 to 1 May 1896 when he was assassinated. He was the son of [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] and [[Malek Jahan Khanom, Mahd-e Olia|Malek Jahān Khānom]] and the third longest reigning monarch in Iranian history after [[Shapur II]] of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] and [[Tahmasp I]] of the [[Safavid Dynasty]]. Nasser al-Din Shah had sovereign power for close to 50 years and was also the first modern Iranian monarch to formally visit Europe.

==Reign==

===Effectiveness of his early rule===
The state under Naser Al-Din was the recognized government of Iran but its authority was undermined by local tribal leaders. The religious and tribal chieftains held quite a bit of autonomy over their communities. Naser Al-Din was not effective in implementing his sovereignty over his people. Local groups had their own militias and oftentimes did not obey laws passed by the monarchy since they did not have the power to enforce them. The people followed the ulama's fatwas instead of state issued law. When Naser Al-Din took power, his army barely had 3,000 men which was significantly smaller than the armies under various tribal leaders. When the state needed a proper army, he would hire the local militias.&lt;ref&gt;William Cleveland, A History of the Modern Middle East, 5th edition (Westview, 2012) pg.100&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his reforms, Naser's government had very little power over their subjects and even during the reforms, they faced more scrutiny over their ability to implement those reforms successfully.

===Diplomacy and wars===
Naser al-Din was in [[Tabriz]] from [[Qajars (tribe)|Qajars tribe]] when he heard of his father's death in 1848 {{what|date=August 2017}}, and he ascended to the [[Sun Throne]] with the help of [[Amir Kabir]].

Naser al-Din had early [[reformist]] tendencies, but was dictatorial in his style of government. With his sanction, some Babis were killed after an attempt on his life.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Amanat. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-xt4WkT4WIC&amp;dq Pivot of the universe: Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar and the Iranian Monarchy], pp. 204–218.&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment continued under his prime minister Amir Kabir, who even ordered the execution of  the [[Báb]] – regarded as a manifestation of God to [[Bábism|Bábí's]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], and to historians as the founder of the [[Bábism|Bábí religion]].

Unable to regain the territory in the [[Caucasus]] [[Russo-Persian Wars|irrevocably lost]] to [[Russia]] in the early 19th century, Naser al-Din sought compensation by seizing [[Herāt, Afghanistan]], in 1856. [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] regarded the move as a threat to [[British India]] and [[Anglo-Persian War|declared war on Persia]], forcing the return of Herāt as well as Persia's recognition of the kingdom of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403828/Naser-al-Din-Shah Article from Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Naser al-Din was the first modern Persian monarch to visit Europe in 1873 and then again in 1878 (when he saw a [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Royal Navy Fleet Review]]), and finally in 1889 and was reportedly amazed with the technology he saw. During his visit to the United Kingdom in 1873, Naser al-Din Shah was appointed by Queen Victoria a Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]], the highest English order of chivalry. He was the first Persian monarch to be so honoured. His travel diary of his 1873 trip has been published in several languages, including Persian, German, French, and Dutch.

[[File:Naser al-Din Shah by Abul Hasan Ghaffari 1854.jpg|thumb|Naser al-Din Shah by [[Sani ol molk|Abul Hasan Ghaffari]], 1854]]
In 1890 Naser al-Din met British major [[Gerald F. Talbot]] and signed a [[contract]] with him giving him the ownership of the Persian [[tobacco]] industry, but he later was forced to cancel the contract after [[Ayatollah]] [[Mirza Hassan Shirazi]] issued a [[Fatwā|fatwa]] that made farming, trading, and consuming tobacco [[haram]] (forbidden). Consuming tobacco from the newly monopolized 'Talbet' company represented foreign exploitation, so for that reason it was deemed immoral. It even affected the Shah's personal life as his wives did not allow him to smoke.

This was not the end of Naser al-Din's attempts to give concessions to Europeans; he later gave the ownership of Persian customs incomes to [[Paul Julius Reuter]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Reforms===
Most of Naser al-Din's modernizing reforms happened during the prime ministership of [[Amir Kabir]]. He defeated various rebels in Iranian provinces, most notably in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], balanced the budget by introducing reforms to the tax system, curbed the power of the [[clergy]] in the judiciary, built some military factories, improved relations with other powers to curb British and Russian influence opened the first newspaper called Vaghaye-Ettefaghieh, embellished and modernized cities by building for example the Tehran Bazaar and most importantly opened the first Iranian school for upper education called the [[Dar ol-Funun]] where many Iranian intellectuals received their education. However Amir Kabir's reforms were unpopular with some people and Naser al-Din Shah first exiled him and then ordered his assassination.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Shah gradually lost interest for reform. However, he took some important measures such as introducing [[telegraphy]] and [[post office|postal]] services and building roads. He also increased the size of the state's military and created a new group called the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]]&lt;ref&gt;William Cleveland, A History of the Modern Middle East, 5th edition (Westview, 2012) pg.103&lt;/ref&gt; which was trained and armed by the Russians. He was the first Persian to be photographed and was a patron of [[photography]] who had himself photographed hundreds of times. His final prime minister was [[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan|Ali Asghar Khan]], who after the shah's assassination aided in securing the transfer of the throne to [[Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar al-Din]].

Although he was successful in introducing these western based reforms, he was not successful in gaining complete sovereignty over his people or getting them to accept these reforms. The school he opened, Dar al-Funun, had very small enrollment numbers. The restriction's defined by Sh'ia Islam on the shah's collection of the ''zakat'' led to those funds going straight into the coffers of the ulama. Therefore, the financial autonomy given to the ulama enabled them to remain structurally independent, keeping madrasahs open and supporting the students therein.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L. "A History of the Modern Middle East" (Westview Press, 2013) pg 104&lt;/ref&gt; The ulama also maintained their authority to challenge state law. To fund these new institutions and building projects, Naser repeatedly used [[tax farming]] to increase state revenue. Unfortunately, tax collectors routinely abused their power and the government was viewed as corrupt and unable to protect them from abuse by the upper class. This anti-government sentiment increased the ulama's power over the people because they were able to provide them security. Keddie states in her book, ''Roots of Revolution: An Interpretive History of Modern Iran'', that at the time "it was still considered a sign of greater status to be admitted to the ranks of the ulama than it was to become a member of the civil service."&lt;ref&gt;William Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', 5th edition (Westview, 2012) pg 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852 Naser al-Din dismissed and executed [[Amir Kabir]], the famous Persian reformer. With him, many believe, died the prospect of an independent Persia led by meritocracy rather than nepotism.

[[File:The Shah and the British Royal Family.jpg|thumb|The Shah on his European tour, seated with British and Russian royalty in the Royal Albert Hall, London]]
In the later years of his rule, however, Naser al-Din steadfastly refused to deal with the growing pressures for reforms. He also granted a series of concessionary rights to foreigners in return for large payments. In 1872, popular pressure forced him to withdraw one concession involving permission to construct such complexes as [[railway]]s and [[irrigation]] works throughout Persia. In 1890, he granted a 50-year concession on the purchase, sale, and processing of all tobacco in the country, which led to a national [[boycott]] of tobacco and the withdrawal of the concession. This last incident is considered by many authorities to be the origin of modern [[Iranian nationalism]].

==Assassination==
Naser al-Din was assassinated by [[Mirza Reza Kermani]], a follower of [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], when he was visiting and praying in the shrine of [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine|Shah-Abdol-Azim]]. It is said that the revolver used to assassinate him was old and rusty, and had he worn a thicker overcoat, or been shot from a longer range, he would have survived the attempt on his life.&lt;ref&gt;Mo'ayeri p.105&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, he is reported to have said "I will rule you differently if I survive!" The assassin was prosecuted by the defence minister, Nazm ol Doleh.

Naser al-Din was buried in the [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]], in [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]] near [[Tehran]], where he was assassinated. His funeral took place six months after his death. A British diplomat who spoke with some who had been present, [[Charles Hardinge]], commented "... the corpse was conveyed on a very high funeral car and was 'high' in more ways than one"&lt;ref&gt;"Old Diplomacy" (1947), by Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; (see picture below 'The Shah's funeral'). His one-piece marble tombstone, bearing his full effigy, is now kept in the [[Golestan Palace]] Museum in Tehran.

==Artistic and literary interests==
[[File:Nasser-ed-Din Shah.jpg|thumb|The Shah in a uniform studded with diamonds from the treasury of the Persian emperors. Often he wore the famous square [[Darya-ye Noor]].]]

Naser al-Din Shah was very interested in painting and [[photography]]. He was a talented painter and, even though he had not been trained, was an expert in [[pen and ink]] drawing. Several of his pen and ink drawings survive. He was one of the first  photographers in Persia and was a patron of the art. He established a photography studio in [[Golestan Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahmasbpoor, Mohammad-Reza (2008). ''Nāser-od-din, the Photographer King''. Tehran: Nashr-e Tarikh-e Iran. {{ISBN|964-6082-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naser al-Din was also a [[poetry|poet]]. 200 couplets of his were recorded in the preface of ''Majma'ul Fusahā'', a work by [[Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat]] about poets of the Qajar period. He was interested in history and geography and had many books on these topics in his library. He also knew [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], but was not fluent in either tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Mo'ayeri p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hekāyāt Pir o Javān'' ({{lang|fa|حکایت پیر و جوان}}; "The Tale of the Old and the Young") was attributed to him by many; it was one of the first Persian stories written in modern European style.&lt;ref&gt;Mansuri, Kurosh(2006). ''Hekāyāte Pir Va Javān''. Tehran: Motale'at Tarikh. {{ISBN|964-6357-69-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote the book [[Diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia during his tour through Europe in A.D. 1873]].

'''Neshedil Kadinefendi''' ({{Lang-tr|Neşedil Kadınefendi}})({{Lang-ar|نشئة دل فادين افندی}})({{circa}} 1857 - 30 January 1924) was a consort to [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Egypt]].

==Early life==
Born in 1857 in [[Caucasus]], Neshedil was a [[Georgians|Georgian]], whose early childhood had been spent in the mountains. Disaster overtook the clan when Neshedil was aged seven. She along with her brother were captured during the raid and were sold to a slave dealer. He took them to [[Istanbul]], where they were separated, and she never again saw or heard of her brother. She herself was brought by the wife of a pasha, who educated her according to the custom of the time. The child was kindly treated, received careful religious instruction, and was taught to read but not to write, as the latter accomplishment might have been an inducement to her pen love letters. She also became an accomplished needlewoman and learned to make the finest lace, oya, and embroidery.

==Life with the Khedive==
At fifteen she was sold to the Khedive Ismail and went to Egypt. Together with other young Circassians she spent a year in the Guezireh Palace, being trained for a life for court, and was named Neshedil (meaning "joy of soul"). She was about sixteen Khedive Ismail gave her a separate establishment in the [[Zaafarana palace|Zaaferan Palace]], with fifty Circassian and thirty Abyssinian slaves of her own. Her clothes, lingerie, and house linen were ordered from Paris. After she had settled in her new surroundings, the Khedive said that it was time for her to go and visit his senior wives at the [[Abdeen Palace|Abdin Palace]]. Trembling inwardly, she went dressed in the finest Brussels lace over a pale blue satin, with a necklace and earrings of rubies and diamonds. Outwardly she maintained her composure and her radiant beauty caused a sensation. Neither of them had expected so much grace and loveliness. 

Ismail's unflagging devotion to her raised such a storm of jealousy that after the birth of her second child, during one of her visits to Abdin, she was served with poisoned coffee. Feeling desperately ill, Neshedil hurried home, nearly dying on the way. The efforts to save her were successful. She slowly came back to life, but never to her former health. After giving birth to a premature son, she was debarred from having other children. Neshedil Kadin Effendi never mentioned names and disliked to talk about the incident. Ismail was so enraged that he made over to her name the title deeds of the Insha and small Ismailieh Palaces, a gift such as he had never made to any of his former wives, and offered her a set of diamonds, comprising a tiara, with matching earrings, necklace, brooch, belt, bracelets, and rings. He also advised her never again to take food or drink outside her own house. Contrary to his expectations, on receiving his gift Neshedil burst into tears, fell on her knees, and implored him not to give her anything that might cause further jealousy. She firmly refused the jewels, and only when threatened with the Khedive's displeasure reluctantly accepted the palaces. In Zaaferan Palace two daughter had been born to her, Emina Aziza, in 1874, and Nimetullah, in 1875, both in September.

When Hoshyar Kadinefendi died in 1885, Neshedil and her daughters went to Naples to rejoin the Khedive Ismail. Four years later, in 1889, the whole family sailed to Emirgan, on the [[Bosphorus]] near Istanbul. At Emirgan Neshedil, Princess Emina Aziza and Princess Nimetullah occupied the yali on the Tokmakburnu promontory, one of the seven buildings on Ismail's estate. He himself lived in the largest of four yalis, the other houses being at the disposal of his married sons and daughters, who came to visit him during the warm season. 

==Later years==
[[File:Tomb of Nehedil Kadin.JPG|thumb|The tomb of Neshedil Kadinefendi]]
The Khedive's death in 1895 caused Neshedil, whose health had deteriorated after months of sick nursing, to fall seriously ill. She eventually recovered, but remained an invalid for the rest of her life. Henceforth she dedicated herself entirely to her daughters and, later, to her grandchildren. After both daughters were married and settled in their own homes, she used to live with either one or the other, but chiefly with the elder, who needed her companionship more. She traveled a great deal on the European continent, with one or both of her daughters, to various spas or towns famous for their doctors, notably in [[Switzerland]]. She and her daughter Emina were always under doctor's orders, seeking the health which eluded them.

==Death and burial==
Neshedil Kadinefendi died in [[Nice]], [[France]], on 30 January 1924, and was buried at the Khedival Mausoleum, [[Al-Rifa'i Mosque]], [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. Neshedil's tomb sits in the center of the mausoleum flanked by the tombs of her two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egy-plus.com/cemeteries/page14.php THE FORGOTTEN CAIRO MAUSOLEUMS]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nina en Frederik van Pallandt (1967).jpg|thumb|Nina and Frederik in Amsterdam, making a TV show (13 April 1967)]]
'''Nina &amp; Frederik''' were a Danish – Dutch [[traditional popular music|popular]] singing [[duet (music)|duo]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"/&gt; Their repertoire consisted of a blend of [[folk music]], [[calypso music|calypso]]s and standards.&lt;ref name="sleeve"&gt;Sleeve notes of album ''Nina &amp; Frederik'' – MFP 1401, by Verity Stevens&lt;/ref&gt; The duo consisted of [[Frederik, Baron van Pallandt|Frederik van Pallandt]] and his wife at the time, [[Nina van Pallandt]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"/&gt;

==History==
Nina &amp; Frederik began singing together at the age of four, but since Frederik's father was the Dutch ambassador to Denmark, his family soon moved to [[Trinidad]] and Frederik eventually began to study at the university, where he formed a Calypso band. During this time he kept writing to Nina, and in 1957 they met again at her parents' home where one evening he played his guitar for her. To his surprise Nina began singing to it, and it was at that moment that they decided to sing together. Originally they sang only for their friends, and occasionally at house parties. This led to them being asked to perform at charity shows, and soon they were in demand professionally. On 1 July 1957, the duo made their professional show business debut in Copenhagen's top night club, Mon Coeur. Within a matter of months they became favourites throughout Europe, and also starred in the 1958 Danish singing-themed comedy ''[[The Richest Girl in the World (1958 film)|The Richest Girl in the World]]''. The couple married in September 1960 and, in 1961, had their own series on British Television, ''Nina and Frederik at Home''.&lt;ref name="sleeve"/&gt;

Their earliest known single was "[[Jamaica Farewell]]"/"Come Back Liza", both calypso songs, issued in 1959 on Pye International 7N 25021, but showing a 1957 'recording first published' date.

Their debut album, ''Nina &amp; Frederik'', charted at number 9 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/musik/dkmusiknyt/article1018003.ece|title=Alphabeats album på top 10 i England|publisher=Ekstrabledet.dk|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their second collection, also entitled ''Nina &amp; Frederik'' but with a different selection of songs, peaked at number 11 in the UK [[record chart|chart]] in May 1961.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

In 1963 they spent three weeks performing at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and in December of the same year they gave a concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], and made guest appearances on the panel of ''[[Juke Box Jury]]''.&lt;ref name="sleeve"/&gt; In 1966 they recorded a live album "An evening with Nina &amp; Frederik at the Albert Hall". (Columbia SX 6077)

Shunning the limelight, Frederik insisted the duo retire shortly thereafter, and the couple eventually divorced in 1976.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

'''Filippo Buondelmonti degli Scolari''' (1369 – December 1426), known as '''Pippo Spano''',{{Cref2|a}} was an [[Italians|Italian]] magnate, general, strategist and confidant of King [[Sigismund of Hungary]], born in the [[Republic of Florence]]. The personal friend of Sigismund and member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], he was buried in the [[Székesfehérvár Basilica]] beside the Hungarian kings.

==Early career==
Filippo, the son of a destitute [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, was born at [[Tizzano]], near [[Florence]]. He is first mentioned in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] around 1382, when he entered the service of Sigismund's [[Royal treasurer (Kingdom of Hungary)|treasurer]] and was awarded the castle in [[Simontornya]] (''Simonsthurm'').

Further services to the Crown, such as providing resources to fight the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], led to his appointment as administrator of all gold mines in the kingdom. Present in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], in the context of a Hungarian nobles' rebellion and [[List of rulers of Bosnia|King]] [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]]'s death (1391), Pippo managed to subdue the main leaders of the revolt.

He took part in the unfortunate anti-Ottoman [[Last Crusade]] of September 1396 at [[Battle of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]] in  [[Bulgaria]], and, unlike most on the Christian side, managed to flee after the defeat. He, the King, and a number of high dignitaries sailed a small boat up the [[Danube]], all the way to Hungarian and Croatian lands.

He married Barbara, daughter and heir of Andrew of [[Ozora]], in 1398.

During the new period of trouble with the claim to the throne of [[Charles III of Naples|Charles II]]'s son [[Ladislaus of Naples]], Lo Scolari exposed acts of treason on the part of some noblemen. He was however forced to give in to most of their demands, as the King was taken prisoner in [[Visegrád]] Castle (1401).

After Sigismund reasserted control briefly, the nobles openly recognized Ladislaus as King. The forces of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] took [[Zadar]] in 1403, and Pippo had to retreat; the same year, he regained [[Veszprém]] and, in September, took [[Esztergom]] and again raided Bosnia - breaking up contacts between Sicilian and rebel armies and forcing the invaders to flee. He persuaded the rebels to seek Sigismund's pardon.

While in [[Vienna]], Pippo was made Count of [[Timișoara|Temesvár (Timișoara)]]. In this capacity, he initiated the building of the Hungarian border castle system to contain the Ottoman aggression; immediately, Pippo started confronting the Turks, but also moving against the [[History of Bosnia|Bosnian]] armies of [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]] that had been besieging the town of [[Šibenik]] in Dalmatia, regaining parts of today's Croatia.

==In Italy==
In 1408, Pippo became the [[Banat of Severin|Ban of Szörény]] and member of the prestigious [[Order of the Dragon]]; by that time, he had become wealthy and powerful. In 1410, Sigismund sent him to persuade [[Italian city-states]] to cut off their links with [[Naples]]: he traveled in great pomp to his native [[Florence]], then to [[Ferrara]] (meeting [[Niccolò III d'Este]]). In August, he was received by [[Pisa]]n [[Antipope John XXIII]]. In September, present in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], Pippo is said to have backed a conspiracy.

As part of the anti-Venetian campaign of 1411, Lo Scolari entered [[Friuli]] at the head of an army, conquered [[Aquileia]] and, in December, he took [[Udine]] and several fortresses in [[Emilia-Romagna|Romagna]], then [[Vittorio Veneto]] - capturing a high official from the [[Barbarigo family]]. In January 1412, the renewed attack ensured Pippo a supply of high-ranking Venetian prisoners, whom he ordered mutilated to avenge a Hungarian killed by the enemy.

He suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Motta (1412)|Battle of Motta]] in August 1412 against the [[Venetian Republic]] under [[Carlo Malatesta]].&lt;ref name=PPA&gt;{{cite book|title=The Papal State under Martin V |first=Peter |last=Partner |year=1958 |place=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pippo intended to besiege [[Padua]] in January, but he could not maintain his army on the spot, and moved towards the [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], in [[Cartigliano]] and [[Marostica]], leading an unsuccessful attack on [[Vicenza]]. Further failures provoked his retreat to Friuli, and then to Hungary, in February. This outcome made Venetian accounts imply a settlement with the Most Serene Republic, and even the mythical execution of Pippo as revenge by the Emperor King (he supposedly had molten gold poured down his throat).

Lo Scolari returned to Friuli in September, in order to aid Florence against Ladislaus' troops. At [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] (in [[Lombardy]]), he attended the meeting between Sigismund and the ruler of the city, [[Giovanni da Vignate]].

==Later assignments==
 [[Image:Szeged-ozoraipipo.jpg|thumb|200px|Pippo in [[Székesfehérvár]] pantheon]]
Pippo took part in the March 1414 initial proceedings of the [[Council of Constance]], where the Emperor King charged him with guarding John XXIII - an assignment he did not fully accomplish, as the Antipope soon managed to flee. In 1415, the Count of Temesvár witnessed the rebel [[Jan Hus]]' execution in [[Konstanz]].

He fought the Turks again in 1417 in [[Wallachia]], in 1418 around [[Belgrade]], and in 1419 in Bosnia (where he agreed to a five-year truce); the King Emperor awarded him Severin, [[Mehadia]] and [[Orşova]]. He was called to [[Bohemia]], where he dealt with the [[Hussite Wars|Hussite insurrection]] from 1420 (see [[Battle of Vítkov Hill]]), being severely beaten by [[Jan Žižka]] at [[Havlíčkův Brod]] (see [[Battle of Německý Brod]]), in January 1422.

The rumor that Pippo had been killed in Bohemia led to an Ottoman attack in Wallachia against his ally [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]]. Prompted by requests from [[Stefan Lazarević]], he moved into Serbia and won a large-scale battle. However, he soon suffered a [[stroke]] and remained impaired, being carried away to [[Petrovaradin]].

He was buried in [[Székesfehérvár]], next to the tombs of Hungarian Kings. His funeral was attended by King Sigismund himself.

==Legacy==
He was enumerated in South Slavic epic poetry, known as "Filip the Magyar ([[Hungarian people|Hungarian]])" ({{lang-sr|Филип Мађарин}}, {{lang-bg|Филип Маджарин}}).

==Annotations==

{{Cnote2|a| His short name was Filippo Scolari. He was commonly known under his lifetime as "Pippo Spano". He is known in Hungarian historiography as '''Pipo of Ozora''' ({{lang-hu|Ozorai Pipó}}).}}

'''Richard Felix''' (born 23 February 1949) is an [[English people|English]] [[paranormal investigator]] from [[Stanley, Derbyshire]] most noted for his appearances on [[Sky Living|Living TV]]'s ''[[Most Haunted]]'' series.

==Biography==
Felix was born on 23 February 1949 in [[Derby]].&lt;ref name="Coventry1"&gt;{{cite news   | last = McMullen  | first = Marion   | coauthors =  | title = Ready for some spooky goings-on?  | newspaper = Coventry Telegraph  | location = | pages =  | publisher =  | date = 19 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of record dealers, he left school at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Coventry1"/&gt; At 19 he was diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]] but recovered from the disease.&lt;ref name="Coventry1"/&gt;

Felix was a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] with the 3rd [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters]], the President of Derby Chamber of Trade, the chairman of the Derby Tourism Association and President of the Edward Stuart Society.&lt;ref name="Coventry1"/&gt; He has stated that his life's goal is to definitely discover what [[ghosts]] are.&lt;ref name="Coventry1"/&gt;

==Work==
From the mid-1960s  until 1980 Felix ran a record stall in Derby's Guildhall Market. Since 1981 Felix has been delivering ghost tours around Derby every [[Halloween]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Butler  | first = Rachel  | coauthors =  | title = Six spooky walks will hunt out ghosts and ghouls on Halloween  | newspaper = Derby Evening Telegraph  | location = | pages = 19  | publisher =  | date = 19 September 2011   }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been campaigning during this time to set up an exhibition centre in Queen Street, Derby, at the old clockworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Time challenge for ghost-hunter Felix  | newspaper = Derby Evening Telegraph  | location = | pages = 1  | publisher =  | date = 29 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby1"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Green  | first = Kirsty  | coauthors =  | title = Ghost-hunter wants to take visitors on trip back in time at former clockworks  | newspaper = Derby Evening Telegraph  | location = | pages = 5  | publisher =  | date = 29 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Felix is quoted as saying that there is "barely a corner [of Derby] which shouldn't have a [[blue plaque]] on it."&lt;ref name="Derby1"/&gt; He hopes to use the now abandoned warehouse as an exhibition of Derby's past, both paranormal and otherwise.&lt;ref name="Derby1"/&gt;

In 2011 Felix toured the country with [[Glasgow]]'s medium Chris Conway in the ''Psychic &amp; Science show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Ghosthunter Richard joins paranormal show  | newspaper = Derby Evening Telegraph  | location = | pages = 37  | publisher =  | date = 7 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Expect the unexpected at show  | newspaper = Gravesend Reporter  | location = | pages = ENF  | publisher =  | date = 22 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix appeared on ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' in August 2014, with his wife Julia, finishing second in a competition against two other Derby-area couples.

'''Rudy Garcia-Tolson''' (born September 14, 1988)&lt;ref name="Team USA bio" /&gt; is a Paralympic swimmer, runner and triathlete from the USA.

He was born with [[popliteal pterygium syndrome]], resulting in a [[club foot]], webbed fingers on both hands, a [[cleft lip and palate]] and the inability to straighten his legs. As a 5 year old wheelchair user, after 15 operations, he decided he would rather be a double [[amputee]] and walk with prosthetics. He had both legs removed above the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ironman.com/triathlon-news/articles/2009/10/rudy-garcia-tolson-athlete.aspx |title=Lee Gruenfeld profiles the amazing Rudy Garcia-Tolson |publisher=ironman.com |accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triathlon.competitor.com/2009/04/features/amputee-rudy-garcia-tolson-begins-kona-quest-at-2009-wildflower_410 |title=Amputee Rudy Garcia-Tolson begins Kona quest at Wildflower |publisher=Triathlete magazine |year=2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
