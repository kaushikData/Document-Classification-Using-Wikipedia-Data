Starman is the largest cable television company in Estonia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/10/cnbc-launches-on-starman-in-estonia.html "CNBC launches on Starman in Estonia"], [[CNBC]], July 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Baltic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-457005978.html "Starman and Nokia to Deploy First Nationwide 10-Gigabit Residential Network in Europe"], ''Fiber Optics Weekly Update'', June 10, 2016 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Starman was founded in 1992 by Peeter Kern and Indrek Kuivallik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aripaev.ee/uudised/2016/05/10/starmani-asutaja-ostis-senise-suurosaniku-valja|title=Starmani asutaja ostab senise suurosaniku välja|date=10 May 2016|work=Äripäev|language=et-EE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peeter Kern served as the company's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] until his unexpected death in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aripaev.ee/uudised/2014/03/11/lahkus-starmani-asutaja-peeter-kern|title=Ootamatult lahkus Starmani asutaja Peeter Kern|date=11 March 2014|work=Äripäev|language=et-EE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pluss.postimees.ee/2724852/suri-starmani-asutaja-ja-juht-peeter-kern|title=Suri Starmani asutaja ja juht Peeter Kern|last=Inselberg|first=Kadri|date=12 March 2014|work=Postimees|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Swedish investment company East Capital Explorer bought 51% of Starman's shares from the company's founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.postimees.ee/1223352/east-capital-explorer-buys-majority-stake-in-starman|title=East Capital Explorer buys majority stake in Starman|date=3 May 2013|work=Postimees|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Starman bought the Lithuanian telecommunications company Cgates, with funds from the majority shareholder East Capital Explorer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-394354500.html "East Capital Unveils Acquisition of Cgates in Lithuania"], ''SeeNews Nordic'', December 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Lithuanian branch was again separated in a later acquisition.

In March 2016, East Capital Explorer intended to sell its 63% share to American investment firm [[Providence Equity Partners]] for €81 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.postimees.ee/3619555/swedes-sell-starman-to-americans "Swedes sell Starman to Americans"], ''[[Postimees]]'', March 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but Starman's minority shareholder Polaris Invest (owned by founder Indrek Kuivallik) used their pre-emptive rights to make the purchase instead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2016/12/14/finlands-elisa-buy-starman/|title=Finland’s Elisa to buy Starman|last=Dziadul|first=Chris|date=14 December 2016|website=Broadband TV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://majandus24.postimees.ee/3849951/kuivalliku-polaris-sai-oiguse-osta-starman|title=Kuivalliku Polaris sai õiguse osta Starman|work=Postimees|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Starman Estonia was wholly acquired by Finnish telecommunications company [[Elisa (company)|Elisa]] for €151 million; this deal did not include the Lithuanian branch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://majandus24.postimees.ee/3944705/elisa-ostab-kuivallikult-starmani|title=Elisa ostab Kuivallikult Starmani|last=Reisenbuk|first=Karel|date=12 December 2016|work=Postimees|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apostolou Pavlou Avenue''' ({{lang-el|Λεωφόρος Αποστόλου Παύλου}}, St. Paul's Avenue) is the busiest road artery in [[Paphos]], Cyprus. I

The avenue connects the city center, [[Ktima]], where the shopping and business district is, with [[Kato Paphos]], by the coast, the tourist and entertainment center of the city. At the medieval port, "limanaki", the avenue is closed for traffic. Limanaki ({{lang-el|Λιμανάκι}}, little port) is the home of small [[Restaurant|restaurants]], [[cafés]], [[Bar|bars]] and small shops and [[Paphos Castle]] dominating the horizon. The last building on to the right is called "en plo" ({{lang-el|Εν πλώ}}, on the water), which used to be an [[art gallery]]. B20 is the official serial number of this Avenue.

The '''Centre for Democracy and Development''' (CDD) was established in the United Kingdom in 1997 and subsequently registered in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1999. The organisation which aims to promote the values of [[democracy]], [[peace]] and [[human rights]] in [[Africa]], particularly in the [[West Africa]]n sub-region.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;

The Centre was established to mobilise global opinion and resources for democratic development and provide an independent space to reflect critically on the challenges posed to the democratization and development processes in West Africa, and also to provide alternatives and best practices to the sustenance of democracy and development in the region.

==History==
The CDD was founded in 1997 in London at a time when Nigeria was under [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–79 and 1983–98|military rule]]. Its first activity was to organize a roundtable discussion on the future of democracy in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Center works on policy-oriented scholarship on   introducing and improving democratic processes, improving economic governance, safety and development throughout Africa.The Centre remains focused on capacity building work, policy analysis and advocacy, and as a research reference point on democratic governance, human security and people-centred development in the region. It has remained a critical bridge building institution between policy makers, civil society activists and academics in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Promoting democratic accountability through election pledge monitoring==
[http://www.buharimeter.ng Buharimeter] project, supported by the [[Open Society Initiative for West Africa]] (OSIWA), tremendously heightened public conversation on holding President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] (PMB), and the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), accountable to over 200 election pledges made in the prelude to the 2015 general elections in the year under review. Sequel to the release of One Year Assessment report, its key findings were referenced in numerous opinion pieces and articles authored by political commentators and scholars. For example, in July 2016, Emmanuel Ugwu, in his article titled ‘Why Buhari Must Watch Buharimeter ’,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; drew the attention of President Buhari to the importance of Buharimeter as a tool for objective assessment of its administration. According to him: ‘Buhari ought to face the mirror of his campaign promises every day of his finite tenure. He should respect the Buharimeter as the reflection of his vows and accomplishments. This will furnish him with the right perspective he needs to secure a befitting legacy.’&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2016/02/07/why-buhari-must-watch-buharimeter-emmanuel-uchenna-ugwu|title=Why Buhari Must Watch Buharimeter By Emmanuel Uchenna Ugwu|date=7 February 2016|website=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buharimeter’s one-year report did provide a synopsis of citizens’ perception on the implications of the actions of the government and also revealed the degree to which Nigerians were aware of campaign promises and the actions carried out to achieve them. Knowledge about existence the of Buharimeter and its findings have taken a global outlook. Aside from highlighting how the initiative was widely reported internationally, Buharimeter is now listed as one of the promise tracking initiatives on the Duke Reporters' Lab.  The one year report was the fifth report released since the launch of the project. Others include 30 days, 60 days, 100 days, 7 months’ and mid-term assessment reports published in July 2017, and can be viewed on Buharimeter reports. By May 2018, President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] will be 3 years in office, the Buharimeter team at the Centre for Democracy and Development is expected to release a third-year report which should score the performance of Nigeria's President after 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buharimeter.ng/http://reporterslab.org/global-fact-checking-up-50-percent/] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/|title=Fact- Checking - Duke Reporters' Lab|website=Reporterslab.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africacheck.org/2015/06/18/buharimeter-tracking-president-buharis-promises/|title=BuhariMeter: Tracking President Buhari’s Promises|date=18 June 2015|website=Africa Check|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15761">{{Taxation}}
'''Controlled foreign corporation''' ('''CFC''') rules are features of an [[income tax]] system designed to limit artificial deferral of tax by using offshore low taxed entities. The rules are needed only with respect to income of an entity that is not currently taxed to the owners of the entity. Generally, certain classes of taxpayers must include in their income currently certain amounts earned by foreign entities they or related persons control.

A set of rules generally defines the types of owners and entities affected, the types of income or investments subject to current inclusion, exceptions to inclusion, and means of preventing double inclusion of the same income. Countries with CFC rules include the United States (since 1962), the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Russia (since 2015),&lt;ref name=klerk&gt;[http://www.klerk.ru/law/articles/405216/ "Закон о контролируемых иностранных компаниях: обзор и комментарий"]&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden, and many others.&lt;!--ref clerk lists: Австралия, Аргентина, Великобритания, Венгрия, Германия, Дания, Израиль, Индонезия, Испания, Италия, Канада, Китай, Мексика, Новая Зеландия, Норвегия, США, Турция, Финляндия, Франция, Швеция, ЮАР, Южная Корея, Япония--&gt; Rules in different countries may vary significantly.

==Motivations==
The tax law of many countries, including the United States, does not tax a shareholder of a corporation on the corporation's income until the income is distributed as a dividend. Prior to U.S. CFC rules, it was common for publicly traded companies in the United States to form foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and shift "portable" income to those subsidiaries. Income shifted included investment income (interest and dividends) and [[passive income]] (rents and royalties), as well as sales and services income involving related parties (see [[transfer pricing]]). U.S. tax on this income was avoided until the tax haven country paid a dividend to the shareholding company. This dividend could be avoided indefinitely by loaning the earnings to the shareholder without actually declaring a dividend. The CFC rules of Subpart F were intended to cause current taxation to the shareholder where income was of a sort that could be artificially shifted or was made available to the shareholder. At the same time, such rules were intended not to interfere with active business income or transactions with unrelated parties.

==Basic mechanisms==

The rules vary, so this paragraph may not exactly describe a particular tax system. However, the features listed are prevalent in most CFC systems. A domestic person who is a member of a foreign corporation (a CFC) that is controlled by domestic members must include in such person's income the person's share of the CFC's subject income. The includible income (often determined net of expenses) generally includes income received by the CFC:

:* From investment or passive sources, including
:** Interest and dividends from unrelated parties,
:** Rents from unrelated parties, and
:** Royalties from unrelated parties;
:* From purchasing goods from related parties or selling goods to related parties where the goods are both produced and for use outside the CFC's country;
:* From performing services outside the CFC's country for related parties; 
:* From non-operating, insubstantial, or passive businesses, or
:* Of a similar nature through lower-tier partnerships and/or corporations.

In addition, many CFC rules treat as a deemed dividend earnings of the CFC loaned by the CFC to domestic related parties. Further, most CFC rules permit exclusion from taxable income of dividends paid by a CFC from earnings previously taxed to members under the CFC rules.

CFC rules may have a threshold for domestic ownership, below which a foreign entity is not considered a CFC. Alternatively or in addition, domestic members of a foreign entity owning less than a certain portion or class of shares may be excluded from the deemed income regime.

==United States Subpart F Rules==

Enacted in 1962, these rules incorporate most of the features of CFC rules used in other countries. Subpart F&lt;ref&gt;[[Internal Revenue Code]], Chapter 1 Subchapter N, Part III, Subpart F, being sections [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_III_50_F.html 951-964], hereafter IRC section xxx. Also see [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_08/26cfr1j_08.html 26 CFR 1.951-1 ''et seq''.].&lt;/ref&gt; was designed to prevent U.S. citizens and resident individuals and corporations from artificially deferring otherwise taxable income through use of foreign entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Deferral of Income Earned Through U.S. Controlled Foreign Corporations - A Policy Study|url = http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/subpartf.pdf|publisher = Office of Tax Policy, [[United States Department of the Treasury]]|date = December 2000|accessdate = 2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules require that:

* A ''U.S. Shareholder''
* of a ''Controlled Foreign Corporation'' ("CFC")

must include in their/its income currently

* Their/its share of Subpart F Income of the CFC and 
* Their/its share of earnings and profits ("E&amp;P") of the CFC that are invested in ''United States Property'',

and further exclude from his/its income any dividends distributed from such previously taxed income.

Each of the italicized terms above is defined:

:* A ''Controlled Foreign Corporation''&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 957(a).&lt;/ref&gt; is any corporation organized outside the U.S. (a foreign corporation) that is more than 50% owned by ''U.S. Shareholders''.
:* A ''U.S. Shareholder'' is any U.S. person (individual or entity) that owns 10% or more of the foreign corporation. Complex rules apply to attribute ownership of one person to another person.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 958.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''United States Property'' specifically includes obligations of or investments in related parties, tangible property with a physical situs in the U.S., and stock of a domestic corporation. It does not include bank deposits or obligations of unrelated persons.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subpart F income includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;IRC sections 953 and 954.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Foreign personal holding company income''' (FPHCI), including dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from alienation of property that produces or could produce such income. Exceptions apply for dividends and interest from related persons organized in the same country as the CFC, active rents and royalties, rents and royalties from related persons in the same country as the CFC, and certain other items.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 954(c).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Foreign base company sales income''' from buying goods from a related party and selling them to anyone or buying goods from anyone and selling them to a related party, where such goods are both made and for use outside the CFC's country of incorporation. A branch rule may cause transfers between a manufacturing branch of a CFC in one country and a sales branch in another country to trigger Subpart F income.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 954(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Foreign base company services income''' from performing services for or on behalf of a related person. A substantial assistance rule can cause services performed for unrelated parties to be treated as performed for or on behalf of a related party.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 954(e).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Foreign base company oil-related income''' from oil activities outside the CFC's country of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 954(g).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Insurance income''' from insurance or annuity contracts related to risks outside the CFC's country of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 953.&lt;/ref&gt;

but it does not include:

:* Items of income which (after considering deductions, etc., under U.S. concepts) were subject to foreign income tax in excess of 90% of the highest marginal U.S. tax rate for the type of shareholder;
:* ''[[De minimis]]'' amounts of Subpart F income in absence of other Subpart F income in the period;
:* Such income if the CFC has a deficit in E&amp;P, in which case it is deferred from recognition until the CFC has positive E&amp;P.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 952.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Any dividend received which is considered paid from amounts previously taxed under Subpart F.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate U.S. shareholders are entitled to a foreign tax credit for their share of the foreign income taxes paid by a CFC with respect to E&amp;P underlying a Subpart F inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 960.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent avoidance of Subpart F, U.S. shareholders of a CFC must recharacterize gain on disposition of the CFC shares as a dividend.&lt;ref&gt;IRC section 1248.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, various special rules apply.

==United Kingdom rules==
Controlled foreign company rules in the UK do not apply to individual shareholders, but otherwise they are similar to the U.S. rules.&lt;ref&gt;[[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]], as amended (hereafter ICTA88), section 747 ''et seq''. See HRMC's International Manual at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM200000.htm INTM20000].&lt;/ref&gt; UK resident companies are subject to a charge for tax on undistributed income of low tax controlled foreign companies of which they are shareholders. Control for this purpose is not a mechanical test, rather one of factual control. However, control is considered to exist if the shareholder (or shareholder group of companies) owns 40% or more of voting interests.&lt;ref&gt;"The test is not a mechanical one based simply on, for example, shareholding or voting rights. The aim is to establish whether a person (or persons) has the power to ensure that the affairs of a company are conducted in accordance with his (or their) wishes." [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM202020.htm INTM202020] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717001251/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM202020.htm |date=2009-07-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A controlled company is a controlled foreign company if it is tax resident outside the UK and it is subject to a charge to tax less than it would have been were it a UK resident company. This is determined by comparing the actual charge to tax to a corresponding UK tax. In computing the corresponding tax, lower UK rates of tax on small companies are considered. Further, there are taken into account certain adjustments to income and fiscal years.

Certain exemptions apply.&lt;ref&gt;ICTA88/S748(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a foreign company will not be considered a controlled foreign company if it meets any of the following tests:
*It is tax resident in a "white list" of countries not considered to be tax havens, as maintained by HMRC,
*The foreign company maintains a policy whereby it distributed 90% or more of its available earnings each year (no longer applicable since 1 July 2009),
*The company qualifies for a De Minimis level of accounting profits being less than £200,000. This level of income has been in place since 1 January 2011. Previously the level was set at £50,000 of profits that would be chargeable to UK corporation tax if the company were UK resident (not necessarily the same as accounting profits).
*The foreign company meets an active business test,
*The foreign company is publicly quoted on a recognized securities exchange, or
*The group meets a no-tax-reduction motive test.

==German rules==
The CFC provisions in Germany (§§ 7-14 AStG, Foreign Tax Act) apply to both individual and corporate shareholders of a controlled foreign company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/astg/ AStG (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Such shareholders must include in their currently taxable income as a deemed dividend their share of passive income if two tests are met:
*German residents control the non-German corporation and
*That corporation is taxed at a rate of less than 25% on the passive income.

Control in this case is ownership by all German residents of more than 50% of the vote or capital of the foreign corporation. Such ownership includes both direct ownership and ownership through related persons. In determining the 50% threshold, all German residents are considered, even those owning very minor amounts.

Passive income is all income which is not active income, as extensively defined. Active income, however, excludes income where there has been substantial assistance by a German related party in earning the income. Active income also excludes all income of a foreign corporation lacking sufficient substance. Generally, passive income resembles U.S. [[foreign personal holding company]] income (discussed above). However, deemed dividends may be exempted under some treaties.

== India ==

The CFC Rules were first introduced in Indian taxation as part of the proposed Direct Tax Code 2010. The CFC provisions was also retained in revised draft of Direct Tax Code, 2013. However, Direct Tax Code is yet to become law in India and consequently, there are no statutory provisions in existing Income Tax Act (Income Tax Act 1961) for the enactment of CFC Rules. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/columns/whether-india-needs-a-controlled-foreign-corporation-regime/story/245025.html|title=Whether India needs a Controlled Foreign Corporation regime|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
[[Japan]] taxes shareholders of foreign corporations where the operation of such corporation results in no or minimal foreign tax. However, there is a waiver where the foreign corporation conducts a substantial business.

New Zealand and Sweden&lt;ref&gt;[https://lagen.nu/1999:1229#L2014:949S14 The white list with exceptions noted in Swedish]&lt;/ref&gt; each have CFC rules, following a "grey list" and a "white list" approach, respectively.

Australia has CFC rules similar to UK rules, but relies more on a "white list" of safe countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Other anti-deferral measures==
Several countries have adopted other measures aimed at preventing artificial deferral of passive or investment income. U.S. [[passive foreign investment company|passive foreign investment companies]] (PFICs) require that shareholders in foreign [[mutual fund]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s must include in their current taxable income their share of ordinary income and capital gains, or face a tax-and-interest regime.

==Avoiding CFC status==
Under U.S. tax rules, a foreign entity may be classified for U.S. tax purposes as a corporation or a [[flow-through entity]] somewhat independently of its classification for foreign purposes. Under these "[[check-the-box]]" rules, shareholders may be able to elect to treat their shares income, deductions, and taxes of a foreign corporation as earned and paid by themselves. This permits U.S. individuals to obtain credits for foreign taxes paid by entities they own, which credits might otherwise not be available.

Artificial arrangements to avoid CFC status may be ignored in some jurisdictions under legislative provisions or court-developed law, such as [[substance over form]] doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM202020.htm INTM 202020] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717001251/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM202020.htm |date=2009-07-17 }} quoted above.&lt;/ref&gt;

European civil law may provide opportunities for formalistic agreements whereby practical control is maintained but formal definitions of control are not met.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">The '''Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Ecosystem Monitoring Programme''' (abbreviated '''CEMP''') is a program set up in 1985 by the [[Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] to monitor and record fishing and harvesting of marine life in and around [[Antarctica]].

The goals are to:
"(1) detect and record significant changes in critical components of the marine ecosystem within the Convention Area, to serve as a basis for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources; and
(2) distinguish between changes due to harvesting of commercial species and changes due to environmental variability, both physical and biological."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aad.gov.au/apa/cemp/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025213718/http://www.aad.gov.au/apa/cemp/index.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites==
The CEMP includes several sites, located in three "Integrated Study Regions" as well as a network of additional sites. Two sites are additionally set up for special protection, they are [[Seal Island, South Shetland Islands|Seal Island]] and [[Cape Shirreff]]; both are located in the [[South Shetland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aad.gov.au/apa/cemp/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025213718/http://www.aad.gov.au/apa/cemp/index.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permits are required for entry within the CEMP program areas.

==Information about the fortress==
The site is located in the river valley of ''Apa Grădiștei''. The superior plateau of the hill where it`s situated is 514 m above the sea level. It was a strong fortress which had a defensive role. It`s being told that it had a civil settlement at the base and it was the regular residence of the Transylvanian dacian kings. Another important role was also the guarding of the road to  [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]].

'''''Dada Boat''''' is a television programme that shows daily on [[Original Black Entertainment TV]] (OBE). It has some similarities to ''[[Taxi Driver (TV programme)|Taxi Driver]]'', another popular Ghanaian programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doku |first=Francis |url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/391/3/dada-boat-series-starts-today.html |title="Dada Boat" Series Starts Today |publisher=ModernGhana.com |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The story is set in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], where a young man named Dada Boat, played by [[Mikki Osei Berko]], is involved in various comical situations and scams. The comedy in ''Dada Boat'' arises from his attempt to imitate African-American [[hip-hop culture]], which is somewhat frowned upon by the Ghanaian locals. He is often seen wearing various items of jewellery and in particular, a large chain. His best friend is Hotman, another character in the programme. Although the story is fictional, it is set in a real life setting, unlike other programmes, which are often recorded on specially made sets. Dada Boat is a relative of the character in ''Taxi Driver'' known as "Master Richard". They are both played by the Ghanaian actor Mikki Osei Berko.

[[File:Dobradinha.jpg|thumb|Dobradinha]]
'''Dobradinha''' is a dish made from a cow's flat white stomach lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brazilian-food.info/recipes/Dobradinha |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201093644/http://www.brazilian-food.info/recipes/Dobradinha |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originated from North of Portugal, where it is called '''dobrada''' or '''tripas'''. Hence, the northern inhabitants are called '''tripeiros''' for their ancestral dishes. It is a traditional dish in Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine.

Its has been the theme of Fernando Pessoa poem, ''Dobradinha à moda do Porto''.

The joke website of the UK [[Tripe Marketing Board]] featured the dish on its series of 2014 World Cup [[recipe cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tmbindustrynews.blogspot.com/2014/06/world-cup-can-boost-tripe-sales.html|title=TMB Industry News: World Cup can boost tripe sales|date=1 June 2014|website=tmbindustrynews.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ekspress''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс'''}}) is a highly flexible [[satellite bus]] designed and manufactured by [[JSC Information Satellite Systems|ISS Reshetnev]].&lt;ref name=gsp-npopmekspress1000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-npopmekspress2000 /&gt; It is an unpressurized bus originally designed for [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]], but that has been adapted for [[medium Earth orbit]] and to [[highly elliptical orbit]]. It has different versions and has been used from civilian communications to [[satellite navigation]].&lt;ref name=rsw-ekspress1000n /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-ekspress2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-glonassk2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-uragank /&gt;

==Platform variations==
The Ekspress bus has two main platforms: the 1000 light to medium version and the 2000, for heavy birds.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt; There was a project for a third platform, the 4000, but it has never been used, yet.&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal052008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-ekspress1000n /&gt;

===Ekspress-1000 Series===
The Ekspress-1000 ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000'''}}) in its different variations offers an platform for small to medium satellites. It is a direct to [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] bus for total spacecraft weights from {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2200|kg|abbr=on}} and having a power production from 3&amp;nbsp;kW to 8&amp;nbsp;kW with a life expectancy of 15 years.&lt;ref name=gsp-npopmekspress1000 /&gt; It is designed for directly stacking up to 3 of the smallest version (Ekspress-1000K) or 2 of the bigger ones.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;

*'''Ekspress-1000K''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000K'''}}): The smallest platform. It is designed for spacecrafts up to {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, with space for {{convert|250|kg|abbr=on}} of payload and up to 3&amp;nbsp;kW of power generation and 1.8&amp;nbsp;kW of heat dissipation. It can be stacked up to three Ekspress-1000K.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal082009 /&gt;
*'''Ekspress-1000H''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000Н'''}}): The middle platform. It is designed for spacecrafts up to {{convert|1900|kg|abbr=on}}, with space for {{convert|500|kg|abbr=on}} of payload and up to 5.6&amp;nbsp;kW of power generation and 3.5&amp;nbsp;kW of heat dissipation. It can be dual stacked with Ekspress-1000K or Ekspress-1000H.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal082009 /&gt;
*'''Ekspress-1000SH''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000SH'''}}): The biggest platform. It is designed for spacecrafts up to {{convert|2200|kg|abbr=on}}, with space for {{convert|700|kg|abbr=on}} of payload and up to 8&amp;nbsp;kW of power generation and 5&amp;nbsp;kW of heat dissipation. It can be dual stacked with an Ekspress-1000K.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal082009 /&gt;
*'''Ekspress-1000HT''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000НТ'''}}): Evolution of the SH platform.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;
*'''Ekspress-1000HTA''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-1000НТА'''}}): Evolution of the HT platform.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;
*'''Ekspress-1000HTV''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс 1000НТВ'''}}): Evolution of the HTA platform.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;

===Ekspress-2000 Series===
The '''Ekspress-2000'''  ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-2000'''}})  is the fruits of the collaboration with [[Thales Alenia Space]] and their [[Spacebus 4000]] experience with the '''Ekspress-1000H'''.&lt;ref name=rsw-ekspress2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal082009 /&gt; It is a big platform for spacecraft massing up to {{convert|3500|kg|abbr=on}}, with space for {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} of payload and up to 14&amp;nbsp;kW of power generation and 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW of heat dissipation. It is, as the rest of the family, a direct to [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] bus and given its size it is not designed to be stacked. It has an expected design life of 15 years.&lt;ref name=jscisspre-20100421istcstcuspain /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-npopmekspress2000 /&gt;

===Ekspress-4000 Series===
The '''Ekspress-4000'''  ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-4000'''}}) is a collaboration with [[Thales Alenia Space]] to mix the best elements of the Ekspress-2000 with the [[Spacebus 4000]].&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal082009 /&gt; It would be a direct to [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] platform for spacecrafts massing up to {{convert|3200|kg|abbr=on}} and having a power production of 14&amp;nbsp;kW with a life expectancy of 15 years. This would enable more than 60 [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] of payload.&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal052008 /&gt;

It would lack any [[Orbital maneuver|orbit raising]] propulsion, but would keep the [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] thrusters ([[SPT-100]]) supplied by [[OKB Fakel]] for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]]. It would also use the Russian solar panels and have versions designed for [[highly elliptical orbit]] like [[Molniya orbit]] so important for the northerner regions of Russia.&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal052008 /&gt;

During 2009, the plan was to start with a series of satellites in [[highly elliptical orbit|HEO]] orbits for the Russian government, called '''Ekspress-RV''' {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс-РВ'''}}). It would be a constellation of three on orbit spacecraft with a fourth backup on Earth, but no further development have been communicated. Nor any of the expected foreign sales were closed.&lt;ref name=issreshetnev-journal052008 /&gt;

==List of satellites==
The Ekspress bus has seen many successes, both for the commercial market and the military programs. Here is a list of all known orders as of July 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2804">[[File:Ennstaler2.jpg|thumb|right|Ennstal Mountain Pied Cattle]]
The '''Ennstaler Bergscheck''' ("Ennstal Mountain Pied Cattle") is an endangered [[Austria]]n [[list of cattle breeds|breed]] of [[domestic cattle]]. The name comes from the Ennstal, the valley of the [[Enns (river)|Enns]] River.

The small light Ennstaler Bergscheck was long believed to have originated from the [[Bavaria]]n ''Weißkopfscheck'' ("White-headed Pied Cattle") but recent archaeological discoveries indicate descent from the local cattle of the [[La Tène]] period (5th&amp;ndash;1st centuries BC).&lt;ref name="bmnt"&gt;[https://www.bmnt.gv.at/land/lebensmittel/trad-lebensmittel/Fleisch/Rind/ennstaler_bergscheck.html Bundesministerium für Nachhaltigkeit und Tourismus: Ennstaler Bergscheck]&lt;/ref&gt; Once they were almost totally foxy red before the white spots in their fur increased, until 75%&amp;ndash;80% of the fur was white with only the loin and the side remaining clouded or with fringed spots. The inner ears are coloured. Horns, hooves and mucosas are mostly pigment free.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;''Seltene Nutztierrassen'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The breed was once popular as a draft and beef animal but in the 18th century was replaced by [[Murboden Cattle]], [[Pinzgau Cattle]], or [[Carinthian Blondvieh]]. The animals are fully developed after two years in the Alps, so they count as the earliest maturing alpine cattle breed. Although they do not become fat their beef is well marbled.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt;

It was thought that the last two cows had been slaughtered in 1986, but some surviving animals were found. Their conservation is organised by the Union for the Conservation of Endangered Domestic Animal Breeds (VEGH) and the Austrian National Union for Gene Reserves. In the year 2004 there were in Austria 65 animals in 6 farms again.

[[File:Baldung hexen ca1514.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hans Baldung Grien]]'s ''Three Witches'', c.&amp;nbsp;1514]]

Belief in and practice of [[witchcraft]] in [[Europe]] can be traced to [[classical antiquity]] and has continuous history during the [[Middle Ages]], culminating in the [[: Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Early Modern witch hunts]] and giving rise to the [[fairy tale]] and [[popular culture]] "witch" stock character of modern times, as well as to the concept of the "modern witch" in [[Wicca]] and related movements of [[contemporary witchcraft]].

The topic is a complex amalgamation of the practices of [[folk healer]]s, [[folk magic]], ancient belief in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] in pagan Europe, Christian views on [[heresy]], medieval and early modern practice of [[ceremonial magic]] and simple fiction in folklore and literature.

==History==

===Antiquity===
{{Further|Hecate|Lamia (mythology)|Strix (mythology)|Strigoi|Empusa|Mormo|Gello}}
Instances of persecution of witchcraft are documented from [[Classical Antiquity]], paralleling evidence from the [[Asian witchcraft#Ancient Near East|ancient Near East]] and the [[Witchcraft and divination in the Bible|Old Testament]].
[[File:Tablette de défixion d'Eyguières.jpg|thumb|An ancient Greek ''[[Curse tablet|defixion]]'' from Eyguieres]]

In [[ancient Greece]], for example, [[Theoris of Lemnos|Theoris]], a woman of Lemnos, was prosecuted for casting incantations and using harmful drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Theoris of Lemnos and the Criminalization of Magic in Fourth-Century Athens|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=51|issue=2|year=2001|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was executed along with her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Theoris of Lemnos and the Criminalization of Magic in Fourth-Century Athens|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=51|issue=2|year=2001|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[ancient Rome]] black magic was punished as a capital offence by the [[Law of the Twelve Tables]], which are to be assigned to the 5th century BC, and, as [[Livy]] records, from time to time Draconian statutes were directed against those who attempted to blight crops and vineyards or to spread disease among flocks and cattle. The terms of the frequent references in [[Horace]] to Canidia illustrate the odium in which sorceresses were held. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Under the Empire, in the third century, the punishment of burning alive was enacted by the State against witches who compassed another person's death through their enchantments.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Paulus, "Sent.", V, 23, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all the while normal legislation utterly condemned witchcraft and its works, while the laws were not merely carried out to their very letter, but reinforced by such emperors as Claudius, Vitelius, and Vespasian.

In the imperial period, it is evident from many Latin authors and from the historians that Rome swarmed with occultists and diviners, many of whom in spite of the Lex Cornelia almost openly traded in poisons, and not infrequently in assassination to boot. Paradoxical as it may appear, such emperors as [[Augustus]], [[Tiberius]], and [[Septimius Severus]], while banishing from their realms all seers and necromancers, and putting them to death, in private entertained astrologers and wizards among their retinue, consulting their art upon each important occasion, and often even in the everyday and ordinary affairs of life. These prosecutions are significant, as they establish that and the prohibition under severest penalties, the sentence of death itself of witchcraft was demonstrably not a product of Christianity, but had long and necessarily been employed in the heathen world and among pagan peoples and among polytheistic societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The ecclesiastical legislation followed a similar but milder course. The [[Council of Elvira]] (306), Canon 6, refused the holy Viaticum to those who had killed a man by a "per maleficium", translated as "visible effect of malicious intention" and adds the reason that such a crime could not be effected "without idolatry"; which probably means without the aid of the Devil, devil-worship and idolatry being then convertible terms. Similarly canon 24 of the [[Council of Ancyra]] (314) imposes five years of penance upon those who consult magicians, and here again the offence is treated as being a practical participation in paganism. This legislation represented the mind of the Church for many centuries. Similar penalties were enacted at the [[Council of Trullo|Eastern council in Trullo]] (692), while certain early Irish canons in the far West treated sorcery as a crime to be visited with excommunication until adequate penance had been performed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The early legal codes of most European nations contain laws directed against witchcraft. Thus, for example, the oldest document of Frankish legislation, the [[Salic Law]], which was reduced to a written form and promulgated under [[Clovis I|Clovis]], who died 27 November, 511, punishes those who practice magic with various fines, especially when it could be proven that the accused launched a deadly curse, or had tied the Witch's Knot. The laws of the [[Visigoths]], which were to some extent founded upon the [[Roman law]], punished witches who had killed any person by their spells with death; while long-continued and obstinate witchcraft, if fully proven, was visited with such severe sentences as slavery for life.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Christianization and Early Middle Ages===
The ''[[Pactus Legis Alamannorum]]'', an early 7th-century code of laws of the [[Alemanni]] confederation of Germanic tribes, lists witchcraft as a punishable crime on equal terms with poisoning. If a free man accuses a free woman of witchcraft or poisoning, the accused may be disculpated either by twelve people swearing an oath on her innocence or by one of her relatives defending her in a [[trial by combat]]. In this case, the accuser is required to pay a fine (''Pactus Legis Alamannorum'' 13).

With Christianization, belief in witchcraft came to be seen as [[superstition]]. The [[Council of Leptinnes]] in 744 drew up a "List of Superstitions", which prohibited sacrifice to saints and created a [[baptism]]al formula that required one to renounce works of demons, specifically naming [[Thor]] and [[Odin]]. Persecution of witchcraft nevertheless persisted throughout most of the [[Early Middle Ages]], into the 10th century.

When [[Charlemagne]] imposed Christianity upon the people of [[Saxony]] in 789, he proclaimed:
{{quote|If anyone, deceived by the Devil, shall believe, as is customary among pagans, that any man or woman is a night-witch, and eats men, and on that account burn that person to death... he shall be executed.&lt;ref name="huttonPaganReligions"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title= The Pagan Religions of the Early British Isles}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File: Augustine Lateran.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest known portrait of [[Saint Augustine]] in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]

Similarly, the Lombard code of 643 states:
{{quote|Let nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female slave as a witch, for it is not possible, nor ought to be believed by Christian minds.&lt;ref name="huttonPaganReligions"/&gt;}}

This conforms to the thoughts of [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], who taught that witchcraft did not exist and that the belief in it was heretical.&lt;ref name="canonEpiscopi"&gt;[http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~marc-carlson/witch/canon.html The ''Canon Episcopi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 814, [[Louis the Pious]] upon his accession to the throne began to take very active measures against all sorcerers and necromancers, and it was owing to his influence and authority that the [[Council of Paris]] in 829 appealed to the secular courts to carry out any such sentences as the Bishops might pronounce. The consequence was that from this time forward the penalty of witchcraft was death, and there is evidence that if the constituted authority, either ecclesiastical or civil, seemed to slacken in their efforts the populace took the law into their own hands with far more fearful results.

In England, the early Penitentials are greatly concerned with the repression of pagan ceremonies, which under the cover of Christian festivities were very largely practised at Christmas and on New Year's Day. These rites were closely connected with witchcraft, and especially do S. Theodore, S. Aldhelm, Ecgberht of York, and other prelates prohibit the masquerade as a horned animal, a stag, or a bull, which S. Caesarius of Arles had denounced as a "foul tradition", an "evil custom", a "most heinous abomination". The laws of King [[Athelstan]] (924-40), corresponsive with the early French laws, punished any person casting a spell which resulted in death by extracting the extreme penalty. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Among the laws attributed to the Pictish King [[Kenneth MacAlpin|Cináed mac Ailpin]] (ruled 843 to 858), is an important statute which enacts that all sorcerers and witches, and such as invoke spirits, "and use to seek upon them for helpe, let them be burned to death". Even then this was obviously no new penalty, but the statutory confirmation of a long-established punishment. So the witches of Forres who attempted the life of King Duffus in the year 968 by the old bane of slowly melting a wax image, when discovered, were according to the law burned at the stake. {{Citation needed|date = October 2011}}
[[File:Canon Episcopi Hs119.jpg|thumb|300px|The text of the canon ''Episcopi'' in Hs. 119 (Cologne), a manuscript of ''Decretum Burchardi'' dated to ca. 1020.]]

The [[Canon Episcopi]], which was written circa 900 AD (though alleged to date from 314 AD), once more following the teachings of Saint Augustine, declared that witches did not exist and that anyone who believed in them was a heretic. The crucial passage from the Canon Episcopi reads as follows:
{{quote|It is also not to be omitted that some unconstrained women, perverted by Satan, seduced by illusions and phantasms of demons, believe and openly profess that, in the dead of night, they ride upon certain beasts with the pagan goddess Diana, with a countless horde of women, and in the silence of the dead of the night to fly over vast tracts of country, and to obey her commands as their mistress, and to be summoned to her service on other nights. But it were well if they alone perished in their infidelity and did not draw so many others into the pit of their faithlessness. For an innumerable multitude, deceived by this false opinion, believe this to be true and, so believing, wander from the right faith and relapse into pagan errors when they think that there is any divinity or power except the one God.&lt;ref name="canonEpiscopi"/&gt;}}
 
{{quotation|In the world of late antiquity or the early Middle Ages, it is impossible to define someone as a witch (as opposed, for example, to an amateur herbalist, a heretic or a scold), and none of the legislation of the time attempted to do so. Offenders were designated offenders by virtue of their performing various actions or wearing certain objects declared by the legislation to be condemned or forbidden. For all practical purposes, the 'witch' had not yet been invented. There were only practitioners of various kinds of magic, both male and female, who might belong to any rank of ecclesiastical or lay society, and whose actions might, or might not, bring them within the compass of canon or secular law, depending on external factors that were usually local but could, from time to time, be more general.|[[P.G. Maxwell-Stewart]], ''The Emergence of the Christian Witch''}}

===Magic and Medicine in the Middle Ages===
During the European Middle Ages, the centuries following Christianization of the continent, the Church focused on the persecution of [[heresy]] in order to maintain unity of doctrine. Practitioners of folk magic were left unmolested by the authorities.

During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there are few cases of witchcraft in England, and such accusations as were made appeared to have been brought before the ecclesiastical court.

In the twelfth through fifteenth centuries, Christianity was throughout nearly all of Europe and was often tied into what we now define as magic. Instead of being able to identify one type of magician, there are many who practiced several types of magic in this time including: monks, priests, physicians, surgeons, midwives, folk healers, and diviners. There are many written works from monks and priests rather than laypeople because they were literate and capable of writing down their day-to-day activities. Much of their "magic" consisted of the usage of medicinal herbs in order to heal. Each monastery was expected to be able to provide medical aid, a way in which they used various types of "magic" to become healers. Classical medicine entailed magical elements, they would use various charms or potions to help drive away sickness. Many ordinary parish priests might have had some experience in medicine, but they also were more likely to practice other forms of magic. For example, it was the duty of a parish priest to perform an agricultural ritual for infertile fields in the twelfth century. The ceremony takes an entire day, and consists of digging out clumps of the earth and sprinkling it with holy water, oil, milk, honey, herbs, and a recitation. This is seen as a "Christian" act because the words that the priest says are taken from the Bible, specifically Genesis 1:28. Magical acts such as these were widespread because it seemed to be under the umbrella of Christianity but also has ties to classical magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=Magic in the Middle Ages|date=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521309417|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicinal practices in the Middle Ages were often regarded as forms of "natural magic". One in particular was referred to as a "leechbook", or a doctor-book that included masses to be said over the healing herbs. For example, a procedure for curing skin disease first involves an ordinary herbal medicine followed by strict instructions to draw blood from the neck of the ill, pour it into running water, spit three times and recite a sort of spell to complete the cure. In addition to the leechbook, the Lacnunga included many prescriptions derived from the European folk culture that more intensely involved magic. The Lacnunga prescribed a set of Christian prayers to be said over the ingredients used to make the medicine, and such ingredients were to be mixed with straws that had the names "Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John" inscribed on them. In order for the cure to work, several charms were sung in Latin over the medicine.

===Early Modern Witch Hunts===
{{Main|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
The origins of the accusations against witches in the Early Modern period are eventually present in trials against heretics, which trials include claims of secret meetings, orgies, and the consumption of babies. From the 15th century, the idea of a pact became important—one could be possessed by the Devil and not responsible for one's actions, but to be a witch, one had to sign a [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]], often to worship him, which was heresy and meant damnation. The idea of an explicit and ceremonial pact with the Devil was crucial to the development of the witchcraft concept, because it provided an explanation that differentiated the figure of the witch from that of the learned necromancer or sorcerer (whose magic was presumed to be diabolic in source, but with the power to wield it being achieved through rigorous application of study and complex ritual). A rise in the practice of necromancy in the 12th century, spurred on by an influx of texts on magic and diabolism from the Islamic world, had alerted clerical authorities to the potential dangers of malefic magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=Magic in the Middle Ages|date=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-78576-1|pages=116–119; 151–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This elevated concern was slowly expanded to include the common witch, but clerics needed an explanation for why uneducated commoners could perform feats of diabolical sorcery that rivaled those of the most seasoned and learned necromancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Michael D.|title=The Feminization of Magic and the Emerging Idea of the Female Witch in the Late Middle Ages|journal=Essays in Medieval Studies|date=2002|volume=19|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that witches gained their powers through a pact with the Devil provided a satisfactory explanation, and allowed authorities to develop a mythology through which they could project accusations of crimes formerly associated with various heretical sects (incestuous orgies, cannibalism, ritual [[infanticide]], and the worship of [[Familiar spirit|demonic familiars]]) onto the newly emerging threat of diabolical witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohn|first1=Norman|title=Europe's inner demons : an enquiry inspired by the great witch-hunt|date=1975|publisher=Chatto|location=London|isbn=978-0-435-82183-8|edition=1a reimpr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pact and the ceremony that accompanied it became widely known as the [[Witches' Sabbath|witches' sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Michael D.|title=The Medieval Concept of the Witches' Sabbath|journal=Exemplaria|date=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=419–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sprenger - Malleus maleficarum, 1669 - BEIC 9477645.tiff|thumb|The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' was influential in 17th-century European [[witch trials]]]]
By 1300, the elements were in place for a witch hunt, and for the next century and a half fear of witches spread gradually throughout Europe. At the end of the Middle Ages (about 1450), the fear became a craze that lasted more than 200&amp;nbsp;years. As the notion spread that all magic involved a pact with the Devil, legal sanctions against witchcraft grew harsher. Each new conviction reinforced the beliefs in the methods (torture and pointed interrogation) being used to solicit confessions and in the list of accusations to which these "witches" confessed. The rise of the witch-craze was concurrent with the rise of [[Renaissance magic]] in the great [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the time (this was called High Magic, and the [[Neoplatonist]]s and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]s that practised it took pains to insist that it was wise and benevolent and nothing like Witchcraft), which helped abet the rise of the craze. Witchcraft was held to be the worst of heresies, and early skepticism slowly faded from view almost entirely.

In the early 14th century, many accusations were brought against clergymen and other learned people who were capable of reading and writing magic; [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (d. 1303) was posthumously tried for apostasy, murder, and sodomy, in addition to allegedly entering into a pact with the Devil (while popes had been accused of crimes before, the demonolatry charge was new). The Templars were also tried as Devil-invoking heretics in 1305–14. The middle years of the 14th century were quieter, but towards the end of the century, accusations increased and were brought against ordinary people more frequently. In 1398, the University of Paris declared that the demonic pact could be implicit; no document need be signed, as the mere act of summoning a demon constituted an implied pact. Tens of thousands of trials continued through Europe generation after generation; [[William Shakespeare]] wrote about the infamous "[[Three Witches]]" in his tragedy ''[[Macbeth]]'' during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]], who was notorious for his ruthless prosecution of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Z.|first1=Grace|title=Witchcraft: The Beginnings|url=http://people.ucls.uchicago.edu/~snekros/The%20Salem%20Sentinel/Other/Entries/2013/11/14_Witchcraft_-_The_Beginnings.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations against witches were almost identical to those levelled by 3rd-century pagans against early Christians:
{{quote|In chapters 6–11 of the ''Octavius'', Caecilius, the pagan opponent of Christianity, accuses Christians of rejecting ancestral beliefs and of failing to imitate the piety of the Romans (chap. 6), of failing to understand the communication of gods with humans (chap. 7), of denying the existence of many gods and accepting only the dregs of society, the most shameful people, into their assemblies and organizing dreadful, nocturnal, secret meetings (chap. 8). They practice indiscriminate sexual activity, worship the head of an ass, worship the genital organs of their priests, and initiate novices by making them kill infants and cannibalize them (chap. 9). Their rites are held in secret, and they have no temples (chap. 10). Finally they are a subversive sect that threatens the stability of the whole world (chap. 11).&lt;ref&gt;Kors and Peters, eds. page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The craze took on new strength in the 15th century, and in 1486, [[Heinrich Kramer]], a member of the [[Dominican Order]], published the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (the 'Hammer against the Witches'). This book was banned by the Church in 1490 and scholars are unclear on just how influential the Malleus was in its day. Less than one hundred years after it was written, the Council of the Inquisitor General in Spain discounted the credibility of the Malleus since it contained numerous errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2778975|title = The Great European Witch-Hunts: A Historical Perspective|journal = American Journal of Sociology|volume = 88|issue = 6|pages = 1270–1274|last1 = Hoak|first1 = Dale|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution continued through the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, and the Protestants and Catholics both continued witch trials with varying numbers of executions from one period to the next. The "Caroline Code", the basic law code of the Holy Roman Empire (1532) imposed heavy penalties on witchcraft. As society became more literate (due mostly to the invention of the Printing Press in the 1440s), increasing numbers of books and tracts fueled the witch fears.

The craze reached its height between 1560 and 1660. After 1580, the Jesuits replaced the Dominicans as the chief Catholic witch-hunters, and the Catholic Rudolf II (1576–1612) presided over a long persecution in Austria. The Jura Mountains in southern Germany provided a small respite from the insanity; there, torture was imposed only within the precise limits of the Caroline Code of 1532, little attention was paid to the accusations of or by children, and charges had to be brought openly before a suspect could be arrested. These limitations contained the mania in that area.

The nuns of [[Loudun possessions|Loudun]] (1630), [[The Devils of Loudun|novelized]] by [[Aldous Huxley]] and made into [[The Devils (film)|a film]] by [[Ken Russell]], provide an example of the craze during this time. The nuns had conspired to accuse Father Urbain Grandier of witchcraft by faking symptoms of possession and torment; they feigned convulsions, rolled and gibbered on the ground, and accused Grandier of indecencies. Grandier was convicted and burned; however, after the plot succeeded, the symptoms of the nuns only grew worse, and they became more and more sexual in nature. This attests to the degree of mania and insanity present in such witch trials.

In 1687, Louis XIV issued an edict against witchcraft that was rather moderate compared to former ones; it ignored black cats and other lurid fantasies of the witch mania. After 1700, the number of witches accused and condemned fell rapidly.

===Witchcraft in Britain===
{{Further|Witch trials in early modern Scotland}}
[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]

In England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland there was a succession of [[Witchcraft Acts]] starting with Henry VIII's Act of 1542. They governed witchcraft and providing penalties for its practice, or—after 1700—rather for pretending to practise it.

In Wales, fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500. There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500". ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536-1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales". ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603, [[James I]] brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. He set out the much stiffer [[Witchcraft Acts|Witchcraft Act of 1604]], which made it a felony under common law. One goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality{{Citation needed|reason=Speculative|date=December 2016}} among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches' Community". ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment attitudes after 1700 made a mockery of beliefs in witches. The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L.

==Hallucinogens and witchcraft==

===Recognition===
A number of modern researchers have recognized the importance of hallucinogenic plants in the practice of European witchcraft; among them, anthropologists [[Edward B. Taylor]], [[Bernard Barnett]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Bernard, (1965) "Witchcraft, Psychopathology and Hallucinations" in ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 3: 439–45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael J. Harner]] and [[Julio C. Baroja]]&lt;ref name="Baroja, Julio C. 1964"&gt;Baroja, Julio C., (1964) ''The World of the Witches''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmacologists [[Louis Lewin]]&lt;ref name="Lewin, Louis 1964"&gt;Lewin, Louis. (1964) ''Phantastica, Narcotic and Stimulating Drugs: Their Use and Abuse''. E.P. Dutton, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erich Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Hesse, Erich 1946"&gt;Hesse, Erich. (1946) ''Narcotics and Drug Addiction''. Philosophical Library of New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Many medieval writers also comment on the use of hallucinogenic plants in [[Flying ointment|witches' ointments]], including [[Joseph Glanvil]],&lt;ref name="Glanvil, Joseph 1681"&gt;Glanvil, Joseph. 1681. ''Saducismus Triumphatus''. London&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordanes de Bergamo]], [[Sieur de Beauvoys de Chauvincourt]], [[Martin Del Rio]], [[Raphael Holinshed]], [[Andrés Laguna]], [[Johannes Nider]], [[Sieur Jean de Nynald]], [[Henry Boguet]], [[Giovanni Porta]], [[Nicholas Remy]], [[Bartolommeo Spina]], [[Richard Verstegan]], [[Johann Vincent]] and [[Pedro Ciruelo]].&lt;ref name="Harner, Michael J. 1973 p. 128-50"&gt;Harner, Michael J., ed. (1973) "The Role of Hallucinogenic Plants in European Witchcraft" in ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism''. Oxford University Press. Library of Congress: 72-92292. p. 128–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of our knowledge of [[herbalism]] in European witchcraft comes from the Spanish [[Inquisition|Inquisitors]] and other authorities, who occasionally recognized the psychological nature of the "witches' flight", but more often considered the effects of witches' ointments to be [[demonic]] or [[Satanism|satanic]].&lt;ref name="Harner, Michael J. 1973 p. 128-50"/&gt;

===Use patterns===
[[Image:Atropa belladonna Prague 2011 2.jpg|thumb|Berries of ''[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]'']]

[[Decoction]]s of hallucinogenic plants such as [[henbane]], [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[datura]],&lt;ref name="Lewin, Louis 1964"/&gt; and other plants of the [[Solanaceae]] family were central&lt;ref name="Baroja, Julio C. 1964"/&gt; to European witchcraft. All of these plants contain hallucinogenic [[alkaloids]] of the [[tropane]] family, including [[hyoscyamine]], [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], and [[atropine]]—the last of which is unusual in that it can be absorbed through the skin. These concoctions are described in the literature variously as [[Decoction|brews]], [[salves]], [[ointment]]s, [[Potion|philtres]], [[oils]], and [[unguent]]s. Ointments were mainly applied by rubbing on the skin, especially in sensitive areas—underarms, the pubic region,&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. 1962. ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the forehead,&lt;ref name="Glanvil, Joseph 1681"/&gt; the mucous membranes of the vagina and anus, or on areas rubbed raw ahead of time. They were often first applied to a "vehicle" to be "ridden" (an object such as a broom, pitchfork, basket, or animal skin that was rubbed against sensitive skin). All of these concoctions were made and used for the purpose of giving the witch special abilities to commune with spirits, transform into animals ([[lycanthropy]]),&lt;ref&gt;Boguet, Henry (transl. Ashwin, E. Allen). 1929. ''An Examen of Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; gain love, harm enemies, experience euphoria and sexual pleasure,&lt;ref name="Hesse, Erich 1946"/&gt; and—importantly—to "[[Witches' Sabbath|fly to the witches' Sabbath]]".&lt;ref name="Harner, Michael J. 1973 p. 128-50"/&gt;

==Position of the church==
{{further|Christian views on magic}}
[[Image:Martin van Maele - La Sorcière 06.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration by [[Martin van Maële]], of a ''[[Witches' Sabbath]]'', in the 1911 edition of ''La Sorcière'' by [[Jules Michelet]]]]

Witches were not localised Christian distortions of pagans but people alleged to have both the ability and the will to employ supernatural effects for malignant ends. This belief is familiar from other cultures, and was partly inherited from paganism. The belief that witches were originally purely benign does not derive from any early textual source. The earliest written reference to witches as such, from [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Aelfric's]] homilies,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ealdriht.org/witchcraft.html&lt;/ref&gt; portrays them as malign. The tendency to perceive them as healers begins only in the 19th century, with [[Jules Michelet]] whose novel ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorcière]]'', published in 1862, first postulated a benign witch.

It was in the Church's interest, as it expanded, to suppress all competing Pagan methodologies of magic. This could be done only by presenting a cosmology in which Christian miracles were legitimate and credible, whereas non-Christian ones were "of the devil". Hence the following law:

{{quote|We teach that every priest shall extinguish heathendom, and forbid wilweorthunga (fountain worship), and licwiglunga (incantations of the dead), and hwata (omens), and galdra (magic), and man worship, and the abominations that men exercise in various sorts of witchcraft, and in frithspottum (peace-enclosures) with elms and other trees, and with stones, and with many phantoms.|Source: 16th [[Canon Law]] enacted under King [[Edgar of England|Edgar]]|10th century&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]]}}

While the common people were aware of the difference between witches, who they considered willing to undertake evil actions, such as cursing, and [[cunning folk]] who avoided involvement in such activities, the Church attempted to blot out the distinction. In much the same way that culturally distinct non-Christian religions were all lumped together and termed merely "Pagan", so too was all magic lumped together as equally sinful and abhorrent. The ''Demonologie'' of [[James I of England|James I]] explicitly condemns all magic-workers as equally guilty of the same crime against God.

=="Witch" stock character==
[[File:Hexensabbat.jpg|thumb|250px|Representation of [[Witches' Sabbath|Sabbath]] gatherings from the chronicles of [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]

The characterization of the witch in Europe is not derived from a single source.
The familiar witch of folklore and popular superstition is a combination of numerous influences.

At the end of the Middle Ages, the recurring beliefs about witches were:
{{quote|
#The ride by night
#The [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]]
#The formal repudiation of Christianity
#The secret nocturnal meeting
#The desecration of the [[Eucharist]] and [[crucifix]]
#The [[orgy]]
#Sacrificial [[infanticide]], and
#[[Cannibalism]]}}
The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) declared that the four essential points of witchcraft were renunciation of the Catholic faith, devotion of body and soul to evil, offering up unbaptized children to the Devil, and engaging in orgies that included intercourse with the Devil; in addition, witches were accused of shifting their shapes, flying through the air, abusing Christian sacraments, and confecting magical ointments.

Witches were credited with a variety of magical powers. These fall into two broad categories: those that explain the occurrence of misfortune and are thus grounded in real events, and those that are wholly fantastic.

The first category includes the powers to cause impotence, to turn milk sour, to strike people dead, to cause diseases, to raise storms, to cause infants to be stillborn, to prevent cows from giving milk, to prevent hens from laying and to blight crops. The second includes the power to fly in the air, to change form into a hare, to suckle [[familiar spirit]]s from warts, to sail on a single plank and perhaps most absurd of all, to go to sea in an eggshell.

Witches were often believed to fly on broomsticks or [[distaffs]], or occasionally upon unwilling human beings, who would be called 'hag-ridden'. Horses found sweating in their stalls in the morning were also said to be hag-ridden.

The accused witch [[Isobel Gowdie]] gave the following charm as her means of transmuting herself into a hare:
{{cquote|I shall go into a hare,&lt;BR&gt;
With sorrow and sych and meickle care;&lt;BR&gt;
And I shall go in the Devil's name,&lt;BR&gt;
Ay while I come home again.}}
[[File:Three Witches (scene from Macbeth) by William Rimmer.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[William Rimmer]] depicting the [[Three Witches]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'']]
Especially in media aimed at children (such as [[fairy tale]]s), witches are often depicted as wicked old women with wrinkled skin and [[pointy hat]]s, clothed in black or purple, with [[wart]]s on their noses and sometimes long [[claw]]-like fingernails. Like the [[Three Witches]] from ''[[Macbeth]]'', they are often portrayed as concocting potions in large cauldrons. Witches typically ride through the air on a [[broomstick]] as in the [[Harry Potter]] universe or in more modern spoof versions, a [[vacuum cleaner]] as in the ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' universe. They are often accompanied by [[black cat]]s. One of the most famous modern depictions is the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.

Witches also appear as villains in many 19th- and 20th-century [[fairy tale]]s, [[Folklore|folk tales]] and children's stories, such as "[[Snow White]]", "[[Hansel and Gretel]]", "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", and many other stories recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Such folktales typically portray witches as either remarkably ugly hags or remarkably beautiful young women.

In the novel by [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[La Celestina|Celestina]] is an old prostitute who commits [[pimping]] and [[witchcraft]] in order to arrange sexual relationships.

Witches may also be depicted as essentially good, as in [[Archie Comics|Archie Comics']] long running ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' series, [[Terry Pratchett|Terry Pratchett's]] ''[[Discworld]]'' novels, in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s 1989 film ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''&lt;!-- Dispute this is a Japanese film, the witches it depict are of western culture, with story setting in a seaside European town.--&gt;, or the television series ''[[Charmed]]'' (1998–2006). Following the film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', popular fictional depictions of witchcraft have increasingly drawn from [[Wicca]]n practices, portraying witchcraft as having a religious basis and witches as humans of normal appearance.

== History ==
On September 13, 1988, the director of the National Institute of Technology Research signed a decision to establish The Food Processing Technology Company (FPT's original name), operating in the fields of drying technology, information technology and automation technology.

On October 27, 1990, the company was renamed The Corporation for Financing and Promoting Technology (FPT for short), specializing in information technology. 

In 1998, FPT became one of the four leading [[Internet service provider|Internet service providers]] in Vietnam to create a breakthrough in this field.

On September 8, 2006, the [[FPT University]] was founded under FPT, becoming the first licensed cooperate university. Key people of the university were Dr. Le Truong Tung - the first dean and Associate Professor Truong Gia Binh - the chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt; "FPT University receives licence".[http://sggpnews.org.vn/education/fpt-university-receives-licence-26194.html] ''Vietnamnet Bridge''.

'''Fernandinos''' are [[creole peoples|creole]]s, multi-ethnic or multi-racial populations who developed in  [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the former [[Spanish Guinea]]. Their name is derived from the island of Fernando Pó, where many worked. This island was named for the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Fernão do Pó]], credited with discovering the region.

Each population had a distinct ethnic, social, cultural and linguistic history. Members of these communities provided most of the labor that built and expanded the cocoa farming industry on [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] during the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[W. G. Clarence-Smith, "African and European Cocoa Producers on Fernando Póo, 1880s to 1910s," ''The Journal of African History,'' Volume 35, Issue 02, July 1994, pp 179–199, {{doi|10.1017/S0021853700026384}}, Published online by Cambridge University Press 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fernandinos of Fernando Po were closely related to each other. Because of the history of labor in this area, where workers were recruited, effectively impressed, from [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Freetown]], [[Cape Coast]], and [[Saros (Nigeria)|Lagos]], the Fernandinos also had family ties to those areas.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Sundiata, ''From Slaving to Neoslavery: The Bight of Biafra and Fernando Po in the Era of Abolition, 1827–1930; Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1996; {{ISBN|0-299-14510-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-14510-1}}; p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually these ethnically distinct groups intermarried and integrated. In 21st-century [[Bioko]], their differences are considered marginal.

== Native Fernandinos ==
The indigenous group of '''Fernandinos''' or ''Los Fernandinos'', were mixed-race descendants of the indigenous population of [[Spanish Guinea]] originating from the island of [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Pó]] (modern day [[Bioko Island]]), an island discovered by the explorer [[Fernão do Pó]]. This group consisted of [[mulatto]]es of female [[Bubi people|Bubi]] and white male [[Spaniard|Spanish]] parentage, and were part of the [[emancipados]] social class. Many children from such unions were not claimed by the father; however, some couples married under [[Roman Catholic]] law. Because the Bubi women generally were responsible for rearing and caring for their mixed-race children, they identified with and were generally accepted by the Bubi tribe.

Similarly, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]-Indigenous descended [[mulatto]] population of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], an island also discovered by explorer [[Fernão do Pó]], were also referred to as '''Fernandinos''', at one point.

=== Language ===
Native '''Fernandinos''' spoke [[Equatoguinean Spanish]], French, [[Bube language|Bube]] and a form of pidgin English called [[Pichinglis]]. Pichinglis was brought to Fernando Pó by [[Efik people|Efik]] settlers from [[Akwa Akpa|Akwa Akpa State]] (known during colonial times as [[Calabar States: Calabar Kingdom|Calabar State]]) in [[Nigeria]]. The dialect was used in trade activities, and may have varied slightly per region. During [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|the Franco regime]], this creole dialect was stigmatized.

=== Religion ===
Most [[Bubi people|Bubi]] living on Bioko during the colonial era became Roman Catholic. The mulatto Fernandinos were raised chiefly as Roman Catholic as well.

== Krio Fernandinos ==
The other Fernandinos of [[Equatorial Guinea]] were descended from English-speaking freed slaves of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]]. Essentially, Krios are descendants of blacks who were resettled from London, the Caribbean and Nova Scotia to Sierra Leone in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Some were formerly slaves in the United States who had been freed by the British after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. They were joined by [[Africans]] liberated from the illegal slave trade by British forces after 1808.

In separate actions, supported by the [[American Colonization Society]], groups of free African Americans emigrated to Liberia, established as a US colony in West Africa, in the antebellum years. Their numbers were also added to by Africans liberated from the slave trade along the west coast of Africa.

Workers from both Sierra Leone and especially Liberia were transported as workers to [[Bioko Island]]. As English speakers with some Anglo culture, they became a dominant force in the evolution of local society and economy and took on leadership roles. They tended to marry among themselves, as they identified as separate from the local, less educated and/or liberated indigenous peoples. The Krios eventually blended with the local populations, with Krio women and children taking on the surnames of indigenous families. They have contributed to the ethnically/racially mixed peoples who live along the West Coast of Africa.

The Krios arrived from Sierra Leone on the island of Fernando Po in 1827, a year after Great Britain leased the island for 50 years. The Krios joined an influx of several hundred freed Creole African-descended immigrants from [[Cape Coast]] and other groups from British colonies in Africa.  The Krios began populating the harbor  known as [[Port Clarence|Clarence Cove]]. The first inhabitants purchased dwellings for $3,000 to $5,000, along with a handful of large plantation owners who had engaged in the [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] farming industry. This was chiefly controlled by English and Spanish factory owners. A nineteenth-century British history characterized Krios as noted for their scholastic achievement and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;''Glimpses of Africa, West and Southwest coast''. By Charles Spencer Smith; A.M.E. Sunday School Union, 1895; p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Biased writers attributed this to their partial European ancestry.

=== Marriage ===
The group is closely related to other West-Central African Creole communities in Freetown, Cape Coast and Lagos. Endogamy was a common marriage practice, and families aligned themselves in order to maintain, and increase, property ownership as well as social and business alliances outside of the island. Because of this, prior to the 20th century, marriages with non-Creoles, known as ''bush marriages'', were not recognized by the church or in estate claims. However, they were recognized socially.

=== Culture ===
Krio Fernandinos were heavily Anglophone and Protestant as well as a cultural arm of British West Africa. They were once noted as being highly xenophobic. A notable example of this was a Krio Fernandino, and son of a Scottish father, named [[Henry Hugh Gardner]]. He was beaten by Spanish police after he murdered his African-Catholic Cameroon-born common-law wife, Victoria Castellanos. At the bequest of his mother, Gardner refused to marry Castellanos because she refused religious conversion. She, then, became involved with a Catholic-convert which infuriated Gardener.

Krio Fernandinos were, initially, unimpressed and indifferent to Spanish rule. However, by the late-1800s, as Spanish cultural and religious influence grew on the island, Krio Fernandinos found that exclusively marrying into their traditional identity became less practical for political and economic survival.&lt;ref name="sundiata01"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0365.htm

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
Throughout the generations, the Fernandinos maintained their creole language, [[Fernando Poo Creole English]]. Krio Fernandinos are exclusively concentrated around [[Malabo]]. Although they comprise a distinct ethnic group in Equatorial Guinea, their pidgin dialect is spoken in only six communities (Musola, Las Palmas, Sampaca, Basupu, Fiston and Balveri de Cristo Rey). In 1998 it was estimated that the number of fluent speakers of this Equatoguinean language was 5,000. About one-fifth of those 5,000 speakers have this Creole English as their only language. Up to 70,000 EquatoGuineans may use it as a trade language. In the 21st century, [[Fernando Poo Creole English]] and [[Pichinglis]] have long been fused into one dialect.

=== Religion ===
The majority of Krio '''Fernandinos''' are Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''Glimpses of Africa, West and Southwest coast''By Charles Spencer Smith; A.M.E. Sunday School Union, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; Krios have contributed to development of the [[Protestant]] church in [[Bioko]]. Descendants of Iberian parentage tend to be [[Roman Catholic]].

'''Greece–Holy See relations''' of diplomatic character were established in 1980. The [[Holy See]] immediately set up its [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to [[Greece]] in [[Athens]]. The Greek ambassador to the Holy See resided at first in [[Paris]], where he was concurrently accredited to [[France]]; but in 1988 a separate Greek embassy to the Holy See, situated in [[Rome]], was set up.
 
In May 2001, [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] made a visit of pilgrimage to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-52755180.html |title=Almanac |accessdate=2009-05-07 |quote=In 2001, Pope John Paul II flew to Greece to begin a journey retracing the steps of the Apostle Paul through historic lands. ... |publisher=[[United Press International]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[East-West Schism]] divided medieval [[Christendom]] into [[Orthodox Christian]] and [[Roman Catholic|Western Roman Catholic]]. Relations between East and West had long been embittered by political and ecclesiastical differences and theological disputes.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cross, F. L. ed. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical relations===
Relations with Greece are largely related to ecumenical relations with the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the Greek [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. In 2007 [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] gave his approval to the [[Declaration of Ravenna]], a Catholic–Orthodox document concerning the [[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]], although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=11385 Divided in Ravenna, Russian and Estonian Orthodox to talk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrant crisis===

[[Image:Antarctic shelf ice hg.png|thumb|Sketch of the Antarctic coast with glaciological and oceanographic processes, showing ice rises within ice shelf]]

An '''ice rise''' is a clearly defined elevation of the otherwise totally  flat [[ice shelf]], typically dome-shaped and rising 100 to 200 metres above the surrounding ice shelf. An ice rise forms where the ice shelf touches the rocky [[seabed]] because of an elevation in the seabed that remains below sea level. (In contrast, an elevation in the seabed that extends above sea level is defined as an [[island]]). The ice shelf flows over the seabed elevation, completely covering it with ice, thereby forming an ice rise. The resulting tension forms [[crevasse]]s around the ice rise.

An island within and totally covered by the ice shelf may appear the same as an ice rise. Elaborate measurements may be required to distinguish between these two geographic features.

Although ice rises are typically located within the ice shelf area, they can partially face the open sea. Ice rises are found only on the ice shelves of [[Antarctica]]. The largest ice rises exceed dimensions of 50 by 200&amp;nbsp;km, or 10 000&amp;nbsp;km² in area. Some ice rises are incorrectly called islands, but also a few totally ice-covered islands within an ice shelf are also called ice rises.

'''''Le Médecin de campagne''''' (''The Country Doctor'') is an 1833 novel by [[Honoré de Balzac]]. The second in his '''''Scène de la vie de campagne''''' series, it addresses the author's own preoccupation with social organisation, political power and religion, though the reader has to avoid confusing Balzac's political principles with the convictions of Dr Benassis on which critics have often given contrary opinions. Some see the book as giving a sort of 20th century-type liberalism,&lt;ref&gt;André Wurmser, La comédie inhumaine&lt;/ref&gt; while others see the premises of socialist thinking or [[Charles Fourier|fourierist]] tendencies. The book's romantic dimension has to be taken into account, despite quite a thin plot, connecting it with the world of  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] with an elogy on nature, peace and poetry. None of its characters appear elsewhere in ''[[La Comédie humaine]]''.

The heart of its third part is made up of tales told during a vigil in a barn by Guoguelat, a former soldier in the armies of Napoleon. This section uses material Balzac had gathered for a planned work entitled ''Les Batailles napoléoniennes'', which he began but never finished. &lt;!---Le cœur de la troisième partie du roman est constitué par les récits, faits à la veillée dans une grange, par l'ex-fantassin de Napoléon, Guoguelat. Balzac effleure ici un projet dont il avait tracé le plan et commencé la rédaction : ''Les Batailles napoléoniennes''. L'ouvrage ne verra jamais le jour, mais les récits de ces batailles, les références aux généraux, maréchaux, grognards et fantassins seront dispersés dans toute [[la Comédie humaine]]. A tel point que Napoléon est le personnage le plus souvent cité. Tantôt en rapport avec les personnages fictifs du romancier, tantôt dans l'histoire réelle.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Meiningeer et Pierre Citron, index des personnes réelles, [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]], 1981, p. 1773 à 1782{{ISBN|2070108775|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In 1829, commander Genestas arrives in a village in the [[Dauphiné]], where he meets Dr Benassis, who has transformed this miserable settlement into a small but prosperous town in only ten years. The two men each have a secret which is only revealed at the end of the book.
&lt;!---
Genestas s'installe chez le docteur Benassis pour dix francs par jour sous le prétexte de soigner d'anciennes blessures militaires. Les deux hommes se lient d'amitié et le commandant accompagne le médecin dans sa tournée de visites. ll découvre alors comment Benassis, devenu maire du village, y a apporté la prospérité en appliquant ses théories. Par de gigantesques travaux hydrauliques, il a transformé une terre aride en terre cultivable où l'on a pu planter blé, arbres fruitiers. Il a aussi amélioré les habitations, créé une petite industrie de vannerie et de scierie, fait construire une route qui relie le village à celle de [[Grenoble]]. Du coup, boulanger, maréchal ferrant, et grand nombre d'artisans sont venus se joindre à la population qui connaîtra cinq ans plus tard une forme de "luxe", avec l'installation de commerces, tanneries, boucherie, ainsi que de structures municipale : mairie, école. Finalement, les deux nouveaux amis se font le récit de leur vie : le commandant Genestas a un fils adoptif malade, Adrien, qu'il veut confier au docteur Benassis. Le médecin accepte et réussit à guérir l'enfant.

De son côté, Benassis confie son secret au commandant : l'énorme tâche qu'il a accomplie pour le village était une manière d'expiation, pour lui qui refuse le suicide ou le monastère. Après la mort d'une jeune fille qu'il a séduite dans sa jeunesse, et celle du fils qu'il a eu d'elle, il a décidé de mettre sa vie au service des autres.

'''Mali''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mali.ogg|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|i}}; {{IPA-fr|mali}}), officially the '''Republic of Mali''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|République du Mali}}), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[West Africa]], a region geologically identified with the [[West African Craton]]. Mali is the eighth-largest country in [[Africa]], with an area of just over {{convert|1240000|sqkm|sqmi}}. The population of Mali is {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Mali}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}}&amp;nbsp;million.{{UN_Population|ref}} Its capital is [[Bamako]]. The [[sovereign state]] of Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], while the country's southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Senegal River|Senegal]] rivers. The country's economy centers on agriculture and mining. Some of Mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/65656d0049a2edb0a589ef9f13675c4c/Mali-gold-reserves-rise-in-2011-alongside-price-20120101 ''Mali gold reserves rise in 2011 alongside price''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121041039/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/65656d0049a2edb0a589ef9f13675c4c/Mali-gold-reserves-rise-in-2011-alongside-price-20120101 |date=21 November 2015 }}.

Present-day Mali was once part of three West [[African empires]] that controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]]: the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]] (for which Mali is named), and the [[Songhai Empire]]. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of mathematics, [[astronomy]], literature, and art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115452/http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=371 Topics].

The Black Past. Retrieved 8 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, during the [[Scramble for Africa]], France seized control of Mali, making it a part of [[French Sudan]]. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with [[Senegal]] in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the [[Mali Federation]]. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal's withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.

In January 2012, an [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|armed conflict broke out in northern Mali]], in which [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|Tuareg rebels]] took control of a territory in the north, and in April declared the [[secession]] of a new state, [[Azawad]].&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Polgreen and Alan Cowell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/07/world/africa/mali-rebels-proclaim-independent-state-in-north.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1333728086-ZXpwSz3KFqUnA4lteq4j4w "Mali Rebels Proclaim Independent State in North"], ''The New York Times'' (6 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was complicated by a [[2012 Malian coup d'état|military coup]] that took place in March&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/mali/9161930/UN-Security-council-condemns-Mali-coup.html UN Security Council condemns Mali coup].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Mali'' is taken from the&amp;nbsp;name of the [[Mali Empire]]. The name was originally derived from&amp;nbsp;the [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;[[Bambara language|Bambara]]&amp;nbsp;word ''mali'', meaning "[[hippopotamus]]", but it eventually came to mean "the place where the king lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u5HnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=mali+hippopotamus#v=onepage&amp;q=mali%20hippopotamus&amp;f=false|title=Discovering the Empire of Mali|last=Wolny|first=Philip|date=15 December 2013|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781477718896|location=|pages=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word carries the connotation of strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&amp;pg=PA673&amp;dq=mali+hippopotamus#v=onepage&amp;q=mali%20hippopotamus&amp;f=false|title=Educational Systems of Africa: Interpretations for Use in the Evaluation of Academic Credentials|last=Sasnett|first=Martena Tenney|last2=Sepmeyer|first2=Inez Hopkins|date=1 January 1967|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=673|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinean writer [[Djibril Tamsir Niane|Djibril Niane]] suggests in ''Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali'' (1965) that it is not impossible that Mali was the name given to one of the capitals of the emperors. 14th-century Moroccan traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] reported that the capital of the Mali Empire was called Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zf6xAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=niani+mali#v=onepage&amp;q=niani%20mali&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Mali|last=Imperato|first=Pascal James|last2=Imperato|first2=Gavin H.|date=25 April 2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=9780810864023|location=|pages=231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] tradition tells that the legendary first emperor [[Sundiata Keita]] changed himself into a hippopotamus upon his death in the [[Sankarani River]], and that it's possible to find villages in the area of this river, termed "old Mali", which have Mali for a name. This name could have formerly been that of a city. In old Mali, there is one village called Malika which means "New Mali."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/bitstream/123456789/8845/1/A%20Study%20of%20Proverbs%20in%20Things%20Fall%20Apart%20and%20Sundiata%3B%20An%20Epic%20of%20Old%20Mali%20(Sundiata)%20-%202014.pdf|title=A STUDY OF PROVERBS IN THINGS FALL APART AND SUNDIATA: AN EPIC OF OLD MALI (SUNDIATA)|last=Aku Adjandeh|first=Evelyn|date=July 2014|website=|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF GHANA, LEGON – INSTITUTE OF AFRICAN STUDIES|page=100|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of Mali}}
Mali was once part of three famed West African empires which controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, salt, [[slaves]], and other precious commodities.&lt;ref name=p1&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Sahelian kingdom]]s had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; The earliest of these empires was the [[Ghana Empire]], which was dominated by the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], a [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking people.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; The empire expanded throughout West Africa from the 8th century until 1078, when it was conquered by the [[Almoravids]].&lt;ref name=p2&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]]. Mali was later responsible for the collapse of Islamic Slave Army from the North. The defeat of Tukuror Slave Army, was repeated by Mali against the France and Spanish Expeditionary Army in the 1800s ("Blanc et memoires"). . p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mali Empire]] later formed on the upper [[Niger River]], and reached the height of power in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Under the Mali Empire, the ancient cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]] were centers of both trade and Islamic learning.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; The empire later declined as a result of internal intrigue, ultimately being supplanted by the [[Songhai Empire]].&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; The Songhai people originated in current northwestern [[Nigeria]]. The Songhai had long been a major power in West Africa subject to the Mali Empire's rule.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;

In the late 14th century, the Songhai gradually gained independence from the Mali Empire and expanded, ultimately subsuming the entire eastern portion of the Mali Empire.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; The Songhai Empire's eventual collapse was largely the result of a [[Saadi dynasty|Moroccan]] invasion in 1591, under the command of [[Judar Pasha]].&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region's role as a trading crossroads.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Following the [[European exploration of Africa|establishment of sea routes by the European powers]], the trans-Saharan trade routes lost significance.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;

One of the worst [[famine]]s in the region's recorded history occurred in the 18th century. According to [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]], "The worst crises were in the 1680s, when famine extended from the Senegambian coast to the Upper Nile and 'many sold themselves for slaves, only to get a sustenance', and especially in 1738–1756, when West Africa's greatest recorded subsistence crisis, due to drought and locusts, reportedly killed half the population of [[Timbuktu]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

Mali fell under the control of France during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; By 1905, most of the area was under firm French control as a part of [[French Sudan]].&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; In early 1959, French Sudan (which changed its name to the Sudanese Republic) and [[Senegal]] united to become the [[Mali Federation]]. The Mali Federation gained independence from France on 20 June 1960.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;

Senegal withdrew from the federation in August 1960, which allowed the Sudanese Republic to become the independent Republic of Mali on 22 September 1960, and that date is now the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://maliembassy.us/index.php/2012-02-27-16-59-35/public-holidays |title=Public Holidays |website=Embassy of the Republic of Mali to the United States |language=en-gb |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modibo Keïta]] was elected the first president.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Keïta quickly established a one-party state, adopted an independent African and socialist orientation with close ties to the East, and implemented extensive nationalization of economic resources.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; In 1960, the population of Mali was reported to be about 4.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530011412/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/897ce24a48d43c82802565f700407640 Core document forming part of the reports of states parties: Mali].

===Moussa Traoré===
On 19 November 1968, following progressive economic decline, the Keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by [[Moussa Traoré]],&lt;ref name=p3&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; a day which is now commemorated as [[Liberation Day]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} The subsequent military-led regime, with Traoré as president, attempted to reform the economy.

BBC News. 9 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts. The Traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt;

The government continued to attempt economic reforms, and the populace became increasingly dissatisfied.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt; In response to growing demands for multi-party democracy, the Traoré regime allowed some limited political liberalization. They refused to usher in a full-fledged democratic system.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt; In 1990, cohesive opposition movements began to emerge, and was complicated by the turbulent rise of ethnic violence in the north following the return of many [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] to Mali.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt;

Anti-government protests in 1991 led to a coup, a transitional government, and a [[Constitution of Mali|new constitution]].&lt;ref name=p3/&gt; Opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of General Moussa Traoré grew during the 1980s. During this time strict programs, imposed to satisfy demands of the International Monetary Fund, brought increased hardship upon the country's population, while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth.

====March Revolution====
From 22 March through 26 March 1991, mass pro-democracy rallies and a nationwide strike was held in both urban and rural communities, which became known as ''les évenements'' ("the events") or the March Revolution. In Bamako, in response to mass demonstrations organized by university students and later joined by trade unionists and others, soldiers opened fire indiscriminately on the nonviolent demonstrators. Riots broke out briefly following the shootings. Barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and Traoré declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew. Despite an estimated loss of 300 lives over the course of four days, nonviolent protesters continued to return to Bamako each day demanding the resignation of the dictatorial president and the implementation of democratic policies.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesbitt |first=Katherine |title=Mali's March Revolution (1991) |url=http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=34&amp;sobi2Id=10 |publisher=International Center on Nonviolent Conflict |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616222251/http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=34&amp;sobi2Id=10 |archivedate=16 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

26 March 1991 is the day that marks the clash between military soldiers and peaceful demonstrating students which climaxed in the massacre of dozens under the orders of then President Moussa Traoré. He and three associates were later tried and convicted and received the death sentence for their part in the decision-making of that day.

By 26 March, the growing refusal of soldiers to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds turned into a full-scale tumult, and resulted in thousands of soldiers putting down their arms and joining the pro-democracy movement. That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré. As a consequence, opposition parties were legalized and a national congress of civil and political groups met to draft a new democratic constitution to be approved by a national referendum.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"/&gt;

{{Main|Geography of Mali}}
Mali is a landlocked country in West Africa, located southwest of [[Algeria]]. It lies between latitudes [[10th parallel north|10°]] and [[25th parallel north|25°N]], and longitudes [[13th meridian west|13°W]] and [[5th meridian east|5°E]]. Mali is bordered by [[Algeria]] to the northeast, [[Niger]] to the east, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to the south, [[Guinea]] to the south-west, and [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]] to the west.

At {{convert|1242248|km2|sqmi|0|sigfig=3}}, Mali is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|24th-largest country]] and is comparable in size to South Africa or [[Angola]]. Most of the country lies in the southern [[Sahara Desert]], which produces an extremely hot, dust-laden [[Sudan (region)|Sudanian savanna]] zone.&lt;ref name=geography&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Mali is mostly flat, rising to rolling northern plains covered by [[sand]]. The [[Adrar des Ifoghas]] massif lies in the northeast.

Mali lies in the [[Geographical zone#Torrid Zone|torrid zone]] and is among the hottest countries in the world. The [[thermal equator]], which matches the hottest spots year-round on the planet based on the mean daily annual temperature, crosses the country.&lt;ref name=geography/&gt; Most of Mali receives negligible rainfall and droughts are very frequent.&lt;ref name=geography/&gt; Late June to early December is the rainy season in the southernmost area. During this time, flooding of the Niger River is common, creating the [[Inner Niger Delta]].&lt;ref name=geography/&gt; The vast northern desert part of Mali has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] (''BWh'') with long, extremely hot summers and scarce rainfall which decreases northwards. The central area has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] (''BSh'') with very high temperatures year-round, a long, intense dry season and a brief, irregular rainy season. The little southern band possesses a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. ([[Köppen climate classification]] (''AW'') In review, Mali’s climate is subtropical to arid, with February to June being the hot, dry season. June to November is rainy, humid and mild. November to February is the cool, dry season.

Mali has considerable natural resources, with gold, uranium, [[phosphates]], [[kaolinite]], salt and [[limestone]] being most widely exploited. Mali is estimated to have in excess of 17,400 tonnes of uranium (measured + indicated + inferred).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wise-uranium.org/uoafr.html#ML Uranium Mine Ownership – Africa].

=== Extent of central government control ===
In March 2012, the Malian government lost control over Tombouctou, Gao and Kidal Regions and the north-eastern portion of Mopti Region. On 6 April 2012, the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] unilaterally declared their secession from Mali as [[Azawad]], an act that neither Mali nor the international community [[diplomatic recognition|recognised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/06/205763.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Tuareg rebels declare the independence of Azawad, north of Mali|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government later regained control over these areas.

The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Mali was a [[constitutional democracy]] governed by the Constitution of 12 January 1992, which was amended in 1999.&lt;ref name=p14/&gt; The constitution provides for a separation of powers among the executive, [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches of government.&lt;ref name=p14&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The system of government can be described as "semi-presidential".&lt;ref name=p14/&gt; Executive power is vested in a president, who is elected to a five-year term by [[universal suffrage]] and is limited to two terms.&lt;ref name=p14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Const|Constitution of Mali]], Art. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Mali}}
[[File:Rutte and Touré.jpg|Former President of Mali [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] and Minister-president of the Netherlands [[Mark Rutte]]|thumb]]
Mali's foreign policy orientation has become increasingly pragmatic and pro-Western over time.&lt;ref name=p17&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the institution of a democratic form of government in 2002, Mali's relations with the West in general and [[Mali-United States relations|with the United States]] in particular have improved significantly.&lt;ref name=p17/&gt; Mali has a longstanding yet ambivalent relationship with France, a [[French Sudan|former colonial ruler]].&lt;ref name=p17/&gt; Mali was active in regional organizations such as the [[African Union]] until its suspension over the [[2012 Malian coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=p17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/2012323134643629717.html|title=ion suspends Mali over coup|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=23 March 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working to control and resolve regional conflicts, such as in [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]], is one of Mali's major foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name=p17/&gt; Mali feels threatened by the potential for the spillover of conflicts in neighboring states, and relations with those neighbors are often uneasy.&lt;ref name=p17/&gt; General insecurity along borders in the north, including cross-border [[banditry]] and terrorism, remain troubling issues in regional relations.&lt;ref name=p17/&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Further|Military of Mali}}

[[Military of Mali|Mali's military forces]] consist of an army, which includes land forces and air force,&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt; as well as the paramilitary Gendarmerie and Republican Guard, all of which are under the control of Mali's Ministry of Defense and Veterans, [[civilian control of the military|headed by a civilian]].&lt;ref name=ns&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The military is underpaid, poorly equipped, and in need of rationalization.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

The [[Central Bank of West African States]] handles the financial affairs of Mali and additional members of the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |work=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Mali |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ml.html |year=2009|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average worker's annual salary is approximately US$1,500.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

Mali underwent economic reform, beginning in 1988 by signing agreements with the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; During 1988 to 1996, Mali's government largely reformed public enterprises. Since the agreement, sixteen enterprises were privatized, 12 partially privatized, and 20 liquidated.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; In 2005, the Malian government conceded a railroad company to the Savage Corporation.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; Two major companies, Societé de Telecommunications du Mali ([[SOTELMA]]) and the Cotton Ginning Company ([[Compagnie malienne pour le développement du textile|CMDT]]), were expected to be privatized in 2008.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

Between 1992 and 1995, Mali implemented an economic adjustment programme that resulted in economic growth and a reduction in financial imbalances. The programme increased social and economic conditions, and led to Mali joining the [[World Trade Organization]] on 31 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/mali_e.htm Mali and the WTO]. World Trade Organization. Retrieved 24 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mali is also a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref name="ohada.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa | url = http://www.ohada.com/index.php | accessdate =22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gross domestic product (GDP) has risen since. In 2002, the GDP amounted to US$3.4&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref name=p9&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased to US$5.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2005,&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mali|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2828.htm |accessdate=4 June 2008 |date=May 2008|publisher=[[U.S. State Department]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which amounts to an approximately 17.6 percent annual growth rate.

Mali is a part of the "Franc Zone" (''Zone Franc''), which means that it uses the [[CFA franc]]. Mali is connected with the French government by agreement since 1962 (creation of [[BCEAO]]). Today all seven countries of BCEAO (including Mali) are connected to French Central Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/eurosysteme-et-international/zone-franc.html Zone franc sur le site de la Banque de France]. Banque-france.fr. Retrieved 24 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
Mali's key industry is agriculture. Cotton is the country's largest crop export and is exported west throughout Senegal and Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name=Goldenhope&gt;{{cite news | first=Briony | last=Hale | title=Mali's Golden Hope | date=13 May 1998 |publisher=BBC News  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1945588.stm | accessdate =4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite book | last = Cavendish | first = Marshall | title = World and Its Peoples: Middle East, Western Asia, and Northern Africa | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year = 2007 | location = Tarrytown, New York | isbn = 978-0-7614-7571-2|page=1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2002, 620,000 tons of cotton were produced in Mali but cotton prices declined significantly in 2003.&lt;ref name=Goldenhope/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; In addition to cotton, Mali produces rice, [[millet]], [[Maize|corn]], vegetables, tobacco, and tree crops. Gold, livestock and agriculture amount to 80% of Mali's exports.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

Eighty percent of Malian workers are employed in agriculture. 15 percent of Malian workers are employed in the service sector.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; Seasonal variations lead to regular [[temporary employment|temporary unemployment]] of agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=May| last = May | first = Jacques Meyer | title = The Ecology of Malnutrition in the French Speaking Countries of West Africa and Madagascar | publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company | year = 1968 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-848960-5 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
In 1991, with the assistance of the [[International Development Association]], Mali relaxed the enforcement of mining codes which led to renewed foreign interest and investment in the mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell| first = Bonnie | title = Regulating Mining in Africa: For Whose Benefit? | publisher=Nordic African Institute | year = 2004 | location = Uppsala, Sweden | isbn = 978-0-7614-7571-2 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold is mined in the southern region and Mali has the third highest gold production in Africa (after South Africa and [[Ghana]]).&lt;ref name=Goldenhope/&gt;

The emergence of gold as Mali's leading export product since 1999 has helped mitigate some of the negative impact of the cotton and Ivory Coast crises.&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural resources include [[kaolin]], salt, [[phosphate]], and [[limestone]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

=== Energy ===
{{See also|List of power stations in Mali}}
Electricity and water are maintained by the Energie du Mali, or EDM, and textiles are generated by Industry Textile du Mali, or ITEMA.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; Mali has made efficient use of [[hydroelectricity]], consisting of over half of Mali's electrical power. In 2002, 700 [[KWh#Multiples|GWh]] of hydroelectric power were produced in Mali.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

Energie du Mali is an electric company that provides electricity to Mali citizens. Only 55% of the population in cities have access to EDM.&lt;ref&gt;Farvacque-Vitkovic, Catherine ''et al.''

World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport infrastructure ===
{{Main|Transport in Mali}}
In Mali, there is a railway that connects to bordering countries. There are also approximately 29 airports of which 8 have paved runways. Urban areas are known for their large quantity of green and white [[taxicab]]s. A significant sum of the population is dependent on [[public transportation]].

Mixed European/African descendants of Muslims of [[Spanish people|Spanish]], as well some French, Irish, Italian and Portuguese origins live in Mali, they are known as the [[Arma people]] (1% of the nation's population). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=q3mx8aAo6x0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|first1=J.

Although Mali has enjoyed a reasonably good inter-ethnic relationships based on the long history of coexistence, some hereditary servitude and bondage relationship exist, as well as ethnic tension between settled [[Songhai people|Songhai]] and nomadic Tuaregs of the north.&lt;ref name=p6/&gt; Due to a backlash against the northern population after independence, Mali is now in a situation where both groups complain about discrimination on the part of the other group.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S.

(cover text)&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict also plays a role in the continuing [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|Northern Mali conflict]] where there is a tension between both Tuaregs and the Malian government, and the Tuaregs and radical [[Islamist]]s who are trying to establish [[sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/06/mali-war-over-skin-colour Mali's conflict and a 'war over skin colour'], Afua Hirsch, ''The Guardian'', Friday 6 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam was introduced to West Africa in the 11th century and remains the predominant religion in much of the region. An estimated 90 percent of Malians are [[Islam in Mali|Muslim]] (mostly [[Sunni]],&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=2 June 2014 | date=9 August 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life}}&lt;/ref&gt;), approximately 5 percent are Christian (about two-thirds [[Roman Catholicism in Mali|Roman Catholic]] and one-third [[Protestantism|Protestant]]) and the remaining 5 percent adhere to [[African traditional religion|indigenous or traditional animist beliefs]].&lt;ref name = IRFR&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108379.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Mali]. State.gov (19 September 2008). Retrieved 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] are believed to be rare among Malians, most of whom practice their religion on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;

The constitution establishes a [[secular state]] and provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government largely respects this right.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;

Islam as historically practiced in Mali has been malleable and adapted to local conditions; relations between Muslims and practitioners of minority religious faiths have generally been amicable.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;
After the 2012 imposition of [[sharia]] rule in northern parts of the country, however, Mali came to be listed high (number 7) in the Christian persecution index published by [[Open Doors]], which described the persecution in the north as severe.&lt;ref name = DeutscheWelle&gt;[http://www.dw.de/report-points-to-100-million-persecuted-christians/a-16507067 Report points to 100 million persecuted Christians.].

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Mali}}
[[File:Lycéens kati.jpg|thumb|left|High school students in [[Kati]]]]

Public education in Mali is in principle provided free of charge and is compulsory for nine years between the ages of seven and sixteen.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; The system encompasses six years of primary education beginning at age 7, followed by six years of secondary education.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; Mali's actual primary school enrollment rate is low, in large part because families are unable to cover the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and other fees required to attend.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;

In the 2000–01 school year, the primary school enrollment rate was 61 percent (71 percent of males and 51 percent of females). In the late 1990s, the secondary school enrollment rate was 15 percent (20 percent of males and 10 percent of females).&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; The education system is plagued by a lack of schools in rural areas, as well as shortages of teachers and materials.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;

Estimates of literacy rates in Mali range from 27–30 to 46.4 percent, with literacy rates significantly lower among women than men.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; The [[University of Bamako]], which includes four constituent universities, is the largest university in the country and enrolls approximately 60,000 undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Université de Bamako – Bamako, Mali|url=http://globalhealth.northwestern.edu/meded/current-affiliations/Bamako_Mali.html|publisher=Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine|accessdate=8 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513192022/http://globalhealth.northwestern.edu/MedEd/current-affiliations/Bamako_Mali.html|archivedate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===
{{main|Health in Mali}}
Mali faces numerous health challenges related to poverty, [[malnutrition]], and inadequate [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=p7&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 53.06 years in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html?countryName=Mali&amp;countryCode=ml&amp;regionCode=afr&amp;rank=206#ml CIA World Factbook]: Life Expectancy ranks&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; In 2001, the general government expenditures on health totalled about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate.&lt;ref name=p8&gt;[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts have been made to improve nutrition, and reduce associated health problems, by encouraging women to make nutritious versions of local recipes. For example, the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) and the [[Aga Khan Foundation]], trained women's groups to make ''equinut'', a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe ''di-dèguè'' (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/04/Nourishing-Communities-Through-Holistic-Farming ''Nourishing communities through holistic farming''], Impatient optimists, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, and medicines are in short supply.&lt;ref name=p8/&gt; [[Malaria]] and other [[arthropod]]-borne diseases are prevalent in Mali, as are a number of [[infectious disease]]s such as [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=p8/&gt; Mali's population also suffers from a high rate of child malnutrition and a low rate of [[immunization]].&lt;ref name=p8/&gt; An estimated 1.9 percent of the adult and children population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year, among the lowest rates in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=p8/&gt; An estimated 85–91 percent of Mali's girls and women have had [[female genital mutilation]] (2006 and 2001 data).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html WHO | Female genital mutilation and other harmful practices].

The '''Third Siege of Krujë''' by the [[Ottoman Empire]] occurred in 1467 at [[Krujë]] in [[Albania]].

The destruction of [[Ballaban Badera|Ballaban Pasha]]'s army and the siege of [[Elbasan]] during the previous siege of Krujë forced [[Mehmed II]] to re-attack [[Skanderbeg]] in the summer of 1467, only 2 months after the latter's victory at the [[Siege of Krujë (1466–67)|2nd Siege of Krujë]]. This time [[Skanderbeg]] didn't retreat immediately to the mountains, but decided for the first time to front the great [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army at Burshek, on the [[Shkumbin]] river's valley in order to give time for the civil population to retreat in the mountains. The battle was carried in such a way as to not result with winners or defeated; [[Skanderbeg]] then retreated while Ottoman [[grand vizier]] [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]] pursued him but [[Skanderbeg]] succeeded in fleeing to the coast and then to the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrides|2001|pp=163, 164}}  {{quote|. Mehmed II sent Mahmud Pasha, together with the most experienced part of the army, to pursue [[Skanderbeg]], while he himself ravaged the rest of the land ... The Grand Vezir spent fifteen days in the mountains, but couldn't find Skanderbeg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Mehmed II sent detachments to raid the Venetian possessions (especially [[Durrës]] which was also put under siege and bombarded for a short period) and to keep them isolated. He besieged [[Krujë]] for several days but when he realized that he could not take it by assault, he lifted the siege. Although Ottomans did not capture Krujë, they managed to plunder areas around [[Durres]] and [[Shkodër|Scutari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrides|2001|p=163}}{{quote|...taking much booty and many prisoners... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Darcy''' (born 1956) was the first female [[test pilot]] for the [[Boeing]] company. Initially an assistant engineer for the company, she progressed to an instructor role and then a test pilot for a wide range of aircraft.

==Career==
Susan Darcy was born in 1956. She joined the [[Boeing]] company in 1974 as an assistant engineer, but was inspired to fly and began to take lessons in 1977. Around the same time, she attended the [[University of Washington]] to study aeronautics and astronautics, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1981. The following year, she was promoted at Boeing to an instructor in the training department. This job involved training pilots in how the aeroplanes functioned and writing parts of the operations manuals.&lt;ref name="welch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=Rosanne|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Aviation and Space|date=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|isbn=978-0-874369-588|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was promoted to a [[test pilot]] position on October 31, 1985. This made her the first female test pilot employed by the company.&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; In 1986, she was one of the speakers at the first World Aviation Education and Safety Congress, held in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollander|first1=Lu|last2=Jessen|first2=Gene Nora|last3=West|first3=Verna|title=The Ninety-Nines: Yesterday-Today-Tomorrow|date=1996|publisher=Turner Pub.

When she was accredited for the [[Boeing 747-400]] in 1989, she was the first woman to Captain that type of plane. Her job also involved testing prototype planes, and on occasion, flying them to overseas buyers.&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; By 1991, she remained one of two female test pilots for Boeing, alongside [[Rose Looper]] who joined shortly after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mikell|first1=Ann|title=Sky Is The Limit For Test Pilot|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-08-21/news/9108210497_1_test-pilot-loper-flight-test|accessdate=November 19, 2017|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of the promotional Asian tour of the [[Boeing 777]] in 1995, and was part of the team who flew a plane from [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], to [[Seattle]] in a world record time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boeing 777 sets World Record from Bangkok to Seattle|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/BOEING+777+SETS+WORLD+SPEED+RECORD+FROM+BANGKOK+TO+SEATTLE-a016876428|accessdate=November 19, 2017|work=PR Newswire|publisher=TheFreeLibrary|date=April 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tafea''' is the southernmost of the six provinces of [[Vanuatu]].

The name is an [[acronym]] for the five main islands that make up the province: '''T'''anna, '''A'''neityum, '''F'''utuna, '''E'''rromango and '''A'''niwa.

==History==

Unlike the other provinces of Vanuatu, the territorial integrity of this administrative unit has been unchanged since the times of the [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]], when it was called ''Southern District'', or ''Tanna'' after the main island. Only the [[Capital (political)|capital]] moved from [[Lenakel]] to nearby [[Isangel]], less than two kilometers more southeast.

A secessionist movement began in the 1970s, and the Nation of Tanna was proclaimed on March 24, 1974. While the [[United Kingdom|British]] were more open to allowing its holdings in Vanuatu independence, it was opposed by the [[France|French]] colonists and finally suppressed by the [[Anglo-French Condominium]] authorities on June 29, 1974.

In 1980, there was another attempt to secede, declaring the Tafea Nation on January 1, 1980, its name coming from the initials of the five islands that were to be part of the nation (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango and Aneityum). British forces intervened on May 26, 1980, allowing the islands to become part of the newly independent nation of Vanuatu on July 30, 1980.

==Geography==

The province has a population of 32,540&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governmentofvanuatu.gov.vu/index.php/publicationdocuments/vanuatu-statistics 2009 Census Summary release final] - Government of Vanuatu&lt;/ref&gt; people and an area of 1,628&amp;nbsp;km². The main island, though second to [[Erromango]] in area, is [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], with some 80 percent of the province population, with the provincial capital of [[Isangel]], and the largest village of [[Lenakel]], both close together on the southwest coast.

The three larger islands are [[Melanesia]]n, but the smaller two, Aniwa and Futuna, also known under the collective term ''Erronan Islands'', are [[Polynesian outlier]]s. Futuna is sometimes called West Futuna to distinguish it from [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna]].

The island of Tanna has the world's most accessible volcano, [[Mount Yasur]], with 1,084 meters the highest peak of the province. [[Aniwa Island]] is the only [[coral]] island, the other four are [[volcano|volcanic]] and reach much higher elevations than Aniwa.

[[Anatom]] is the southernmost island of Vanuatu (not counting the remote, tiny and uninhabited [[Matthew and Hunter Islands]], {{convert|280|to(-)|335|km|abbr=off}} to the southeast, which are disputed with [[New Caledonia]], but which are considered by the people of Anatom Island part of their custom ownership). Its southeastern cape ''Nétchan Néganneaing'' is the southernmost point of land in Vanuatu, more southerly than the southern satellite islet [[Inyeug]]. The latter, however, is surrounded [[Intao Reef]], that extends even further south, albeit submerged, thus being the southernmost feature of Vanuatu.

'''Trade Unions''' play a major role in the [[corporatist]] '''[[Dutch economy]]'''.

== Dynamics ==
In 2001 about 25% of the Dutch people who were employed were organized in a union. There are three major unions: the [[Christian-democracy in the Netherlands|Christian-democratic]] "[[Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond|Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond (CNV)]]", the [[social democracy in the Netherlands|social-democratically oriented]] "[[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV)]]" and the "[[Federation of Managerial and Professional Staff Unions|Federation of Managerial and Professional Staff Unions (MHP)]]". All are federations of sector-based labour unions. The FNV is with about 1,4 million members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fnv.nl/publiek/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023124053/http://www.fnv.nl/publiek/ |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; the largest of the three. The CNV has 350.000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnv.nl/speciaal/english/|title=English|website=Cnv.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; members and the MHP 160.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vakcentralemhp.nl/organisatie.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222175122/http://www.vakcentralemhp.nl/organisatie.asp |archivedate=2013-02-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The FNV has 17 affiliate unions, the CNV 11 and the MHP 4. 

The labour unions play a major role in the [[Economy of the Netherlands|Dutch economy]] because, first, they bargain with [[employers' organizations]] over wages and working conditions (these deals are binding for all employed people), and second, they advise the government on economic legislation through its membership of the [[Social-Economic Council|Social-Economic Council (SER)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ser.nl/en/about_the_ser/members.aspx|title=Members of the SER - SER|website=Ser.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Dutch labour unions were part of the [[pillarization|pillarized structure of society]]. Each social group had a pillar: the [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestants]] (CNV), the [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholics]] ([[NKV]], merged into FNV), the social-democrats ([[Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen|NVV]], merged into FNV) and the syndicalists ([[National Labor Secretariat|NAS]]).

In [[economics]], a '''virtual airline''' is an [[airline]] that has [[outsource]]d as many possible operational and business functions as it can, but still maintains effective control of its core business.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Such an airline focuses on operating a network of air services, and outsourcing non-core activities to other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Contracting out services within the aviation industry has reportedly become so common that many carriers could be classed as having features of a virtual airline, although it is arguable whether any current carriers meet a strict definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe travel companies and ticket agencies that market themselves as airlines, but are unlicensed and with flights undertaken by licensed operators often in the livery of the virtual airline.

==Origins==

Virtual airlines originated following the drastic changes brought about by the [[Airline Deregulation Act of 1978]]. During the hyper-competitive years immediately following deregulation, [[mainline (flight)|major airlines]] found it increasingly unprofitable to compete against start-up carriers on many routes they currently served. Instead of forfeiting the routes entirely, the larger carriers often made marketing arrangements with smaller airlines to fly under the "banner", or  [[aircraft livery]], of the larger airline. These [[regional airline]]s, mimicking the well known major airlines in adverts and prescribing to make connections as seamless as possible, soon abandoned their own local service routes. In most cases, the regional airlines found it more profitable to serve the mainline hubs as a feeder operation rather than operate on their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
