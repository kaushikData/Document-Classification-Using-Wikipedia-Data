==History==

21c Museum Hotel was launched in 2006 by philanthropists and art collectors Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson. The pair had seen farmland and rural landscapes fall to development while the historic buildings of Louisville's downtown sat vacant. They created 21c in Louisville's downtown arts and theater district to support both [[urban renewal]] and regional agriculture, and have developed partnerships with local growers to supply produce and ingredients for the Proof on Main restaurant and bar.

Following the success of the Louisville location, additional 21c locations were put into motion, with 7 currently in operation and more in the planning or construction stages.

In July 2018, 21C Museum Hotels was acquired by the French Hotel Group [[AccorHotels]] for a sum of $51 Million. Founders Brown and Wilson maintain a 15% stake and continue to be involved with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2018/07/31/21c-museum-hotels-sold-to-international-hotel.html|title=21c Museum Hotels to be sold to international hotel chain|last=Mann|first=David|date=July 31, 2018|website=BizJournals.com|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|aleatory}}
'''Aleatoricism''' is the incorporation of [[randomness|chance]] into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. The word derives from the Latin word ''alea'', the rolling of [[dice]]. "Aleatory" should not be confused with either [[improvisation]] or [[indeterminacy in music|indeterminacy]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"&gt;Sabine Feisst, "Losing Control: Indeterminacy and Improvisation in Music Since 1950", ''New Music Box'' (1 March 2002): § [http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=35tp02 "Aleatory—Pierre Boulez"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Charles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book ''The Virtual Muse''.&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;
{{Citation

  | title = The Virtual Muse: Experiments in Computer Poetry

  | isbn =  0-8195-2239-2}}
 (see especially pp. 54–64.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
{{see also|Automatic drawing|Surrealist automatism|Pareidolia|Apophenia}}

==Music==
{{main|Aleatoric music}}
The term [[aleatoric music|aleatory music]] was first coined by [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is "determined in general but depends on chance in detail".&lt;ref&gt;Werner Meyer-Eppler. 1957. "Statistic and Psychologic Problems of Sound", translated by Alexander Goehr, ''Die Reihe'' 1 ("Electronic Music", 1957): 55–61; original German edition, 1955, as "Statistische und psychologische Klangprobleme", ''Die Reihe'' 1 ("Elektronische Musik", 1955): 22–28; the citation is on pp. 55 and 22, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German  noun ''Aleatorik'' as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, "aleatoric".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jacobs, "Admonitoric Note", ''The Musical Times'' 107, no. 1479 (May 1966): 414.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Boulez]] applied the term in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the [[indeterminate music]] of [[John Cage]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"/&gt; While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another prolific composer of aleatory music was [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"/&gt;

Aleatoric techniques are sometimes used in contemporary film music. Examples can be found in [[John Williams]]'s scores as well as, for example, [[Mark Snow]]'s music for ''X-Files: Fight the Future''.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Karlin and Rayburn Wright, ''On the Track: A Guide to Contemporary Film Scoring'', second edition (New York: Routledge, 2004): 430–36. {{ISBN|0-415-94135-0}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-415-94136-9}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In film-making, there are several avant-garde examples;  one is Andy Voda's ''Chance Chants''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchceC3rV2k Andy Voda's film "Chance Chants"]&lt;/ref&gt; which features Allison Knowles' computer poem "House of Dust",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aknowles.com Alison Knowles website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fred Camper]]'s ''SN'' (1984, first screening 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Camper, [http://www.fredcamper.com/F/SN.html "''SN'', a film by Fred Camper"], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; uses coin-flipping for one section to determine which three of 16 possible reels to screen and what order they should go in (3360 permutations).

Film scholar [[Barry Salt]] directed the 1971 film ''Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|1053919|Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order (1971)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/50946 "Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order (1971)"], BFI Film &amp; TV Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alien Weaponry''' is a [[thrash metal]] band from [[Waipu, New Zealand|Waipu]], [[New Zealand]], formed in 2010 by brothers Henry and Lewis de Jong. 
The band consists of Lewis de Jong (guitar and vocals), Henry de Jong (drums), and Ethan Trembath (bass guitar). All three members have [[Māori]] ancestry and several of their songs are written in [[te reo Māori]].

==History==
Alien Weaponry was formed in [[Auckland]] in 2010 by guitarist and vocalist Lewis de Jong and drummer Henry de Jong who were only 8 and 10 years old respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talented Waipu kids form band: Alien Weaponry|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&amp;objectid=11179845 |accessdate=31 December 2013|work=NZHerald|publisher=Northern Advocate |date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alien Weaponry Facebook Page |url=https://www.facebook.com/316119405127962/posts/316124311794138/|accessdate=18 December 2010|work=Alien Weaponry|publisher=Facebook|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers named the band Alien Weaponry after watching the movie [[District 9]] and after moving to the small town of [[Waipu, New Zealand|Waipu]] were joined by bass guitarist Ethan Trembath in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talented Waipu kids form band: Alien Weaponry|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&amp;objectid=11179845|accessdate=31 December 2013|work=NZHerald|publisher=Northern Advocate|date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trembath replaced Wyatt Channings who had briefly played bass for the band the previous year. 

In 2016 the band won both the national finals of [[Smokefreerockquest]] and Smokefree Pacifica Beats&amp;mdash;the only band to have ever won both events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smokefreerockquest national finals results 2015 |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1509/S00187/smokefreerockquest-national-finals-results-2015.htm |accessdate=14 September 2015|work=Scoop|publisher=Scoop|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had previously come second in the 2015 Smokefree Rockquest, and been regional finalists for four years running. The band also toured with New Zealand chart topping band [[Devilskin]] on their "We Rise" tour in 2014 and performed at The Powerstation in support of [[Shihad]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shihad shoulder-tap a dream come true for Alien Weaponry|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/68483342/shihad-shouldertap-a-dream-come-true-for-alien-weaponry|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=stuff|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Devilskin: We Rise Tour|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503438&amp;objectid=11313964|accessdate=25 August 2014 |work=NZHerald |publisher=Rotarua Daily Post|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alien Weaponry are believed to be youngest recipients to have ever received New Zealand on Air funding with their song "Ru Ana Te Whenua" in October 2015. They received a $10,000 grant to complete recording of their song and produce a video in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waipu's Alien Weaponry lands $10,000 grant for thrash metal song in te reo Maori|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/whangarei-leader/73672201/waipus-alien-weaponry-lands-10000-grant-for-thrash-metal-song-in-te-reo-maori.html|accessdate=4 November 2015|work=stuff|publisher=Whangarei Leader|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then another two $10,000 NZ On Air grants in 2016 to record their singles "Urutaa" and "Raupatu" and produce music videos. 

In 2016 the band was named by UK Metal Hammer Magazine as one of New Zealand's top 10 hard rock and metal acts.

=== Albums ===
Alien Weaponry released their début EP "The Zego Sessions" and in August 2014 and began work on a new album at [[Neil Finn]]'s [[Roundhead Studios]] in Auckland with record producer [[Tom Larkin]] in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are these teenage metallers NZ's next big thing?|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11542937|accessdate=20 November 2015|work=NZHerald|publisher=nzherald|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waipu's Alien Weaponry lands $10,000 grant for thrash metal song in te reo Maori |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/whangarei-leader/73672201/waipus-alien-weaponry-lands-10000-grant-for-thrash-metal-song-in-te-reo-maori.html|accessdate=4 November 2015 |work=stuff |publisher=Whangarei Leader|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alien Weaponry |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nat-music/audio/201763702/alien-weaponry|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Music 101|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 Alien Weaponry released their single and music video for "Urutaa" as the first offering from their upcoming album. February 2017 saw the release of their second single "Raupatu" and in July 2017 they released "Rū Ana Te Whenua".

On 1 June 2018 their album Tū was released,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/te-reo-thrash-metal-band-alien-weaponrys-album-t-hits-number-one-new-zealand-chart&lt;/ref&gt; debuting at number five on the New Zealand album charts &lt;ref&gt;https://nztop40.co.nz/chart/albums?chart=4487&lt;/ref&gt;, the top New Zealand album of the week.&lt;ref&gt;https://nztop40.co.nz/chart/nzalbums?chart=4487&lt;/ref&gt; The album had over a million streams on Spotify in its first week of release; and tracks from it were added to over 8,000 playlists worldwide, including Spotify's own metal genre playlists New Blood, New Metal Tracks, Kickass Metal and Thrash Metal Big 4 &amp; Friends. Songs from the album were also playlisted by over 50 radio stations in the USA in its first week, with the band’s single ‘Kai Tangata’ rocketing to no.1 on the prestigious ‘Devil’s Dozen’ countdown for the Liquid Metal show on New York based Sirius XM toppling metal heavyweights [[Parkway Drive]] from the top slot.

== Musical style and lyrical themes ==

Alien Weaponry's début single, "Urutaa", is sung partly in the [[Māori language]] and was originally about a clash of ideas and expectations leading to stress and unhappiness, which was likened to a plague or ''urutaa'' (an outbreak). The Maori lyrics refer to events that occurred in the [[Bay of Islands]] in the 1800s and what followed after a pocket watch was inadvertently dropped into the harbour. The misunderstanding culminated in the [[Boyd massacre|burning of the Boyd]], a grim set of events in New Zealand's colonial history. Says the band "This incident is used in this song as a metaphor for the misunderstandings that continue to plague us today – between cultures, generations and individuals who torment each other through lack of understanding."

The band's second single "Raupatu" (released in February 2017) is about [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscations by the New Zealand colonial government]] in the 1800s and the unjust legislation of 1863 that allowed it to happen. Their third single, "Rū Ana te Whenua" (the trembling earth), released 1 July 2017, refers to the mighty battle at Pukehinahina/[[Gate Pa]] in 1864 where their great great great grandfather, Te Ahoaho, lost his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2017/12/05/567304737/this-new-zealand-band-is-trying-to-save-maori-culture-one-head-banger-at-a-time | title = This New Zealand Band Is Trying To Save Maori Culture One Head Banger At A Time | date = 5 December 2017 | accessdate = 6 December 2017 | publisher = ''NPR'' | author = Ashley Westerman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MS&amp;nbsp;5236''' (inventory number of the [[Schøyen Collection]]) is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[amulet]] of the 6th century BC, which is unique in two respects: it is the only known magic amulet of the time inscribed with a text that was stamped as opposed to incised, and it is the only extant specimen of [[ephesia grammata]] made of [[gold]]. The only partially comprehensible inscription is an invocation of the god [[Apollo|Phoebus Apollo]] and may have been composed in [[central Greece]] or western [[Asia Minor]]. As such magical amulets are known to have been mass-produced, the existence of MS&amp;nbsp;5236 indicates that, despite the singularity of the foil, an inkless [[block printing]] process was practised in ancient Greece to a certain degree,&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1–2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brekle 1–5"/&gt; for texts of some length, beyond the examples known from [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s and the many types of stamps used to mark bricks and pottery with the maker's name and other details. 

== Description ==
The lamella is registered under the inventory number MS&amp;nbsp;5236 by the private [[Norway|Norwegian]] Schøyen Collection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com The Schøyen Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was studied by the British classicist [[Dominic Montserrat]].&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1–2"&gt;Montserrat: [http://epub.uni-regensburg.de/16319/ "Report on Early Greek Gold Lamella"], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The printing technique of the inscription was specifically analysed by the German [[typographer]] [[Herbert Brekle]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="Brekle 1–5"&gt;Brekle: [http://epub.uni-regensburg.de/16319/ "Analyse der Herstellungstechnik der Inschrift auf einem Goldamulett in der Schoyen Collection (London/Oslo)"], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–5&lt;/ref&gt;

MS&amp;nbsp;5236 is made of a thin, rectangular gold sheet of 2.8 x 9.0 x 0.1&amp;nbsp;cm, which is inscribed on one side. The ancient Greek text comprises six lines [[Writing direction|written from left to right]]; margins all around the text body suggest that its contents are fully preserved. The surface of the gold foil is marked by many small creases that have grown together into cracks. Unlike later amulets, it appears to have never been rolled up or folded for personal use.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1"&gt;Montserrat, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and date ==
The [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] analysis of the [[letterform]] indicates an early, [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] date. The script used does not clearly match any local variant of the [[Greek alphabet]]: certain letter shapes indicate an origin in [[Attica]] or [[Euboea]], while other letters point to the [[Ductus (linguistics)|ductus]] common in western [[Asia Minor]], particularly that of [[Knidos]]. Overall, the comparison with other early Greek documents suggests a creation of the text in the middle of the 6th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1"/&gt;

== Inscription and use ==
[[File:Amulet MS 5236. Transcription 01.jpg|thumb|Transcribed inscription which opens with the words "O Phoebus Apollo who rules over man..."]]

Even though the Greek text is legible on the whole (see [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to [[grammatical]] and [[syntactical]] peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked in order to raise his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient [[epigraphic]] and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1–2"/&gt;

According to Montserrat, important characteristics of MS&amp;nbsp;5236 most closely correspond to the ''ephesia grammata'', magic amulets whose incantatory words were supposedly fixed in writing on the cult statue of [[Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]], and which were carried on the body to ward off harm. Although these metal sheets circulated in the Greek world in huge numbers, only [[lead]] examples have survived, rendering the gold foil among the ''ephesia grammata'' unique.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 2"&gt;Montserrat, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Block print ==
The special significance of MS&amp;nbsp;5236 lies in the way the inscription was created. A close examination shows that a blind-stamping process was used to reproduce the Greek text on the lamella, with a single matrix carrying the whole text. In this, MS&amp;nbsp;5236 differs fundamentally from other amulets of the time, where the magic formulas were incised by hand, such as with a [[stylus]], into the metal foil.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1–2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brekle 1–5"/&gt;

The entire process is reconstructed by Brekle as follows: First, the inscription's text was engraved with an [[iron]] stylus into an even [[copper]] or [[bronze]] block, with its letters facing the opposite direction and running from right to left. The displaced material rose up on both sides of the letter grooves forming two sharp, parallel ridges. In the second step, the inscribed side of the stamp block was placed on the plane gold sheet and sufficient pressure, either manually or by hammering onto a plate laid on top, was exerted from above to transmit the text. What produced the print image were the ridges caused by the material displacement; these left shallow double lines in the foil, thus creating the text. The actual, sunken letter lines were not transferred during the imprinting procedure, since they did not enter the surface of the foil.&lt;ref name="Brekle 3–4"&gt;Brekle, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the existence of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS&amp;nbsp;5236 as being stamped and not written. Because it is a matter of mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a [[bas-relief]], which was produced by a bas-relief stamp.&lt;ref name group="A."&gt;Montserrat, in contrast, interprets MS&amp;nbsp;5236 as a [[high relief]], which was created by [[relief printing]]. However, this assumption is—as Brekle states (p.&amp;nbsp;2–3)—flawed in several ways, as it was beyond the technical capabilities of the time to carve out the very delicate and fragile double lines in high relief from the stamp surface. Moreover, this procedure would have needed the high-relief stamp to be pressed through the gold foil from the reverse side—a method, however, by which the letter impressions would have appeared too blurred. The only possible remedy, namely the contouring of the letters by way of a prepared pad underneath, whose bas-relief forms correlate perfectly with those of the high-relief stamp, was not technically feasible then, either. This proves Montserrat's high-relief hypothesis to be untenable.&lt;/ref&gt; If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of [[Drypoint|drypoint etching]], by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS&amp;nbsp;5236 is a colourless blind print.&lt;ref name="Brekle 3–4"/&gt;

A further indication for the use of a printing technique is the varying strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of the foil was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked here. If the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into the foil, these variations would not have occurred.&lt;ref name="Brekle 4"&gt;Brekle, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the stroke order of the letters on the stamp, it can be said that the Hasta, the mostly vertical main line, was normally executed before the Coda figures.&lt;ref name="Brekle 5"&gt;Brekle, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; 

MS&amp;nbsp;5236 is an overall rare and possibly unique print from the early Greek era.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brekle 5"/&gt; Despite this, the widespread use of magical amulets indicates that such block prints were, at least from the present prototype, mass-produced at that time.&lt;ref name="Montserrat 1–2"/&gt;

'''Anti-Americanism''' (also called '''Anti-American sentiment''', and '''Americanophobia''')&lt;ref&gt;Denis Lacorne, "Anti-Americanism and Americanophobia: A French Perspectives." (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; is a sentiment that espouses a dislike of or opposition to the [[American government]] or its policies, especially in regards to its [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]], or to [[Americans]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiozza|first1=Giacomo|title=Anti-Americanism and the World Order|date=2009|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Brendon O'Connor of the [[United States Studies Centre]] suggests that "anti-Americanism" cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon, since the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices, and criticisms evolving to more politically-based criticism. French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term "anti-Americanism" is "only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole."&lt;ref name="OConnor"&gt;O'Connor, Brendan: [http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/1_04/OConnor.pdf "A Brief History of Anti-Americanism from Cultural Criticism to Terrorism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521145809/http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/1_04/OConnor.pdf |date=21 May 2013 }}, ''Australasian Journal of American Studies'', 23(1), July 2004, pp. 77–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Brendan, p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and [[expatriate]] William Russell Melton described that criticism for the United States largely originates from the perception that the U.S. wants to act as a "world policeman."&lt;ref&gt;William Russell Melton. ''The New American Expat: thriving and surviving overseas in the post-9/11 world''. (Intercultural Press 2005. p. XIX.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative or critical views of the United States' influence have increased in recent years in Russia, the [[Middle East]], Latin America, North Korea, Iran, Turkey, as well as in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia,&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center Poll"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpoll/&gt; but remains low in [[Vietnam]], [[Israel]], the [[Philippines]], and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center Poll"/&gt;

==Etymology==
In the online [[Oxford Dictionary]] the term "anti-American" is defined as "hostile to the interests of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anti--American?q=anti-american |title=anti-American: definition of anti-American in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of Webster's [[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]] (1828) the term "anti-American" was defined as "opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=antiamerican&amp;use1913=on&amp;use1828=on |title=The ARTFL Project – Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913+1828) |publisher=Machaut.uchicago.edu |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305190842/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=antiamerican&amp;use1913=on&amp;use1828=on |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France the use of the noun form 'antiaméricanisme' has been catalogued from 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Le Petit Robert {{ISBN|2-85036-668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Phillipe.

Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been polarized. Anti-Americanism has been described by Hungarian-born American sociologist [[Paul Hollander]] as "a relentless critical impulse toward American social, economic, and political institutions, traditions, and values".&lt;ref name=Hollander2007&gt;Hollander, Paul [http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/politics_of_envy.htm The Politics of Envy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906002655/http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/politics_of_envy.htm |date=6 September 2010 }}, The New Criterion, November 2002.

German newspaper publisher and political scientist [[Josef Joffe]] suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060501fareviewessay85311a/walter-russell-mead/through-our-friends-eyes-defending-and-advising-the-hyperpower.html |title=Through Our Friends' Eyes – Defending and Advising the Hyperpower |accessdate=12 April 2008 |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=May–June 2006 |publisher=[[Foreign Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706145354/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060501fareviewessay85311a/walter-russell-mead/through-our-friends-eyes-defending-and-advising-the-hyperpower.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=dmy }} Review of Josef Joffe's ''Überpower: The Imperial Temptation of America.''&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous [[ideology|ideological]] current, comparable to [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-markovits-05.htm |date=August 2005 |title=European Anti-Americanism (and Anti-Semitism): Ever Present Though Always Denied |first=Andrei S. |last=Markovits |work=Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism: Web Publications |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |accessdate=1 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051401/http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-markovits-05.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically U.S. moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Robert. ''Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Its status as an "[[-ism]]" is a greatly contended suspect, however. Brendon O'Connor notes that studies of the topic have been "patchy and impressionistic," and often one-sided attacks on anti-Americanism as an irrational position.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; American academic [[Noam Chomsky]], a prolific critic of U.S. and its policies, asserts that the use of the term within the U.S. has parallels with methods employed by [[totalitarian]] states or military dictatorships; he compares the term to "[[anti-Sovietism]]", a label used by the [[Kremlin]] to suppress dissident or critical thought, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/chomskypa.htm Interviewing Chomsky] {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021113190538/http://www.zmag.org/chomskypa.htm |date=13 November 2002 }} Preparatory to Porto: Alegre ''Zmagazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept "anti-American" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as "anti-Soviet". That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: "One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled "anti-American" by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejas.revues.org/document1523.html |title=Pierre Guerlain, '&amp;#39;A Tale of Two Anti-Americanisms'&amp;#39; (European Journal of American Studies 2007) |publisher=Ejas.revues.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerlain argues that these two "ideal types" of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult. Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti-Americanisms, specific to country and time period, more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenstein, Peter and Robert Keohane.

Globally, increases in perceived anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions,&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Peter W.

For this reason, critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Brendan, op. cit., p 78: "...&amp;nbsp;Cold War (1945–1989) ... In this period the false and disingenuous labeling of objections to American policies as 'anti-Americanism' became more prominent."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degeneracy thesis===
In the mid- to late-eighteenth century, a theory emerged among some European intellectuals that the New World landmasses were inherently inferior to Europe. The so-called "degeneracy thesis" held that climatic extremes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Rubin |authorlink=Barry Rubin |author2=Rubin, Judith Colp |title=Hating America: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-530649-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–19}} American author James W.

The theory originated with [[Comte de Buffon]], a leading French naturalist, in his ''Histoire Naturelle'' (1766).&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; The French writer [[Voltaire]] joined Buffon and others in making the argument.&lt;ref name=Meunier/&gt; Dutchman [[Cornelius de Pauw]], court philosopher to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] became its leading proponent.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked people native to the continent.&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt; James Ceaser has noted that the denouncement of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government's fear of mass emigration; de Pauw was called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in a similar direction.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KF0pySH-ozsC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=%22jackson+pollock%22+%2B%22americanism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6sXBdkD73C&amp;sig=_JKOhWX74h70jsh7KIk6D44o59M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q7lMT-ezMpL74QTIupDMAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jackson%20pollock%22%20%2B%22americanism%22&amp;f=false Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Pauw said that the New World was unfit for human habitation because it was, "so ill-favored by nature that all it contains is either degenerate or monstrous". He asserted that, "the earth, full of putrefacation, was flooded with lizards, snakes, serpents, reptiles and insects". Taking a long-term perspective he announced that he was, "certain that the conquest of the New World...has been the greatest of all misfortunes to befall mankind".&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Old World's New World'' (1991) p 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory made it easy to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture. Echoing de Pauw, the [[Encyclopédie|French Encyclopedist]] [[Abbé Raynal]] wrote in 1770, "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James W. Ceaser|title=Reconstructing America: The Symbol of America in Modern Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5kvAruS5H0C&amp;pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Yale U.P.|page=26. Note: Ceaser writes in his endnote to this sentence (p. 254), that "...in later editions of his work, Raynal exempted North America, but not South America, from this criticism".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]; Jefferson, in his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1781), provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon from a scientific point of view.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in [[Federalist No. 11]] (1787).&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;

One critic, citing Raynal's ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Danzer | first =Gerald A. |date=February 1974 | title =Has the Discovery of America Been Useful or Hurtful to Mankind?

Where in the paper is the idea "specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States"?--&gt;}}

Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific, America that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon's ideas formed the root of a "stratification of negative discourses" that has recurred throughout the two countries' relationship (and has been matched by persistent [[Francophobia|anti-Gallic]] sentiment in the United States).&lt;ref name=Granthem/&gt;

===Culture===
According to Brendan O'Connor, some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking "taste, grace and civility" and having a brazen and arrogant character.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt; British author [[Frances Trollope]] observed in her 1832 book ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' that the greatest difference between England and the United States was "want of refinement", explaining "that polish which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature is unknown and undreamed of" in America.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in 2004 as {{Cite book

[[Simon Schama]] says: "By the end of the nineteenth century, the stereotype of the [[Ugly American (pejorative)|ugly American]] – voracious, preachy, mercenary, and bombastically chauvinist – was firmly in place in Europe".&lt;ref name=Schama&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/10/030310fa_fact|title=The Unloved American |accessdate=23 May 2008 |work=The New Yorker |date=10 March 2003|first=Simon|last=Schama | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619033559/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/10/030310fa_fact| archivedate= 19 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor suggests that such prejudices were rooted in an idealised image of European refinement and that the notion of high European culture pitted against American vulgarity has not disappeared.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt;

===Politics and ideology===
The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of [[reason]] and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet [[Nikolaus Lenau]] commented: "With the expression ''Bodenlosigkeit'' (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled ''Tired of America'' (''Der Amerika-Müde'') (1855) by fellow German [[Ferdinand Kürnberger]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1974) edited by William Rose Bennet: 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of American democracy was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked "[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; The [[French Revolution]], which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery.&lt;ref name=Schama/&gt; "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" asked [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/books/review/04staples.html?pagewanted=1 |title= Give Us Liberty|accessdate=26 May 2008 |last=Staples |first=Brent |date=4 June 2006 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He famously stated that, "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American".&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

==Modern ideological articulations==

===Intellectuals===
[[File:Vreeswijk Akerstrom Cervin 1965.jpg|thumb|Protest march against the [[Vietnam War]] in Stockholm, [[Sweden]], 1965]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] was vehemently anti-American. Historian [[Peter Gay]] says that in "slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was ventilating some inner need". Gay suggests that Freud's anti-Americanism was not really about the United States at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Vann Woodward|title=The Old World's New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gW64cHXNrRsC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1992|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous authors went on the attack. French writer [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]] denounced the United States. German poet [[Rainer Marie Rilke]] wrote, "I no longer love Paris, partly because it is disfiguring and Americanizing itself".&lt;ref name="C. Vann Woodward 1992 34"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Vann Woodward|title=The Old World's New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gW64cHXNrRsC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1992|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist critiques===
Until its demise in 1991, the Soviet Union and other Communist nations emphasized capitalism as the great enemy of Communism, and identified the U.S. as the leader of the capitalist nations. They sponsored anti-Americanism of all kinds among followers and [[fellow traveller]]s. Berman notes that in the mid-19th century, "Marx himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell A. Berman|title=Anti-Americanism in Europe: A Cultural Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8687I9FjRm8C&amp;pg=PT58|year=2004|publisher=Hoover Press|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor argues that, "communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism – a coherent worldview that challenged the free market, private property, limited government, and individualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan O'Conner|title=The Rise of Anti-Americanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=au8edbGaTGQC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors in the west, such as [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] went on the attack and reached a large audience on the far left.&lt;ref name="C. Vann Woodward 1992 34"/&gt; In his ''Anti-Americanism'' (2003), French writer [[Jean François Revel]] argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from [[anti-capitalism]], and this critique also comes from non-Communist, totalitarian regimes.

[[File:NKmuseum.jpg|thumb|North Koreans touring the [[Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities|Museum of American War Atrocities]] in 2009]]
The East German regime imposed an official ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools. Anyone who indicated the least deviation invited a visit from the [[Stasi]] (secret police). The official line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov's]] theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the "terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street".&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," in  Detlef Junker, et al. eds. ''The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945–1968: A Handbook, Vol. 2: 1968–1990''  (2004)  pp 618–626, quotation on page 619.&lt;/ref&gt;

East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the evil Americans. However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it. They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasts, and West German media. The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock 'n roll. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin wall of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," 2:618-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist critiques===
{{Further|Melting pot}}
Drawing on the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882), [[Fascism in Europe|European fascists]] decried the supposed degenerating effect of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]] argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which had a supposedly pure-bred racial stock.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–2}}

[[Anti-Semitism]] was another factor in these critiques. The view that the U.S. was controlled by a [[Zionist Occupied Government|Jewish conspiracy]] through a [[Jewish lobby]] was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–7}} The Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind American plans for world domination, were also seen as using [[jazz]] in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions;&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–7}} [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] did not count America as a credible adversary of the Third Reich because of its incoherent racial mix; they saw Americans as a "mongrel race", "half-Judaised" and "half-Negrified".&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|94–7}}

In an address to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]:

{{quote|He [Roosevelt] was strengthened in this [political diversion] by the circle of Jews surrounding him, who, with Old Testament-like fanaticism, believe that the United States can be the instrument for preparing another [[Purim]] for the European nations that are becoming increasingly [[anti-Semitic]]. It was the Jew, in his full Satanic vileness, who rallied around this man [Roosevelt], but to whom this man also reached out.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Friedlander (2008) ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939–1945''.

The "Liberators" poster distributed by Nazis in 1944 to a Dutch audience displays multiple elements of anti-American attitudes promoted by the Nazis. The title ''Liberators'' refers to a common Allied justification for attacking Germany (as well as the American [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber), and the poster depicts this "liberation" as the destruction of European cities. The artist was [[Harald Damsleth]], a Norwegian who worked for the [[Nasjonal Samling|NS]] in occupied Norway.
* The decadence of beauty pageants (scantily-clad "[[Miss America]]" and "Miss Victory", "The World's Most Beautiful Leg") – or more generally, the putative sexual laxness of American women.

* Anti-semitism appears in most Nazi images of America. A Jewish banker is seen behind the money.
* The presence of blacks in America equals its "mongrelization", adding undesirably "primitive" elements to American popular culture, and constituting a potential danger to the white race (strongly muscular arms of a black male, a stereotypically-caricatured black couple dancing the "[[Jitterbug]] – Triumph of Civilization" in birdcage, which is portrayed as a degraded animalistic ritual).

* Decadence of American popular culture, and its pernicious influence on the rest of the world (dancing of jitterbug, hand holds phonograph record, figure of a European gullible "all-ears" dupe in lower foreground).

** Hence the suggested falsity of American claims to be "Liberators" (the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] was also the name of a U.S. bomber plane).

In a book called ''The Rise of Anti-Americanism'', published in 2006, Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the [[September 11 attacks]] were "quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&amp;pg=PA21 21]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ask, "If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leaders in Islamic countries, including [[Afghanistan]], condemned the attacks. [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their [[crimes against humanity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks draw mixed response in Mideast |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=12 September 2001 |accessdate=30 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813060324/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html |archivedate=13 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe was highly sympathetic to the United States after the 9/11 attack. NATO unanimously supported the United States, treating an attack on the US as an attack on all of them after [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article 5]] of the NATO treaty was invoked for the very first (and, {{As of|2018|08|27|lc=y|post=,}} last) time. NATO and American troops entered Afghanistan ({{As of|alt=and remain there in 2018|2018|07|post=,}} despite various schedules for withdrawals and surges). When the United States decided to invade and overthrow the Iraqi regime in 2003, it won considerable support in Europe, especially from Britain, but also intense opposition, led by Germany and France. [[Konrad Jarausch]] argues that there was still fundamental agreement on such basic issues of support for democracy and human rights. However, there emerged a growing gap between an American "libertarian, individualistic, market outlook, and the more statist, collectivist, welfare mentality in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Konrad|last=Jarausch|title=Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century|date=2015|pages=759–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. computer technology===
A growing dimension of anti-Americanism is fear of the pervasiveness of U.S. internet technology. This can be traced from the very first computers which were either British ([[Colossus computer|Colossus]]) or German ([[Z1 (computer)|Z1]]) through to the World Wide Web itself (invented by Englishman [[Tim Berners-Lee]]). In all these cases the U.S. has commercialized all these innovations.

Americanization has advanced through widespread [[high speed Internet]] and smart phone technology since 2008, With a large fraction of the new apps and hardware being designed in United States. In Europe, there is growing concern about excess Americanization through Google, Facebook, Twitter, the iPhone and Uber, among many other U.S. internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants. There is fear that they are significantly evading taxes, and posting information that may violate European privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;See "Google under fire in Europe over user privacy concerns" [https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/04/08/google-under-fire-in-europe-over-user-privacy-concerns.html ''Toronto Star '' 8 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' in 2015 reported "deep concerns in Europe's highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Fairless, "Europe's Digital Czar Slams Google, Facebook," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-digital-czar-slams-google-facebook-over-selling-personal-data-1424789664 ''Wall Street Journal'' 24 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation of anti-Americanism===
Sometimes developments help neutralize anti-Americanism. In 2015, the United States Department of Justice went on the attack against corruption at [[FIFA]], arresting many top world soccer leaders long suspected of bribery and corruption. In this case the U.S. government's self-defined role as "policeman of the world" won widespread international support.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Barkin, "World's policeman wins rare applause for FIFA crackdown," [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/28/us-soccer-fifa-usa-power-idUSKBN0OD1Z720150528 ''Reuters'' 28 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional anti-Americanism==

===Europe===
[[File:Yankee go home.jpg|thumb|250px|Banner expressing anti-American sentiments in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 2006]]
In a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:
* Representations, images and stereotypes (from the birth of the Republic onwards)
* The challenge of economic power and the American model of modernization (principally from the 1910s and 1920s on)
* The organized projection of U.S. political, strategic and ideological power (from World War II on)
He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1426.html |title=Anti-Americanism: Why Do Europeans Resent Us? |author=David Ellwood  |publisher=George Mason university : History News Network |date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] unilateralism of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fabbrini |first=Sergio |title=Layers of Anti-Americanism: Americanization, American Unilateralism and Anti-Americanism in a European Perspective |journal=European Journal of American Culture |date=September 2004 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=79–94 |doi=10.1386/ejac.23.2.79/0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the specific policy decisions, that are decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Fabbrini, "Anti-Americanism and US foreign policy: Which correlation?," ''International Politics'' (Nov 2010) 47#6 pp. 557–573.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[George W. Bush]] administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Global Attitudes Project poll showed "favourable opinions" of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain. In Spain, unfavorable views of Americans rose from 30% in 2005 to 51% in 2006 and positive views of Americans dropped from 56% in 2005 to 37% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Europe in 2002, vandalism of American companies was reported in [[Athens]], [[Zürich]], [[Tbilisi]], Moscow and elsewhere. In [[Venice]], 8 to 10 masked individuals claiming to be anti-globalists attacked a [[McDonald's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In Athens, at the demonstrations commemorating the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising|17 November Uprising]] there was a march toward the U.S. embassy to emphasize the U.S. backing of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] attended by many people each year.

Ruth Hatlapa, a PhD candidate at the [[University of Augsburg]], and Andrei S. Markovits, a professor of Political Science at the [[University of Michigan]], describe President Obama's image as that of an angel – or more precisely, a rock star – in Europe in contrast to Bush's devilish image there; they argue, however, that "Obamamania" masks a deep-seated distrust and disdain of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatlapa | first1 = Ruth | last2 = Markovits | first2 = Andrei | year = 2010 | title = Obamamania and Anti-Americanism as Complementary Concepts in Contemporary German Discourse | url = | journal = German Politics and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 69–94 | doi=10.3167/gps.2010.280105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In France, the term [[Anglo-Saxon world|"Anglo-Saxon"]] often is used in expressions of anti-Americanism or [[Anglophobia]]. It also has had more nuanced uses in discussions by French writers on French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chabal | first1 = Emile | date = Spring 2013 | title = The Rise of the Anglo-Saxon: French Perceptions of the Anglo-American World in the Long Twentieth Century | url = | journal = French Politics, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 24–46 | doi=10.3167/fpcs.2013.310102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 caused dismay among the French right, which already was angry at the lack of American support during [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu in 1954]]. For the Socialists and Communists of the [[French left]], it was the [[Vietnam War]] and U.S. imperialism that were the sources of resentment.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: In the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJkMN0hjOw8C|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-027-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YJkMN0hjOw8C&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, the alleged [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction in Iraq]] affair certainly dirtied the previously favourable image. In 2008, 85% of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2008/opi20081002-l-opinion-des-francais-sur-la-crise-financiere-internationale.htm In France, 85 % French consider the US banks and government as responsible for the current crisis, published poll, 10/05/2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010002832/http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2008/opi20081002-l-opinion-des-francais-sur-la-crise-financiere-internationale.htm |date=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her contribution to the seminal book ''Anti-Americanisms in World Politics'' edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, [[Sophie Meunier]] writes about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=4604 Book Review: Anti-Americanisms in world politics], Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 33% of the French had a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" view of Americans and 36% viewed the U.S. in a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" light.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion of the United States|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/custom-analysis/ |publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power. He writes in 2013:
:America functioned as the "other" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped [sic] ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kuisel, "The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power," ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41–45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{Main|Anti-American sentiment in Germany}}
German naval planners in the 1890–1910 era denounced the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as a self-aggrandizing legal pretension to dominate the West hemisphere. They were even more concerned with the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty|possible American canal in Panama]], because it would lead to full American hegemony in the Caribbean. The stakes were laid out in the German war aims proposed by the Navy in 1903: a "firm position in the West Indies," a "free hand in South America," and an official "[[revocation]] of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]" would provide a solid foundation for "our trade to the [[West Indies]], [[Central America|Central]] and South America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk Bönker|title=Militarism in a Global Age: Naval Ambitions in Germany and the United States before World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Nhk1cMHoYC&amp;pg=PA61|year=2012|publisher=Cornell U.P.|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the official government policy in [[East Germany]], and dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti-Americanism was the common position on the left, but the majority praised America as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Diner, ''America in the eyes of the Germans: an essay on anti-Americanism'' (Markus Wiener Publishers, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After reunification in 1990, the Communist Party in the East struggled on under a new name, "Die Linke", and maintained its old anti-American position. Today it warns that America is plotting to spoil Germany's friendly relationship with Russia. Germany's refusal to support the American war on Iraq in 2003 was often seen as a manifestation of anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomas Forsberg, "German foreign policy and the war on Iraq: anti-Americanism, pacifism or emancipation?." ''Security Dialogue'' (2005) 36#2 pp: 213–231. [https://dk-media.s3.amazonaws.com/AA/AT/gambillingonjustice-com/downloads/275731/German_foreign_policy_and_the_war_on_Iraq-_anti-Americanism__pacifism_or_emancipation.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but reemerged in the 21st century especially in the [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Merkel.&lt;ref&gt;"Ami go Home," [https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21642211-anti-americanism-always-strong-german-left-growing-right-ami-go-home  ''Economist'' 7 February 2015, p 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
Although the Dutch have generally held a favorable attitude toward America, there were negative currents in the aftermath of World War II as the Dutch blamed American policy for the loss of their [[Dutch East Indies|colonies in Southeast Asia]] to [[Indonesia]]. They credit their rescue from the Nazis in 1944–45 to the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teitler | first1 = G. | year = 1987 | title = Sea Power on the Decline: Anti-Americanism and the Royal Netherlands Navy, 1942–1952 | url = | journal = European Contributions to American Studies | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 72–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postwar attitudes continued the perennial ambiguity of anti-Americanism: the love-hate relationship, or willingness to adopt American cultural patterns while at the same time voicing criticism of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroes | first1 = Rob | year = 1987 | title = The Great Satan Versus the Evil Empire: Anti-Americanism in the Netherlands | url = | journal = European Contributions to American Studies | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 37–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, anti-Americanism revived largely in reaction against the Vietnam War. Its major early advocates were non-party-affiliated, left-wing students, journalists, and intellectuals. Dutch public opinion polls (1975–83) indicate a stable attitude toward the United States; only 10% of the people were unswervingly anti-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = Koen | year = 1987 | title = Anti-Americanism and the Dutch Peace Movement | url = | journal = European Contributions to American Studies | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 97–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most strident rhetoric came from the left wing of Dutch politics and can largely be attributed to the consequences of Dutch participation in NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGraaf | first1 = Bob | year = 1987 | title = Bogey or Saviour?

Russia has a long history of Anti-Americanism, dating back to the early days of the [[Cold War]]. In some of the latest Russian population polls, United States and its allies, constantly top the list of "greatest threats".&lt;ref name="fom"&gt;[http://fom.ru/globe/10096 ФОМ: Старый враг лучше новых двух], FOM: An old enemy is better than two new&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levada"&gt;[http://www.levada.ru/press/2009061001.html Левада-центр: Друзья и враги России] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620213458/http://www.levada.ru/press/2009061001.html |date=20 June 2013 }}, Levada-center: Friends and Foes of Russia&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 30% of Russians had a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" view of Americans and 40% viewed the U.S. in a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" light, up from 34% in 2012.&lt;ref name="pew"/&gt; Recent Polls from the [[Levada center|Levada center survey]] shows that 71% of Russians have a negative or somewhat negative attitude to the U.S., up from 38% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/06/05/anti-american-sentiment-on-the-rise-in-russia/ Anti-American Sentiment on the Rise in Russia]".

In comparison to the [[History of Russia (1992–present)#"Shock Therapy"|1990s]] the number of Russians unhappy with American policies at that time was only under 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://rt.com/politics/163892-russians-usa-bad-attitude/ |title=Russians' disapproval of US actions hits all-time high – RT Russian politics |publisher=Rt.com |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a new poll by the Levada center showed that 81% of Russians now hold unfavorable views of the United States, presumably as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions imposed against Russia because of the [[Ukrainian Crisis]]. Anti-Americanism in Russia is reportedly at its highest since the end of the [[Cold War]]. Sarah Mendelson argues that "As part of a broad crackdown on dissent after the eruption of antigovernment protests in 2011, Putin has managed to close nearly all space [used by] independent, critical voices."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah E.  Mendelson, "Generation Putin: What to Expect from Russia's Future Leaders."

====Ireland====
Some [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]] generally viewed the United States as the successor of the British Empire. This position became most persistent when Republicanism became dominated by socialists during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Irish Republican support for Palestinian Statehood, Arab Socialism, Latin American and African left-wing liberation movements and Serbia's claim over Kosovo as well as America's special relationship with the United Kingdom has been also been used to justify an anti-American stance. Anti-American sentiment has also increased among the general public since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and the American military's usage of civilian facilities at [[Shannon Airport]] which potentially jeopardises Ireland's official neutrality stance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====East Asia====

=====China=====
In China, there has been a history of anti-Americanism, beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900, which the US military participated in.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]], the US provided economic and military assistance to the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] regime against the Japanese invasion. In particular, the [[China Hands]], American diplomats known for their knowledge of China, also attempted to establish diplomatic contacts with [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists [[Dixie Mission|in their stronghold in Yan'an]], with a goal of fostering unity between the Nationalists and Communists.&lt;ref&gt;John Service, ''The Amerasia Papers: Some Problems in the History of US – China Relations'' (Berkeley, CA: Center for Chinese Studies, U of California Press, 1971), 191 – 192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, relations soured after communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the relocation of the Chiang regime to [[Taiwan]], together with the start of the [[Cold War]] and rise of [[McCarthyism]] in US politics. While the US initially expected the Chiang regime to quickly fall, China and the US fought a major undeclared [[Korean War|war in Korea, 1950–53]], and as a result, President [[Harry S. Truman]] began advocating a policy of containment and sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] to deter a possible communist invasion of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry S Truman, “Statement on Formosa,” January 5, 1950|url=http://china.usc.edu/harry-s-truman-%E2%80%9Cstatement-formosa%E2%80%9D-january-5-1950|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US signed the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with Taiwan, which lasted until 1979, and during this period, the communist government in Beijing was not diplomatically recognized by the US. By 1950, virtually all American diplomatic staff had left mainland China, and one of Mao's political goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qiu Xu | first1 = Guang | year = 2000 | title = U.S. Air Aid and the CCP's Anti-American Campaign, 1945–1949 | url = | journal = Air Power History | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 24–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael M.

Mao initially ridiculed the U.S. as a "[[paper tiger]]," occupiers of Taiwan, "the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself" and "monopoly capitalist groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mao Tse Tung |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch06.htm |title=Quotations from Mao Tse Tung – Chapter 6 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was argued that Mao never intended on friendly relations with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Sheng, ''Battling Western Imperialism: Mao, Stalin, and the United States'' (Princeton University Press, 1997) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and increasing tension between China and the Soviet Union, US President [[Richard Nixon]] signaled a diplomatic reapproachement with communist China, and [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|embarked on an official visit in 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=Richard|title=Announcement of the President's Trip to China|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2258|work=US-China documents collection|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic relations between the two countries were eventually restored in 1979. After Mao's death, [[Deng Xiaoping]] embarked on economic reforms, and hostility diminished sharply, while large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors. Following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the US placed economic and military sanctions upon China, although official diplomatic relations continued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/world/the-west-condemns-the-crackdown.html The West Condemns the Crackdown], New York Times, 5 June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-American and Chinese nationalist sentiments surged following the [[Yinhe incident]] of 1993, where a Chinese ship was detained by the US Navy in international waters, allegedly containing chemical components headed for Iran, but was eventually cleared after months of inspection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/06/world/no-chemical-arms-aboard-china-ship.html "No chemical arms aboard China ship"], ''New York Times'', 6 September 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1996 has led Chinese officials to be concerned about a supposed [[China containment policy]], and began viewing the United States as responsible for major issues that arise in the bilateral relationship between China and Taiwan, as they believe that American support of Taiwan is an effort to weaken their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ma, Ying |title=China's America Problem |journal=Policy Review|date=February–March 2002|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there is also a sense of disillusionment with the US among Chinese intellectuals, and popular books such as [[China Can Say No]] criticized US foreign policy towards China and promoted grassroots Chinese nationalism. Relations became severely strained by the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in May 1999, which was blamed on an intelligence error but which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. The bombing, alongside the perceived lack of apology from the US, led to mass protests in Beijing and other major Chinese cities. In 2001, diplomatic relations were further damaged by the [[Hainan Island incident]], where a collision between an US and Chinese aircraft resulted in the death of the Chinese pilot and detainment of the 24 American crew.

The election of US President [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 also signified a shift in American foreign policy towards China, and then Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] called for a "Pivot to Asia", or rebalancing of US strategic and economic interests in East Asia, specifically freedom of navigation patrols in the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|title=America's Pacific Century|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century|accessdate=7 June 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move is widely seen as attempts to counter Chinese interests in the region, and in response, the Chinese military began their own buildup in the region, such as the creation of its own [[Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea)|Air Defense Identification Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/special-reports/crisis-in-korea/china-criticizes-increase-in-us-forces-in-asia-1.216769 |title=China criticizes increase in US forces in Asia |last1=BODEEN |first1=CHRISTOPHER |date=16 April 2013 |work=Stars and Stripes |publisher=AP |accessdate=16 April 2013 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, in 2009, Luo Ping, a director-general at the [[China Banking Regulatory Commission]], criticized America's laissez-faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the [[United States Treasury]] would start to print money and depreciate the value of the U.S. dollar, thus cheapening the value of China's purchase of U.S. bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sender |first=Henny |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba857be6-f88f-11dd-aae8-000077b07658.html#axzz1ET01xP6U |title=China to stick with US bonds |work=Financial Times  |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese hackers have also conducted extensive [[cyberwarfare]] against American institutions and citizens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menn |first=Joseph |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a4b497a-34b4-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ET01xP6U |title=Chinese hackers hit energy groups |work=Financial Times |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/hacking/2007-03-11-chinese-hackers-us-defense_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Jon | last=Swartz | title=Chinese hackers seek U.S. access | date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Registration required|date=December 2010}} {{Cite news |author1=Shane, Scott |author2=Lehren, Andrew W. |title=Cables Shine Light into Secret Diplomatic Channels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101129185337/http://www.nytimes.com//2010//11//29//world//29cables.html| archivedate=29 November 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; targeting the U.S. and its Western allies.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi King Urged U.S. To Attack Iran: WikiLeaks|first=Ross |last=Colvin |agency=Reuters |date=28 November 2010|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AP06Z20101128 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin|first=Dan|title=Chinese hackers 'slurped 50 MB of US gov email'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/06/wikileaks_chinese_hacking/|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, China's leaders present their country as an alternative to the meddling power of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kurlantzick23jun23,0,6663104.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Joshua | last=Kurlantzick | title=China's charm offensive | date=23 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 54% of the Chinese had a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" view of Americans and 53% viewed the U.S. in a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" light.&lt;ref name="pew"/&gt;

While the Chinese government officially condemned the [[September 11 attacks]], privately there was a considerable number of Chinese citizens (mostly Chinese nationalists) who celebrated news of the terrorist attacks on U.S. targets. This was not the case in all of China, and in fact, tens of thousands of people visited the U.S. Embassy after the 9/11 attacks, leaving flowers, cards, funeral wreaths and hand-written notes of condolence on the pavement outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/9-11-reminds-Chinese-of-America-global-bully-2558035.php | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | title=9/11 reminds Chinese of America, global bully | date=9 September 2003 | first=Jehangir | last=Pocha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have argued that certain Hollywood films such as ''[[Django Unchained]]'' were allowed to slip past China's [[Film censorship in China|film censorship regime]], as they depicted a negative view of American society. "The film depicts one of America's darker periods, when slavery was legal, which Chinese officials like to use to push back against criticism from the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why China is letting 'Django Unchained' slip through its censorship regime |url=http://qz.com/62717/why-china-is-letting-django-unchained-slip-through-its-censorship-regime/ |publisher=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514072402/http://qz.com/62717/why-china-is-letting-django-unchained-slip-through-its-censorship-regime/ |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{check quotation}}

While protests have arisen because of specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, suggests: "The growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries".&lt;ref name="WilsonProgram"&gt;{{Cite journal

Anti-American sentiment has existed in the Philippines, owing to primarily the [[Philippine–American War]] of more than 100 years ago, and the 1898–1946 period of American colonial rule. In the modern day, the controversial [[Visiting Forces Agreement (Philippines – United States)|Visiting Forces Agreement]] provides an extra means of anti-American sentiment in the country; especially among [[Muslim Filipinos]]

However, despite these incidents, a poll conducted in 2011 by the BBC found that 90% of Filipinos have a favorable view of the U.S., higher than the view of the U.S. in any other country.&lt;ref name="worldpublicopinion.org"&gt;[http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/mar11/BBCEvalsUS_Mar11_rpt.pdf Views of US Continue to Improve in 2011 BBC Country Rating Poll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123070720/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/mar11/BBCEvalsUS_Mar11_rpt.pdf |date=23 November 2012 }}, 7 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Pew Research Center Poll released in 2014, 92% of Filipinos viewed the U.S. favorably, making the Philippines the most pro-American nation in the world.

===Middle East===

After [[World War I]], admiration was expressed for American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s promulgation of democracy, freedom and self-determination in the [[Fourteen Points]] and, during [[World War II]], the high ideals of the [[Atlantic Charter]] received favorable notice.&lt;ref name="Tamim Ansary 2009"&gt;Tamim Ansary (2009) ''Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes'': 333&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tamim Ansary, in ''Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes'' (2009) early views of America in the Middle East and the Muslim World were mostly positive.&lt;ref name="Tamim Ansary 2009"/&gt;

Like elsewhere in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or reiteration of certain policies by the U.S. government, in special its support for Israel in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project/|title=America's Image in the World: Findings from the Pew Global Attitudes Project|date=14 March 2007|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher=Pew Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to 9/11, a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll noted, for example, that while some (3%) Muslims polled opposed the attack, 97% of them (called 'radicals' in the survey) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at U.S. policies.&lt;ref name=gallup937&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZlsZRgzHmgwj6sKpA7PR5F5Ecsw |title=Major survey challenges Western perceptions of Islam |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2013 |publisher=Agence Free Presse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603084234/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZlsZRgzHmgwj6sKpA7PR5F5Ecsw |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, when targeting U.S. or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al-Qaeda included, have made reference to U.S. policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. For example, to explain the [[Khobar Towers bombing]] (in which 19 [[United States Air Force|American airmen]] were killed), Bin Laden, although proven to have not committed the attack, named U.S. support for Israel in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and the [[Qana massacre]], as the reasons behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfM5eJkh3ygC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=sabra+shatila++facts&amp;ei=UYykUNm0BtKq0AXq8ICwBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;q=sabra%20shatila%20%20facts|title=The Structures of Love: Art and Politics Beyond the Transference|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda also cited the U.S. sanctions on and bombing of Iraq in the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] (1991–2003), which exacted a large toll in the Arab country's civilian population, as a justification to kill Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm |title=World Islamic Front Statement Urging Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders |publisher=Fas.org |date=23 February 1998 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although right-wing scholars (e.g. [[Paul Hollander]]) have given prominence to the role that religiosity, culture and backwardness play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn't correlated with poverty, backwardness or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than 'moderates'.&lt;ref name=gallup937 /&gt;

There is also, however, a cultural dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative groups in the Middle East. It may have its origins with [[Sayyid Qutb]]. Qutb, an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] who was the leading intellectual of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], studied in [[Greeley, Colorado]] from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, ''The America I Have Seen'' (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts.&lt;ref&gt;David Von Drehle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822102733/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/february/presence.php A Lesson In Hate] ''Smithsonian Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Wrote Qutb, "They danced to the tunes of the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..."&lt;ref name="Siegel2003-05-06"&gt;Siegel, Robert [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1253796 Sayyid Qutb's America], NPR, ''All Things Considered'', 6 May 2003. Retrieved 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it".&lt;ref name="Siegel2003-05-06" /&gt; He was particularly disturbed by [[jazz]], which he called the American's preferred music, and which "was created by [[Negro]]es to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Amrika allati Ra'aytu'' (The America that I Have Seen) quoted on Calvert (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes.

Qutb's ideas influenced [[Osama Bin Laden]], an anti-American Islamic militant from Saudi Arabia, who was the founder of the [[Jihadi]]st organization [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scheuer, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes'', p.110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Bari Atman (2007) ''The Secret History of Al-Qa'ida''. London: Abacus: 34-5, 65–7&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, bin Laden issued two [[fatwa|fatawa]] – [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|in 1996 and then again in 1998]] – that Muslims should kill military personnel and civilians of the United States until the United States government withdraw military forces from [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]] and withdraw support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden'S Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=20 August 1998 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901093550/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1996 fatwa, entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places", bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) under an [[American Civil War]] statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Wright (2007) ''The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda's Road to 9/11''.

In 2002 and in mid-2004 [[Zogby International]] polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby's 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004. Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE, from 87% who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73% in 2004.&lt;ref name="Zogby"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7080-2004Jul22.html|title=Poll Shows Growing Arab Rancor at U.S|first=Dafna|last=Linzer| date=23 July 2004 |work=The Washington Post|page=A26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair.&lt;ref name="Zogby"/&gt;

A 1953 [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup]] which involved the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] was cited as a grievance.&lt;ref&gt;Tamim Ansary (2009) ''Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes'': 334&lt;/ref&gt; State-sponsored murals characterised as anti-American dot the streets of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dumper|author2=Bruce E.

The [[Iran hostage crisis]] that lasted from 1979 to 1981, in which fifty-two [[Americans]] were held hostage in [[Tehran]] for 444 days, was also a demonstration of anti-Americanism, one which considerably worsened mutual perceptions between the U.S. and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html|title=Iran–U.S. Hostage Crisis (1979–1981)|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jordan====
Anti-Americanism is felt very strongly in [[Jordan]] and has been on the rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the [[Government of Jordan]] is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of [[Jordanians]] is among the highest in the world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although 2017 data indicates negative attitudes towards the U.S. and American people have gone down to 82% and 61% respectively, rates of anti-Americanism in Jordan are still amongst the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1&amp;country=223&amp;response=Favorable|title=Opinion of the United States|date=22 April 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palestine====
In July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, a leader of the Jerusalem-based [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], called for the destruction of America, France, Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the "Nation of Islam". He warned: "We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt," shouted the cleric to the enthusiastic replies of the crowd. "Who do you think we are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar. All glory to Allah".&lt;ref name=warningstowest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/imam-calls-for-us-and-europes-destruction-from-temple-mount-pulpit/|title=imam calls for destruction of US and europe|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hammouri also warned U.S. president Barack Obama that there is an impending rise of a united Muslim empire that will instill religious law on all of its subjects.&lt;ref name="warningstowest"/&gt;

Anti-Americanism in Palestine originates from an opposition to longstanding U.S. [[Israel–United States relations|support of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/148584| Israel National News, retrieved 27/2/16&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, in 2009, anti-American protestors held signs saying "Obama, new president of the American imperialism that is the enemy of the world's people, your hands are also bloody.

===The Americas===
All the countries of the western hemisphere (including Canada, the United States of America, and a region known as Latin America) are often referred to as "The Americas." In the U.S. generally and often outside it, the term "America" and "American" in ordinary parlance in the modern era refers only to the United States of America and its citizens. In the 1890s Cuban writer [[José Martí]] in an essay, "Our America," alludes to his objection to this usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mauricio Augusto Font|author2=Alfonso W.

{{See also|Canada–United States relations#Anti-Americanism|label 1=Canada–United States relations}}
Anti-Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots. When the [[Continental Congress]] was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Military]] invaded Canada, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]]. Although the American [[Articles of Confederation]] later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them. Soon 40,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist refugees]] arrived from the United States, including 2,000 [[Black Loyalists]], many of whom had fought for [[the Crown]] against the American Revolution. To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, [[Plutocracy|ruled by money]] and [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Nossal, Kim Richard, "Anti-Americanism in Canada", ''Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives'' (2007), ed. Brendon O'Connor, pp. 62–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-British imperialists repeatedly warned against American-style republicanism and democracy as little more than mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara Jeannette Duncan|author2=Misao Dean|title=The Imperialist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54osezQz_eQC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Canadian textbooks portrayed the United States in a negative fashion. It had abandoned the British Empire and as a results was disorderly, greedy, and selfishly individualistic. By the 1930s, there was less concern with the United States, and more attention given to Canada's peaceful society, and its heroic efforts on behalf of Civilization in the World War. Close cooperation in the Second World War led to much more favorable image. In the 1945-1965 era, the friendly and peaceful border was stressed. Textbooks emphasized the role of the United States as an international power and champion of freedom with Canada as its influential partner.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Von Heyking, "Talking about Americans: The image of the United States in English-Canadian schools, 1900–1965." ''History of Education Quarterly'' 46.3 (2006): 382-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945-65, there was wide consensus in Canada on foreign and defense policies 1948 to 1957. Bothwell, Drummond and English state:
:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M. Drummond|author3=John English|title=Canada Since 1945: Power, Politics, and Provincialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMaS5cb7s8QC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1989|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the consensus did not last. By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. "Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one."&lt;ref&gt;Bothwell et al., p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the far left, which admired the USSR, anti-Americanism was first adopted by a few leading historians. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, [[Harold Innis]] grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. "We are indeed fighting for our lives," he warned, pointing especially to the "pernicious influence of American advertising....We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold A.

Anti-Americanism, as a political tactic, was sometimes used by the Conservatives to attack the supposed Liberal Party affinity for Americans, as in [[Canadian federal election, 1911|the 1911 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Richard | last2 = Percy | first2 = Michael B. | year = 1980 | title = Reciprocity, Imperial Sentiment, and Party Politics in the 1911 Election | journal = Canadian Journal of Political Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 711–729 | jstor=3230240 | doi=10.1017/s0008423900034004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Americanism thus remained a fixture in Canadian partisan politics, as employed by such leaders as prime minister [[John G. Diefenbaker]] in the 1950s. He was aided in his attacks by the prominent historian [[Donald Creighton]], who also wrote ''The Take-Over'' (1978), a novel about an American takeover.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Granatstein. ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997) pp. 121–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified the United States as the world centre of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest, with its rejection of tradition, its worship of "progress" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and social harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).&lt;ref&gt;Damien-Claude Bélanger, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891–1945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 16, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths state in their book ''Anti-Americanism'' that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterised as anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people, or the U.S. as a country as being anti-American often demonising, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes.
They have also written that the anti-Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities: nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long, nor so central to the political culture as in Canada.&lt;ref name="Brendon O'Connor 2007 https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: Comparative perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-026-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian historian [[Kim Richard Nossal]] thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti-Americanism permeates Canadian political culture, though "designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from Americans".&lt;ref name="Brendon O'Connor 2007 https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71" /&gt; Although [[Jack Granatstein]] has suggested that anti-Americanism was dead in Canada, John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall in their book ''Canada and the United States'' (2002) states that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes, and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Herd Thompson|author2=Stephen J. Randall|title=Canada and the United States: ambivalent allies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVGHdmbzUTwC|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2403-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UVGHdmbzUTwC&amp;pg=PA310 310]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Atwood]] is a leading Canadian author. In her [[dystopia]]n novel [[The Handmaid's Tale|''The Handmaid's Tale'' (1986)]] all the horrible developments take place in the United States near Boston, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape. This reflects her status of being "in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reingard M. Nischik|title=Margaret Atwood: Works and Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_xIap0GDbwC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2000|publisher=Camden House|pages=6, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have seen Gilead (the U.S.) as a repressive regime and the mistreated Handmaid as Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|last2=Chandra|first2=Anshul|title=Margaret Atwood: A Jewel in Canadian Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nKLIv_C8hgC&amp;pg=PA154|year=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|pages=154–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate in 1987 over a free trade agreement between Canada and the United States, Atwood spoke out against the deal, and wrote an essay opposing the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wenchi Lin |url=https://www.eng.fju.edu.tw/worldlit/canada/handmaid.html |title=handmaid |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128154355/http://www.eng.fju.edu.tw/worldlit/canada/handmaid.html |archivedate=28 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] was opposed to the Iraq War and refused to allow Canada to participate in it. A 2003 poll found that 71% of Canadians approved of this decision, while 27% disapproved. Conservative Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] initially supported the Iraq War when elected in 2006 but by 2008, he had changed his mind and stated that the war was "a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/19/canada-iraq-war_n_2902305.html|title=Canada's 'No' To Iraq War a Defining Moment for Prime Minister|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekospolitics.com/articles/torstar-24-03-2003c.html|title=Canadians Back Chrétien on War, Poll Finds|newspaper=Toronto Star|first=Tim|last=Harper|date=22 March 2003|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States President [[George W. Bush]] was "deeply disliked" by a majority of Canadians according to the ''Arizona Daily Sun''. A 2004 poll found that more than two-thirds of Canadians favoured Democrat [[John Kerry]] over Bush in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], with Bush's lowest approval ratings in Canada being in the province of [[Quebec]], where just 11% of the population supported him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azdailysun.com/poll-deep-anti-bush-sentiment-in-canada/article_1c8749cf-9704-5e02-9c7c-159214c9a5f5.html|title=Poll: Deep Anti-Bush Sentiment in Canada|newspaper=Arizona Daily Sun|date=19 October 2004 | author=Associated Press |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian public opinion of [[Barack Obama]] was more positive. A 2012 poll found that 65% of Canadians would vote for Obama in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] "if they could", while only 9% of Canadians would vote for his Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]]. The same study found that 61% of Canadians felt that the Obama administration had been "good" for America, while only 12% felt that it had been "bad". The study also found that a majority of members of all three major Canadian political parties supported Obama, and that Obama had slightly higher approval ratings in Canada in 2012 than he did in 2008. John Ibbitson of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated in 2012 that Canadians generally supported Democratic presidents over Republican candidates, citing how President [[Richard Nixon]] was "never liked" in Canada and that Canadians generally did not approve of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]'s friendship with President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/who-do-canadians-want-to-vote-for-barack-obama/article4219652/|title=Who Do Canadians Want to Vote For?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2101">'''Antipater''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀντίπατρος}}) of [[Acanthus (Greece)|Acanthus]] was a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] of [[ancient Greece]], of uncertain date,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemaeus Chennus]], ''ap.

Cod.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], ''ad [[Homer|Hom.]] [[Odyssey|Od.]]'' xi. p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; probably the same as the one mentioned by the [[Scholiast]] on [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on [[Aristophanes]] Av. 1403&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider this Antipater to be entirely fictional, and a source fabricated by [[Ptolemaeus Chennus]], to assert the existence of a version of the [[Iliad]] that predates [[Homer]]'s, written, Ptolemaeus said, by [[Dares Phrygius]], a participant in the events of the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Mheallaigh | first =Karen ní | title =Reading Fiction with Lucian: Fakes, Freaks and Hyperreality | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] | series =Greek Culture in the Roman World | date =2014 | pages =122 | url =https://books.google.ie/books?id=cru1BAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781316123980 | accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Allen | first =Thomas William | title =The Homeric Catalogue of Ships | publisher =Georg Olms Verlag | date =1921 | pages =30 | url =https://books.google.ie/books?id=uf0qfxC5LjIC | isbn = 9783487420592 | accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kim | first =Lawrence | title =Homer between History and Fiction in Imperial Greek Literature | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] | series =Greek Culture in the Roman World | date =2010 | pages =179 | url =https://books.google.ie/books?id=K7Bg3zRom6QC | isbn = 9781139490245 | accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bahar-e-Shariat''''' (1939) is an [[encyclopedia]] of [[Islamic]] [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence), according to the [[Hanafi]] school, spreading over 20 volumes. Seventeen of its volumes were written by [[Mufti Amjad Ali Aazmi]], a disciple of [[Ahmed Raza Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookhut.net/bahar-e-shariat-urdu-pdf-complete/|title=Bahar e Shariat Book by Amjad Ali Aazmi|author=+Umer Sarwar|work=Download Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final three books were compiled by his disciples after his death. The book is written in simple [[Urdu]]. Laymen, clerics and research scholars, all find it a complete book of Islamic [[Sharia]] with 11624 topics explained briefly yet lucidly.&lt;ref name="Qadri"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moulana Mohammad Iliyas Attar Qadri|title=Method of Salah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYVlCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|publisher=TANVEER AHMED|pages=123–|id=GGKEY:41U7ZHH6L4N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://remmm.revues.org/6019|title=Language, Religion and Politics|author=Rahman, Tariq|work=revues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6942">The '''Bennett scale''', also called the '''Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity''' ('''DMIS'''), was developed by [[Milton Bennett]]. The framework describes the different ways in which people can react to [[cultural difference]]s.

Organized into six “stages” of increasing sensitivity to difference, the DMIS identifies the underlying cognitive orientations individuals use to understand cultural difference. Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of cultural difference, which in turn allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures.  By identifying the underlying experience of cultural difference, predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum.  The first three stages are [[ethnocentric]] as one sees his own [[culture]] as central to reality. Climbing the scale, one develops a more and more ethnorelative point of view, meaning that one experiences one's own culture as in the context of other cultures.
By the fourth stage, ethnocentric views are replaced by ethnorelative views.

== Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity ==
# '''Denial of Difference'''
#* Individuals experience their own culture as the only “real” one.  Other cultures are either not noticed at all or are understood in an undifferentiated, simplistic manner.  People at this position are generally uninterested in cultural difference, but when confronted with difference their seemingly benign acceptance may change to aggressive attempts to avoid or eliminate it. Most of the time, this is a result of physical or social isolation, where the person's views are never challenged and are at the center of their reality.
# '''Defense against Difference'''
#* One’s own culture is experienced as the most “evolved” or best way to live. This position is characterized by dualistic us/them thinking and frequently accompanied by overt negative stereotyping. They will openly belittle the differences among their culture and another, denigrating race, gender or any other indicator of difference. People at this position are more openly threatened by cultural difference and more likely to be acting aggressively against it.  A variation at this position is seen in reversal where one’s own culture is devalued and another culture is romanticized as superior.&lt;ref&gt;While this level may initially be interpreted as a higher level of sensitivity, it is actually consistent with the dualistic thinking characterized by this stage where one culture is seen as good and another culture as bad.  In this case, however, it is one’s own culture that is seen as bad and another’s culture that is seen as good; neither culture is valued in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Minimization of Difference''' 
#* The experience of similarity outweighs the experience of difference. People recognize superficial cultural differences in food, customs, etc.,. but they emphasize human similarity in physical structure, psychological needs, and/or assumed adherence to universal values. People at this position are likely to assume that they are no longer ethnocentric, and they tend to overestimate their tolerance while underestimating the effect (e.g. “privilege”) of their own culture. In other words, as explained by the Canadian Center for Intercultural Learning, “people who adopt this point of view generally approach intercultural situations with the assurance that a simple awareness of the fundamental patterns of human interaction will be sufficient to assure the success of the communication. Such a viewpoint is ethnocentric because it presupposes that the fundamental categories of behavior are absolute and that these categories are in fact our own."
# '''Acceptance of Difference'''
#* One’s own culture is experienced as one of a number of equally complex worldviews. People at this position accept the existence of culturally different ways of organizing human existence, although they do not necessarily like or agree with every way.  They can identify how culture affects a wide range of human experience and they have a framework for organizing observations of cultural difference. We recognize people from this stage through their eager questioning of others. This reflects a real desire to be informed, and not to confirm prejudices. The key words of this stage are “getting to know” or “learning.”
# '''Adaptation to Difference'''
#* Individuals are able to expand their own worldviews to accurately understand other cultures and behave in a variety of culturally appropriate ways.  Effective use of empathy, or frame of reference shifting, to understand and be understood across cultural boundaries. It is the ability to act properly outside of one’s own culture. At this stage, one is able to “walk the talk.”
# '''Integration of Difference'''
#* One’s experience of self is expanded to include the movement in and out of different cultural worldviews.  People at this position have a definition of self that is “marginal” (not central) to any particular culture, allowing this individual to shift rather smoothly from one cultural worldview to another.

==Evolutionary strategies==
In his theory, Bennett describes what changes occur when evolving through each step of the scale. Summarized, they are the following: 
# '''From Denial to Defense''': the person acquires an awareness of difference between cultures
# '''From Defense to Minimization''': negative judgments are depolarized, and the person is introduced to similarities between cultures.
# '''From Minimization to Acceptance''': the subject grasps the importance of intercultural difference.
# '''From Acceptance to Adaptation''': exploration and research into the other culture begins
# '''From Adaptation to Integration''': subject develops empathy towards the other culture.

'''Bevis of Hampton''' (Old French: '''Beuve(s)''' or '''Bueve''' or '''Beavis''' '''de Hanton(n)e'''; Anglo-Norman: '''Boeve de Haumtone'''; Italian: '''Buovo d'Antona''') or '''Sir Bevois''',&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/hampshire/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8481000/8481274.stm Cannes showing of medieval Southampton's Sir Bevois], 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was a legendary English hero and the subject of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]],&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt; Dutch, French,&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt; English,&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt; [[Venetian language|Venetian]],&lt;ref name="Hasenohr"&gt;Hasenohr, 173–4.&lt;/ref&gt; and other medieval metrical [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] that bear his name. The tale also exists in medieval prose, with translations to Romanian, Russian, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, [[Old Norse]] and [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt;

==Legend==

Sir Bevis of Hampton (c. 1324) is a Middle English romance. It contains many themes common to that genre: a hero whose exploits take him from callow youth to hard-won maturity, ending with a serene and almost sanctified death. Supporting him are a resourceful, appealing heroine and faithful servants set against dynastic intrigue, and a parade of interesting villains, both foreign and domestic. The plot has a geographical sweep which moves back and forth from England to the Near East and through most of western Europe, replete with battles against dragons, giants, and other mythical creatures. Forced marriages, episodes of domestic violence, a myriad of disguises and mistaken identities, harsh imprisonments with dramatic escapes, harrowing rescues, and violent urban warfare fill out the protagonist's experiences. Last but not least, he has a horse of such valor that the horse's death at the end of the poem is at least as tragic as that of the heroine, and almost as tragic as that of Bevis himself. Not surprisingly though, this much variety makes the poem a difficult one to characterize with any degree of certainty, and several other factors make it a poem which is perhaps easier to enjoy than to evaluate accurately.

Bevis is the son of Guy, the count of Hampton ([[Southampton]]), and Guy's young wife, who is a daughter of the [[King of Scotland]]. Discontented with her marriage, Bevis's mother asks a former suitor, Doon or Devoun, emperor of Almaine ([[Germany]]), to send an army to murder Guy in a forest. The plot succeeds, and the countess marries Doon. Threatened with future vengeance by her ten-year-old son, she determines to do away with him also, but Bevis is saved from death by a faithful tutor.

Bevis is subsequently sold to [[pirate]]s and ends up at the court of King Hermin, whose realm is variously placed in [[Egypt]] and [[Armenia]]. The legend continues to relate the exploits of Bevis, his defeat of [[Ascapart]], his love for the king's daughter Josiane, his mission to King Bradmond of [[Damascus]] with a sealed letter demanding his own death, his eventual imprisonment, and his final vengeance on his stepfather. After succeeding in claiming his inheritance, however, Bevis is driven into exile and separated from Josiane, with whom he is reunited only after each of them has contracted, in form only, a second union. The story also relates the hero's death and the fortunes of his two sons.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

==Texts==
The oldest version known, ''Boeve de Haumtone'', is an [[Anglo-Norman literature|Anglo-Norman text]] that dates back to the first half of the 13th century. It consists of 3,850 verses written in [[Alexandrine]]s.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt;

Three continental French [[chansons de geste]] of ''Beuve d'Hanstone'', all in [[decasyllable]]s, were written in the 13th century. One is preserved in [[BnF Français 25516]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Förster|first=Wendelin|authorlink=Wendelin Förster|title=Aiol et Mirabel und Elie de Saint Gille: Zwei Altfranzösische Heldengedichte|date=1876–1882|page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 verses. A French prose version was made before 1469.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr" /&gt;

The English metrical romance, ''[[Beves of Hamtoun (poem)|Sir Beues of Hamtoun]]'' (see [[Matter of England]]&lt;ref name=boundaries&gt;''Boundaries in medieval romance'', Neil Cartlidge, DS Brewer, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84384-155-X}}, 9781843841555. pp. 29–42&lt;/ref&gt;), is founded based on some French origins, varying slightly from those that have been preserved. The oldest manuscript dates from the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; A translation into [[Irish language|Irish]] survives in a 15th-century manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T306000.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The printed editions of the story were most numerous in [[Italy]], where ''Bovo'' or ''Buovo d'Antona'' was the subject of more than one poem, and the tale was interpolated in the ''[[Reali di Francia]]'', the Italian compilation of [[Carolingian]] legend.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; An anonymous ''Buovo d'Antona: Cantari in ottava rima'' was printed in 1480, and a "Tuscan", in fact Padan of the [[Po Valley]], version in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Rosenzweig ''Bovo d'Antona by Elye Bokher. A Yiddish Romance: A Critical Edition '' 2015  9004306854 "The Buovo d'Antona printed in 1497 is not Tuscan, as Rajna assumed, but Padan (that is, of the region of the Po Valley) ... Delcorno Branca has recently edited a critical edition of this 1480 print: Buovo d'Antona: Cantari in ottava rima (1480)."&lt;/ref&gt;

From Italian, it passed into [[Yiddish]], where the ''[[Bovo-Bukh]]'' became the first non-religious book to be printed in Yiddish. The most popular and critically honored Yiddish-language chivalry romance.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Pieter Gerritsen, Anthony G. Van Melle ''A Dictionary of Medieval Heroes: Characters in Medieval Narrative''  0851157807 - 2000 "The Tuscan poem was translated into Yiddish in Venice in 1501 by the Jewish humanist Elia Levita. His Bow- or Baba-boek, also in also in ottava rima, first appeared in print in 1547 and was regularly reprinted throughout Central and Eastern Europe until well into the 19th century. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the romance attained an unparalleled popularity and became a part of [[Russian folklore]]. The Russian rendition of the romance appeared in mid-16th century, translated from a Polish or [[Ruthenian language|Old Belarusian]] version, which were in turn, translated from a Croatian rendition of the Italian romance, made in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]]. The resulting narrative, called ''Повесть о Бове-королевиче'' (''Povest' o Bove-koroleviche'', lit. The Story of {{ill|Bova Korolyevich|ru|Бова Королевич|lt=Prince Bova}}), gradually merged with Russian folktales, and the principal character attained many features of a Russian folk hero ([[bogatyr]]). Since the 18th century until 1918, various versions of the Povest' had been widely circulated (particularly among the lower classes) as a ''[[lubok]]''. Such writers as [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]] and [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] praised ''Bova'''s literary value. The latter used some elements of the Povest' in his fairy tales and attempted to write a fantasy poem based on the romance. Pushkin also praised a version of Bova by Alexander Radishchev, written in 1799.

==Sources==
R. Zenker (''Boeve-Amlethus'', Berlin and Leipzig, 1904) established a close parallel between Bevis and the [[Hamlet (legend)|Hamlet]] legend as related by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in the ''Historia Danica''. Some of the details that point to a common source are the vengeance of a stepfather for a father's death, the letter bearing his own death-warrant entrusted to the hero, and his double marriage. However, the motive of feigned madness is lacking in Bevis. The princess who is Josiane's rival is less ferocious than the Hermuthruda of the Hamlet legend, but she does threaten Bevis with death should he refuse her. Both seem modeled on the type of Thyrdo of the [[Beowulf]] legend. The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' characterizes the mooted [[etymology]] connecting Bevis (Boeve) with Béowa (Beowulf), as "fanciful" and "inadmissible" on the ground that they were both dragon slayers. One alternative theory is that Doon may be identified with the emperor [[Otto the Great]], who was the contemporary of [[Edgar the Peaceful]], the English king Edgar of the story.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8132">A '''bin tipper''', also known as a bin-tipper, bin lifter, cart dumper or Dumpmaster, is a [[machine]] which [[Mechanical engineering|mechanically]] lifts and inverts bins for the purpose of emptying them. Bin tippers are a type of [[lifting equipment]] used in many industries, including [[waste management]], [[food processing]], [[Chemical industry|chemical manufacturing]] and [[facility management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://simpro.world/connect/blog/seven-industrial-problems-solved-by-simpro-bin-tippers|title=Seven industrial problems solved by Simpro bin tippers - Simpro Blog|first=Braden|last=Simmons|date=1 December 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820163836/https://simpro.world/connect/blog/seven-industrial-problems-solved-by-simpro-bin-tippers|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bin tippers are often components of larger machines (such as [[garbage truck]]s), an increasing number of 'standalone' or mobile units are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://solusgrp.com/blog/bin-tippers-from-solus-group-on-display-at-wasteexpo-trade-show.html|title=Bin Tippers From Solus Group On Display At WasteExpo Trade Show|website=solusgrp.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160832/https://solusgrp.com/blog/bin-tippers-from-solus-group-on-display-at-wasteexpo-trade-show.html|archivedate=2017-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bin tippers use [[mains electricity]] to power the lifting system, but some are powered by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Solar power|solar]], [[Crank (mechanism)|crank-handle]], or [[compressed air]].

== Operational principal ==

Bin tippers typically have a steel frame, guarding and cradle, with a motor or crank-handle driving a lifting [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]], which may be [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] or [[Chain drive|chain operated]]. Bins are placed into the machine, then lifted and inverted over the destination receptacle, allowing the contents to be emptied by [[gravity]].

Most bin tippers are designed to comply with one of three [[Technical standard|standards]]:
* EN 840-compliant bin tippers use a comb-lift mechanism, latching onto reinforced combing around the lip of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the waste-management industry in Europe, Asia and Australasia. Compliant bins are often called wheelie bins or MGBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhcg4fLlKrM|title=What is the EN840 European Standard; why is it important|first=|last=DMA Europa|date=29 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210093823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhcg4fLlKrM|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ANSI Z245.60 (Type B)-compliant bin tippers use a front-lift mechanism, latching onto a moulded indentation in the front of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the waste-management industry in North America. Compliant bins are often called toters, waste carts or trash cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waste360.com/safety/safe_carting_ansi|title=Safe Carting|date=1 April 2008|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820202708/http://www.waste360.com/safety/safe_carting_ansi|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://simpro.world/connect/blog/en-840-vs-ansi-z245-60-the-bitter-battle-of-the-mgbs|title=EN 840 vs ANSI Z245.60 - the bitter battle of the MGBs - Simpro Blog|first=Braden|last=Simmons|date=20 February 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820163721/https://simpro.world/connect/blog/en-840-vs-ansi-z245-60-the-bitter-battle-of-the-mgbs|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DIN 9797-compliant bin tippers use a trunnion-lift mechanism, latching onto two trunnions projecting from the sides of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the food-processing industry. Compliant bins are often called euro bins, tote bins, or meat carts.
* Bin tippers may also use various non-standard means to secure the bin, including hydraulic pincers, or base-lift cradles with wheel latches or chain fastenings.

== History ==

A side-load bin tipper was fitted to a garbage truck as early as 1929, by the Heil company in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/hopper/index.html|title=Garbage Trucks - External Hoppers|first=Joseph P.|last=Sallmen|website=www.tigerdude.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810163743/http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/hopper/index.html|archivedate=2017-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s the [[Dempster Brothers|Dempster Dumpmaster]] popularized the front-end loader variant, with bins being tipped over the cab of the truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/frontload/index.html|title=Garbage Trucks - Front End Loaders|first=Joseph P.|last=Sallmen|website=www.tigerdude.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231062539/http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/frontload/index.html|archivedate=2014-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of integrated bin tipper are now common on municipal refuse collection trucks.

Standalone bin tippers developed later, with the release of a machine called the Simpro Ezi-Dump in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://simpro.world/about#timeline|title=About Simpro - Smart lifting solutions since 1986 - Simpro|first=Braden|last=Simmons|website=Simpro|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101806/https://simpro.world/about#timeline|archivedate=2017-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of machine is now common on large commercial facilities, events venues and campuses, since it allows smaller mobile bins to be dispersed for waste collection, then emptied into a skip bin or dumpster; which in turn can be emptied by a front-load garbage truck.

The use of bin tippers and other lifting aids has been stimulated in recent years by research linking heavy manual lifting with musculoskeletal disorders;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/reports/TERO09009ENC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210093822/https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/reports/TERO09009ENC |archivedate=2018-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 4493964 | pmid=26155300 | doi=10.1186/s12995-015-0065-6 | volume=10 | title=Health status and health-related quality of life of municipal waste collection workers - a cross-sectional survey | journal=J Occup Med Toxicol | page=22 | last1 = Velasco Garrido | first1 = M | last2 = Bittner | first2 = C | last3 = Harth | first3 = V | last4 = Preisser | first4 = AM}}&lt;/ref&gt; some government organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.qld.gov.au/health/pdfs/healthsafety/waste-management-factsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705145225/http://education.qld.gov.au/health/pdfs/healthsafety/waste-management-factsheet.pdf |archivedate=2016-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaps.qld.edu.au/Discover%20Us/Documents/Manual-Handling-of-Wheelie-Bins.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210093823/http://www.gaps.qld.edu.au/Discover%20Us/Documents/Manual-Handling-of-Wheelie-Bins.pdf |archivedate=2018-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and companies now prohibit emptying bins by hand.

'''Bruce LaBruce''' (born January 3, 1964)&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/labruce_b.html |title=Arts: Bruce LaBruce |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026025302/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/labruce_b.html |archive-date=October 26, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist,&lt;ref name=papermag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papermag.com/bruce-la-bruce-erotic-photography-2534513425.html|title=A Timeline of Photographer Bruce LaBruce's Erotic Career|publisher=[[Paper Magazine]]|date=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer, filmmaker, photographer and underground director based in [[Toronto, Ontario]].

==Life and career==
LaBruce was born in [[Tiverton, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gayle MacDonald |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/australians-wont-see-zombies-having-sex/article1647616/ |title=Australians won't see zombies having sex |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has claimed both '''Justin Stewart''' and '''Bryan Bruce''' as his birth name in different sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Filmmaker's series critiques gay sensibilities". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied film at [[York University]] in Toronto and wrote for ''[[Cineaction]]'' magazine, curated by [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], his teacher.

He first gained public attention with the publication of the [[Queercore|queer punk]] [[zine]] ''[[J.D.s]]'', which he co-edited with [[G.B. Jones]].&lt;ref name=glbtq /&gt; He has written and photographed for a variety of publications including ''Vice'', the former [[Nerve.com]] and ''[[BlackBook Magazine]]'', and has been a columnist for the Canadian music magazine ''[[Exclaim!]]'' and Toronto's ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', as well as a contributing editor and photographer for New York's ''[[Index Magazine]]''. He has also been published in ''[[Toronto Life]]'', the ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

LaBruce's filmmaking style is marked by a blend of explicitly [[pornography|pornographic]] depictions of sex with more conventional [[narrative]] and filmmaking techniques, as well as an interest in extreme topics which mainstream audiences might dismiss as shocking or disturbing [[taboo]]s.&lt;ref name=romance&gt;"Bruce LaBruce: There Is a Certain Romance to It". ''L.A. Record'', June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, his films have depicted scenes of sexual [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[paraphilia]], [[BDSM]], [[gang rape]], [[racism|racially]]-motivated violence, [[acrotomophilia|amputee fetishism]], [[gerontophilia]], male and female [[prostitution]], and [[zombie]] and [[vampire]] sexuality.&lt;ref name=romance /&gt;

He has frequently been identified with the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement that emerged in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=romance /&gt; although at the height of that movement's prominence, he rejected the association on the grounds that he felt more personally aligned with the [[queercore]] movement.&lt;ref name=romance /&gt; The queercore movement was born in the 1980s and LaBruce was one of the fathers. Noted as the avant-garde and unapologetic gay answer to the punk movement, queercore expressed the very same discontent with society as the punks were stating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Croyle |year=2014|title=Sexual Revolution, Bruce LaBruce |publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/sexual-revolution-bruce-labruce/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His movie, ''[[Otto; or Up with Dead People]]'' debuted at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]]. ''[[L.A. Zombie]]'' was banned from the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] in 2010 because, in the opinion of Australian censors, it would have been refused classification. However, the film was subsequently able to screen at OutTakes, a [[New Zealand]] lesbian and gay international film festival, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/21/2959594.htm Festival zombie porn flick banned]. [[ABC (Australia)|ABC News]], July 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2010/07/21/zombie-film-bruce-labruce.html |title=Bruce LaBruce zombie film banned in Australia|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, LaBruce directed a performance of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s opera ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' at the [[Hebbel am Ufer]] Theatre in [[Berlin]]. This iteration of the opera included gender diversity, [[castration]] scenes and [[dildo]]s, as well as portraying Pierrot as a [[transgender]] [[trans man|man]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ladner. [http://www.buttmagazine.com/magazine/interviews/pierrot-lunaire "Bruce LaBruce and Item Idem at the Opera"]. ''[[Butt (magazine)|Butt]]'', March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently also filmed this adaptation as the 2014 theatrical film ''[[Pierrot Lunaire (film)|Pierrot Lunaire]]''.

Beginning with ''[[Gerontophilia (film)|Gerontophilia]]'' in 2013, LaBruce dropped some of the more sexually explicit aspects of his filmmaking style. He retained his traditional interest in exploring sexual taboos, dramatizing an intergenerational relationship between a young man and a senior citizen, but opted to do so within a film that would be more palatable to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref name=huffington&gt;[http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/19/bruce-labruce-gerontophilia_n_2332835.html "Marie-Hélène Thibault et Pier-Gabriel Lajoie dans «Gerontophilia», un film de Bruce LaBruce tourné à Montréal"]. ''[[Huffington Post]]'', December 19, 2012. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and style==
According to Courtney Fathom Sell of ''South Coast Today'', some of his films explore themes of sexual and interpersonal [[relational transgression|transgression]] against cultural norms, frequently blending the artistic and production techniques of [[independent film]] with [[gay pornography]].&lt;ref name=southcoasttoday&gt;[http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/SC2470202/80226025 Punched in the Nose: An Interview with Filmmaker Bruce LaBruce].

'''Brunei Malay''' (''Bahasa Melayu Brunei'') is the most widely spoken language in [[Brunei]] and a [[lingua franca]] in some parts of [[East Malaysia]], such as [[Labuan]], [[Limbang]], [[Lawas]], [[Sipitang]] and [[Papar]].&lt;ref name="Clynes2014"&gt;Clynes, A.

''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 47(1), 99-108. [http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/research/brunei-malay/index.html On-line Version]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Standard Malay is promoted as the official language of Brunei, Brunei Malay is socially dominant and it is currently replacing the minority languages of Brunei,&lt;ref name="McNoorDet2016"&gt;McLellan, J., Noor Azam Haji-Othman, &amp; Deterding, D.

Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite divergent from Standard Malay to the point where it is almost mutually unintelligible with it. Although the idea that Brunei Malay might be classified as a [[creole language]] has been discredited, it does bear considerable similarities to East Indonesian [[Malay trade and creole languages|Malay-based creole languages]].

Some analysts exclude /w/ and /j/ from this table on the basis that they are 'margin high vowels',&lt;ref name="Mataim2007"&gt;Mataim Bakar. (2007). ''The phonotactics of Brunei Malay: An Optimality Theoretic account''. Bandar Seri Begawan: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei.&lt;/ref&gt; while others include /w/ but exclude /j/.&lt;ref name="Clynes2014" /&gt;

All these consonants can occur in initial position except /h/. While /h/ can occur in final position, its absence from initial position means that Standard Malay ''hutan'' ('forest') is ''utan'' in Brunei Malay, and Standard Malay ''hitam'' ('black') is ''itam''.&lt;ref name="DetIsh2016" /&gt;

All the consonants can occur in word-final position apart from the palatal sounds /tʃ dʒ ɲ/ and the voiced plosives /b d ɡ/ (except in a few borrowed words such as ''mac'' ('March') and ''kabab'' ('kebab')).&lt;ref name="Clynes2014" /&gt;

[[File:Vowel-plot.jpg|300px|thumb|Acoustic analysis of the three vowels of Brunei Malay]]
Brunei Malay has a three-vowel system: /i/, /a/, /u/.&lt;ref name="Clynes2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poed1996"&gt;Poedjosoedarmo, G. (1996). Variation and change in the sound systems of Brunei dialects of Malay. In P. Martin, C. Ozog, &amp; Gloria Poedjosoedarmo (Eds.), ''Language use and language change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 37–42). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustic variation in the realisation of these vowels is shown in the plot on the right, based on the reading of a short text by a single female speaker.&lt;ref name="DetIsh2016" /&gt;

While /i/ is distinct from the other two vowels, there is substantial overlap between /a/ and /u/. This is partly because of the vowel in the first syllable of words such as ''maniup'' ('to blow') which can be realised as [ə]. Indeed, the Brunei Malay dictionary uses an 'e' for the prefix in this word, listing it as ''meniup'',&lt;ref name="DPB2007"&gt;Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei. (2007). ''Kamus Bahasa Melayu Brunei'' (Edisi Kedua) [Brunei Malay dictionary, 2nd edition]. Bandar Seri Begawan: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei.&lt;/ref&gt; though other analyses prefer to show prefixes such as this with 'a', on the basis that Brunei Malay just has three vowels.&lt;ref name="Jaludin2000"&gt;Jaludin Chuchu. (2000). ''Morphology of Brunei Malay''. Bangi: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mataim2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clynes2014" /&gt;

==Dialects==
Brunei Malay, Kedayan and Kampong Ayer can be regarded as different dialects of Malay. ''Brunei Malay'' is used by the numerically and politically dominant Brunei people, who traditionally lived on water, while ''Kedayan'' is used by the land-dwelling farmers, and the ''Kampong Ayer'' dialect is used by the inhabitants of the river north of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, 2006. "Brunei Darussalam: Language Situation". In {{ELL2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wurm, Mühlhäusler, &amp; Tryon, ''Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas'', 1996:677&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 94% of the words of Brunei Malay and Kedayan are lexically related.&lt;ref

The '''Cantius Stele''' is a Roman grave stele in the form of a rectangular [[aedicula]] from [[Noricum]], which was created around AD 100.

The stele, which measures 288 x 116 x 29 cm is made of [[Gummern marble]] and divides into four horizontal sections. The uppermost, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is composed of a triangular gable with a [[gorgoneion]] in the centre and two dolphins facing outwards in the spandrels. Underneath this are laurel wreathed medallions containing portraits of Lucius Cantius Secundus and his wife Cantia Bonia, between two twisting columns. Below this, in a similar but centred medallion is an image of their daughter Cantia Boniata, with an image of a boy to the left and of a girl to the right. The lowest section is the inscription, which reads:

{{quote|text=
{{columns|width=auto
|col1={{lang-la|L(ucius) Cantius / Secundus v(ivus) f(ecit) sib(i) / et Cantiae Iuni(i) f(iliae) / Boniae uxori et / Cantiae L(ucii) f(iliae) Boniatae}}
|col2={{lang-en|Lucius Cantius Secundus made this while still alive for himself and his wife Cantia Bonia daughter of Iunius and for his daughter Cantia Boniata}}
}}|sign={{CIL|3|5437}} &amp; {{CIL|3|5438}}}}
The stele was embedded in the outer wall of [[St Leonhard's, Graz|St Leonhard's]] in [[Graz]] until 1818, when it was gifted to the collection of the [[Universalmuseum Joanneum|Landesmuseum Joanneum]]. Today it is kept in the [[lapidarium]] of the archaeological museum at [[Eggenberg Palace, Graz|Eggenberg Palace]]

A '''comprehensive school''' is a [[secondary school]] that is a [[state school]] and does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to the [[selective school]] system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria. The term is commonly used in relation to [[England and Wales]], where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools. They correspond broadly to the [[state school|public high school]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and to the ''Gesamtschule'' in [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Context==
Comprehensive schools provide an [[National Curriculum for England|entitlement curriculum]] to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in [[grammar school]]s. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11–16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by [[sixth form]] colleges and [[further education]] colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the [[City Technology College]]s and [[Specialist schools programme]]s have made the comprehensive ideal less certain.

In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the [[selective school]] system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to [[England and Wales]] in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.{{fact|date=November 2014}} (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England).
Most comprehensives are [[secondary school]]s for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US [[Middle school#Canada and the United States|middle school]] (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.

In principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as "neighbourhood" schools for all students in a specified catchment area.

{{Further|Education in Finland}}
In most countries, the term "comprehensive school" is used to refer to the education of children after [[primary school]], but in Finland this English term is confusingly used to also refer to all of the earlier grades.

Finland has used comprehensive schools after 5th grade since the 1970s. (Schools up to 4th grade have always been comprehensive in most countries, including Finland.) Until the 1970s, some children stayed on in the [[primary school]] (''kansaloulu'') until the end of the sixth grade whereas others left after the fourth grade to go to a school (''oppikoulu'') whose higher grades were called ''lukio'' ([[high school]]) and prepared them for [[tertiary education]]. 

Since the 1970s, everyone has been required to complete the same nine grades of ''peruskoulu'' (literally "basic school"), from the ages of 7 to 16. This change was modeled on the British comprehensive school, which goes from the ages of 11 to 16. (In the USA and Germany, for example, comprehensive schools go to the age of 18 or 19.) From the ages of 16 to 19, students go either to [[vocational school]] or high school (lukio). 

The division of the ''peruskoulu'' into a lower school (grades 1–6, ala-aste, alakoulu) and upper school (grades 7–9, yläaste, yläkoulu) has been discontinued.

===Comprehensive schools that offer college preparatory classes===
Germany has a comprehensive school known as the ''Gesamtschule''. While some German schools such as the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Realschule]] have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the [[Hauptschulabschluss]], the [[Realschulabschluss]] or the [[Abitur]] depending on how well they did in school.

The percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by [[States of Germany|Bundesland]]. In the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Prof Dr. Valentin Merkelbach: "Gesamtschulen und Grundschulen sind das Beste in unserem Schulsystem" http://bildungsklick.de/a/55873/gesamtschulen-und-grundschulen-sind-das-beste-in-unserem-schulsystem/&lt;/ref&gt; while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.

Starting in 2010/2011,  [[Hauptschule]]n were merged with [[Realschule]]n and Gesamtschulen to form a new type of comprehensive school in the German States of Berlin and Hamburg, called Stadtteilschule in Hamburg and Sekundarschule in Berlin (see: [[Education in Berlin]], [[Education in Hamburg]]).

===Comprehensive schools that do not offer college preparatory classes===
The "[[Mittelschule]]" is a school in some States of Germany that offers regular classes and remedial classes but no college preparatory classes. In some States of Germany, the [[Hauptschule]] does not exist, and any student who has not been accepted by another school has to attend the Mittelschule. Students may be awarded the [[Hauptschulabschluss]] or the [[Mittlere Reife]] but not the [[Abitur]].

===Controversies===
There is some controversy about comprehensive schools. As a rule of thumb those supporting [[The Left (Germany)|The Left Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] are in favour of comprehensive schools, while those supporting the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] are opposed to them.

====Grade inflation====
[[File:Integrierte Gesamtschule Ludwigshafen-Gartenstadt 02.jpg|thumb|Integrierte Gesamtschule Ludwigshafen-Gartenstadt]]

Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability&lt;ref&gt;who scored 100 on a math test, provided by the scientists&lt;/ref&gt; found themselves at the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of "Five", which means "Failed". Gesamtschule senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of their class and had an average grade of "Three Plus".&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Tücke: "Psychologie in der Schule, Psychologie für die Schule: Eine themenzentrierte Einführung in die Psychologie für (zukünftige) Lehrer". 4 Auflage 2005. Münster: LIT Verlag; p. 127; the study was done in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], students were attending a Leistungskurs&lt;/ref&gt; When a central [[Abitur]] examination was established in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, it was revealed that Gesamtschule students did worse than could be predicted by their grades or class rank. Barbara Sommer ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]), Education Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, commented that: ''Looking at the performance gap between comprehensives and the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] [at the Abitur central examination] [...] it is difficult to understand why the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] wants to do away with the Gymnasium. [...] The comprehensives do not help students achieve [...] I am sick and tired of the comprehensive schools blaming their problems on the social class origins of their students. What kind of attitude is this to blame their own students?'' She also called the Abitur awarded by the Gymnasium the true Abitur and the Abitur awarded by the Gesamtschule "Abitur light".&lt;ref&gt;Presseinformationen: Sprechzettel von Ministerin Barbara Sommer zur Pressekonferenz am 19.08.2008 "Schuljahresbeginn und Auswertung des Zentralabiturs 2008". Ministerium für Schule und Weiterbildung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction, Sigrid Beer ([[Alliance '90/The Greens]]) stated that comprehensives were structurally discriminated against by the government, which favoured the Gymnasiums. She also said that many of the students awarded the Abitur by the comprehensives came from "underprivileged groups" and sneering at their performance was a "piece of impudence".&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Lüke: "Gutes Abitur, schlechte Gesamtschule". WDR Wissen&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unfairness====
Gesamtschulen might put bright working class students at risk according to several studies. It could{{weasel word|date=July 2016}} be shown that an achievement gap opens between working class students attending a comprehensive and their middle class peers. Also, working class students attending a Gymnasium or a Realschule outperform students from similar backgrounds attending a Gesamtschulen. However, it is not students attending a Gesamtschulen, but students attending a Hauptschule who perform the poorest.

A study by a group of researchers around [[Helmut Fend]], an Austrian Professor of [[Pedagogy]] and proponent of comprehensive schools, revealed that comprehensive schools do not help working class students in the long term. The researchers compared alumni of the tripartite system to alumni of comprehensive schools. While working class alumni of comprehensive schools were awarded better school diplomas, at age 35 they held similar occupational positions as working class alumni of the tripartite system and were as unlikely to graduate from college. Fend concluded that the social background outweighs advantages of the type of school after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Leffers: "Gesamtschule folgenlos - Bildung wird vererbt". 3 January 2008.

==Ireland==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=February 2017}}
Comprehensive schools were introduced into [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1966 by an initiative by [[Patrick Hillery]], [[Minister for Education and Skills|Minister for Education]], to give a broader range of education compared to that of the [[vocational school]] system, which was then the only system of schools completely controlled by the state. Until then, education in Ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion, particularly the [[voluntary secondary school]] system was a particular realisation of this. The comprehensive school system is still relatively small and to an extent has been superseded by the [[Community school (Ireland)|community school]] concept. The Irish word for a comprehensive school is a 'scoil chuimsitheach.'

In Ireland comprehensive schools were an earlier model of state schools, introduced in the late 1960s and largely replaced by the secular community model of the 1970s. The comprehensive model generally incorporated older schools that were under [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] ownership, and the various denominations still manage the school as patrons or trustees. The state owns the school property, which is vested in the trustees in perpetuity. The model was adopted to make state schools more acceptable to a largely conservative society of the time.

The introduction of the community school model in the 1970s controversially removed the denominational basis of the schools, but religious interests were invited to be represented on the Boards of Management. Community schools are divided into two models, the community school vested in the [[Minister for Education and Skills|Minister for Education]] and the community college vested in the local [[Education and Training Board]]. Community colleges tended to be amalgamations of unviable local schools under the umbrella of a new community school model, but community schools have tended to be entirely new foundations.

===England and Wales===
{{main|Comprehensive school (England and Wales)}}

The first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. In 1946, for example, Walworth School was one of five 'experimental' comprehensive schools set up by the London County Council&lt;ref&gt;Peter Medway and  Pat Kingwell, ‘A Curriculum in its place: English teaching in one school 1946-1963′, ''History of Education'' 39, no. 6 (November 2010): 749-765.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early comprehensive school was [[Holyhead High School|Holyhead County School]] in [[Anglesey]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=chts&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4202774.stm Comps - here to stay?], Phil Tineline, September 2005, BBC, accessed 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051025/ai_n15717384}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coventry opened two Comprehensive School in 1954 by combining Grammar Schools and Secondary Modern Schools. These were Caludon Castle and Woodlands. Another early example was [[Ormiston Sandwell Academy|Tividale Comprehensive School]] in [[Tipton]]. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was [[Colne Valley High School]] near Huddersfield in 1956.

The largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by [[Anthony Crosland]], Secretary of State for Education in the 1964–1970 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. The policy decision was implemented by [[Circular 10/65]], an instruction to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a [[secondary modern]], [[secondary technical]] or [[grammar school]] depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places, depending on location.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

In 1970 [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Secretary of State for Education in the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert, however, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary.

By 1975 the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the [[Eleven-Plus exam|11-Plus]] examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many [[secondary modern]] schools and [[grammar schools]] were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. Many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including [[Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell|Sandwell]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Dudley|Dudley]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s. 

In 1976 the future Labour prime minister [[James Callaghan]] launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the [[examination system]]. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state [[secondary school]] in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.

Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to [[Home education in the United Kingdom|home educate]] them instead. The concept of "school choice" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original "neighbourhood comprehensive" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial [[league tables]] of school performance.

===Scotland===
{{Further|Education in Scotland}}
[[Scotland]] has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The [[Scottish Government]] has rejected plans for [[specialist school]]s as of 2005.

===Northern Ireland===

Education in Northern Ireland differs slightly from systems used elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but it is more similar to that used in England and Wales than it is to Scotland.

=== Australia ===
When the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students' academic merit based on their performance in public examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barcan|first=Alan|date=2007|title=Comprehensive Secondary Schools in Australia: a View from Newcastle, New South Wales|url=http://www.erpjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ERPV34-1_Barcan-A.-2007.-Comprehensive-secondary-schools.pdf|journal=Education Research and Perspectives, University of Newcastle, NSW|volume=34|pages=136-178|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Western Australia]] was the first to replace many multilateral school systems, proceeding with [[Queensland]], and finally [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008|last=Harrington|first=Marylin|publisher=Social Policy Section|year=2008|issn=1328-8091|location=National Curriculum|pages=1-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/english/australian-education/education-system|title=Education system overview|last=Technology|first=Elcom|website=www.studyinaustralia.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level.

The '''"Debate between sheep and grain"''' or '''"Myth of cattle and grain"''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[creation myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s in the mid to late 3rd millennium BCE.

==Disputations==
Seven "debate" topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of '[[disputation]]s'; some examples are: the [[Debate between Winter and Summer]]; the [[Debate between bird and fish]]; [[The Oak and the Reed|the Tree and the Reed]]; and ''The Dispute between Silver and Copper''.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"/&gt; These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian [[Mesopotamia]]. The debates are [[philosophy|philosophical]] and address humanity's place in the world.

==Compilation==
The first sixty-one lines of the [[myth]] were discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section, tablet number 14,005 from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. This was translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as "Sumerian religious texts" in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]", number eight, entitled "A New Creation Myth".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|5|by|2.6|by|1.25|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton describes the text as an "elaborate statement of the non-existence of many things once upon a time" and considered it a "statement that mankind was brought into existence through the physical union of a god and a goddess."

Another tablet from the same collection, number 6893 (part of which was destroyed) was translated  by [[Edward Chiera]] in 1924 increasing the text to seventy lines in "Sumerian religious texts".&lt;ref name="Chieraottoman1924"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Chiera|author2=Constantinople.

Later work has added to this and modern translation has removed the [[Apotheosis|deification]] of Lahar and Ashnan, naming them simply "grain" and "sheep" (also known as cattle).&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/ Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Fluckiger-Hawker, E, Robson, E., and Zólyomi, G., The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998- .]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The story opens with a location "the hill of heaven and earth" which is discussed by Chiera as "not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian [[Garden of Eden]] is to be placed."&lt;ref name="Chieraottoman1924"/&gt;  The Sumerian word [[Edin (Sumerian term)|Edin]], means "steppe" or "plain",&lt;ref name="ThomasmaWeisstub2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C.

Thomasma|author2=David N.

==Discussion==
[[Samuel Noah Kramer]] has noted the parallels and variations between the story and the later one of [[Cain and Abel]] in the [[Bible]] [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|4:1-16|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Kramer1961c"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian mythology: a study of spiritual and literary achievement in the third millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t16tDOHZLLEC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1961|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-60506-049-1|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ewa Wasilewska mentions, "this text is not very clear, allowing for the interpretation that humankind was already present before Lahar and Ashnan were created and it was them, not the Anunnakû, who were not able to provide for themselves and for the deities until they were given divine 'breath' (Lyczkowska and Szarzynska 1981). However, it seems that Kramer's translation is more appropriate concerning the Sumerian realm in which each and every creation must have had its clearly described purpose".&lt;ref name="Wasilewska2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Wasilewska|title=Creation stories of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMj1tyho3CoC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-681-2|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat noted the use of [[measuring rod]]s in the tale as being linked to the [[history of writing]], which developed in order to keep count of animals and produce.&lt;ref name="Nemet-Nejat1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|title=Daily life in ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbmXsaTGNKUC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=24 May 2011|date=30 September 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Black suggests that the victory of grain perhaps implies that man can live without [[domestic animal]]s, but cannot survive without [[bread]]. He goes on to point out that the debates on both sides are roughly equal.&lt;ref name="BlackBlack2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy A. Black|author2=Jeremy Black|author3=Graham Cunningham|author4=Eleanor Robson|title=The Literature of Ancient Sumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1W2mTtGVV4C&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=24 May 2011|date=13 April 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929633-0|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
The introduction to the myth reads:

{{cquote|When, upon the hill of heaven and earth, An created the Annunaki, since he neither spawned nor created Grain with them, and since in the Land he neither fashioned the yarn of [[Uttu]] (the goddess of weaving) nor pegged out the loom for Uttu — with no Sheep appearing, there were no numerous lambs, and with no goats, there were no numerous kids, the sheep did not give birth to her twin lambs, and the goat did not give birth to her triplet kids; the Annunaki, the great gods, did not even know the names Grain or Sheep. There was no grain of thirty days; there was no grain of forty days; there was no  grain of fifty days; there was no small grain, grain from the mountains or grain from the holy habitations. There was no cloth to wear; Uttu had not been born — no royal turban was worn; lord [[Ninurta|Niĝir-si]], the precious lord, had not been born; The [[Sumugan|god of wild animals]] had not gone out into the barren lands. The people of those days did not know about eating bread. They did not know about wearing clothes; they went about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grass with their mouths and drank water from the ditches.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;}}

The benefits that grain and sheep bring to the [[Human settlement|habitation]] are also described:

{{cquote|They brought wealth to the assembly. They brought sustenance to the Land. They fulfilled the ordinances of the gods. They filled the store-rooms of the Land with stock. The barns of the Land were heavy with them. When they entered the homes of the poor who crouch in the dust they brought wealth. Both of them, wherever they directed their steps, added to the riches of the household with their weight. Where they stood, they were satisfying; where they settled, they were seemly. They gladdened the heart of An and the heart of Enlil.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;}}

The final merits of grain are emphasized in a [[proverb]] at the end of the myth:

{{cquote|From sunrise till sunset, may the name of Grain be praised. People should submit to the yoke of Grain. Whoever has silver, whoever has jewels, whoever has cattle, whoever has sheep shall take a seat at the gate of whoever has grain, and pass his time there.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;}}

__NOTOC__
'''Diary studies''' is a [[research method]] that collects [[qualitative property|qualitative information]] by having participants record entries about their every day lives in a log, diary or journal about the activity or experience being studied. This collection of data uses a&amp;nbsp;[[longitudinal study|longitudinal technique]], meaning that it is reported by the participants over a period of time ranging from some days to more a few months, meaning that it studies the same [[variable (research)|variables]] over a period of time. This research tool, although not being able to provide results as detailed as a true [[field study]], can still offer a vast amount of contextual information without the costs of a true field study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigdesignevents.com/2012/08/5-methods-to-collect-data-with-diary-studies/|title=5 methods to collect data with diary studies|last=Sullivan|first=Brian K.|date=August 9, 2012|website=Big Design|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/|title=Diary Studies: Understanding Long-Term User Behavior and Experiences|last=Flaherty|first=Kim|date=June 5, 2016|website=Nielsen Norman Group|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diary studies are also known as [[Experience sampling method|experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment (EMA)]] methodology.  

Traditionally diary studies involved participants keeping a written diary of events. However the emergence of smartphones now enables participants to diary with photos, videos and text using a variety of online, mobile or offline apps and tools. 

There are two types of diary studies:

# '''Elicitation studies''', where participants capture media that are then used as prompts for discussion in interviews. The method is a way to trigger the participant's memory. This type of diary study is sometimes referred to by Researchers as pre-task or pre-work and typically is carried out before an in-person interview such as a [[Focus group|Focus Group]] or an In-depth interview.
# '''Feedback studies''', where participants answer predefined questions about events. This is a way of getting immediate answers from the participants.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff"&gt;Carter and Mankoff (2005). When participants do the capturing: the role of media in diary studies. ''CHI '05 Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems''.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
An early example of a diary study was "How Workingmen Spend Their Time" (Bevans, 1913) which went unpublished by George Esdras Bevans.&lt;ref&gt;"Bevans, G.E. (1913). How Workingmen Spend Their Time (Unpublished Doctoral Thesis). Columbia University, New York, NY"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Diary studies originate from the fields of [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), diary studies have been adopted as one method of learning about user needs towards designing more appropriate technologies.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalenSalzman"&gt;Palen, L., &amp; Salzman, M. (2002). Voice-mail diary studies for naturalistic data capture under mobile conditions. In ''Proceedings of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW '02)'', pp. 87–95. New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Advantages of diary studies are numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Lallemand, C. (2012). [http://uxpamagazine.org/dear-diary-using-diaries-to-study-user-experience/ Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User Experience][http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/11-3/ UX Magazine 11.3, August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;
They allow:

* collecting longitudinal and temporal information;
* reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment;
* participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation;
* determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors.

==Limitations==
Diary studies might generate inaccurate [[recall (memory)|recall]], especially if using the elicitation type of diary studies, because of the use of memory triggers (e.g. taking a photo and writing about it later). There is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. 
In feedback studies, there is also low control, and it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.&lt;ref&gt;Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, {{ISBN|0123848695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14450">'''The Eighteen Arhats (or Luohan)''' ({{zh|c=十八羅漢|p=Shíbā Luóhàn|w=Shih-pa Lo-han}}) are depicted in [[Mahayana Buddhism]] as the original followers of [[Gautama Buddha]] who have followed the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and attained the [[four stages of enlightenment]]. They have reached the state of [[Nirvana]] and are free of worldly cravings. They are charged to protect the Buddhist faith and to wait on earth for the coming of [[Maitreya]], an enlightened Buddha prophesied to arrive on earth many millennia after Gautama Buddha's death ([[parinirvana]]). In [[China]], the eighteen arhats are also a popular subject in [[Buddhist art]], such as the famous Chinese [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans|group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian]] from about 1000 [[Common Era|CE]].

==In China==
[[File:Asita Steele Rubbing.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Ink rubbing of the stele commissioned by Qianlong depicting Asita. The upper right shows the inscriptions of the eulogy given by Qianlong.]]
Originally, the arhats were composed of only 10 disciples of Gautama Buddha, although the earliest [[India]]n [[Sūtra|sutras]] indicate that only 4 of them, Pindola, Kundadhana, Panthaka and Nakula, were instructed to await the coming of Maitreya.&lt;ref name="Four Arhats"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arhats in China and Japan|author=M.V. de Visser|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1919|ISBN=9780691117645|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earliest Chinese representations of the arhats can be traced back to as early as the fourth century,&lt;ref name="Chinese Art"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese art: a guide to motifs and visual imagery|author=Patricia Bjaaland Welch|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2008|ISBN=9780804838641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sgO9BuZQSEC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=luohans+added&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CPHdlLdPq6&amp;sig=2MYqmIjMSR6hWecardYEL6iwmY4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jmjiSubZFYea8AaW-On4AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=luohans%20added&amp;f=false|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainly focused on [[Pindola Bharadvaja|Pindola]] who was popularized in art by the book ''Method for Inviting Pindola'' ({{zh|c=請賓度羅法|p=''Qǐng Bīndùluó Fǎ''}}).

Later this number increased to [[Sixteen Arhats|sixteen]] to include patriarchs and other spiritual adepts. Teachings about the Arhats eventually made their way to [[China]] where they were called ''Luohan'' (羅漢, shortened from ''a-luo-han'' a Chinese transcription for Arhat), but it wasn't until 654 AD when the [[Nandimitrāvadāna]] ({{zh|c=法住記|p=''Fǎzhùjì''}}), ''Record on the Duration of the Law, spoken by the Great arhat Nadimitra'', was translated by [[Xuanzang]] into Chinese that the names of these arhats were known. For some reason Kundadhana was dropped from this list.&lt;ref name="Relics of Buddha"&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John Strong|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|ISBN=9780691117645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KLAxmR8PZAC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=Nandimitr%C4%81vad%C4%81na&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDYRQ7Ovy3&amp;sig=dyNFSHrPR3Y7epdvBTu_vtxWDLA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qk_jSqrmE5CvlAfDxdWKBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhere between the late [[Tang Dynasty]] and early [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period of China two other Luohans were added to the roster increasing the number to 18.&lt;ref name="Tang"&gt;{{cite book|title=Court Art of the Tang|author=Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky|publisher=University Press of America|year=1996|ISBN=9780761802013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMOOq5ygqX4C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=18+lohans&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=18%20lohans&amp;f=false|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this depiction of 18 Luohans only gained a foothold in China, whereas other areas like [[Japan]] continued to revere only [[Sixteen Arhats|sixteen]] and their roster differs somewhat. This depiction of having 18 instead of 16 Luohans continues into modern Chinese Buddhist traditions. A cult built around the Luohans as guardians of Buddhist faith gained momentum amongst Chinese Buddhists at the end of the ninth century for they had just been through a period a great persecution under the reign of [[Emperor Tang Wuzong]]. In fact the last two additions to this roster, Taming Dragon and Taming Tiger, are thinly veiled swipes against [[Taoism]].

==In Chinese art==
Because no historical records detailing what the Luohans looked like existed, there were no distinguishing features to tell the Luohans apart in early Chinese depictions.&lt;ref name="Guan Xiu Art"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guanxiu and Exotic Imagery in Rakan Paintings|author=Masako Watanabe|publisher=Orientations, vol. XXXI, no. 4|year=2000|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first portraits of the 16 Luohans were painted by the monk [[Guanxiu]] in 891 AD, who at the time was residing in [[Chengdu]]. Legend has it that the 16 Luohans knew of Guanxiu's expert calligraphy and painting skills, so they appeared to the monk in a dream to make a request that he paint their portraits.&lt;ref name="10000 Numbers"&gt;{{cite book|title=10,000 Chinese Numbers|author=Roy Bates|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2007|ISBN=9780557006212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSrrrgbS2v4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA256&amp;dq=18+lohans&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=18%20lohans&amp;f=false|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The paintings depicted them as foreigners having bushy eyebrows, large eyes, hanging cheeks and high noses. They were seated in landscapes, leaning against pine trees and stones. An additional theme in these paintings was that they were portrayed as being unkempt and "eccentric," which emphasizes that they were vagabonds and beggars who have left all worldly desires behind. When Guanxiu was asked how he came up with the depictions, he answered: ''"It was in a dream that I saw these Gods and Buddhas. After I woke up, I painted what I saw in the dream. So, I guess I can refer to these Luohans as 'Luohans in a dream'."'' These portraits painted by Guanxiu have become the definitive images for the 18 Luohans in Chinese Buddhist iconography, although in modern depictions they bear more [[Sinitic]] features and at the same time have lost their exaggerated foreign features in exchange for more exaggerated expressions.  The paintings were donated by Guanxiu to the Shengyin Temple in [[Hangzhou|Qiantang]] (present day [[Hangzhou]]) where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect.&lt;ref name="Early Text Painting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Texts on Painting|author=Susan Bush and Ilsio-yen Shih|publisher=Cambridge, MA, and London|year=1985|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many prominent artists such as [[Wu Bin (painter)|Wu Bin]] and [[Ding Guanpeng]] would later try to faithfully imitate the original paintings.

The [[Qianlong Emperor]] was a great admirer of the Luohans and during his visit to see the paintings in 1757, Qianlong not only examined them closely but he also wrote a eulogy to each Luohan image. Copies of these eulogies were presented to the monastery and preserved. In 1764, Qianlong ordered that the paintings held at the Shengyin Monastery be reproduced and engraved on stone tablets for preservation. These were mounted like facets on a marble stupa for public display. The temple was destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] but copies of ink rubbings of the steles were preserved in and outside of China.&lt;ref name="Harvard Univerisity"&gt;{{cite book|title=Harvard University Library|url=http://via.lib.harvard.edu/via/deliver/deepLinkResults?kw2=rubbings&amp;kw1=lohan&amp;bool1=and&amp;index2=Anywhere&amp;index1=Anywhere&amp;repositoryLimit=Harvard%20Fine%20Arts%20Library&amp;digital=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roster==
In the Chinese Tradition, the 18 Luohans are generally presented in the order they are said to have appeared to Guan Xiu, not according to their power: Deer Sitting, Happy, Raised Bowl, Raised Pagoda, Meditating, Oversea, Elephant Riding, Laughing Lion, Open Heart, Raised Hand, Thinking, Scratched Ear, Calico Bag, Plantain, Long Eyebrow, Doorman, Taming Dragon and Taming Tiger.

The '''[[emblem]] of the Republic of Abkhazia'''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of Abkhazia|Article 10: Constitution of Abkhazia]]&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted by the [[Supreme Soviet]] of Abkhazia on 23 July 1992, after it declared its secession from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

The emblem of separatist Republic of Abkhazia is a shield divided vertically into white and green. On this are placed devices outlined in gold:
* At the base eight-pointed star, in the upper part of both the white and the green field are set two eight-pointed stars. 
* At the centre of the shield is a horseman, flying on the fabulous steed called ''[[Arash]]'', and shooting an arrow towards the stars. This scene is from the heroic epic ''[[Narts]]''.

Green symbolizes youth and life, while white symbolizes spirituality. The stars represent the sun, as well as the union of the East and West.

'''''Food of the Gods II''''', sometimes referred to as '''''Gnaw: Food of the Gods II''''' as well as '''''Food of the Gods Part 2''''', is a 1989 film that is a very loose sequel to the 1976 [[Bert I. Gordon]] [[The Food of the Gods (film)|film]] based on [[H.G. Wells]]' novel, ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth|The Food of the Gods]]''. It is a sequel in name only, as its plot bears no relation to the 1976 film.

==Plot==
Dr. Neil Hamilton ([[Paul Coufos]]) receives a call from his mentor Dr. Kate Travis ([[Jackie Burroughs]]) about a young boy named Bobby, whose deficient growth has been treated with Travis' experimental serum. Bobby has swiftly and unexpectedly grown larger than a full-grown adult and become violent. To find an antidote, Neil takes a sample of the serum back to his lab at a university science complex. There, animal-rights activists led by Mark Hales ([[Réal Andrews]]) and Neil's girlfriend Alex Reed ([[Lisa Schrage]]) are protesting the work of Prof. Edmund Delhurst ([[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]]), who claims to [[oncology|study]] [[cancer]] but in fact subjects animals to experimentation seeking a cure for [[baldness]].

Neil and his assistant Joshua ([[Frank Pellegrino (actor)|Frank Pellegrino]]) inject the serum into some lab [[rat]]s. That night, the activists (minus Alex) break into the complex to trash Delhurst's lab and accidentally release the now-giant rats, which kill Mark and escape into the campus' utility tunnels. Police Lieutenant Weizel (Michael Copeman) does not believe the surviving activists' statements despite Neil's [[Corroborating evidence|corroboration]] about the serum, and Dean White ([[David B. Nichols]]) hires a pair of [[pest control|exterminators]] to handle what he believes are normal-sized rats.

The giant rats kill several people, including one of the exterminators and the surviving activists, Al and Angie, escape. But the giant rats apparently kill whoever tried to hunt the animals down themselves. Delhurst's assistant, a janitor named Zeke, is attacked. But, the surviving exterminator, despite taking several rat bites to his arms and face, appears and burns this rat. Later, a night watchman tries to escape some rats, though he is killed off screen.  Alex discovers the body of a workman (a Mexican forced from his car and chased by rats) while two other men killed by the rats, whose bodies are still in the car, are discovered by the police. Although Lieutenant Weizel is convinced of the threat, Dean White remains skeptical and refuses to shut the campus down because of the upcoming grand opening of the university's new sports complex. When Joshua falls victim to the rats, Neil attacks the Dean and is fired.

Delhurst steals the serum sample and tests it, first on Neil's pet rat Louise, then on a sample of cancer cells. He accidentally contaminates himself wiĺth treated cells and dies within minutes as his entire body develops massive tumors. Neil returns to the lab to retrieve the antidote he has created, testing it by destroying Delhurst's transformed corpse. Meanwhile, the rats attack the swimming competition being held in the new sports complex, killing several people including Dean White.

Neil uses the enlarged but still-docile Louise, who is in [[Estrus|heat]], to lure the giant (male) rats into the university courtyard where Weizel and his men gun them all down. Neil phones Dr. Travis to inform her of the antidote, but it is too late; Bobby, now [[psychotic]] and larger than ever, kills Travis while she is on the phone and escapes.

'''Godfrey Higgins''' (30 January 1772 in [[Owston, Yorkshire]] – 9 August 1833 in [[Cambridge]]) was an English magistrate and landowner, a prominent advocate for social reform, [[historian]], and [[antiquarian]].  He is now known best for his writings concerning ancient myths, especially his book ''[[Anacalypsis]]'', published posthumously, in which he asserts a commonality among various religious myths, which he traces back to the supposed lost religion of [[Atlantis]].  He has been termed a "political radical, reforming county magistrate and idiosyncratic historian of religions".

==Life==

===Early career===
Higgins was the son of Godfrey Higgins of [[Skellow]] Grange, near [[Doncaster]]. He was educated in [[Hemsworth]] before being admitted to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] in 1790, and transferring to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HGNS790G|name=Higgins, Godfrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied [[law]] at the [[Inner Temple]], but was not [[called to the bar|granted a license to practice law]], and refrained from practice. When [[Napoleon]] threatened an invasion of the [[United Kingdom]], Higgins joined the [[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteer Corps]] and became a Captain of the [[Third West York Militia]].&lt;ref name="theohistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theohistory.org/thcovers/thscan103.html#Anchor-of-47942 |title=Theosophical History vol 1 no 3 July 1985 |publisher=Theohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800 he married Jane Thorpe, who gave birth to his son, also named Godfrey, and two daughters, Jane and Charlotte. After Higgins' promotion to the rank of major in 1808, he resigned from the Volunteer Corps citing a severe fever as reason. Soon thereafter he was appointed as magistrate or [[justice of the peace]] in [[Yorkshire, England|Yorkshire]].

===Reformist activities===
Higgins' work as a magistrate featured reformist campaigns, as part of which he "courageously exposed the scandalous treatment of pauper lunatics and campaigned for Parliamentary Reform, criticizing excessive taxation, the [[Corn Laws]], and the exploitation of children in factories".&lt;ref name="theohistory" /&gt; He was also favoured disestablishing the [[Church of Ireland]].&lt;ref name = "tuke"/&gt; In 1814 he had a major role in uncovering the abuse of patients at the York Lunatic Asylum after rumours of serious misconduct had come to his attention. He joined Quaker [[William Tuke]] in agitating for reform.&lt;ref name = "tuke"/&gt; In a surprise visit he forced staff to open doors which revealed female patients kept in "a number of secret cells in a state of filth, horrible beyond description...the most miserable objects I ever beheld." Most of the staff were dismissed and Higgins was able to secure a government enquiry into the management of the asylum, at which he gave evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Medcalf, "The York Lunatic Asylum Scandal", ''Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins was appointed as a Governor of the Asylum. He proceeded to investigate a suspicious fire that had destroyed many of the asylum's records, concluding that it was unlikely to have started by accident.&lt;ref name = "tuke"&gt;Kathleen Jones, ''Lunacy, Law, and Conscience, 1744-1845: The Social History of the Care of the Insane'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1955, p.80-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings on mythology===
Meanwhile, he developed a regimen to study the meaning of life and religion, and wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I came to a resolution to devote six hours a day to this pursuit for ten years. Instead of six hours daily for ten years, I believe I have, upon the average, applied myself to it for nearly ten hours daily for almost twenty years. In the first ten years of my search I may fairly say, I found nothing which I sought for; in the latter part of the twenty, the quantity of matter has so crowded in upon me, that I scarcely know how to dispose of it.&lt;ref name="burghwallis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burghwallis.com/village/articles/higgins.htm |title=Godfrey Higgins |publisher=Burghwallis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A keen antiquarian, Higgins was a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. According to [[Ross Nichols]], Higgins was also a "Chosen Chief" of the [[Druid|Order of Druids]], founded by [[John Toland]] in 1717. Higgins was claimed a member of [[The Druid Order|An Uileach Druidh Braithreaches]] ([[The Druid Order]]), an ancient [[Druid]] order that predates the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]; however, these claims are unsubstantiated. Regardless, Higgins demonstrated extensive knowledge and familiarity with the traditions of Druid orders in his work, ''The Celtic Druids''.

Higgins' wife died on 18 May 1822. Higgins' own death, on 9 August 1833, resulted from an illness which he suffered while attending a meeting of [[The British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="burghwallis" /&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Anacalypsis.jpg|thumb|''Anacalypsis'' by Higgins, first published posthumously in 1836]]
Higgins' main writings were part of the syncretism of the day, which was an attempt to associate Biblical narratives to evidence emerging about other religious traditions. Higgins discussed, and argued with, other authors of this tradition such as [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Roger O'Connor]] and [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]. Higgins' own writings, especially ''Anacalypsis'', were later to have a major influence on the development of [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]], through the publications of [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theohistory.org/thcovers/thscan103.html |title=Theosophical History vol 1 no 3 July 1985 |publisher=Theohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ronald Hutton]], Higgins' ''Anacalypsis'' says that,

{{quote|the megalithic remains scattered across the world had been the works of a great nation unknown to history, which had discovered religion and writing. This had given its system of spirituality and philosophy to the ancient Indians, Chaldeans, Hebrews, Egyptians, and Druids alike, based on a veneration of the sun with a threefold personification of deity and a myth of a saviour god who dies and then returns. Higgins identified this nation with the drowned land of Atlantis, hitherto regarded as a myth in itself. This device not only dealt with the question of why no objective evidence of the ancestral civilization remained, but effectively turned the Atlanteans into a blank sheet upon which an ideal religion could be delineated, composed of the writer's favourite aspects of those known to history. In Higgins's scheme, the ancient knowledge had been hopelessly corrupted by the Christian churches, and needed now to be reconstructed.&lt;ref name = "hhh"&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, 1999, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These ideas "lay dormant for about forty years, and was then taken up and given a considerable popularity by one of the century's truly international figures, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky".&lt;ref name = "hhh"/&gt;

Hutton describes Higgins as an "occultist and mystic", and [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] also terms him an "occultist".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2008, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], who has written a detailed history of esotericism, says that Higgins had no interest in either occultism or esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;New Age religion and Western culture: esotericism in the mirror of secular thought, Wouter J. Hanegraaff, 1996, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins main interests were the history of religious beliefs and practical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Budget of Paradoxes]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], 2007, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal works===
*''Horae Sabbaticae'', published in 1826, was a study of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]]. Higgins recommended the Sabbath remain a festival instead of a "gloomy" fast.
*''The Celtic Druids'', published in 1827 and 1829 as three parts, was intended as a precursor to ''[[Anacalypsis]]''. ''The Celtic Druids'' was "an attempt to show that the druids were the priests of oriental colonies who emigrated from [[India]], were the introducers of the First or [[Cadmus|Cadmean System of Letters]], and the builders of [[Stonehenge]], [[Carnac]], and other [[Cyclopean]] works in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]." Higgins prefaced the 1829 second edition stating that he was preparing a review of "all the ancient Mythologies of the world, which, however varied, and corrupted in recent times, were originally one, and that one founded on principles sublime, beautiful, and true." This review would become ''Anacalypsis''.
*''An Apology for the life and character of the celebrated Prophet of Arabia called Mohamed, or the Illustrious'' was published in 1829.
*''[[Anacalypsis]]'' was written in 1833 and published posthumously in 1836 as two quarto volumes numbering 1,436 pages with meticulous references to hundreds of books. ''Anacalypsis'' was printed initially as a limited edition of 200 copies, reprinted partially in 1878, and reprinted completely in a limited edition of 350 copies in 1927. The full title is ''Anacalypsis; An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into the Origin of languages, Nations and Religions''.  The book is a review of the history of religions; however, due to his death Higgins was unable to complete the final chapter on [[Christianity]].  In it he claims that the [[Druids]] and [[Jews]] originated in India, that [[Abraham]] is really [[Brahma]], and that there is a secret "pandeist" global movement.

===Quotations===
* In ''Anacalypsis'' Higgins asserts a commonality among various religious myths:

'"One thing is clear—the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines." Higgins bluntly declares that every ancient author, without exception, has come to us through the medium of Christian editors who have "either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Harpur]], 2004, ''[[The Pagan Christ]]'', pp. 30, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

* In his publication ''Anacalypsis'' Higgins makes some interesting claims stating that all the Greek Gods and Goddesses of Greece were black such as Jupiter "Osiris and his Bull were black; all the Gods and Goddesses of Greece were black: at least this was the case with Jupiter, Bacchus, Hercules, Apollo, Ammon.The Goddesses Venus, Isis, Hecati, Diana, Juno, Metis, Ceres, Cybile, are black. The Multi-mammia is black in the Campidoglio at Rome, and in Montfaucon, Antiquity explained. Page 138
&lt;ref name="scribd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/6075857/Anacalypsis-Full-Only-Text%2049/ |title=Anacalypsis (Full Only Text) |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In ''Anacalypsis'' he states that the Jews of Jacob or Israel were Ethiopians
"There seems to be nothing improbable in these Ethiopians being the tribe of the Jews—the tribe of Jacob or Israel. I think these Ethiopians did come under Jacob, and did settle in Goshen, and gave the names of Maturea and Avaris to the city in which they dwelt." Page 399
&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt;

*In ''Anacalypsis'' he states that the Jews of Asia minor were a tribe and colony of black Buddhists from India.
"Solomon was a personification or incarnation of wisdom, and the Jews, of Asia Minor were a tribe or colony from India, of black Buddhists, at or about the same time with the Ioudi to Syria, under the Brahmin."
*He also states that all the hero Gods and saviours were black too.
"All the hero Gods Theseus, Bacchus, Æsculapius, &amp;c., were saviours and black saviours too. These black icons were made when man himself was black. He made his God after himself, and then said that man was made after the image of God."

A '''halo hat''' (sometimes '''halo brim hat''') is a millinery design in which the headgear acts as a circular frame for the face, creating a halo effect. The design is said to date back to the late 19th century, when it was known as the '''aureole hat'''; this name is sometimes still used.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|page=66|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=aureole+%2B+halo+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cNZhM4K_eP&amp;sig=QV2bIwSI14MKKpllo2JK7jJLC_k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KjZmVIrtDoznarHQgrAH&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aureole%20%2B%20halo%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be known as the ''angel hat'' or ''bambini'' – the latter said to derive from Italian for terracotta plaques depicting the infant Christ.&lt;ref name="Hats and Headwear Chico"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chico|first1=Beverly|title=Hats and Headwear around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO LLC|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781610690621|pages=211–12|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GdbYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=millinery+%2B+halo+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pp68mWvYMR&amp;sig=uzT7vx3Ow5bUoIPkTQTxF5Nixso&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zfxjVKzpNpGO7AbCxYGoAg&amp;ved=0CHcQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=millinery%20%2B%20halo%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A halo hat may be a wide range of sizes – some lying close to the head in the style of a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] or [[Cloche hat|cloche]] and others that are similar in dimensions to a [[Picture hat|picture]] or [[cartwheel hat]]. Typically, designs are worn towards the back of the head to create the 'halo' effect.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Costume Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|page=164|edition=1999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=millinery+%2B+halo+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adsrnnPnCJ&amp;sig=Cf5z6IlAOmdSObQz9oOQ9XjcUMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PP9jVMTGLMjAPJXUgdgH&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=millinery%20%2B%20halo%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs with open crowns may also be referred to as halo hats or as diadems.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland-P76"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|page=76|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=halo+brim+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_cG4PXdR&amp;sig=g92EleqmAkXX_rb7rhrsRYOWEFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_mupVIDrN43haNHLgbgO&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=halo%20brim%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular from the 1930s on, the halo hat was created in a variety of fabrics – knitted or crocheted versions could be made at home – and could be a circle or semi-circle in shape. The halo became popular with brides; one of the most famous examples is the blue straw half-circle halo created for the wedding of [[Wedding dress of Wallis Warfield|Wallis Simpson]] by the Parisian millinery house of [[Caroline Reboux]].

==History==
The halo hat is said to have first come into fashion the late 1880s, when it was usually known as an aureole hat (a synonym for halo), and this was a name that continued to be used to describe the circular or semi-circular shape into the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Hats and Headwear Chico" /&gt; The ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' used the term to describe a new hat style in 1937.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Sentinel Aureole"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hat forms an aureole|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19370514&amp;id=rEZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ag4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6565,2847503|accessdate=13 November 2014|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=14 May 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, describing the outfits worn by racegoers at a [[Sandown Park]] meet in 1937, ''[[The Times]]'' referred to an: "aureole-brimmed" hat design.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Racing from Sandown Park: dresses at the Eclipse Meeting|issue=47739|publisher=The Times|date=17 July 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s popularity===
The halo shape became popular again from the start of the 1930s in both the United States and Europe. It was a distinct move away from the cloche style that was worn low over the brow, as the halo exposed the face and brow, also showing off more elaborate curled hairstyles becoming popular during this era.&lt;ref name="VFG History of hats for women"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of hats for women|url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/fashion-history/the-history-of-womens-hats/|accessdate=13 November 2014|publisher=Vintage Fashion Guild|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 ''The Times'' reviewed the Christmas catalogues, saying: "the new season millinery, with its leading novelty, the 'halo' hat, is specially interesting".&lt;ref name="The Times 46612"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Fashions in Millinery: The "Halo" Hat|issue=46612|publisher=The Times|date=27 November 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Duchess of York]] was described as wearing a [[velvet]] halo hat to attend a charity matinee with [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="The Times 46666"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Duchess of York and Princess Elizabeth: Visit to charity matinee|issue=46666|publisher=The Times|date=31 January 1934|ref=pg.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Wallis Simpson would wear an iconic gown and halo bridal headpiece, made by Caroline Reboux's studio in Paris and trimmed with pink and blue feathers.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Sebba"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sebba|first1=Anna|last2=Fox|first2=Imogen|title='Wallis Simpson used fashion as a weapon'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2011/sep/02/wallis-simpson-fashion|accessdate=16 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallis Simpson wedding dress Clegg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clegg|first1=Melanie|title=Wallis Simpson's wedding dress|url=http://madameguillotine.org.uk/2013/06/03/this-weeks-dress-wallis-simpsons-wedding-dress/|accessdate=14 November 2014|publisher=Madame Guilllotine|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design variations==
The halo was a flexible design. While it could create a large frame around the face – as with the circular straw design that featured on the ''[[Picture Post]]'' in 1940 – it could also have more modest proportions.&lt;ref name="Hats and Headwear Chico" /&gt; Like the [[draped turban]], the halo style lent itself to adaptations – feathers, bows, trims or flowers could be added – making it a versatile hat style.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press jewel halo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bonnet brim hat with jewel halo!

New Yorker two-way halo|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47502383|accessdate=14 November 2014|publisher=The Australian Women's Weekly|date=15 June 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger versions suited the post-war [[Christian Dior S.A.#The .22New Look.22|New Look]] designs, balancing the proportions of the full skirts that were fashionable after [[World War II|wartime]] austerity.&lt;ref name="Hats and Headwear Chico" /&gt;

The halo-style hat became popular for wedding outfits – future [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] of the United States [[Betty Ford]] wore a large-brimmed halo wedding hat in 1938 – and half halos would become a staple design for more traditional wedding headpieces, remaining popular in bridal designs.&lt;ref name="Hats and Headwear Chico" /&gt;

===Revivals===
In the mid 1960s, [[British Pathé]]'s 1964 film ''Hats on for Winter'' featured a large-scale halo design with sunburst pattern, alongside visors and caps. Designers such as [[Graham Smith (milliner)|Graham Smith]] created oversized examples during the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Times 63083"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Liz|title=Brimful|issue=63083|publisher=The Times|date=17 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most memorable modern halo-shaped hats are the design created by [[Philip Treacy]] for influential fashion editor [[Isabella Blow]], and the wheatsheaf halo-effect headpiece he designed for the wedding of [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles|Camilla Parker Bowles]] to Prince Charles.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A film about wheatsheaf hat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding Dresses 1775-2014: Philip Treacy|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/wedding-dress-1775-2014/phillip-treacy/|website=vam.ac.uk|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very Rev '''Henry Duncan''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (8 October 1774 – 12 February 1846) was a Scottish [[Minister of the Kirk|minister]], geologist and [[social reformer]]. The minister of [[Ruthwell]] parish church in Dumfriesshire, he founded the world's first commercial savings bank. He served as [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1839. He was also an author, publisher and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in 1774 at [[Lochrutton]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], where his father, George Duncan, was minister. As a boy he met the poet [[Robert Burns]], who visited Lochrutton Manse. Duncan was educated in [[Dumfries]] at the [[Dumfries Academy|Academy]]. After studying for two sessions at [[St. Andrews University]] he was sent to [[Liverpool]] to begin commercial life, and under the patronage of his relative, [[James Currie (physician)|Dr. James Currie]], the biographer of [[Robert Burns]], his prospects of success were very fair; but his heart was not in business, and he soon left Liverpool to study at Edinburgh and Glasgow for the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Whilst in [[Edinburgh]] he joined the [[Speculative Society]], and became intimate with [[Francis Horner]] and [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

==Ministry and works==
In 1798 he was ordained as minister of the Church of Scotland and became Minister at [[Ruthwell]] in Dumfriesshire in 1799, where he spent the rest of his life. Duncan from the first was remarkable for the breadth of his views, especially in what concerned the welfare of the people, and the courage and ardour with which he promoted measures not usually thought to be embraced in the minister's rôle. In a time of scarcity he brought Indian corn from Liverpool. At the time when a French invasion was dreaded he raised a company of volunteers, of which he was the captain. He published a series of cheap popular tracts, contributing to the series some that were much prized, afterwards collected under the title ''The Cottage Fireside''. He originated a newspaper, ''[[Dumfries Courier|The Dumfries and Galloway Courier]]'', of which he was editor for seven years.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

===Savings banks===
The measure which is most honourably connected with Duncan's name was the institution of [[savings bank|savings banks]]. The first savings bank was instituted at Ruthwell in 1810,&lt;ref name="GFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst120.html|title=Rev. Dr. Henry Duncan|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duncan was unceasing in his efforts to promote the cause throughout the country. His influence was used to procure the first act of parliament passed to encourage such institutions. By speeches, lectures, and pamphlets he made the cause known far and wide. The scheme readily commended itself to all intelligent friends of the people, and the growing progress and popularity of the movement have received no check to the present day. Great though his exertions were, and large his outlay in this cause, he never received any reward or acknowledgement beyond the esteem of those who appreciated his work and the spirit in which it was done.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

In 1810 Duncan opened the world's first commercial savings bank, which would eventually form part of the [[Trustee Savings Bank]], paying interest on its investors' modest savings. The bicentenary of this event was celebrated with a conference held by the [[Centre for Theology and Public Issues]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/divinity/news-events/events/henry-duncan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185920/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/divinity/news-events/events/henry-duncan |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers investigated Duncan's legacy in light of current social, financial, and religious dynamics. The '''Savings Bank Museum''' tells the story of early home savings in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

===Other works===
In 1823 Duncan received the degree of D.D. from the [[University of St. Andrews]]. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work which reached ultimately to four volumes, entitled ''[[The Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons]]''. It was well received, and ran through several editions. To the ''[[Transactions of the Scottish Antiquarian Society]]'' he contributed a description of a celebrated runic cross: the [[Ruthwell Cross]] (now in Ruthwell church), one of the finest [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] crosses in Britain. This late 7th/early 8th century cross, which he discovered in his parish and restored in 1818, and on which volumes have since been written, is remarkable for its [[rune|runic]] inscription, which contains excerpts from ''[[The Dream of the Rood]]'', an [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

He made a memorable contribution likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a paper to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Royal Society]] of [[Edinburgh]] describing the discovery of the fossil footmarks of four legged vertebrate animals in the [[Permian]] red sandstone of [[Corncockle Muir]], near [[Lochmaben]]&lt;ref name="Duncan1831"&gt; Duncan, H. 1831. An account of the tracks and footmarks of animals found impressed on sandstone in the quarry of Corncockle Muir, in Dunfreisshire. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 11:194-209. &lt;/ref&gt;. The paper, published in 1831, was one of the first two scientific reports of a fossil track (the other being made by [[Mr. J. Grierson]]&lt;ref&gt; Grierson, J. 1928. On footsteps before the flood, in a specimen of res sandstone. Edinburgh Journal of Science, 8:130-134.&lt;/ref&gt;). A cast of the tracks of ''Chelichnus duncani'' can be found in the [[Royal Museum|National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

While at first not very decided between the moderate and the evangelical party in the church, Duncan soon sided with the latter, and became the intimate friend of such men as Dr. Chalmers and Dr. [[Andrew Mitchell Thomson|Andrew Thomson]]. In the earlier stages of the controversy connected with the Scottish church he addressed letters on the subject to his old college friends [[Lord Brougham]] and the [[Marquis of Lansdowne]], and to [[Lord Melbourne]], home secretary.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

In 1839 Duncan became [[List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], and at the time of the [[Disruption of 1843]] became one of the founding ministers of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]&lt;ref name="GFS"/&gt; leaving a manse and grounds that had been rendered very beautiful by his taste and skill.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

Henry Duncan was visited by [[Robert Murray M'Cheyne]] during his vacations in Ruthwell.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Duncan was a man of most varied accomplishments — manual, intellectual, social, and spiritual. With the arts of drawing, modelling, sculpture, landscape-gardening, and even the business of an architect, he was familiar, and his knowledge of literature and science was varied and extensive. In private and family life he was highly estimable, while his ministerial work was carried on with great earnestness and delight. The [[stroke]] of paralysis that ended his life on 19 February 1846 fell on him while conducting a religious service in the cottage of an elder.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

==Family==
Duncan's first wife whom he married in November 1804 was Agnes Craig, daughter of his predecessor, the Rev. John Craig. They had two sons and a daughter. Agnes Duncan died of influenza in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sophy: Dr Duncan of Ruthwell, Founder of Saving's Banks, by his great Granddaughter, Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan's second wife whom he married in 1836 was Mary Grey, daughter of George Grey of [[West Ord]], sister of [[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]] of Dilston, a well-known Northumbrian gentleman (see memoir by his daughter, Mrs. Josephine Butler), widow of the Rev. [[R. Lundie]] of [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], and mother of [[Jane Lundie Bonar]]. She was a lady of considerable accomplishments and force of character, and author of several books:{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=166}}
# "Memoir of the Rev. M. Bruen".
# ''[[Memoir of Mary Lundie Duncan]]'' (her daughter, author of several well-known hymns for children).
# ''[[Missionary Life in Samoa, being the Life of George Archibald Lundie]]'' (her son).
# ''[[Children of the Manse]]''.
# "America as I found it".

Duncan's son George John Craig Duncan was born in 1806. He became the minister at [[Kirkpatrick Durham]]. His wife was [[Isabelle Wight Duncan]] who was a notable author.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Snobelen, ‘Duncan , Isabelle Wight (1812–1878)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/74811, accessed 19 Nov 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
Henry Duncan's daughter Barbara referred to by Thomas Carlyle as "the bonny little Barbara Duncan" married the Rev. James Dodds of Dunbar.

==Legacy==
The headquarters of [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB Bank]] (a descendent of the original Trustee Savings Bank) is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tsb.co.uk/legal/information/information-about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron-on''' transfers are images that can be imprinted on [[Textile|fabric]].  They are frequently used to print onto [[T-shirt]]s.

On one side is paper, and on the other is the image that will be transferred in reverse.  After placing it on the fabric and either running over the fabric side with an [[Iron (appliance)|iron]] or pressing with a [[heat press]], the image is transferred to the fabric.  Iron-on transfer paper is available for use with [[computer printers]].

Commercial quality heat [[transfer paper]] used in a heat press will yield much better results in terms of 'hand' (how the print feels on  the fabric) and durability than store bought papers or transfers applied with a home iron.

A number of inkjet, copier and laser printer toners have been developed to utilize this process. This is the process developed at [http://BlackLightning.com BlackLightning] by Walter Jeffries in the 1980s for negatively charged laser printer toners for use in black and white laser printers like those from Apple, HP, Xerox, Canon and other vendors.

The advantages of commercial heat transfer over screenprinting are that it is relatively cheap and easy to create one-off, full color designs.  Also, when compared with [[dye sublimation]] techniques, heat transfers can be used on 100% cotton garments, whereas [[dye sublimation]] requires at least a 50/50 poly cotton garment.

==Iron-on fabric==
Iron-on fabric has a glue backing that melts into another fabric it is applied to with heat.  It is used in patching torn clothes or to apply extra fabric in places subject to extreme wear. An alternative to iron on adhesive is dryer heat activated adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetatpatch.com/info.htm|title=application}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron-on labels==
There are primarily 2 types of iron-on labels: a form of material tape; and a form of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] similar to that used on graphic [[t-shirt]]s. With the vinyl type the objective is to effectively melt the label onto the cloth so the label and [[garment]] become one, hence a permanent bond. The application of a label typically takes about 10–15 seconds for the label to become one with the garment and then a few minutes to cool.

==Iron-on appliques==
Iron-on [[applique]]s are decorative embroidery items with a melt-glue backing.

==Iron-on patches==
Iron-on patches can be created in a variety of ways.  The key behind all iron on patches is an heat reactive adhesive is added to an imprinted material to allow an iron or heat press to activate the glue.  Different glues react to different fabrics in different ways.

[[File:Jenny Oropeza (142821897).jpg|thumb|right|Oropeza in 2006]]

'''Jennifer Ann "Jenny" Oropeza''' (September 27, 1957 – October 20, 2010) was the [[California State Senate|California State Senator]] for the 28th district which includes the cities of [[Carson, California|Carson]], [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[Hermosa Beach]], [[Lomita]], [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], and [[Torrance, California|Torrance]]; the Los Angeles communities of [[Cheviot Hills, California|Cheviot Hills]], [[Bel Air, California|Bel Air]], [[Harbor City, California|Harbor City]], [[Harbor Gateway]], [[Lennox, California|Lennox]], [[Mar Vista, California|Mar Vista]], [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]], [[Palms, California|Palms]], [[Playa del Rey, California|Playa del Rey]], [[Rancho Park]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]], [[West Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], [[Westchester, California|Westchester]], [[Wilmington, California|Wilmington]] and [[Venice, California|Venice]]; and part of the city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].

Oropeza was elected to her first term in the [[California State Senate]] in November 2006 and garnered 62 percent of the vote. She died less than two weeks before the [[California State Senate elections, 2010|November 2, 2010 election]], in which she had been expected to easily win reelection. Her name remained on the ballot in the 28th Senate District. Oropeza posthumously won reelection on November 2, 2010.

She served in the [[California State Assembly]] for six years prior (2000–2006) to her time in the Senate. Oropeza and Tom Mullins married in August 1977.

==Education==
Oropeza graduated from Alhambra High School and received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from California State University, Long Beach.  She began her career in public service by serving two terms as student body president at [[California State University, Long Beach]]. During that time, she was appointed by the governor to the [[Board of Trustees]] of the [[California State University|CSU]] system.

==Early political career==
Oropeza was the first Latina to serve as a member of the Long Beach Unified School District Board of Education and held office from 1988 to 1994. In 1994, she was elected the first [[Latina]] member of the Long Beach City Council and won re-election in 1998. As an [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] board member from 1996 through 2000, Oropeza represented the southeast cities of [[Los Angeles County]] and served on MTA's Planning and Programming and Construction committees. While with the MTA, she also chaired the Goods Movement Committee of the Southern California Association of Governments.

==Assemblymember==
Oropeza was a member of the [[California State Assembly]] from 2000 to 2006 for the 55th Assembly District. In January 2002, with barely a year's experience in the Assembly, Oropeza was named chair of the Assembly Budget Committee — on the eve of the worst deficit in California history. She served two years. From 2004 to 2006, Oropeza chaired the Assembly Transportation Committee.

She was Vice Chair of the dual-house Latino Caucus. In 2005, the [[League of California Cities]]' Latino Caucus named her Legislator of the Year{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}; in 2006, the Los Angeles [[League of Conservation Voters]] awarded her the '''Smith-Weiss Environmental Champion Award''' for her work on issues from air pollution and cancer prevention to radiation and environmental advocacy. She had long supported transportation improvements, including Proposition 42 in 2002, which sought to dedicate a portion of gasoline taxes toward construction.

==California State Senate==

===Run for the State Senate===
On June 6, 2006, Oropeza won a very close Democratic primary against former Assembly member [[George Nakano]].  Oropeza was endorsed by the [[California Democratic Party]] and the [[California League of Conservation Voters]]. Nakano had been endorsed by [[US Congress|Congresswoman]] [[Jane Harman]] and California Assemblyman [[Ted Lieu]]. Oropeza captured 52.8% of the vote to Nakano's 47.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartvoter.org/2007/06/26/ca/la/vote/oropeza_j/bio.html Profile], smartvoter.org, June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committees and caucuses===
Oropeza chaired the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee and was a member of the Appropriations; Transportation; and Elections, Reapportionment and Constitutional Amendments Committees. She also chaired the select committees on Integrity of Elections and Public Health and the Environment and was a member of the Select Committees on the [[Alameda Corridor]] and Asian Pacific Affairs. In addition, she was a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Fiscal Oversight and Bonded Indebtedness, the Senate Subcommittee on California Ports and Goods Movement, as well as the Streamlined Sales Tax Project board of governance and the Commission on the Status of Women. As one of 26 Latinos in the Legislature, Oropeza chaired the California Latino Caucus Policy Committee on Environmental Justice.

===Legislation===
Upon election to the State Senate, Oropeza introduced 24 bills. The policy areas ranged from preventing smoking in cars while minors are present (SB 7) to increasing the efforts of the [[California State Controller]] to contact the owners of unclaimed property (SB 920). She introduced legislation in the areas of local sales, [[massage therapy]], teacher credentials, and air pollution in ports.

==Death==
In 2004 Oropeza was treated for liver cancer. She was admitted to [[Long Beach Memorial Medical Center]] for difficulty breathing, but later died there the evening of October 20, 2010. She had been undergoing treatment for a blood clot in her abdomen since May 2010.

==Legacy==
Since her death, Oropeza has been honored by the Democratic Women's Study Club in Long Beach, which posthumously awarded her the Political Leadership Award, which is now named the Jenny Oropeza Political Leadership Award. Centro CHA in Long Beach posthumously awarded Oropeza the [http://www.presstelegram.com/news/ci_18742593 Create Change Community Service Excellence Award], now known as the Create Change: Jenny Oropeza Community Service Excellence Award.  The Long Beach Lambda Democratic Club created the [http://www.insidesocal.com/outinthe562/2011/10/long-beach-lambda-democratic-club-to-honor-jean-harris-at-banquet-saturday.html Jenny Oropeza Ally of the Year Award], which like the other two awards, was first given in 2011.

As a tribute to Oropeza's dedication to fostering protections for key California-state public health programs, the Los Angeles County Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, in joint collaboration with the six other California-based Komen Affiliates ("the California Collaborative"), established the [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110718006833/en/Los-Angeles-County-Affiliate-Susan-G.-Komen Senator Jenny Oropeza Public Policy Internship position].
 
The City of Long Beach named the community center in Cesar E. Chavez Park the [http://www.lbpost.com/news/allison/11380 Jenny Oropeza Community Center].  On December 8, 2011 the Los Angeles Unified School District dedicated the [http://www.lbpost.com/life/staffreports/12903 Jenny Oropeza Global Studies Academy]. The Academy is one of four academies at the Rancho Dominguez Preparatory School.

In August 2012 the California Legislature approved the naming of the "Honorable Jenny Oropeza Memorial Overcrossing" for the section of Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington that created the bridge that spans the Alameda Corridor.  The Alameda Corridor did not have the money to complete this overcrossing and Oropeza worked with Federal, State and local government entities, as well as the railroads and Metropolitan Transportation Authority to find the funds to construct this last and critical portion of the project.

On April 21, 2014, State Senator Ricardo Lara introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 115 that would designate the portion of State Highway Route 710 that runs between Pico Avenue and West Wardlow Road in the City of Long Beach as the Senator Jenny Oropeza Memorial Freeway.

An annual scholarship, the Senator Jenny Oropeza Memorial Scholarship, is awarded at California State University, Long Beach, each year to a student who is committed to a career in public service.

'''Ladderax''' is a modular shelving and storage system created by Robert Heal in 1964 for Staples of Cricklewood, London. It is an example of [[Mid-Century modern]] design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladderax.com Ladderax Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heal was influenced by the work of the "Danish school". This mid-century Scandinavian design movement was largely about reinterpreting simple, linear shapes from Georgian and Shaker pieces, and making them “straighter”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/interiorsandshopping/8118034/Interiors-Get-the-Mad-Men-look.html The Telegraph: Get the Mad Men look]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ladderax System consists of a number of upright ladders, supporting shelves and cabinets. These are fixed by resting on steel support rods, hooked on to the rungs of the ladders. They fit into grooves under the shelves and cabinets. This allows easily assembly and flexibility. Ladderax does not require any permanent fixing to a wall, because it self-supports.

'''''The Sacrifice''''' is a digital [[comic book]] created by [[Valve Corporation]] based on the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' video game, detailing the events that the protagonists–Zoey, Louis, Francis, and Bill–experience after the chronological final campaign, ''Blood Harvest''. It accompanies a campaign in both ''Left 4 Dead'' and ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]'' of the same name. It also serves as a prequel to the campaign from ''Left 4 Dead 2'' called ''The Passing'', which makes allusions to the events.

==Synopsis==
''The Sacrifice'' takes place between the "Blood Harvest" campaign of the main ''Left 4 Dead'' game, and leads up to the events of "The Sacrifice" downloadable campaign for ''Left 4 Dead''. Interspersed within the story are flashbacks showing the events that each Survivor experienced a short time "after First Infection"; watching friends, loved ones, and strangers turn into zombie-like creatures before their eyes and each realizing they are immune to the Infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=1-4|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of "Blood Harvest", the four Survivors—Bill, Zoey, Louis, and Francis—are rescued by U.S. Army and taken to Millhaven, a well-fortified army base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=1|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=}} "'''Soldier''': ''[after knocking Francis out cold, to the other Survivors]'' Bring your smart ass friend. Anybody that makes a break for it, that body gets shot. Welcome to Millhaven."&lt;/ref&gt; They are immediately split up; Francis and Louis are put into an isolation room, while Bill and Zoey are tested by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=2|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=51|panel=|id=}} "'''Louis''': Wherever we are, it sure ain't Camp Echo. / '''Francis''': Zoey and Bill? / '''Louis''': ''"With the Doctor."'' That's all they'll tell me. ''[...]'' / "'''Annie''': You're in a hermetically-sealed sterile room with an independent ventilation system. The only way we're coming in there is if you are dead or on fire.&lt;/ref&gt; All four learn that they are "Carriers", having the virus yet showing no symptoms. Zoey herself is horrified to learn that her father, who requested her to kill him before he turned, had the Carrier gene, meaning that his death could have been avoided. They describe to Lt. Mora how the Infection has mutated to create "Special" Infected with unique abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=2|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=53-54|panel=|id=}} "'''Louis''': ''[speaking to the soldiers guarding them about "mutated" Infected]'' Wait a minute.

See, the barf attracts ''other'' zombies. It's like...I dunno, cat nip or something. ''[...]'' But even ''they're'' not the worst ones. There's this thing called a Hunter. They'll leap a hundred off a building, right on ''top'' of you. Rip your guts out with their ''claws''. / '''Annie''': Holy shit... / '''Louis''': Then you got the Tanks. / '''Jeff''': The zombies have ''tanks?'' / '''Louis''': Don't need 'em. These things're thirty feet tall. Arms like ''tree trunks''. They'll pick a boulder up just to ''beat'' you to ''death'' with it."&lt;/ref&gt; Though Lt. Mora agrees with the Survivors' reports (having seen the Special Infected himself), his superior, Everly, is highly skeptical, and refuses to take steps to consider evacuating the base despite not receiving orders for the last nine days. Mora becomes concerned that the Survivors may be on the side of the Infected, and privately discusses plans to evacuate the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=2|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Sacrifice Comic.jpg|left|thumb|256px|One of the pages from the fourth issue of the comic.]]
Mora overthrows Everly and sounds the evac alarm, unintentionally drawing Infected that attack the base, including several Special Infected able to breach the base's defense. As Mora's squad attempt to hold back the Infected; Bill, Zoey, Louis, and Francis, along with two befriended soldiers and a doctor (who is also immune), attempt to make their way to a nearby trainyard to a train south towards Florida. As they are escaping, Mora, injured from battle, attempts to stop the group, believing them responsible for the invasion; but Bill knocks him down. As they discover a train, Everly attempts to escape in a helicopter, but a Tank sends it crashing to the ground. Finding an available train, the group becomes concerned that it has become too quiet, and Zoey suggests there is something lying in wait for them. They are soon attacked by a Tank and a horde of Infected. The two soldiers sacrifice themselves to protect the group as they start the train. While the four Survivors are able to board in time, the doctor lags behind; to Zoey's dismay and anger, Bill refuses to slow down, stating that "we come back for our own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=3|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they travel south, Bill explains that his plan is to get them to the islands of the [[Florida Keys]]; as the Infected cannot swim, they will be safe there. At a town at the end of the line, they start searching for a boat. While navigating the town, Zoey explains to Francis that she doesn't understand Bill; Francis says that "Bill doesn't always do the right thing, but he does it for the right reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=4|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=|quote=&lt;!--'''Francis''': --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, they find a yacht, but Louis is severely injured when he finds it packed with Witches. After burning the yacht, the group finds a sailboat, filled with provisions and medicine; however, to get it downriver, they must raise a rusty old bridge blocking their path. They start nearby generators and prepare to fight the horde while waiting for the bridge to be raised, but soon the generators give out. Bill, without pause, jumps off the bridge and makes his way to the generators, restarting them as three Tanks strike him and maul him to death. Francis attempts to go after Bill but Zoey stops him, sadly commenting that Bill's sacrifice will have been for nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Michael Avon Oeming]]|story=Left 4 Dead|title=[http://www.l4d.com/comic/ The Sacrifice]|volume=|issue=4|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=|location=|page=|panel=|id=}} "'''Zoey''': He did this for ''us.'' If you go down there, he did it for ''nothing.'' / '''Francis''': ''[lowering his head]'' ...god''damn''it."&lt;/ref&gt; After waiting for the horde to disperse, the three quietly return to the boat and set course to the Keys.

Part 3 of The Sacrifice releases, Left 4 Dead PC News |publisher=GamesRadar |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve commented that they hated to see video games made into bad films or comics, due to most of them being "disconnected from [the video game's] source", so they decided to make the comic in-house. They commissioned Oeming to illustrate their comic to allow the comic to reach a certain level of quality. While the comic began as smaller than the current size, it grew as they fleshed out certain parts, due to their enjoyment of the characters and their intention to "give each one time in the spotlight." Valve also explains that they feel that comics are a better format for video game adaptations than films; they state that when players get attached to a character, a comic book allows them to appreciate them more than a two-hour film versus spending "hours and hours, even hundreds of hours with them" with them in the video game. They add that comics help to go into stories that the game doesn't elaborate on.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/games/left-4-dead-comics-interview-101004.html |title=Sacrificing LEFT 4 DEAD With Online Comics |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the comic's content was created before the comic was created; in particular, the flashback featuring Francis was one of the first thing that was written for him. Valve explains the addition of numerous supporting characters is due to the new format; where the video games only allowed for focus on the main characters, they could go more in depth on others and show the effects of the infection on the rest of the world. When asked why Bill was chosen to die, Valve explained that they wanted the sacrifice to be done by the most impacting and favourite character by both Valve and the community, as well as the fact that his story matched ''The Sacrifice'' well.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

''The Sacrifice'' was released in four parts. Valve released it in both downloadable PDF format or viewable on their web site. They specifically released versions of the comic without text or speech bubbles for the purpose of allowing fans to localize them into other languages. They added that this would allow fans to make their own dialogue for them.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Words: Tyler Nagata, GamesRadar US |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/left-4-dead/news/part-two-of-the-left-4-dead-comic-releases/a-20100922142616969032/g-20061120155139282079 |title=Part two of the Left 4 Dead comic releases, Left 4 Dead PC News |publisher=GamesRadar |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=barichnikov |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/65709/left-4-dead-sacrifice-dlc |title=Left 4 Dead 'Sacrifice DLC' Comic Part Two Av |publisher=Shacknews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve announced that the best fan-made comics would be featured on the ''Left 4 Dead'' developer's blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/09/22/part-2-of-the-left-4-dead-comic-is-out/ |title=Part 2 of the Left 4 Dead comic is out |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part was released on September 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Longgshot |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/65539/left-4-dead-sacrifice-dlc |title=Left 4 Dead Sacrifice DLC Comic Launches Tomo |publisher=Shacknews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each following part was released every week following, up until the release of The Sacrifice in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=4352 |title=Left 4 Dead Blog |publisher=L4d.com |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually released for the [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] items [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=4493 |title=Left 4 Dead Blog |publisher=L4d.com |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether more comics would be made by Valve, they stated in the affirmative, specifically saying that "this isn’t the last you will see of Left 4 Dead comics."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The full comic was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in ''Valve Presents: The Sacrifice and Other Steam-Powered Stories'', a volume along with other comics created by Valve for ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35767/Comic_Book_Based_On_Valve_Strips_Coming_This_November.php | title = 	Comic Book Based On Valve Strips Coming This November | first = Mike | last=  Rose | date = 2011-07-11 | accessdate = 2011-07-11 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[GamesRadar]]'s Tyler Nagata commented that, as of the second release, it was "pretty great," praising it for its "snarky dialogue and messy encounters with the special infected".&lt;ref name="gr"/&gt; [[Kotaku]]'s Michael McWhertor recommended it for fans of the series.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/#!5638117/left-4-deads-the-sacrifice-goes-live&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'s Gus Mastrapa praised the beginning of the comic for "capturing the frenetic action of the first-person shooter". He adds that while he prefers that the video games do not go too much into the story, stating that the "mystery makes the action feel that much more visceral", he praised the execution for expanding the narrative in an outside medium without ruining the mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/09/left-4-dead-the-sacrifice-2/ |title=Left 4 Dead Comic Tells Story Between Missions &amp;#124; GameLife |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2010-09-15|accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Nick Chester called it "decent hype" for the upcoming ''Left 4 Dead'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/left-4-dead-the-sacrifice-comic-hits-tomorrow-183793.phtml |title=Left 4 Dead 'The Sacrifice' comic hits tomorrow |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Gamer]] described them as "thrilling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/10/06/the-sacrifice-comic-concludes-dlc-out/ |title=The Sacrifice comic concludes, DLC out |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the comics' releases, [[Rock Paper Shotgun]]'s Kieron Gillen expressed interest, citing illustrator Michael Avon Oeming's "fantastic" visual storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/15/sequential-first-part-the-sacrifice-comic/ |title=Sequential First Part: The Sacrifice Comic |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of the second comic, fellow Rock Paper Shotgun editor Alec Meer emphatically recommended that readers read it, expressing "mild frustration" with the wait for the next comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/22/left-4-dead-not-2-part-2/ |title=Left 4 Dead Not 2, Part 2 |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll of what readers of the comic would like to see ''The Sacrifice'' released in, the choices were, in order of popularity: TV, computer, mobile device, and print.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The supporting characters introduced in the comic have received some positive reception, with Valve citing an email they received asking if Annie, one of the soldiers accompanying the survivors, survived the zombie horde.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">'''Theft from libraries''' is the crime of [[Theft|stealing]] [[book]]s, [[DVD]]s or other media from [[libraries]]. It is typically prevented by installing [[electronic article surveillance]] alarms at the doors. Library materials are tagged and if the tag is not deactivated it sounds an alarm.  In some libraries with older or rare materials, readers are not allowed to take coats or bags into the reading area except for a few items in a clear plastic bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/locker/cloakroom.html|title=Help for Researchers: Cloakroom and Lockers|publisher=British Library|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Security camera]]s are not commonly used in libraries for privacy reasons.

One study commissioned in the UK estimated the average loss rate of libraries to theft at 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sARvKM5rynkC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=library+theft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=06NcUb_4Kubq0AHCtIDgBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Planning Public Library Buildings: Concepts and Issues for the Librarian - Michael Dewe - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]], the third conviction for library theft is a [[felony]], regardless of the value of material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegielibrary.org/usingthelibrary/policies/librarytheft.html Pennsylvania Library Theft Act, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101070711/http://www.carnegielibrary.org/usingthelibrary/policies/librarytheft.html |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Library thieves, who may be staff or regular visitors of the library, risk being discovered if a book is found in the [[library catalog]] but missing from the shelves. To avoid this, some library thieves have been careful to also steal the catalog card describing the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22249700 The curious tale of the stolen books], by Martin Vennard for BBC News Magazine, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
In public libraries, librarians have noticed common themes in what subjects are most frequently stolen. Books with topics like sex and [[witchcraft]] are popular with thieves, as are guides for [[General Educational Development]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Edward|title=U.S. libraries checking out book theft / 'Most-stolen' list will help curb crime|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/U-S-libraries-checking-out-book-theft-2921164.php|publisher=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll taken in 1996, the top three books that went missing were: ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'', GED Examination Books, and the ''Prophecies'' of [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosley|first1=Shelley|last2=Caggiano|first2=Anna|last3=Charles|first3=John|title=The "Self-Weeding" Collection: The Ongoing Problem of Library Theft, and How To Fight Back.|journal=Library Journal|date=October 15, 1996|volume=121|issue=171|pages=38-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft incidents==
[[Rare books]] departments of libraries especially fall target to professional thieves. In 1996, two rare early Mormon manuscripts were stolen from the [[Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County]], when the thief requested the manuscript and replaced it with a facsimile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rbms.info/theft-reports/1996/09/26/two-mormon-publications-stolen/ | title=Two Mormon Publications Stolen | publisher=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries | date=September 26, 1996 | accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Document theft''' is the crime of stealing documents of historical, literary, or cultural interest from public or private archives, often for the purpose of sale to private collectors.  In many cases, document thieves occupy positions of trust, or have established records of legitimate accomplishment, prior to their crimes. Examples of notable convicted document thieves include former [[New York State Archives|New York State]] archivist [[Daniel D. Lorello]],&lt;ref&gt;''Albany Times Union'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frede Møller-Kristensen]], who between 1968 and 1978 stole some 1,600 historical books worth more than $50 million from the [[The Royal Library, Denmark|Danish National Library]], and antiquities dealer [[Forbes Smiley|E. Forbes Smiley III]], who stole nearly 100 maps from libraries in the United States and Great Britain over the course of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to letters, maps, and other manuscript material, rare books also attract the attention of document thieves. [[John Charles Gilkey]], for instance, stole hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books over the course of many years. These crimes were largely the product of a personal obsession, illustrating the range of motives in document thefts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Allison Hoover (2009).

==History==
LinguaSys was co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Brian Garr in Boca Raton, Florida, USA;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-08-27/business/fl-worker-turned-entrepreneur-20120826_1_google-s-motorola-mobility-ibm-speech-recognition-technology South Florida workers-turned-entrepreneurs are creating jobs - Sun Sentinel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20130506/COLUMNIST/130509824/-1/news?Title=Angel-investors-ar-eout-there-you-just-need-to-know-where-to-look Angel investors are out there; you just need to know where to look | HeraldTribune.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Technology Officer Vadim Berman in Melbourne, Australia; and Vice President of Development and Architecture Can Unal in Darmstadt, Germany in 2010.

CEO Brian Garr was formerly CTO of Globalink from 1995–1998 and is a recipient of the Smithsonian Institute's "Heroes in Technology" award for his work in Machine Translation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">In lunar photography, the '''Looney 11 rule''' (also known as the '''Looney f/11 rule''') is a method of estimating correct [[exposure (photography)|exposures]] without a [[light meter]].  For daylight photography, there is a similar rule called the [[Sunny 16 rule]].

The basic rule is, ''"For astronomical photos of the Moon's surface, set [[aperture]] to {{f/|11|link=yes}} and [[shutter speed]] to the [reciprocal of the] ISO [[film speed]] [or ISO setting]."'' 
* With ISO 100 film / setting in the camera, one sets the aperture to f/11 and the shutter speed to 1/100 or 1/125 second (on some cameras 1/125 second is the available setting nearest to 1/100 second).
* With ISO 200 film / setting and aperture at f/11, set shutter speed to 1/200 or 1/250.
* With ISO 400 film / setting and aperture at f/11, set shutter speed to 1/400 or 1/500.

As with other light readings, shutter speed can be changed as long as the f-number is altered to compensate, e.g. 1/250 second at f/8 gives equivalent exposure to 1/125 second at f/11. Generally, the adjustment is done such that for each step in aperture increase (i.e., decreasing the f-number), the exposure time has to be halved (or equivalently, the shutter speed doubled), and vice versa. This follows the more general rule derived from the mathematical relationship between aperture and exposure time—within reasonable ranges, exposure is proportional to the square of the aperture ratio and proportional to exposure time; thus, to maintain a constant level of exposure, a change in aperture by a factor ''c'' requires a change in exposure time by a factor 1/''c''² and vice versa. Steps in aperture correspond to a factor close to the square root of two, thus the above rule.

The intensity of visible sunlight striking the surface of the Moon is essentially the same as at the surface of the Earth. The [[albedo]] of the Moon's surface material is lower (darker) than that of the earth's surface, and the Looney 11 rule increases exposure by one stop versus the Sunny 16 rule.  Many photographers simply use the f/16-based [[Sunny 16 rule]], unmodified, for lunar photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Market Gate of Miletus''' ({{lang-de|das Markttor von Milet}}) is a large [[marble]] monument in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, Germany. It was built in [[Miletus]] in the 2nd century AD and destroyed in an earthquake in the 10th or 11th century. In the early 1900s, it was excavated by a German archeological team, rebuilt, and placed on display in the museum in Berlin. Only fragments had survived and reconstruction involved significant new material, a practice which generated criticism of the museum. The gate was damaged in [[World War II]] and underwent restoration in the 1950s. Further restoration work took place in the first decade of the 21st century.

==Description==
[[File:Market Gate of Miletus hall.jpg|thumb|The room which houses the gate, which is on the left]]
The gate is a large marble monument,{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=753}} about 30&amp;nbsp;meters wide, 16&amp;nbsp;meters tall, and 5&amp;nbsp;meters deep.{{sfn|Ringle|Nutto|Voegtle|Pfanner|2004|p=1}} The two-story structure has three doorways{{sfn|Vögtle|Ringle|Nutto|Bähr|2003|p=350}} and a number of projections and niches.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=204}} At roof level and in between the floors are ornate [[frieze]]s with bull and flower reliefs. The structure's protruding [[pediment]]s are supported by [[Corinthian column|Corinthian]] and [[composite column]]s. The gate is not entirely original, as little of the base and lower floor survived the centuries;{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=204}} additional material includes brick, cement, and steel.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=205}} The gate is affixed by iron girders to the wall behind it.{{sfn|Ringle|Nutto|Voegtle|Pfanner|2004|p=1}}

While in Miletus, niches on the second story featured statues of emperors, some fighting against barbarians.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; 

==History==
===Miletus===
The gate was built in the 2nd century AD, most likely during the reign of [[Emperor Hadrian]] about 120 to 130&amp;nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=753}}{{sfn|Ringle|Nutto|Voegtle|Pfanner|2004|p=1}} It replaced an existing Doric [[propylon]] and served as the northern entrance to the southern market, or [[agora]], in [[Miletus]], an ancient city in what is now Turkey.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|pp=753–754}}&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|title=The North Gate of the South Agora|url=http://www.fhw.gr/choros/miletus/en/pili_notias_agoras.php?mp=map4|publisher=Foundation of the Hellenic World|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gate underwent restoration in the 3rd century following damage from an earthquake.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; When [[Justinian]] strengthened the defenses of Miletus in 538, the gate was incorporated into the city walls.{{sfn|Fodor's|2009|p=93}} In the 10th or 11th century, an earthquake caused the gate to collapse. Fragments of the structure were scavenged and used in surrounding buildings, but the majority subsided into the ground.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}}

===Excavation and reconstruction===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00983, Berlin, Pergamon Museum.jpg|thumb|The gate shortly after reassembly; the differently colored sections show the incompleteness of the original]]
German archaeologist [[Theodor Wiegand]] conducted a series of excavations in Miletus from 1899 through 1911.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=199}} In 1903, the Market Gate of Miletus was excavated and from 1907 to 1908, fragments of the gate were transported to Berlin.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}} Wiegand wrote in his diaries that he gave a presentation using models to Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], who was so impressed that he ordered the gate's reconstruction at full scale "like a theater backdrop" in the Pergamon Museum.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=200}}

From 1925 to 1929, the gate was reassembled in the recently expanded museum from over 750 tons of fragments.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}} However, the fragments did not constitute the entirety of the gate, and fill material had to be used in the reconstruction.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=201}} Reconstruction began by assembling the middle-floor [[entablature]] and placing the second story columns on top, followed by reconstructing the pediments.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|pp=204–205}} A base and ground floor were then inserted below. Brick and cement reinforced with steel supplemented the few remains of the lower structure.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=205}} Original column fragments were bored out, leaving a thickness of {{convert|3|to|4|cm|in}}, and filled with steel and mortar.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=753}} In the 1920s and 1930s, the museum was criticized for portraying its monuments as originals when they consisted significantly of non-original material.{{sfn|Bilsel|2012|p=206}}

===World War II to present===
The gate suffered significant damage from aerial bombardment in World War II.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}} The roof and skylight above the gate were destroyed along with a protective brick wall.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|pp=753–754}} The right wing collapsed and the structure was damaged by fire and shrapnel;{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}} the loss of the brick wall also exposed the gate to weathering for two years.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=753}} After winter passed, a temporary roof was constructed to protect the gate from the elements. From 1952 to 1954, the structure was extensively restored under the supervision of archaeologist H. H. Völker. However, little documentation exists detailing what specific work took place.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}}

[[File:Pergamonmuseum - Antikensammlung - Architektur 12.JPG|thumb|Scaffolding and protective cover in front of the gate]]
The next major restoration work took place in the decade of the 2000s.{{sfn|SMB|2008}} The gate had deteriorated from a combination of indoor atmospheric effects and incompatible building materials.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=753}} Fragments of the gate have spontaneously loosened and fallen, necessitating the addition of a fence in front of the structure to protect visitors.{{sfn|Siegesmund|Middendorf|2008|p=754}} The state of the structure was documented prior to restoration, from about 2003 through 2004, including the production of three-dimensional [[photogrammetric]] models due to the gate's architectural complexity.{{sfn|Ringle|Nutto|Voegtle|Pfanner|2004|p=1}}{{sfn|Vögtle|Ringle|Nutto|Bähr|2003|p=350}} In December 2005, scaffolding was erected around the structure with a transparent protective cover on the outside and within the entrance tunnel. The scaffolding and cover were removed in late 2008 following the initial restoration phase.{{sfn|SMB|2008}}

{{National Literary "Matters"}}
According to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[poetry|poet]] [[Jean Bodel]], the '''Matter of Rome''' was the [[literature cycle|literary cycle]] made up of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], together with episodes from the history of [[classical antiquity]], focusing on military heroes like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]].  Bodel divided all the literary cycles he knew best into the [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Matter of France]] and the Matter of Rome (although "non-cyclical" [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] also existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Laura A | last = Hibbard | title = Medieval Romance in England | place = New York | publisher = Burt Franklin | year = 1963 | page = iii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Matter of Rome also included what is referred to as the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the [[Trojan War]] and its after-effects, including the adventures of [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion To Homer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5WQRBvMp18C&amp;pg=PA364|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=9780521012461|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
Classical topics were the subjects of a good deal of [[Old French]] literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from [[Homer]] was built on scant sources; since the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]]. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] from writing a lengthy adaptation, ''Le Roman de Troie'', running 40,000 lines.&lt;ref name=Fowler/&gt; The poems that were written on these topics were called the ''romans d'antiquité'', the "romances of antiquity."  This name presages the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects.  For example, in the [[Epic poetry| epic]] poems ''[[Roman d'Alixandre]]'' and the ''[[Roman de Troie]]'', Alexander the Great, and [[Achilles]] and his fellow heroes of the [[Trojan War]] were treated as knights of [[chivalry]], not much different from the heroes of the ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Ker, ''Epic And Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature'' p 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of [[courtly love]] were introduced into the poems; in the ''[[Roman de Thèbes]]'', a romantic relationship absent from the [[Greek language|Greek]] sources is introduced into the tale of [[Parthenopeus| Parthenopæus]] and [[Antigone]].  Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of [[knight-errant]]ry and [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].  

Another example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the [[Roman d'Enéas|''Eneas'']], a treatment of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of [[Virgil]]'s poem.  Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from [[Ovid]], the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the [[pastiche]].  The ''Philomela'' attributed to [[Chrétien de Troyes]], a retelling of the story of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]], also takes its source from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink = C. S. Lewis | first = Clive Staples | last = Lewis | title = Selected Literary Essays | publisher = University Press | place = Cambridge, ENG, UK | year = 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |30–1}}  He also brought the story into line with the precepts of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref name = "Lewis" /&gt;{{rp |35–6}}

This anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the [[Middle English]] [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] "[[Sir Orfeo]]", where the Greek [[Orpheus]] becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. [[Eurydice]]) from the [[fairy]] king.

'''Mujaddara''' ({{lang-ar|مجدرة}} ''mujadarah'', with alternative spellings in English '''majadra''', '''mejadra''', '''moujadara''', '''mudardara''', and '''megadarra''') consists of cooked [[lentil]]s together with [[groat (grain)|groats]], generally [[rice]], and garnished with sautéed [[onion]]s.

==Name and origin==
''Mujaddara'' is the Arabic word for "pockmarked"; the lentils among the rice resemble pockmarks.&lt;ref name=Basanp118&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-7wnpIi3VRwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=mujaddara&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bSyzS5-pFIOe_AaD79n8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mujaddara&amp;f=false Middle Eastern Kitchen], Ghillie Basan, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marksp412/&gt; The first recorded recipe for ''mujaddara'' appears in ''[[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|Kitab al-Tabikh]]'', a cookbook compiled in 1226 by [[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Marksp412&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ojc4Uker_V0C&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=lentil+rice+medieval+arab&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=au_TTrL7N8Ta8QPD8cH6Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lentil%20rice%20medieval%20arab&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Food''], Gil Marks, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Containing rice, lentils, and meat, it was served this way during celebrations.&lt;ref name=Marksp412/&gt; Without meat, it was a medieval [[Arab cuisine|Arab dish]] commonly consumed by the poor, reputed to be a derivative of the "[[mess of pottage]]" [[Jacob]] used to buy [[Esau]]'s birthright.&lt;ref name=Basanp118/&gt; Because of its importance in the diet, a saying in the Eastern Arab world is, "A hungry man would be willing to sell his soul for a dish of mujaddara."&lt;ref name=Salloump199&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pkmdosckh7MC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=mujaddara&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b-zTTt-dOIji8QOYlLXUDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mujaddara&amp;f=false ''From the lands of figs and olives: over 300 delicious and unusual recipes from the Middle East and North Africa''], Habeeb Salloum and Jim Peters, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Cooked lentils are popular all over the [[Middle East]] and form the basis of many dishes. ''Mujaddara'' is a popular dish throughout the [[Arab world]], and is generally made using brown or green lentils and rice, that can be seasoned with [[cumin]], [[coriander]], or [[Mentha|mint]].&lt;ref name=Basanp118/&gt; It is topped with fried onions and is generally served with yogurt, among other vegetables and side dishes, either hot or cold.&lt;ref name=Basanp118/&gt;

The dish is made with brown lentils and rice. In Lebanon, the word ''mjaddara'' refers to the puréed version of the dish, rather than the version with whole grains and lentils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mjaddara or mdardara?|url=https://www.oroom.org/forum/threads/mjaddara-or-mdardara.44811/|website=The Orange Room|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mjaddara'' usually has the consistency of rice pudding whereas in the [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanese]] variant known as ''mudardara'', the rice and lentils remain relatively intact and distinct. Both ''mujaddara'' and ''mudardara'' are topped with caramelized onions and usually served with yogurt.

Particularly in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], rice is often replaced with bulgur; the dish is called M'jaddaret-Burghul to distinguish it from the M'jaddara which is served with rice. Pronounced as ''m'jaddara'', the dish is served multiple times a month for family, cooked with olive oil and onion strips, and served alongside local plain sheep's-milk yogurt (laban n'aj) made in Nablus, with green salad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hassoun|first1=Ghazi|title=Walking Out into the Sunshine: Recollections and Reflections: A Palestinian Personal Experience|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=XypgDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=BookBaby|language=en|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN World Food Programme|url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/familychef-samars-mujaddara|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=rice|first1=Mujaddara (Palestinian|last2=Says|first2=Lentil Dish /|title=Mujaddara palestinian rice &amp; lentil dish|url=http://happiness-is-homemade.com/2014/08/18/mujaddara-palestinian-rice-lentil-dish/|website=Happiness is homemade|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitchen of Palestine Bulgur with Lentils (Mjaddara)|url=http://www.kitchenofpalestine.com/mjaddara/|website=www.kitchenofpalestine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zaytoun|url=http://www.zaytoun.org/downloads/recipes/Maftoul%20oil%20UM%20HIKMAT.pdf.|website=www.zaytoun.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab Christians]] traditionally eat ''mujaddara'' during Lent.&lt;ref name=Basanp118/&gt; The dish is also popular among [[Mizrahim|Jewish communities of Middle Eastern origin]], in particular those of [[Syrian Jews|Syrian]] and [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian]] backgrounds; it is generally made with rice rather than wheat. It is sometimes nicknamed "Esau's favourite".&lt;ref&gt;Roden.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews traditionally ate it twice a week: hot on Thursday evening, and cold on [[Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, Poopa, ''Aromas of Aleppo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar dishes==
In [[Egyptian cuisine]], lentils, rice, [[macaroni]], and tomato sauce cooked together are known as [[kushari]]. In Indian cuisines, lentils cooked together with rice are known as [[khichdi]] (see also [[kedgeree]]). In [[Iranian cuisine]], a similar dish composed of rice and lentils is called Addas Polo.

In Cypriot cuisine, the dish called "fakes moutzentra"&lt;ref name=CFVM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yangou|first1=Varvara|title=Φακές μουτζιέντρα|url=http://foodmuseum.cs.ucy.ac.cy/web/guest/parsintages/civitem/2342#_bs_civitems_tabcyprus.rec.tab1|website=foodmuseum.cs.ucy.ac.cy|publisher=Cyprus Food Virtual Museum|accessdate=30 November 2015|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; is very similar to mujaddara, as it consists of lentils and rice. In Greek, "fakes" means lentils.

'''''Open Water 2: Adrift''''' (called '''''Adrift''''' in the UK, Australia, and various other countries, and called '''''Open Water 2''''' in Germany) is a 2006 [[psychological]] [[horror film|horror]] film filmed entirely in [[Malta]], starring [[Eric Dane]], [[Susan May Pratt]], [[Richard Speight, Jr.]], Niklaus Lange, [[Ali Hillis]], and [[Cameron Richardson]].  Promotional posters claim the film is based on actual events.

The script was written before ''[[Open Water (film)|Open Water]]'' (2003) was theatrically released. After ''Open Water'' became a success, ''Adrift'' was produced and the name was changed to ''Open Water 2: Adrift'' in some countries to capitalize on the success of the earlier film.

==Plot==
A group of friends, Amy ([[Susan May Pratt]]), James ([[Richard Speight, Jr.]]), Zach (Niklaus Lange), Lauren ([[Ali Hillis]]), Dan ([[Eric Dane]]), and Dan's new girlfriend Michelle ([[Cameron Richardson]]) go for a weekend cruise on Dan's new yacht. Amy and James also bring their infant daughter, Sarah.

Most of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim. Amy, who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident, refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her. However, nobody thought to lower the ladder to re-board the ship, and so everyone (except the baby) is trapped in the water with only two masks, a dive knife, and a toy dolphin float. Despite their efforts, the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach. They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them. The group try to grab their attention, but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them, and sail off. During the struggle, the group try using a phone to call for help, only to hear the voices of some well wishers, unable to get the caller's attention. The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water.

They are left to tread water disconsolately. The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope. After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing. Instead of having the lightest person climb up, Zach attempts to climb. He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the [[gunwale]] but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy. The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope.

Meanwhile, James goes underwater, and is fooling around with the prop, in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook, but he drops the knife. He swims down after it and manages to catch it, and desperately tries to swim for the surface. As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat, and is knocked unconscious. He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent [[skull fracture]]. Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up. Dan tries to stop Zach, but accidentally stabs him, causing Zach to drop the knife.

In a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood, Michelle begins to swim away, but sinks underwater. Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater. He dives after her, but he can't reach her, and her body disappears into the depths. After some time, Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren's arms. She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away, face down. After much waiting, Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help. Her fate after this is unknown.

Later that night, during a rainstorm, James dies from his head injury. Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife. He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] pops out. Remembering Zach's attempt with the knife, Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder, giving him a handhold. Amy climbs over his shoulders, finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens,causing him to yell as his hand bleeds more and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board. Once on board, she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby, Sarah. Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt. She jumps back in to save him, reminding her of when she attempted to save her father in the same manner, at a young age.

The next morning, a fishing boat approaches the yacht, and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water - no one had pulled them in. The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck.

The film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun, looking around appearing heartbroken. Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half, seemingly sleeping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">The '''philosophy of technology''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of [[technology]] and its social effects.

Philosophical discussion of questions relating to technology (or its Greek ancestor ''[[techne]]'') dates back to the very dawn of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Franssen et al." /&gt;  The phrase "philosophy of technology" was first used in the late 19th century by German-born philosopher and geographer [[Ernst Kapp]], who published a book titled "Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik".&lt;ref name="Marquit 1995"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marquit|first1=Erwin|title=Philosophy of Technology|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~marqu002/techphil.html|accessdate=25 September 2015|date=1995}} Section 2, paragraph 10.  Published in vol. 13 of the ''Encyclopedia of Applied Physics'' (entry “Technology, Philosophy of”), pp. 417–29. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapp 1877" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Greek philosophy ===
The western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term ''[[techne]]'' (τέχνη) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of [[Western philosophy]]. A common theme in the Greek view of ''techne'' is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders). Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]] endorsed this view.&lt;ref name="Franssen et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franssen |first1=Maarten |last2=Lokhorst |first2=Gert-Jan |last3=van de Poel |first3=Ibo |title=Philosophy of Technology |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Spring 2010 |first4=Edward N., Ed. |last4=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/technology/ |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], [[Aristotle]] agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that ''techne'' can go beyond nature and complete "what nature cannot bring to a finish."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II.8, 199a15&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also argued that nature (''physis'') and ''techne'' are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause. While ''techne'' is shaped by an outside cause and an outside ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (goal or end) which shapes it.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II&lt;/ref&gt; Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while ''techne'' does not. In [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman ([[Demiurge]]) who created the world in accordance with [[platonic forms|eternal forms]] as an artisan makes things using blueprints. Moreover, Plato argues in the [[Laws]], that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.

=== Middle ages to 19th century ===
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Francis Bacon]]
During the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De Architectura]]'' (1st century BC) and [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]]'s ''[[De re metallica|De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). Medieval [[Scholastic philosophy]] generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature. During the Renaissance, [[Francis Bacon]] became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society. In his utopian work ''[[New Atlantis]]'' (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution ([[Salomon's House]]) uses [[natural philosophy]] and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions. The goal of this fictional foundation is "...the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== 19th century ===

The native German philosopher and geographer [[Ernst Kapp]], who was based in [[Texas]], published the fundamental book "Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik" in 1877.&lt;ref name="Kapp 1877"&gt;* [[Ernst Kapp]]: ''Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik. Zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Cultur aus neuen Gesichtspunkten'' (Braunschweig/Brunswick 1877, Reprint Düsseldorf 1978, Engl. Translation Chicago 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Kapp was deeply inspired by the philosophy of [[Hegel]] and regarded technique as a projection of human organs. In the European context, Kapp is referred to as the founder of the philosophy of technology.

Another, more materialistic position on technology which became very influential in the 20th-century philosophy of technology was centered on the ideas of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== 20th century to present ===

Five early prominent 20th-century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were [[John Dewey]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Günther Anders]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders,&lt;ref&gt;# The Outdatedness of Human Beings 1. On the Soul in the Era of the Second Industrial Revolution. 1956 # The Outdatedness of Human Beings 2. On the Destruction of Life in the Era of the Third Industrial Revolution.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Human Condition'', 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, ''[[Gestell]]'' or ''Enframing'' which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility. Heidegger's major work on technology is found in ''[[The Question Concerning Technology]]''.

Contemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Brian Holmes]],  [[Don Ihde]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla]], [[Carl Mitcham]], [[Leo Marx]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Paul Virilio]], [[Günter Ropohl]], [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[:pt:Álvaro Vieira Pinto|Álvaro Vieira Pinto]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

While a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, [[Paul Durbin]] has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v7n1/intro.html Techné Vol 7 No 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Those were ''Technology and the Good Life'' (2000), edited by [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], Andrew Light, and [[David Strong]] and ''American Philosophy of Technology'' (2001) by [[Hans Achterhuis]]. Several collected volumes with topics in philosophy of technology have come out over the past decade and the journals ''[[Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology|Techne: Research in Philosophy and Technology]]'' (the journal of the [[Society for Philosophy and Technology]], published by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]]) and ''Philosophy &amp; Technology'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]) publish exclusively works in philosophy of technology. Philosophers of technology reflect broadly and work in the area and include interest on diverse topics of geoengineering, internet data and privacy, our understandings of internet cats, technological function and epistemology of technology, computer ethics, biotechnology and its implications, transcendence in space, and technological ethics more broadly.

=== Technology and neutrality ===

[[Technological determinism]] is the idea that "features of technology [determines] its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from] technological change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the "development and deployment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of technologies. [[Lelia Green]] used recent gun massacres such as the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur Massacre]] and the [[Dunblane Massacre]] to selectively show technological determinism and [[social determinism]]. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed. It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.

"Poseur" or "poseuse" is also used to mean a person who poses for an artist—a [[Model (art)|painter's model]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller, Susan.

==Examples==
[[File:Homosexualitywilde.jpg|thumb|Oscar Wilde (right) and Lord Alfred Douglas]]
The playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] has been described as a "poseur".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Havelock, Mrs. "A Note on Oscar Wilde". ''The Lotus Magazine''. Vol. 9, No. 4 (Jan., 1918), pp. 191-194. "When people say that Wilde was only a poser what do they mean?  They forget that his 'poses' were his reality."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hardy]] said of him, "His early reputation as a poseur and [[fop]] – so necessary to his notoriety – recoiled upon the scholar and gentleman (as Wilde always innately was), and even upon the artist".&lt;ref name="Hardy, Thomas 2016. page 256"/&gt;

[[Lord Alfred Douglas]] said of Wilde, "That he had what passed for genius nobody will, I think, nowadays dispute, though it used to be the fashion to [[pooh-pooh]] him for a mere poseur and decadent."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/oscarwildemyself00dougrich/oscarwildemyself00dougrich_djvu.txt Douglas, Lord Alfred.  ''Oscar Wilde and Myself.''] Duffield &amp; Company. New York. (1914) Introduction. page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James A. Whistler]] has been sometimes described as a "poseur" for his manner and personal style.&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, Marion Harry. editor. "James A. McNeil Whistler, 1834—1903; Personal Recollections" ''The Magazine of Art'', Volume 1. Cassell, Petter &amp; Gallpin, 1903. page 578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pX4OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=poseur%2B%22whistler%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SquI8fMsTj&amp;sig=u1X8VMX7ZRaUX6HgM5UY_iGXdvU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu5Lys8rnQAhXGJCYKHd6pCY4Q6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alec-Tweedie, Mrs. Alec (Ethel). ''Thirteen Years of a Busy Woman's Life''.] Chapter XV. Publisher: John Lane (1912). page 168 - 175.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Whistler's genius lay partly in his ability to cultivate the role of the poseur, to "act as if he were always on stage", in order to stir interest, and cause people to wonder how such a poseur could create work that was so serious and authentic. His fame as an artist seemed to require that he present himself as a poseur.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Sarah. ''Inventing the Modern Artist: Art and Culture in Gilded Age America''. Yale University Press (1996) {{ISBN|9780300078596}}. p 236&lt;/ref&gt;

The playwright and critic, [[George Bernard Shaw]], has been described as a poseur; in that context Shaw is quoted as saying, "I have never pretended that G.B.S. was real ... The whole point of the creature is that he is unique, fantastic, unrepresentative, inimitable, impossible, undesirable on any large scale, utterly unlike anybody that ever existed before, hopelessly unnatural, and void of real passion."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Archibald. ''George Bernard Shaw His Life and Works''. Stewardt &amp; Kidd Co. (1911). p 498&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greek comedy, ''[[The Clouds]]'', the playwright [[Aristophanes]] portrays [[Socrates]] as a "poseur".&lt;ref&gt;Silk, M.S. ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy.'' Oxford University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780199253821}}. p 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English term '''poseur''' is a loanword from French. The word in English use dates back to the mid 19th Century. It is from the French word ''poseur'', and from the Old French word ''poser'', meaning "to put, place, or set". The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', suggests that "poseur" is in fact the English word "poser" dressed "in French garb, and thus could itself be considered an affectation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=poseur&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010024654/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=poseur&amp;searchmode=none |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use within contemporary subcultures ==
"Poseur" is often a pejorative term, as used in the [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], and [[goth subculture|goth]] [[subculture]]s, or the [[skateboarding]], [[surfing]] and [[jazz]] communities, when it is used to refer to a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.
[[File:Castle Party p 114.jpg|thumb|right|Devotees of various music subcultures, like the [[goth subculture]], value authenticity highly]]

===Punk subculture===
David Marsh, in an article in ''Rock &amp; Rap'', speaking of "those first punk kids in London" says, "The terms in which they expressed their disdain for hangers-on and those whose post-hip credentials didn't quite make it came straight out of the authenticity movements: ''Poseurs'' was the favorite epithet.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |volume=124 |date=June 1995 |title=LIVE THROUGH THIS.... |first=Dave |last=Marsh |work=Rock &amp; Rap Archives |url=http://www.rockrap.com/archive/arch124b.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114211815/http://www.rockrap.com/archive/arch124b.html |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Buncle argues that eventually the Australian punk scene "opened the door to a host of poseurs, who were less interested in the music than in UK-punk fancy dress and being seen to be hip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perthpunk.com/orphans_story.htm |title=The Orphans Story |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002134806/http://www.perthpunk.com/orphans_story.htm |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing a rehearsal of The Orphans, he says there "were no punk-identikit poseurs" present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthpunk.com/the-orphans/|title=The Orphans - The Geeks &amp; Other Perth Punk Stories|author=|date=|website=perthpunk.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002072423/http://www.perthpunk.com/the-orphans/|archivedate=2 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 article about early punk subculture in ''[[The New Republic]]'' states that punk "...was as immersive as a motorcycle gang or membership in the Mafia; part-time participants were derided as “poseurs,” while any deviation from orthodoxy was a “sellout"...; this punk militancy created "... an economic and social ghetto which was nearly impenetrable to corporate infiltration and which only adventurous or deranged souls dared enter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/123187/how-npr-killed-college-rock |title=The Rise and Fall of College Rock: How yuppies and NPR gentrified punk |last=Svenonius |first=Ian |date=23 October 2015 |website=newrepublic.com |publisher= |access-date=7 June 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608034618/https://newrepublic.com/article/123187/how-npr-killed-college-rock |archivedate=8 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of [[The Clash]] film ''[[Rude Boy (film)|Rude Boy]]'', a critic argued that this "film was another sign of how The Clash had sold out – a messy, vain work of punk poseurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranger |first=Joshua |title=It Used to Be about the Music, Man: Rock ‘n’ Roll Fan Movies and the Post Facto Creation of the Nostalgia Market (archived MSWord document) |url=http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2007spring/s07_1806_ranger_a3.doc |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823233817/http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2007spring/s07_1806_ranger_a3.doc |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US music journalist [[Lester Bangs]] praised punk pioneer [[Richard Hell]] for writing the "strongest, truest rock &amp; roll I have heard in ages" without being an "arty poseur" of the "age of artifice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Hell Press Bio/Resumé|url=http://www.richardhell.com/pressbio.html|publisher=Richard Meyers &amp; Roy Suggs|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001121050000/http://www.richardhell.com/pressbio.html|archivedate=21 November 2000|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic argues that by the late 1970s, "punk rock had already, at this early date, shown signs of devolving into pure pose, black leather jacket and short hair required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/music/temp/genres.html |title=Genre Definitions |publisher=Starling.rinet.ru |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320010126/http://starling.rinet.ru/music/temp/genres.html |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Please Kill Me'' includes interviews with punks in New York and Detroit who "rip their English counterparts as a bunch of sissified poseurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer |first=Matthew |title=Books that rock |url=http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/?id=3433&amp;IssueNum=74 |publisher=Southland Publishing |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718185300/http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/?id=3433&amp;IssueNum=74 |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''poseur'' was used in several late-1970s punk songs, including the [[X-Ray Spex]] song "I Am a Poseur", which included the lyrics "I am a poseur and I don't care/I like to make people stare/Exhibition is the name."
Another song using the term was the [[Television Personalities]] song "Part-Time Punks". The Television Personalities' song "was a reaction to the macho posturing of the English punk scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leung |first=Godfre |title=Towards a Post-Gendered Pop Music: Television Personalities’ My Dark Places |url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |publisher=Independent Culture |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717220604/http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |archivedate=17 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics argue that, "while Television Personalities were not themselves punks in the orthodox sense, neither was anyone else". The song "declared that either everyone who wanted to be a punk was one or that everyone was a poseur (or both)", and it argues that "the concept of [...] punk rock authenticity, of [[Joe Strummer]], was a fiction".

An article in ''Drowned in Sound'' argues that 1980s-era "[[hardcore punk|hardcore]] is the true spirit of punk" because "[a]fter all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with [[New Romantic]] haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics". It argued that the hardcore scene consisted only of people "completely dedicated to the [[DIY]] ethics"; punk "[l]ifers without the ambition to one day settle into the study-work-family-house-retirement-death scenario".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Symonds |first=Rene |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/2307017 |title=Features – Soul Brothers: DiS meets Bad Brains |publisher=Drowned in Sound |date=16 August 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011095854/http://drownedinsound.com/articles/2307017 |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oi!|Oi]] band [[Combat 84]] has a song entitled "Poseur" which describes a person changing from a punk to a skinhead, and then into a Mod and a Ted. The lyrics include the lines "Poseur poseur standing there/You change your style every year."

====1990s–2000s====
[[Dave Rimmer]] writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, with [[grunge]] musicians like "[Kurt] [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]], and lots of kids like him, rock &amp; roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music [or else] live with being a poseur, a phony, a [[sellout]]?"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Refused]]'s [[Dennis Lyxzén]] and [[Bad Religion]]'s [[Brett Gurewitz]] used the term to refer to early 2000s-era [[pop punk]] fans as "kids – more specifically the new wave of punk poseurs who came to the music via bands like [[Good Charlotte]]". They argue that these young listeners want "not to have to think and [instead they] would rather use music as [[escapism]] [,] and too many bands seem willing to comply".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/coverstory.aspx?csid1=60|title=Exclaim!

One writer argued that the Los Angeles punk scene was changed by the invasion of "antagonistic suburban poseurs", which bred "rising violence [...] and led to a general breakdown of the hardcore scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=82 |title=Fantagraphics Books – Artist Bio – Los Bros.

Daniel S. Traber argues that attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult; as the punk scene changed and re-invented itself, "[e]veryone got called a poseur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=30–64 |doi=10.1353/cul.2001.0040 |title=L.A.'s 'White Minority': Punk and the Contradictions of Self-Marginalization |year=2001 |last1=Traber |first1=Daniel S. |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; One music writer argues that the punk scene produced "...true believers who spent long days fighting the man on streets of the big city [and living in squats who] always wanted to make punk rock less a cultural movement than some kind of meritocracy: "You have to prove you're good enough to listen to our music, man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RockNotes: Punks vs. Poseurs |work=Beachwood Reporter |first=Don |last=Jacobson |url=http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/music/rocknotes_punks_vs_poseurs.php |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419161339/http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/music/rocknotes_punks_vs_poseurs.php |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Keithley]], the singer for [[D.O.A.

The early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] band [[MDC (band)|MDC]] penned a song entitled "Poseur Punk", which excoriated pretenders who copied the punk look without adopting its values. The lyrics sheet packaged with [[Magnus Dominus Corpus]], the album on which "Poseur Punk" appears, contains a picture of the band [[Good Charlotte]] juxtaposed underneath the lyrics to "Poseur Punk". As part of MDC's 25th anniversary tour in the 2000s, frontman "Dictor's targets remain largely the same: warmongering politicians, money-grubbing punk poseurs (including [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], whose Tim Armstrong once worked as an M.D.C. roadie), and of course, cops".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seigel |first=Stephen |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=67460 |title=Soundbites &amp;#124; Soundbites |publisher=Tucson Weekly |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304031147/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=67460 |archivedate=4 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[NOFX]]'s album ''[[The War on Errorism]]'' includes the song "Decom-poseur", part of the album's overall "critique of punk rock's 21st century incarnation of itself".

===Heavy metal subculture===

[[Jeffrey Arnett]] argues that the heavy metal subculture classifies members into two categories: "acceptance as an authentic metalhead or rejection as a fake, a poseur".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. Metalheads: Heavy Metal Music and Adolescent Alienation (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 profile of heavy metal fans' "subculture of alienation", the author notes that the scene classified some members as poseurs, that is, heavy metal performers or fans who pretended to be part of the subculture but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=423–43 |doi=10.1007/BF00989973 |title=Three profiles of heavy metal fans: A taste for sensation and a subculture of alienation |year=1993 |last1=Arnett |first1=Jeffrey |journal=Qualitative Sociology |volume=16 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, ''SPIN'' magazine referred to "poseur metal".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gaines, Donna.

In 2014, Stewart Taylor wrote that in the Bay Area thrash metal scene in the 1980s, in venues where bands like [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] played, metal fans who liked "[[hair metal]]" bands such as "[[Ratt]], [[Motley Crue]] and [[Stryper]]" were considered to be poseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Stewart. ''Route A666 - A Heavy Metal Journey''. Lulu Press, Inc, 2014.

Pine Forge Press, 2008. p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;If a music fan came to an Exodus show at thrash clubs "...with a Motley Crue shirt or a Ratt shirt, [[Paul Baloff]] [of Exodus] would literally tear that shirt off the person's back," and then the band would "tear up the shirts and tie them around their wrists and wear them as trophies...[or]...badges of honor." &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/Bay-Area-Metal.html |title=Thrash Masters: A new book recalls the slam-dancing days in the mid-'80s when thrash metal bands stalked Bay Area stages at clubs like the Keystone Palo Alto and the New Varsity Theater |last=Singh |first=Gary |date=7 December 2011 |website=metroactive.com |publisher=Metroactive |access-date=7 June 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604182415/http://www.metroactive.com/features/Bay-Area-Metal.html |archivedate=4 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;As well, "...Baloff would often command the audience to 'sacrifice a poseur'", a ritual that involved the audience throwing the suspected hair metal fan onto the stage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The Swedish black metal band [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], which aimed to be the "...most brutal and blasphemous band ever", uses Nazi imagery, such as the Nazi Panzer tank, in their songs and album art (e.g., their 1999 album is titled ''Panzer Division Marduk''). &lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-list-december-10-16-2009/Content?oid=1250867 |title=The List: December 10-16, 2009 Critics' Choices and other notable concerts: the Flaming Lips, Pelican, Keri Hilson, Marduk, Unsilent Night, and more |last=Margasak |first=Peter |date=10 December 2009 |website=www.chicagoreader.com |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=10 June 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112133620/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-list-december-10-16-2009/Content?oid=1250867 |archivedate=12 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of Nazi imagery offended [[neo-Nazi black metal]] bands, who called Marduk poseurs. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; 

In the heavy metal subculture, some critics use the term to describe bands that are seen as excessively commercial, such as MTV-friendly [[glam metal]] groups in which hair, make-up, and fancy outfits are more important than the music.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} During the 1980s, [[thrash metal]] fans called [[pop metal]] bands "metal poseurs" or "false metal". &lt;ref&gt; Berger, Harris M. and Greene Paul D.

In the [[Alestorm]] song "Heavy Metal Pirates", the song makes numerous metaphors and allusions to pirates, including references to cutlasses, and it includes the line "[[No quarter]] for the poseurs, we'll bring 'em death and pain". The [[Manowar]] song "Metal Warriors" includes the lines "Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall" and "...all whimps and posers go on get out".

===Goth subculture===

Nancy Kilpatrick's ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined'' defines "poseur" for the goth scene as: "goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd...". Kilpatrick dismisses poseur goths as "Batbabies" whose clothing is bought at [mall store] [[Hot Topic]] with their parents' money.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Kilpatrick's ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined'' 2004. page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hip hop subculture===

[[File:Breakdance-oldschool.png|thumb|right|Authenticity or "street cred" is important in hip-hop culture]]
In the [[hip hop]] scene, authenticity or ''street cred'' is important. The word [[wigger]] is the specific used to refer to caucasian people mimicking black hip-hop culture. Larry Nager of ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' wrote that rapper [[50 Cent]] has "earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing, the guns, the drugs, the big cars and magnums of champagne. He's not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta; he's the real thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nager|first=Larry|title=50 Cent's performance won't propel rapper to next level|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:trRANTublH0J:enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/23/tem_50cent23.html|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''This Are Music'' review of white rapper [[Rob Aston]] criticizes his "fake-gangsta posturing", calling him "a poseur faux-thug cross-bred with a junk punk" who glorifies "guns, bling, cars, bitches, and heroin" to the point that he seems like a parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamonds and Lint, October 18th, 2007 |url=http://www.thisaremusic.com/reviews/diamonds-and-lint |publisher=This Are Music |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223061558/http://www.thisaremusic.com/reviews/diamonds-and-lint |archivedate=23 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 article on BlackAmericaWeb claims that Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as rapper [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], was not "a rough dude from the 'hood" as his official record company biographies claimed. After Jones' death from drugs, the rapper's father claimed that "his late son was a hip-hop poseur, contrary to what music trade magazines published in New York" wrote. Jones' father argued that the "story about him being raised in the Fort Greene [Brooklyn] projects on welfare until he was a child of 13 was a total lie"; instead, he said "their son grew up in a reasonably stable two-parent, two-income home in Brooklyn".

The article also refers to another "hip-hop poseur from a decade ago", [[Lichelle Laws|Lichelle "Boss" Laws]]. While her record company promoted her as "the most gangsta of girl gangstas", posing her "with automatic weapons" and publicizing claims about prison time and an upbringing on the "hard-knock streets of Detroit", Laws' parents claim that they put her "through private school and enrolled [her] in college in suburban Detroit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkins |first=Wayne |title=Commentary: Middle-class rappers who extol thug life insult parents |url=http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/sayitloud/odb1223 |publisher=BlackAmericaWeb.com, Inc |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428033613/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/sayitloud/odb1223 |archivedate=28 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As hip hop has gained a more mainstream popularity, it has spread to new audiences, including well-to-do "white hip-hop kids with gangsta aspirations—dubbed the 'Prep-School Gangsters'" by journalist [[Nancy Jo Sales]]. Sales claims that these hip hop fans "wore Polo and Hilfiger gear trendy among East Coast hip-hop acts" and rode downtown to black neighborhoods in chauffeured limos to experience the ghetto life. Then, "to guard against being labeled poseurs, the prep schoolers started to steal the gear that their parents could readily afford".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peddling the Street: Gangsta Wannabes, Allen Iverson, and Black Masculinity (Under the Boards: The Cultural Revolution in Basketball, University of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, May 2007) |url=http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110062908/http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html |archivedate=10 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was highlighted in [[The Offspring]] song "[[Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)]]".

A 2008,'' Utne Reader'' article describes the rise of "[[hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]] Rap", which "consists of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional [[keffiyeh]], and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle". The article says this "hipster rap" has been criticized by the hip hop website [[Unkut]] and rapper Mazzi, who call the mainstream rappers ''poseurs'' or "fags for copping the [[metrosexual]] appearances of hipster fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohan |first=Jake |title=Hipster Rap: The Latest Hater Battleground |url=http://www.utne.com/2008-06-13/Arts/Hipster-Rap-The-Latest-Hater-Battleground.aspx |publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc. |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161304/http://www.utne.com/2008-06-13/Arts/Hipster-Rap-The-Latest-Hater-Battleground.aspx |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prefix Mag'' writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there "have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap", which he says can be summed up as "white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop [...] without all the scary black people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanislawski|first=Ethan|title=The Chicago Reader has hip-hop hipster backlash against hip-hop hipster backlash|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/|publisher=Prefix Mag', 20 June 2008|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927025524/http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[skateboarding]] subculture attempts to differentiate between authentic skaters and pretenders. A ''New York Times'' article on the 2007 skateboarding scene notes that "some first-time skaters drawn into the sport by catchy choruses or candy-colored sneakers are dismissed as poseurs" who are "walking around with a skateboard as an accessory, holding it in a way we call 'the mall grab.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Detrick |first=Ben |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/fashion/11skaters.html?pagewanted=print |title=Skateboarding Rolls Out of the Suburbs – New York Times |location=Brooklyn (NYC) |work=The New York Times |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605044406/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/fashion/11skaters.html?pagewanted=print |archivedate=5 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1988 video game ''[[Skate or Die!]]'', "Poseur Pete" is the name of the challenger for beginner-level players.

An ''LA City Beat'' magazine writer argues that "[[dance music]] had its ''[[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]'' moment some time around the year 2000", arguing that "the prospect of fame, groupies, and easy money by playing other people's records on two turntables brought out the worst poseurs since [[glam metal|hair metal]] ruled the Sunset Strip.

In 1986, ''SPIN'' magazine referred to "poseur [[Motorcycle|biker]]s", individuals who ride motorcycles and wear biker clothing, yet who lack the missing teeth and scars of real bikers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; An obituary for Colorado motorcycle enthusiast Walt Hankinson stated that “[h]e was an old-time biker, not a poseur", because he "...wasn’t looking for the most stylish leather outfit and never had a fashion crisis about what to wear on the next ride,” instead just wearing a "flannel shirt, jeans and a cloth jacket" when he rode his motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2007/04/08/longtime-biker-reveled-in-the-ride-taught-others/ |title=Longtime biker reveled in the ride, taught others |last=Culver |first=Virginia |date=8 April 2007 |website=www.denverpost.com |publisher=Denver Post |access-date=10 June 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512200717/https://www.denverpost.com/2007/04/08/longtime-biker-reveled-in-the-ride-taught-others/ |archivedate=12 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, there are "alleged military posers", individuals who wear army uniforms and medals, who are not actually current or previous members of the armed forces. In November 2014, Ottawa police charged one of these alleged poseurs for impersonating a soldier, after he appeared in TV interviews during Remembrance Day ceremonies wearing a uniform and medals which he had no right to wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/11/16/ottawa-cops-praised-for-charging-alleged-fake-soldier|title=Ottawa cops praised for charging alleged ‘fake’ soldier|author=|date=17 November 2014|website=torontosun.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129012617/http://www.torontosun.com/2014/11/16/ottawa-cops-praised-for-charging-alleged-fake-soldier|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a "jazz poseur" dates back to the 1940s. Bob White from ''[[Downbeat (magazine)|Downbeat]]'' argued that some jazz critics knew nothing about new jazz ([[bebop]]) and nothing about chords, tone, or the technical aspects of jazz; instead, they would just learn the names of a few old masters and "...become a romantic, a charlatan, a poseur, a pseudo-intellectual, an aesthetic snob, ...well on the way to success" as a jazz critic.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of a Jazz Art World.'' Paul Douglas Lopes. Cambridge University Press, 30 May 2002 p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the CBC produced a radio show about how to spot "jazz poseurs" in a jazz scene. These were described as people who do not know much about the music, but they can "name-drop" the names of famous performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.music.cbc.ca/blogs/2014/2/How-to-spot-a-jazz-poseur|title=CBC Music|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225154/http://m.music.cbc.ca/blogs/2014/2/How-to-spot-a-jazz-poseur|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Salon'' writer Joan Walsh calls US politician [[Paul Ryan]] a Randian poseur.

{{Sex and the law}}
'''Public morality''' refers to [[morality|moral and ethical standards]] enforced in a society, by law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the content of the [[Mass media|media]], and to conduct in [[public place]]s.  A famous remark of [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], that she did not care what people did as long as they "didn't frighten the horses" shows that in some sense even high [[Toleration|tolerance]] expects a ''public'' limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite extreme a [[theocracy]] may equate public morality with religious instruction, and give both the equal force of law.

Public morality often means [[sex and the law|regulation of sexual matters]], including [[prostitution]] and [[homosexuality]], but also matters of dress and [[nudity]], [[pornography]], acceptability in social terms of [[cohabitation]] before [[marriage]], and the protection of children. It is a main justification for [[censorship]]; it can lead to campaigns against [[profanity]], and so be at odds with [[freedom of speech]]. [[Gambling]] is generally controlled: [[casino]]s have been considered much more of a threat than large-scale [[lotteries]] or [[football pools]]. [[Public drunkenness]] is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. [[Abortion]] is sometimes treated as an aspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. [[AIDS]] as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.

Views on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been proscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public.{{fact|date=December 2015}} These examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often move towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised by [[moral panic]]s, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after [[Shakespeare]]'s death by the English [[Puritan]]s.

It may also be applied to the ''morals of public life''. [[Political corruption]], or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is not a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the [[public interest]], while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

==Science in Brazil==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Nathan Sivin
|url=http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/new/sivin_new_sts.htm
|title=Think Ahead
|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

==Science in India==

{{Main|Science and technology in India}}

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Plot summary==
The "Long Earth" is a (possibly infinite) series of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth, which can be reached by using an inexpensive device called a "Stepper". The "close" worlds are almost identical to "our" Earth (referred to as "Datum Earth"), others differ in greater and greater details, but all share one similarity: on none are there, or have there ever been, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' – although the same cannot be said of earlier [[hominid]] species, especially ''[[Homo habilis]]''.

The book deals primarily with the journey of Joshua Valienté (a natural "Stepper") and Lobsang, who claims to be a [[Tibet]]an [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance|motorcycle repairman]] reincarnated as an [[artificial intelligence]]. The two chart a course to learn as much as possible about the parallel worlds, travelling millions of steps away from the original Earth. They encounter evidence of other humanoid species (referred to as trolls and elves); of human settlers who learned their gifts early – including Sally Linsay, daughter of the inventor of the stepper, who joins them on their expedition; and of an extinct race of bipedal dinosaur descendants. They also encounter warning signs of a great danger, millions of worlds away from "our" Earth, causing catastrophe as it moves. The book also deals with the effects of the explosion of available space on the people of Datum Earth and the new colonies and political movements that are spreading in the wake of Step Day.

A young girl, Helen Green, and her family (with the exception of her brother, Rod, who is unable to step) trek across the long earth to form a new community, Reboot, on Earth West 101,754.

After stepping across "The Gap" – a universe around two million steps from the Datum where the earth no longer exists – Joshua and Lobsang encounter the threat that has caused the slow migration of Trolls away from the gap. First Person Singular is a being that absorbs other sentient life forms, eventually taking over everything on earth before stepping to the next. It currently cannot pass The Gap. Lobsang elects to stay in First Person Singular's universe and commune with it, in the hopes of convincing it not to advance further, or at least to not absorb all other sentients.

Joshua and Sally return to Datum Earth back the way they came.  Upon reaching Earth West 101,754, they hear news that Datum [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] has been destroyed in a nuclear explosion, the result of a bomb planted by a terrorist group of humans incapable of stepping (called "phobics" in the book's terminology).  The book ends with the two of them briefly seeing the explosion site, before retreating to Earth West 1 Madison, where a backed-up instantiation of Lobsang contacts Joshua by phone.

==Characters==
*Joshua Valienté: an orphan, born on another world when his mother stepped during childbirth. A natural stepper.
*Lobsang: an [[artificial intelligence]] who claims to be a [[Tibet]]an [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance|motorcycle repairman]].
*Sally Linsay: daughter of the inventor of the "Stepper" box, a device that allows the majority of humans to step between parallel universes. A natural stepper and later romantic interest to Joshua Valienté.
*Monica Jansson: A Madison Police Office who helps the disappearing children on "Step Day" - the day when the Stepper Box is released on the internet.
*Helen Green: a young girl who sets off across the long earth with most of her family to start a new community. Keeps a diary of her travels.
*Rod Green: brother to Helen Green, a boy who cannot step and is left on Datum Earth by his family as they travel across the long earth. Later helps in the bombing of Madison where he is captured and imprisoned.
*Sister Agnes: a nun who looks after Joshua during his younger years at the orphanage.
*Douglas Black: founder of the Black Corporation, a high-profile research based weapons and technology company and manufacturer. Creator of Lobsang.
*First Person Singular: a being found on the far side of "The Gap", more than two million steps from earth, that absorbs all sentient life.
*''Mark Twain'': an [[airship]] with a certain level of artificial intelligence granted by the Black Corporation and Lobsang, allowing it, and those within it, to step. The ''Mark Twain'', named after the [[Mark Twain|author]] who penned the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, carries Joshua and Lobsang on their journey across the long earth.

==Reception==
Reviewing the book in'' [[The Guardian]]'', Adam Roberts found it to be "much more like a Baxter novel than a Pratchett one." It was also said to be "a charming, absorbing and somehow spacious piece of imagineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/20/long-earth-terry-pratchett-stephen-baxter-review|title=The Long Earth by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter – review|author=Adam Roberts|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book reached 13th on the ''[[New York Times]]'' hardback best-sellers list on 8 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-07-08/hardcover-fiction/list.html Best Sellers July 08, 2012], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel won the [[Goodreads]] Choice Awards 2012 for Science Fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2012|title=Best Books 2012 — Goodreads Choice Awards|work=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A timeline of notable events relating to [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and its predecessor [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]].

==Radio 5==
'''1990'''
*27 August – [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] launches at 9am on the old [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] mediumwave frequency. The station is on air from 6am until just after midnight but only broadcasts its own programmes at peak times and weeknight evenings. The rest of its airtime is taken up with programmes from the [[World Service]] and simulcasts of the BBC’s other national stations during off-peak hours.

'''1991'''
*17 January – 2 March – [[Radio 4 News FM]], the first rolling [[BBC radio]] [[news]] service is on air during the first [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/stunt_up/ |title=Dictionary definition of 'stunt up'| accessdate = 2009-12-30}} refers Sheena McDonald, "Scud-FM goes critical—BBC gears up for round-the-clock news service", page 25, [[The Guardian]] 17 August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Bob| last = Franklin| title      = Key Concepts in Journalism Studies| date = 31 March 2005| publisher  = Sage| isbn = 0-7619-4482-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is deemed to be so successful that bosses began looking at ways to launch a full-time news radio station.
*2 September – Radio 5 launches a weekday lunchtime programme in conjunction with forces station [[BFBS]]. Called ''BFBS Worldwide'', the programme continues to be broadcast until the demise of Radio 5 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/radio5/1991-09-02 BBC Genome Project Radio 5 listings 2 September 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;
*5 October – Football phone-in ''[[6-0-6]]'' is broadcast for the first time. [[Danny Baker]] is the programme’s host. The launch of this programme is part of an expansion of Radio 5's programming. Consequently, the station no longer simulcasts the BBC's other radio stations although programming from the World Service continues to be broadcast, albeit less than before.

'''1992'''
*10–26 June – For the first time, the BBC provides full radio coverage of an international football tournament when it broadcasts live commentary of every game of [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]].
*25 July – 9 August – Radio 5 provides full live coverage of the [[1992 Summer Olympic Games]]. Programmes run all day, from 6.30am until 10pm. This is the first time that [[BBC Radio]] has provided full coverage of the Games.

'''1993'''
*May – The broadcasting arrangements for ''[[Test Match Special]]'' for the 1993 cricket season see the morning play moving from [[BBC Radio 3]] to Radio 5 – the afternoon session remained on Radio 3 although Radio 5 does provide commentary during weekday editions of ''[[5 Live Sport|Sport on 5]]''.

'''1994'''

*22 March – 5 Live's late night news bulletin ''News Extra'' and phone-in/talk show ''After Hours'' are broadcast for the final time. The next day a new three hour late show called ''Late Night Live'' launches and ''[[Up All Night (radio show)|Up All Night]]'' is extended to become a four-hour show.
*28 March – [[Edwina Currie]] joins to present the weekend late evening show, called ''Late Night Currie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwina.currie.co.uk/html/broadcasting_right.htm Broadcasting career], Edwina Currie's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Treehouse of Horror XXVIII'''" is the fourth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|twenty-ninth season]] of the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 622nd episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on October 22, 2017.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence: The Sweets Hereafter===
The Simpson family is on a plate, as part of candies distributed on Halloween at a house. [[Bart Simpson|Bart as a Butterfinger bar]] is afraid of being taken, [[Marge Simpson|Marge as a Mars bar]] comforts him saying he's always the last taken, and [[Homer Simpson|Homer, an Oh Henry! bar]] saying even a box of stale [[raisin]]s gets taken before him. [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson as a Crunch bar]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kirk van Houten|Kirk as a Turkish Taffy bar]] get taken, and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa as an apple]] complains about no one ever wanting the apples, as people are afraid of [[razor]] [[blade]]s being inside her. Marge comforts her saying they take them only when [[caramel apple|dipped in caramel]], to the apple's disgust. Shauna takes [[Grandpa Simpson|the Junior Mints]], after Homer moved aside, and eats its contents.

The next day, the family are the only ones left, and they get placed on a [[Shelf (storage)|shelf]] when the family remove the [[Halloween]] decorations, where they find a [[chocolate]] [[Easter bunny]], that tells them they'll be left there forgotten. Seeing his discomfort as no one ever takes him, Homer starts eating him. Marge tries to stop him, but he tells her chocolate doesn't feel anything, and resumes eating it, with the rest of the family joining in when he eats the bunny's mouth to shut it up. The camera pans to the wall, where The Simpsons Easter Special is written, but the chocolate from the bunny splatters all over it, covering the words, and dark chocolate resembling blood spells out "Treehouse of Horror XXVIII".

===The Exor-Sis===
On a pre-Christian temple site in northern [[Iraq]] (a parody of the opening scene of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''), a [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]] statue is dug up and sent through [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] to the Simpsons home due to Homer accidentally ordering it, thinking it said "pizza". After Homer sings a very disturbing lullaby with glowing red eyes, the statue is left on Maggie's bed as the demon within it [[demonic possession|possesses]] Maggie, with the possessed infant making her presence known during the [[cocktail party]] that Homer and Marge are hosting downstairs. The demon kills a complaining [[Helen Lovejoy]] before locking everyone in and then killing [[Dr. Hibbert]] while revealing that he is cheating on his wife. [[Ned Flanders]] tells the Simpsons that Maggie needs an [[exorcism]] before being killed himself from being beaten up and choking on a toy car. An Irish [[priest]] arrives soon after, and performs the exorcism that purges the demon from Maggie, but the demon ends up possessing Bart, which he fearfully regrets, declaring that Bart has the evilest soul he's ever seen and is "worse than [[David Schwimmer]]".

===Coralisa===
In a parody of ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', Maggie is still recovering from Pazuzu while starting to violently vomit all over the dinner table, eventually flooding the kitchen with puke. In Lisa's room, [[Snowball (The Simpsons)|Snowball]] V (Neil Gaiman) takes her through a secret tunnel that brings her to another version of the family, with pink buttons instead of eyes on their faces. While the alternate family are like a dream, Lisa runs back to her world in terror when she learns they want to sew buttons on her eyes so she can remain with them forever. Lisa reconsiders the alternate family's offer after Homer had killed a snake with Lisa's saxophone.

A few days later, the family finally realizes Lisa is missing with Homer accepting it and saying Maggie gets Lisa's room and clothes, while Bart gets her homework. Upon hearing this, Bart escapes through the door and is accepted in the alternate reality. After Marge follows after her children, Homer follows suit and a meeting with the alternate family results with him killing the alternate Bart while alternate Homer injures himself on a pair of scissors trying to avenge him. This infuriates alternate Marge as she transforms into an eight-legged spider-like creature to attack Homer, who decides to take advantage of the situation to benefit himself: bringing the surviving members of the alternate family home with his alternate counterpart attending parent-teacher meetings while alternate Marge does the chores and guards the house. Lisa accepts this outcome, claiming that it could have been much worse.

===MMM… Homer===
An opening scene features Lisa warning viewers about the following segment’s disgusting content, proclaiming, "What you're about to see is so disgusting, you'll watch [[Game of Thrones]] to calm down!" The episode then begins when a Homer remains home while the rest of the family go on vacation with [[Patty and Selma]]. Homer gets comfy, but ends up eating his food supplies, ending up with only vegetables before finding a frozen hot dog. Losing the hot dog to [[Santa's Little Helper]], Homer accidentally cuts his finger off while grilling. He cooks the finger and eats it. He discovers how tasty it is, losing interest in other food when invited by Ned for lunch, and starts cooking parts of his body before his family come back. They become suspicious with Homer constantly wearing oven mitts to hide his severed fingers, being 20 pounds thinner, and walking with a limp. When Marge discovered Homer's self-cannibalism one night while he was frying his own severed leg, she takes him to an addiction counselor for help, but [[Mario Batali]], in search for new ingredients, convinces a despondent (and now missing the entire lower half of his body) Homer to cook his remaining body parts as ingredients sold at Chez Homer and several other restaurants across Springfield. Carl mentions that they are also eating Barney Gumble, Comic Book Guy, and horse meat. In [[Heaven]], Homer comments to [[Jesus]] how he now shares people [[eucharist|eating his body with him]], as the Springfield residents have turned into cannibals.

==Reception==
This episode received mostly positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B- stating, "The 28th ‘Treehouse Of Horror’ carries on the venerable Simpsons institution by, as ever, tossing a whole lot of stuff at the screen and seeing what sticks. To that end, this year’s outing gives us: An 'Exorcist' parody, a 'Coraline’  parody, Homer eating human flesh (just his own, but still), stop-motion segments, horror and fantasy-specific guest stars, a little light Fox standards-pushing (Homer does, as stated, eat human flesh), and the usual string of hit-or-miss gags. That last part isn’t really a criticism in itself. Freed up from the need to calibrate the heart-yucks equation, a ‘Treehouse Of Horror’ rises or falls on the strength of its jokes, although the annual Halloween anthology provides its own unique degree of difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dennis Perkins |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-simpsons-walks-us-through-a-visually-ambitious-but-1819753498 |title=The Simpsons walks us through a visually ambitious but forgettable Treehouse Of Horror |publisher=Avclub.com |date=2017-10-22 |accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10 stating, "The ‘Treehouse of Horror’ specials are rarely among the more memorable episodes in any given season of The Simpsons. However, Season 29 is likely to be a major exception. All three segments in this year's special were strong. The series finally plugged two major holes in its huge collection of horror movie parodies while also reminding us that it can offend and disturb with the best of them. Perhaps there's still more mileage to be found in this long-running Simpsons trope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/23/the-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-xxviii-review |title=The Simpsons: "Treehouse of Horror XXVIII" Review |publisher=IGN |date=2017-10-22 |accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Sokol]] of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' gave the episode four out of five stars stating, "’Treehouse of Horror XXVIII’ had chills and spills, which Marge, of course, has to clean, but the thrills were only middling. It was a very funny episode, yes. It took chances, like leaving a kid alone with a catholic priest, but ultimately doesn’t reach the dizzying highs, terrifying lows nor the creamy middles of Halloweens past. It’s better than a Butterfinger, but doesn’t have a long-enough lasting aftertaste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Sokol |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-simpsons/268415/the-simpsons-season-29-episode-4-review-treehouse-of-horror-xxviii |title=The Simpsons Season 29 Episode 4 Review: Treehouse of Horror XXVIII |publisher=Denofgeek.com |date=2017-10-22 |accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII" scored a 1.6 rating with a 6 share and was watched by 3.66 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-oct-22-2017/|title=‘NCIS: LA’ and ‘Shark Tank’ adjust up, ‘Madam Secretary’ adjusts down: Sunday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=October 24, 2017|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For millennia, the Galra Empire has plagued the universe by destroying other civilizations and enslaving various races. The only known threat strong enough against the empire's power and plans is the legendary "Defender of the Universe" Voltron, a 100-meter tall robot warrior composed of five lion mechas whose pilots are known as the Paladins. At the crux of the war that ended with the destruction of planet Altea, Voltron was separated by King Alfor of Altea in order to protect Voltron from falling into the Galran evil Emperor Zarkon's possession. King Alfor bonded the five lion's energies to his daughter Allura's life force and sent them across the universe to different locations until the time for the next generation of Paladins to appear and pilot Voltron arrived. Princess Allura, her royal advisor Coran, and the Altean Castle of Lions were hidden on planet Arus along with the Black Lion.

In the present, the Galra Empire's path of conquest and search for Voltron has led them to Earth's solar system. A group of space pilots – Shiro, Keith, Lance, Pidge, and Hunk – discover the Blue Lion and immediately get swept up into the Galran War. They meet Princess Allura, become the new Paladins, and reunite the five lions to form Voltron, beginning their fight to liberate the universe from the Galra Empire.

===Main===
====Voltron Force====
* [[Josh Keaton]] as Lieutenant/Commander Takashi "Shiro" Shirogane – The Black Paladin and the pilot of the Black Lion. The Leader of the Defenders of the Universe, Shiro was captured by the Galra Empire a year before the start of the series during which he was given a weaponized prosthetic right arm. A natural, decisive leader, Shiro is calm and always in control. At the end of season two, Shiro reclaims his personal bayard weapon from Zarkon that enables them to defeat him, but Shiro mysteriously vanishes afterwards. In season three, it is revealed he was teleported to a Galra ship, as he ended up on one before escaping and was eventually found by the team. After finding that the Black Lion no longer accepts him as its true paladin, he continues to aid the team by providing guidance and support to them from the Castle of the Lions. At the start of season four, Shiro manages to re-establish his bond with the Black Lion when Keith was absent during an intense battle. In season five, he has become an unwitting mole of Haggar, who can see through his eyes to keep an eye on Lotor. After Keith and the Altean Romelle revealed Lotor's true intentions, Haggar takes full control over Shiro, and Keith discovers that the Shiro besides them is a clone, while the true Shiro died during the fight at the end of season two and his soul lies inside the Black Lion. Afterwards, Shiro is revived when Allura uses her powers to transfer his soul from the Black Lion to the clone's body. In season 7 following his return to Earth, he becomes the captain of the Atlas, a Garrison battleship and joins the fight against Sendak. The first episode introduces the character "Adam W." who was shown as a "significant other" to Shiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/voltron-legendary-defender-debuts-full-premiere-of-seventh-and-penultimate-season-at-sdcc |title=Voltron Legendary Defender debuts full premiere of seventh and penultimate season at SDCC 2018 |first=Jacob |last=Oller |date=20 July 2018 |website=[[syfy.com]] |quote=Season 7 kicks off with Shiro's recovery (and coming out, thanks to a flashback showing him and a significant other named Adam)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a description confirmed by Lauren Montgomery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/09/voltron-legendary-defender-shiro-gay/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |title=How Voltron showrunners found a Legendary LGBTQ Defender in Shiro |date=9 August 2018 |first=Nick |last=Romano |quote=An episode screened for the crowd glimpsed a flashback scene involving Adam, Shiro’s former “flight partner” in the Galaxy Garrison who became something more. “He is Shiro’s significant other,” Montgomery told the room. “They weren’t married yet, but that’s the road they were going down” — that is, until Shiro “made the unfortunate decision” to go to space.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that revealed Shiro as an [[LGBT]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[comicbook.com]] |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2018/07/20/voltron-legendary-defender-shiro-boyfriend/ |date=20 July 2018 |first=Christian |last=Hoffer |title='Voltron: Legendary Defender' Paladin Confirmed as LGBT |quote=During today's panel, showrunner Lauren Montgomery noted that viewers would meet Adam, Shiro's significant other, during the seventh season of the show.

* [[Steven Yeun]] as Keith – The Red Paladin and the pilot of the Red Lion. Formerly a cadet at Galaxy Garrison academy before being expelled, Keith is an [[orphan]] and a lone wolf as a result. Sullen and temperamental, Keith spends his free time honing his skills for battle. In season two, Keith discovers he has Galra blood, apparently from his maternal side of the family. The revelation comes from a knife which associated him with a secret rebel group of the Galra called the "Blade of Marmora", but also ends up straining Allura's trust in him for a while. Due to Shiro's absence, Keith takes over as the head of Voltron as the new pilot of the Black Lion in season three. At the start of season four, Keith officially steps down as the leader of Voltron, handing the position back to Shiro so that he can continue to work with the Blade of Marmora. At the end of season five, Keith is reunited with his Galra mother, Krolia. He rejoins the Paladins in the end of season six, reassuming command of the Black Lion.
* [[Jeremy Shada]] as Lance – The Blue Paladin and the pilot of the Blue Lion. Lance was the fighter pilot of his team at Galaxy Garrison academy. Cocky and confident, Lance is the comic relief of the Defenders and likes to think of himself as a ladies' man as well as the sharpshooter. Lance has maintained a one-sided rivalry with Keith from when the two were at the Galaxy Garrison together, but the two have shown to be an effective team. Lance becomes the new pilot of the Red Lion from season three onward.
* [[Bex Taylor-Klaus]] as Katie "Pidge Gunderson" Holt – The Green Paladin and the pilot of the Green Lion. Katie disguised herself as a boy named Pidge Gunderson to get into Galaxy Garrison academy to find out what happened to her father and brother who disappeared whilst on the same mission which Shiro was captured on. A technical genius, Pidge is the smartest member of the team able to create specialist modifications for the Green Lion such as a cloaking device (which only lasts thirty seconds) and she re-purposed a Galran drone to work for her, naming it Rover, who later sacrifice itself to protect her. During her time as a Paladin, she eventually rescues her family and while her brother Matt keeps fighting for the alliance, her father returns to Earth to warn the Galaxy Garrison about the war against the Galra.
* [[Tyler Labine]] as Hunk – The Yellow Paladin and the pilot of the Yellow Lion. Hunk was the engineer of his team at Galaxy Garrison academy. A gentle giant with an equally large appetite, Hunk is the heart of the team, lifting them up and making peace between them. After witnessing first hand the devastation and misery that Zarkon's conquest of the universe has brought upon the people of various worlds, Hunk is determined to free those enslaved.
* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Princess Allura – Crown Princess of Altea, the daughter of King Alfor, Allura was the last known female Altean. Pilot and keeper of the Castle of Lions, a structure that is both a castle and a spaceship, Allura granted the Defenders their titles and sent them on their mission to defeat Zarkon and liberate the universe. Allura wishes more than anything to finish her father's work in stopping Zarkon. In season three, she becomes the new pilot of the Blue Lion as the new Blue Paladin. As an Altean, Allura's abilities include the chameleon-like ability to blend in with other species and magical abilities related to quintessence. She has a telepathic bond with some Altean mice that had ended up in the same cryo-pod that she was hibernating inside of.
* [[Rhys Darby]] as Coran – The Royal advisor to Princess Allura's family, Coran was the last known male Altean. Energetic and excitable, Coran serves Allura dutifully whilst being fiercely protective of her. He tends to ramble on and on about his past, particularly about his supposedly daring feats or past experiences. Despite his odd and quirky character, he is a reliable and steadfast ally to his princess and the Paladins.

====Galra Empire====
* [[Neil Kaplan]] as Emperor Zarkon – The Emperor of the ruthless Galra Empire, and the ruler of most of the known universe after spending the last ten thousand years conquering it. He desires the Lions of Voltron, whom he is powerful to contend against, due to both the threat they pose to campaign along with the revelation that he was the former Black Paladin that motivates his claim of the Lions as his own property. During the season two finale, Zarkon faces Voltron and the Paladins in an experimental mecha armor and is defeated but left in a coma for most of season three until he was revived by Haggar and begins a manhunt for Lotor. In season five, Lotor slew him in a duel to the death, and he is declared dead by the empire.
* [[Cree Summer]] as Witch Haggar – Zarkon's primary advisor, and leader of the Druids, dark mystics who fanatically serve the Galra Empire. Haggar is both a dangerous sorceress and a mad scientist. She combines her unnatural magic with abominable science to arm Galra soldiers with powerful weapons, create terrible monsters later called "Robeasts" to fight Voltron, and leech all manner of living things, including entire planets, of the mystical energy known as quintessence for the Galra to use in their conquest of the universe. In battle, her magical abilities allow her to teleport, cast illusions, fog the minds of others with hallucinations, and use her hands to project energy blasts and shields. Haggar is eventually revealed to be an Altean alchemist named Honerva, Zarkon's wife who played a role in Voltron's origins ten millennia ago. While afflicted by the same corruption that transformed Zarkon, Haggar lost all the memories of her former life, and gradually recovered them as she traveled the mystical realm of Oriande where Altean alchemy originated. The trip restores Haggar to her original state as Honerva. She has mysteriously disappeared during season 7. Honerva will return on season 8.
* [[A.J. Locascio]] as Prince Lotor – The son of Zarkon and Honerva, making him a Galra-Altean hybrid, who assumes control of the Galra Empire following his father's inability to lead while in critical condition. Possessing a [[Messianic complex]], Lotor's ideology that strength comes from worthy followers from conquered worlds, rather than resource expansion and subjugation, is reflected in his personal all-female strike team who are half-Galra like himself. While acting as ruler, ignoring matters that he deems a waste of time, Lotor has been working on his own plans to obtain Quintessence which results with him branded an outlaw by Zarkon once he returns to power. Forming an alliance with the Paladins after saving them from Haggar's ambush, Lotor manages to win back the Galra throne after defeating his father in a battle to the death and subsequently dealing with insurgents, but Lotor's alliance with the Paladins falls apart once it is revealed that he secretly saved many Alteans at the time during the past war, hiding them away and allowing them to thrive, only to sacrifice a majority of them so he can use their harvested quintessence for his plans, as revealed by Keith and the Altean Romelle. It is eventually revealed that Lotor's goal is to establish a new Altean Empire, one that will even span across other realities, and he will dispose of anything, even his own forces if need be, to accomplish this, as he fights Voltron using his own giant robot formed from his Sincline ships, which has the ability to enter the Quintessence field at will. As the fight enters the Quintessence field itself, the exposure to all that quintessence drives Lotor mad with power, just like Zarkon, but Lotor is defeated when Allura has Voltron use all of its power, both from itself and the constant power it gets from Quintessence field, against him. As the power makes Voltron increasingly difficult to keep together, they are forced to abandon Lotor in the Quintessence field.

== Reception ==
''Voltron: Legendary Defender'' has received critical acclaim. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating for the first season, based on 11 reviews, with Critic Consensus being that "''Voltron: Legendary Defender'' honors its source material with beautifully expressive animation and impactful action."&lt;ref name="voltrontomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/voltron-legendary-defender/s01/ |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the first season Max Nicholson of IGN wrote, “DreamWork’s Voltron Legendary Defender delivers exactly the kind of show you’ve come to expect from the amazing creative team behind The Legend of Korra.” He rated the series an 8.9 out of 10. Sarah Moran of ScreenRant gave a positive review of the first. Moran wrote, “It isn’t trying to reinvent or really improve on the original conceit of Voltron, but Legendary Defender is certainly a welcomed take on a classic cartoon; one that should appeal to fans both new and old.” Shamus Kelly from Den of Geek gave the series 5 stars out of 5. Kelly wrote, “Seriously, you won’t be disappointed. It’s something special that doesn’t come around often in television.”

==Comics==
Three comic series detailing events happening in between episodes were announced in January 2016. Taking story ideas that were deemed too outlandish and too epic to be contained in a 23-minute episode from the animated series, these comic series bridges the time lapse between seasons.&lt;ref name="voltroncomictpbinitial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltron.com/news/lion-forge-comics |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Graphic Novel initial date|publisher=Dreamworks |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume 1 (2016)===
The first miniseries consisted of five issues, published by [[Lion Forge Comics]]. It was written by show head writer Tim Hedrick and Mitch Iverson, and illustrated by Digital Art Chefs. A special cover variant of issue #1 was available at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in 2016, with a limited release of 250 copies.&lt;ref name="comicsdcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/lion-forge-voltron-legendary-defender-sdcc-variant-cover/ |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Comic SDCC Cover Variant |publisher=Comicsalliance.com |date= |accessdate=August 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730211918/http://comicsalliance.com/lion-forge-voltron-legendary-defender-sdcc-variant-cover/ |archivedate=July 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Issue #2 was released on August 2, 2016,&lt;ref name="comic2date"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/761586196493414401|title=Voltron Legendary Defender Comic Issue#2 Release Date|publisher=Lionforge Comics |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by issue #3 on October 5, 2016,&lt;ref name="comic3date"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/783436722801631232 |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Comic Issue#3 Release Date|publisher=Lionforge Comics |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; issue #4 on November 9, 2016,&lt;ref name="comic4date"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/795683719105445888 |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Comic Issue#4 Release Date|publisher=Lionforge Comics |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issue #5 on November 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="comic5date"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/804011445419655168 |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Comic Issue#5 Release Date|publisher=Lionforge Comics |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole series will be collected in a graphic novel and was initially scheduled for a December 2016 release,&lt;ref name="voltroncomictpbinitial"/&gt; but got pushed back to January 3, 2017, then was finally released January 25, 2017, according to Lion Forge.&lt;ref name="voltrontpbdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/819250847100108805 |title=Voltron Legendary Defender Trade Paper Back Release Date|publisher=Lionforge |date= January 11, 2017|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voltrontpbreleasedate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lionforge/status/824278166231322624 |title=Voltron: Legendary Defender – Volume 1 Trade Paperback Release Date|publisher=Lionforge |date= January 25, 2017|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second series will be announced after the release of the graphic novel.&lt;ref name="voltroncomictpbinitial"/&gt; A [[motion comic]] of issue 1 with full voice acting by the series cast was released on June 15, 2017, at the [[DreamWorksTV]] [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref name="motioncomic1"&gt;{{cite AV media | date=June 15, 2017 | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyssxFkLpc&amp;t=6s | title=[MOTION COMIC] Shakedown at the Fripping Bulgogian DREAMWORKS VOLTRON LEGENDARY DEFENDER | medium=[[Motion comic]] | publisher=[[DreamWorksTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place in between the [[List_of_Voltron:_Legendary_Defender_episodes#Season_1_(2016)|season 1]] episodes "Rebirth" and "Crystal Venom."

'''''Walima''''' ({{lang-ar|وليمة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|walīmah}}''), or the [[marriage]] banquet, is the second of the two traditional parts of an [[Islamic]] wedding.  The ''walima'' is performed after the ''[[nikah]]''  ({{lang-ar|نكاح}}) or marriage ceremony.  The word ''walima'' is derived from ''awlam'', meaning to gather or assemble.  It designates a feast in [[ Arabic]].  ''Walima'' is used as a symbol to show domestic happiness in the household post-marriage.&lt;ref&gt;World faiths, Teach yourself - Islam. By Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. {{ISBN|0-340-60901-X}}. Page 179/180.&lt;/ref&gt; While walima is often used to describe a celebration of marriage, it is also held to celebrate the birth of a newborn and the purchase of a new home.

==Debate: The Time of ''Walima''==
Scholars have different views on what the correct time of ''walima'' is.  The timing varies by culture and opinion; for example some believe it should take place:
* at the time of the wedding contract ''(nikah)''
* after ''nikah'' and prior to [[consummate|consummation]]
* at the time of the wedding procession (Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari, 9/287)
* after consummation.

==Other uses of ''Walima''==

Walima in literal translation means "to assemble" and is used to describe an assembly or party celebrating major life events.  Walima is essentially interchangeable with American and English terms such as: wedding reception or celebration (when held to celebrate a marriage), birthday party (when held to celebrate the birth of a newborn), or housewarming party (when held to celebrate the purchase of a new home).  Similarly, walima is generally interchangeable with other languages/cultures terms that essentially mean to assemble for the purposes of celebrating a marriage, newborn, or new home.  While it is an Arabic term, it is not necessarily a term reserved for Muslims per se, as the word simply describes the event that is to be celebrated.

The '''Zanata Stone''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Piedra Zanata''), also known as the '''Zenata Stone''', is a small [[stele]] with [[engraving]]s. The [[Berber architecture|tablet]] is presumably of [[Guanche language|Guanche]] origin. It was found in 1992 near a mountain known as ''Montaña de las Flores'' (Mountain of the Flowers) in the municipality of [[El Tanque]], located in the northwestern part of [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]].
[[File:Museodelanaturalezayelhombre06.jpg|thumb|left|Zanata Stone display at the [[Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre|Archaeological Museum of Tenerife]]]]
The Zanata Stone depicts a kind of fish. According to Rafael Gonzalez Antón, the director of the [[Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre|Archaeological Museum of Tenerife]], its characters appear to be in [[Tifinagh]]. The latter alphabet is descended from the ancient Libyco-Berber script, and is used today by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Peter|title=African Connections: Archaeological Perspectives on Africa and the Wider World|date=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=075911501X|page=177|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TfKxAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zanata Stone seems to have been related to the [[magic (paranormal)|magical]]-religious [[Traditional Berber religion|traditional faith]] of the [[Guanches]]. It has been dated to between the Fifth Century BCE and the Seventh Century CE.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Some Guanches of Tenerife were also known as ''[[Zanata]]'' or ''Zenete'', or "those with a cut tongue". The Zanata Stone is currently in the Archaeological Museum of Tenerife ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OwZMNExQ9KQC&amp;pg=PT119&amp;lpg=PT119&amp;dq=zanata+piedra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1MZ_mKYB4W&amp;sig=UrMcUAIW8tlk8BBCq_Xea6FDdBM&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=KDQhS-eCNY3U4QbXpL3rCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=zanata%20piedra&amp;f=false The Zanata Stone] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zengpiyan''' ({{zh|c=甑皮岩|p=Zèngpíyán}}) is a [[Neolithic]] cave site in southern China. It is located in the [[Guilin]] region on the south-western fringes of the Dushan Mountain (Dú Shān 独山) in the autonomous region [[Guangxi]] and is considered to be one of the most important cave sites of the [[Neolithic]] in China as it is one of the many independent centers for the introduction of animal domestication and pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=sinkhole_2015 | title= HAZARD OF SINKHOLE FLOODING TO A CAVE HOMININ SITE AND ITS CONTROL COUNTERMEASURES IN A TOWER KARST AREA, SOUTH CHINA | publisher=  scholar commons | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave was discovered in 1969 and archaeological excavations began in 1973. Dating revealed that the cave was occupied between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago, the oldest layer reaching as far back as 12,000 years ago. This natural cave was used as a dwelling place, whether it was only a seasonal habitat is not yet clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/82314.htm | title = Archeologists Gather in Guilin to Discuss Cave Discoveries | publisher = China Internet Information Center | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cave has an area of approximately {{convert|220|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and faces southwest, adjacent to the [[Li River (Guangxi)|Li River]] with neighboring woods for hunting, lakes for fishing and plains for collecting wild vegetables.

Excavations have so far yielded over 30 human corpses, 110 kinds of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, over 1,000 pieces of polished and pierced stone and bone ware, animal teeth, mussel shells and over 10,000 pieces of pottery. A large number of fireplaces and waste pits were also discovered. In the back of the cave stone material is piled up. In older sediments semi-finished stone tools were abundant. Pierced stone tools and polished stone tools were unearthed from more recent layers. Bone artifacts included fishing spears (Yubiao {{lang|zh|鱼镖}}), arrowheads (zú {{lang|zh|镞}}) needles (zhēn {{lang|zh|针}}) and hairpins (jī {{lang|zh|笄}}).

The cave yielded some of the country's oldest pieces of pottery as the appearance of pottery in the area is believed to be related to freshwater snail eating. "Freshwater snails were one of their staple foods, judging by the quantities of snail shells found in various strata".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macauart.net/News/ContentE.asp?region=C&amp;id=2277 | title = Pottery origins could be linked to snail eating | publisher =  Macau Art Net | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest local pottery is according to Chinese archaeologists dated to 12,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. The ceramics of more recent strata were determined to belong to the "String pattern-Guan-vessel-type" ({{lang|zh|绳纹罐类}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=X6oPBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Zengpiyan+Cave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q5OGyaOWLe&amp;sig=IcsGDRSpTGk1sV_WAsbu1WiCcI8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_8dOp35rOAhWBpI8KHSlgBGcQ6AEISzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Zengpiyan%20Cave&amp;f=false | title = The Archaeology of Early China By Gideon Shelach-Lavi | publisher = Google Books | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kaogu.net.cn/en/Research_work/Archaeological_sciences_and_tec/2013/1025/30259.html | title = Pig Domestication in Ancient China | publisher =  The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time the cave must also have served as a primitive tomb as bones of about 30 humans were discovered. No burial pits and funeral tools have been found. The bodies were buried mainly in a [[squatting position]].

The cave was finally abandoned after being inhabited for 5,000 years when a warm and humid period started around 7,000 years ago and the cave, only one meter above the surrounding plain, was often flooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geology.com.cn/Geology-Journals/article-29465.html | title= A Study of the 14C Age of Tufa Layer in the Zengpiyan Cave Site of Guilin | publisher=  Geology com - Geology Journals | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assertion that the pig was domesticated at this site remains controversial and has not yet been answered conclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=z4_bT2SJ-HUC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Zengpiyan+Cave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ynH2U4Ow46&amp;sig=MiGJSxse4C7LiJhvPjT42o8v0lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_8dOp35rOAhWBpI8KHSlgBGcQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zengpiyan%20Cave&amp;f=false | title = Archaeology of Asia|editor-first1=Miriam T.|editor-last1=Stark|editor-link1=Miriam Stark | publisher = Google Books | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

scholars Zhang Chia and Hsiao-chun Hung in "Later hunter-gatherers in southern China, 18 000–3000 BC":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9428934 | title = Later hunter-gatherers in southern China, 18 000–3000 BC | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | date= |accessdate=July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ‘Neolithic package’ doesn't really work for this fascinating chapter of the human experience, where pottery, social aggregation, animal domestication and rice cultivation all arrive at different places and times. The authors define the role of the ‘pottery-using foragers’, sophisticated hunter-gatherers who left shell or fish middens in caves and dunes. These colonising non-farmers shared numerous cultural attributes with rice cultivators on the Yangtze, their parallel contemporaries over more than 5000 years. Some agriculturalists became hunter-foragers in turn when they expanded onto less fertile soils. No simple linear transition then, but the practice of ingenious strategies, adaptations and links in a big varied land."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zengpiyan has been listed a monument of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 2001.
