The '''[[Eredivisie|Netherlands Football League Championship]] 1888-1889''' was the first national football championship in the Netherlands. Seven teams from the cities [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Rotterdam]] participated in the competition that would later be called ''Eerste Klasse West''. But since the western football district of the Netherlands was the only one to have a competition at the time, it could be regarded as a national championship. [[RC en VV Rotterdam|VV Concordia]] from [[Rotterdam]] won the championship, however this championship was not official, since the teams had not played an equal number of matches.

The '''1985 Israel Super Cup''' was the 15th [[Israel Super Cup]] (20th, including unofficial matches, as the competition wasn't played within the [[Israel Football Association]] in its first 5 editions, until 1969), an annual Israel football match played between the winners of the previous season's [[Liga Leumit|Top Division]] and [[Israel State Cup]].

The match was played between [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], champions of the [[1984–85 Liga Leumit]] and [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], winners of the [[1984–85 Israel State Cup]].

This was Maccabi Haifa's 3rd Israel Super Cup appearance (including unofficial matches) and Beitar's 4th. At the match, played at [[Kiryat Haim Stadium]], Maccabi Haifa won 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/israsupcuphist.html Israel - List of 'Champions of Champions' (Super Cup) Finals] Yaniv Bleicher, 3 July 2008, RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhpress.nli.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=MAR/1985/06/09&amp;PageLabelPrint=22&amp;EntityId=Ar02200&amp;ViewMode=HTML The Bull of Haifa Saw Yellow and Struck a Five] Yonatan Haleli, Ma'ariv, 9 June 1985, Historical Jewish Press {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="799">The '''2000 Libyan Super Cup''' was the fourth edition of the [[Libyan SuperCup|Super Cup]], and was meant to be played on December 31, 2000 between [[Libyan Premier League 1999-2000|LPL]] winners [[Al Ahly Tripoli]] and [[Libyan Cup 1999-2000|Libyan Cup]] runners-up [[Al Swihli]] at the [[Rajab Omar Stadium]] in [[Tripoli]]. This was a repeat of the Libyan Cup final that was played in the same year. Al Swihli did not show for the cup final and once again, the match was not played as [[Al Swihli]] did not show, and [[Al Ahly Tripoli]] were therefore awarded a 2-0 victory. [[Al Swihli]] later apologised for not showing.

'''Adenosine triphosphate''' ('''ATP''') is a complex [[organic compound|organic chemical]] that provides energy to drive many processes in living [[cell (biology)|cells]], e.g. muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of [[currency]]" of intracellular [[energy transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knowles |first=J.&amp;nbsp;R. |title=Enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=49 |pages=877–919 |year=1980 |pmid=6250450 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.49.070180.004305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) or to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Törnroth-Horsefield |first1=S. |last2=Neutze |first2=R. |title=Opening and closing the metabolite gate |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=105 |issue=50 |pages=19565–19566 |date=December 2008|pmid=19073922 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0810654106 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19073922 |pmc=2604989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a [[coenzyme]].

From the perspective of [[biochemistry]], ATP is classified as a [[nucleoside triphosphate]], which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base ([[adenine]]), the sugar [[ribose]], and the [[Polyphosphate|triphosphate]].

==Structure==
In terms of its structure, ATP consists of an [[adenine]] attached by the 9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar ([[ribose]]), which in turn is attached at the 5′ carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]]. The three phosphoryl groups are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ).

In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, with a small proportion of ATP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Storer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Storer |first1=A. |last2=Cornish-Bowden |first2=A. | title = Concentration of MgATP&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and other ions in solution.

===Binding of metal cations to ATP===
Being polyanionic and featuring a potentially [[chelation|chelatable]] polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The [[binding constant]] for {{chem|link=magnesium|Mg|2+}} is ({{gaps|9|554}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=J. |last2=Chin |first2=A. | title = Chelation of divalent cations by ATP, studied by titration calorimetry | journal = Anal.

Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with {{chem|Mg|2+}} bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers.&lt;ref name=Storer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garfinkel |first1=L. |last2=Altschuld |first2=R. |last3=Garfinkel |first3=D. | title = Magnesium in cardiac energy metabolism | journal = J.

==Production from AMP and ADP==
===Production, aerobic conditions===
With a typical intracellular [[concentration]] of 1–10&amp;nbsp;[[molarity|mM]], ATP is abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Beis |first1=I. |last2= Newsholme |first2=E.&amp;nbsp;A. | date = October 1, 1975 | title= The contents of adenine nucleotides, phosphagens and some glycolytic intermediates in resting muscles from vertebrates and invertebrates | journal= Biochem.

&lt;/ref&gt; The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in [[eukaryote]]s are (1) [[glycolysis]], (2) the [[citric acid cycle]]/[[oxidative phosphorylation]], and (3) [[beta-oxidation]]. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to [[carbon dioxide]], the combination of pathways 1 and 2, is known as [[cellular respiration]], produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rich |first=P.&amp;nbsp;R. |title=The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain |journal=Biochem. Soc. Trans. |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=1095–1105 |year=2003 |pmid=14641005 |url=http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/031/1095/bst0311095.htm |doi=10.1042/BST0311095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP production by a non-[[photosynthetic]] aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the [[mitochondria]], which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.&lt;ref name="Lodish"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lodish |first1=H. |last2=Berk |first2=A. |last3=Matsudaira |first3=P. |last4=Kaiser |first4=C.&amp;nbsp;A. |last5=Krieger |first5=M. |last6=Scott |first6=M.&amp;nbsp;P. |last7=Zipursky |first7=S.&amp;nbsp;L. |last8=Darnell |first8=J. | title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=5th |publisher=W.&amp;nbsp;H. Freeman |location=New York, NY |isbn = 978-0-7167-4366-8 | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glycolysis====
{{Main|Glycolysis}}

In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to [[pyruvate]]. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by two enzymes, [[Phosphoglycerate kinase|PGK]] and [[pyruvate kinase]]. Two equivalents of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]]. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the [[citric acid cycle|Krebs Cycle]].&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voet |first1=D. |last2=Voet |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;G. | year=2004 | title=Biochemistry |volume=1 |edition=3rd | publisher= Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-471-19350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. Phase 1, "the preparatory phase", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in the Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as "Priming Steps". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates . In Step 7, two ATP are produced. In addition, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs are formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.  

=====Regulation=====
In glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&amp;nbsp;– the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.&lt;ref name="Voet" /&gt; A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt;

====Citric acid cycle====
{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}

In the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate,  three equivalents of [[NADH]], and one equivalent of [[Flavin group|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are recycled (to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively), generating additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt; The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to recycle the NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt;

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[glycerol-phosphate shuttle]]) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A [[transaminase]] converts the oxaloacetate to [[aspartate]] for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt;&lt;!--will put the antiporter/full cycle in the shuttle article--&gt;

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the electron transport chain pumps [[proton]]s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a [[proton motive force]] that is the net effect of a [[pH]] gradient and an [[electric potential]] gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient&amp;nbsp;– that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix&amp;nbsp;–  yields ATP by [[ATP synthase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrahams |first1=J. |last2=Leslie |first2=A. |last3=Lutter |first3=R. |last4=Walker |first4=J. | title = Structure at 2.8&amp;nbsp;Å resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6491 | pages = 621–628 | year = 1994 |pmid=8065448 | doi = 10.1038/370621a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three ATP are produced per turn. 

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane's electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. One ATP costs about 3  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires  4H&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt; The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=Brandolin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dahout-Gonzalez |first1=C. |last2=Nury |first2=H. |last3=Trézéguet |first3=V. |last4=Lauquin |first4=G. |last5=Pebay-Peyroula |first5=E. |last6=Brandolin |first6=G. | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology | volume = 21 | pages = 242–249 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/21/4/242 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient. After completing glycolysis, the Citric Acid Cycle, electrons transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30-38 ATP are produced per glucose. 

=====Regulation=====
The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]]&amp;nbsp;– the ion that gives its name to the cycle&amp;nbsp;– is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt;

====Beta oxidation====
{{Main|Beta-oxidation}}
In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to [[acetyl-CoA]]. The pathway is called [[beta-oxidation]]. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are used  by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.  Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ronnett |first1=G. |last2=Kim |first2=E. |last3=Landree |first3=L. |last4=Tu |first4=Y. | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol.

=====Regulation=====
In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is regulated by the availability of its substrate&amp;nbsp;– the reduced form of [[cytochrome c]]. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:
:{{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;NADH + cyt&amp;nbsp;c&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; + ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + cyt&amp;nbsp;c&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt; + ATP
which directly implies this equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}]}{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}]} = \left(\frac{[\mathrm{NADH}]}{[\mathrm{NAD}]^{+}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{ADP}] [\mathrm{P_i}]}{[\mathrm{ATP}]}\right)K_\mathrm{eq}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or a high ratio of [ADP][P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt; An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Brandolin/&gt;

===Production, anaerobic conditions===
[[fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] in the absence of a respiratory [[electron transport chain]]. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to [[lactic acid]] is:
: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → 2&amp;nbsp;{{chem|CH|3|CH(OH)COOH}} + 2&amp;nbsp;ATP

[[Anaerobic respiration]] is respiration in the absence of {{chem|link=oxygen|O|2}}. Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]], and carbon dioxide.

===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===
ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called "replenishment" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the [[ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family|ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase]] family.

===ATP production during photosynthesis===
In plants, ATP is synthesized in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]].  The process is called photophosphorylation. The "machinery" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = J. | title = Photosynthesis of ATP-electrons, proton pumps, rotors, and poise | journal = Cell | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–276 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12176312 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00870-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the [[Calvin cycle]], which produces [[triose]] sugars.

===ATP recycling===
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.2&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. The majority of ATP is recycled from [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells requires the [[hydrolysis]] of 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kg. A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 500-750 times during a single day ({{nowrap|100 / 0.2 {{=}} 500}}).

==Other biochemical functions==
===Intracellular signaling===
ATP is involved [[signal transduction]] by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups.  Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins.  They share a small number of common folds.&lt;ref name=Scheeff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheeff |first1=E. |last2=Bourne |first2=P. | title = Structural evolution of the protein kinase-like superfamily |pmc=1261164 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = e49 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16244704}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Phosphorylation]] of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] cascade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mishra |first1=N. |last2=Tuteja |first2=R. |last3=Tuteja |first3=N. | title = Signaling through MAP kinase networks in plants | journal = Arch. Biochem. Biophys. | volume = 452 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16806044 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP is also a substrate of [[adenylate cyclase]], most commonly in [[G protein–coupled receptor|G protein-coupled receptor]] signal transduction pathways and is transformed to [[second messenger]], cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamenetsky |first1=M. |last2=Middelhaufe |first2=S. |last3=Bank |first3=E. |last4=Levin |first4=L. |last5=Buck |first5=J. |last6=Steegborn |first6=C. | title = Molecular details of cAMP generation in mammalian cells: a tale of two systems | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 362 | issue = 4 | pages = 623–639 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16934836 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.07.045 | pmc = 3662476}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanoune |first1=J. |last2=Defer |first2=N. | title = Regulation and role of adenylyl cyclase isoforms | journal = Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. | volume = 41 | pages = 145–174 | year = 2001| pmid = 11264454 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA and RNA synthesis===
ATP is one of four "monomers" required in the synthesis of [[RNA]]. The process is promoted by [[RNA polymerase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joyce |first1=C.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=Steitz |first2=T.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=177 |issue=22 |pages=6321–6329 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405 |pmc=177480 |doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the [[deoxyribonucleotide]] dATP.  Like many condensation reactions in nature, [[DNA replication]] and [[DNA transcription]] also consumes ATP.

===Amino acid activation in protein synthesis===
{{main|Amino acid activation}}
[[Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]] enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps:

# aa + ATP ⟶ aa-AMP + [[pyrophosphate|PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]]
# aa-AMP + tRNA ⟶ aa-tRNA + AMP

The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration).

===ATP binding cassette transporter===
Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis.  Transport is mediated by [[ATP binding cassette transporter]]s.  The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mammalian ABC transporters in health and disease|authors=Borst, P.; Elferink, R. Oude|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=2002|volume=71|pages=537-592|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.102301.093055|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3499814/42885_202387y.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular signalling and neurotransmision===
Cells secrete ATP to communicate with other cells in a process called [[purinergic signalling]]. ATP serves as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the nervous system, modulates cilliary beating, affects vascular oxygen supply etc.  ATP is either secreted directly across the cell membrane through channel proteins&lt;ref name="RomanovLasher2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanov|first1=Roman A.|last2=Lasher|first2=Robert S.|last3=High|first3=Brigit|last4=Savidge|first4=Logan E.|last5=Lawson|first5=Adam|last6=Rogachevskaja|first6=Olga A.|last7=Zhao|first7=Haitian|last8=Rogachevsky|first8=Vadim V.|last9=Bystrova|first9=Marina F.|last10=Churbanov|first10=Gleb D.|last11=Adameyko|first11=Igor|last12=Harkany|first12=Tibor|last13=Yang|first13=Ruibiao|last14=Kidd|first14=Grahame J.|last15=Marambaud|first15=Philippe|last16=Kinnamon|first16=John C.|last17=Kolesnikov|first17=Stanislav S.|last18=Finger|first18=Thomas E.|title=Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex|journal=Science Signaling|volume=11|issue=529|year=2018|pages=eaao1815|issn=1945-0877|doi=10.1126/scisignal.aao1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahl2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dahl|first1=Gerhard|title=ATP release through pannexon channels|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=370|issue=1672|year=2015|pages=20140191|issn=0962-8436|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0191|pmc=4455760}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is pumped into vesicles&lt;ref name="LarssonSawada2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=Max|last2=Sawada|first2=Keisuke|last3=Morland|first3=Cecilie|last4=Hiasa|first4=Miki|last5=Ormel|first5=Lasse|last6=Moriyama|first6=Yoshinori|last7=Gundersen|first7=Vidar|title=Functional and Anatomical Identification of a Vesicular Transporter Mediating Neuronal ATP Release|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=22|issue=5|year=2012|pages=1203–1214|issn=1460-2199|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr203}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then [[exocytosis|fuse]] with the membrane. Cells detect ATP using the [[purinergic receptor]] proteins P2X and P2Y.

==ATP analogues==
Biochemistry laboratories often use ''[[in vitro]]'' studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. ATP analogs are also used in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine a [[protein structure]] in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.

[[Enzyme inhibitor]]s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as [[kinase]]s are needed to examine the [[binding site]]s and [[transition state]]s involved in ATP-dependent reactions.

Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a [[sulphur]] atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound [[vanadate]] ion.

Caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.&lt;ref name=Resetar&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resetar |first1=A.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=Chalovich |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;M. | year=1995 | title= Adenosine 5′-(gamma-thiotriphosphate): an ATP analog that should be used with caution in muscle contraction studies | volume=34 | issue=49 | pages=16039–16045 | pmid=8519760 | doi = 10.1021/bi00049a018 | journal= Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Adolphe-Chéron Stadium''' is the main stadium for [[Association football|football]] and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] in the city of [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] ([[Val-de-Marne]]).

== Description ==
The stadium has a capacity of &lt;span&gt;3,500&lt;/span&gt;. It is used by the football clubs [[:fr:US Lusitanos Saint-Maur|US Lusitanos Saint-Maur]] and [[:fr:Vie au grand air de Saint-Maur (football)|VGA Saint-Maur]].

==  History  ==

===  Olympic Stadium Saint-Maur Park  ===
In 1912, Phileas Vassal bequeathed 37 hectares of land to the city of Saint-Maur. The will stipulated that the plot must be divided up and it must be devoted to sports played by "both sexes".&lt;ref&gt;Clavel Cyrille, ''Saint-Maur, cité des sports'', Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Le Vieux Saint-Maur, 2014, &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="page(s)"&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/ref&gt; The Company of the Olympic Stadium was created in 1920 to manage and operate the site. Under the leadership of [[:fr:Adolphe Chéron|Adolphe Cheron]], construction of the stadium began in early 1920 and was completed in May 1922.  The opening of the stadium, which at that time could accommodate 10,000 spectators, took place 28 May, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k810718d/f4.item.zoom ''L'Echo de Paris'', &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="Numéro"&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;abbr class="abbr" title="Numéro"&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; mai 1922, &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="page(s)"&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;4] sur ''gallica.bnf''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k623365d/f4.item.zoom ''Le Petit Journal'', &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="Numéro"&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;abbr class="abbr" title="Numéro"&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; mai 1922, &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="page(s)"&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;4] sur ''gallica.bnf''&lt;/ref&gt; The Henry Paté gym is also situated on the site.

The stadium hosted the Ladies Athletics Championships of France in [[:fr:Championnats de France d'athlétisme 1929|1929]], [[:fr:Championnats de France d'athlétisme 1933|1933]] and [[:fr:Championnats de France d'athlétisme 1934|1934]].

The stadium underwent superficial renovations between 1943 and 1951.

=== Adolphe-Chéron Stadium ===
The stadium was renamed the Adolphe-Chéron Stadium on 24 May 1952&lt;ref&gt;Clavel Cyrille, ''op.cit.'', &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="page(s)"&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;147&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent further renovations between 1958 and 1973, including the installation of permanent lighting on [[:fr:19 novembre en sport|19 November]] 1964.  Previously, the lighting was only partial and had to be supplemented for nighttime events, such as the famous "Saint-Maur," athletics meetings. These evening athletics events saw [[Michel Jazy]] break several world records:  
* on [[:fr:27 juin en sport|27 June]] 1962, Jazy beat the world record in the 3,000 meters in 7:49.2.   
* on [[:fr:2 juin en sport|2 June]] 1965, Jazy beats the world record in the [[Mile run|mile]] in 3:55.5,   
* the [[:fr:12 octobre en sport|12 October]]1966, Jazy bade farewell to the competition by beating the world record in the 2,000 meters (4:56.1). 
Other international athletics records are set at the stadium were:
* [[Hervé d'Encausse|Hervé Encausse]] beat the European record in the [[Pole vault]] on [[:fr:5 juin en sport|5 June]] 1968 (5,37 m).     
*   [[Guy Drut]] beat the world record for [[110 metres hurdles|110 meters hurdles]] on [[:fr:23 juillet en sport|23 July]] 1975 (13.1).
The stadium was renovated again between 1987 and 1988, with the erection of a new main stand of 680 seats. This stand, named after Michel Jazy, was inaugurated on [[:fr:9 octobre en sport|9 October]] 1988.

'''Asociación Mutual Social y Deportiva Atlético de Rafaela''' ({{IPA-es|asosjaˈsjon muˈtwal soˈsjal i depoɾˈtiβa aˈtletiko ðe rafaˈela|local}}; usually known simply as '''Atlético de Rafaela''') is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[sports club]] from the city of [[Rafaela]], in [[Santa Fe Province]]. The club is mostly known for its professional [[association football|football]] team, which currently plays in [[Primera B Nacional]], the second division of the [[Argentine football league system]].

Apart from football, other sports and activities practised at the institution are [[basketball]], [[chess]], [[field hockey]], [[artistic gymnastics]], [[paddle tennis]], [[roller skating]], [[skeet shooting]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atleticorafaela.com.ar/contenidos/deportes-amateur/ Deportes amateur] on A. Rafaela website, 28 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Asociaci%C3%B3n_Mutual_Social_y_Deportiva_Atl%C3%A9tico_de_Rafaela.jpg|thumb|left|Atlético Rafaela team of 2012]]
Under the name "Club Atlético Argentino de Rafaela", the club was founded in the city of Rafaela, [[Santa Fe Province]] in 1907. In 1915 the name was changed to "Club Atlético de Rafaela". The Monumental de Barrio Alberdi concrete stadium was erected in 1951.

The club was turned into a non-profit organization in 1988, and renamed ''Asociación Mutual Social y Deportiva Atlético de Rafaela'' ("Social and Sport Association Rafaela Athletic"). Only a year later Rafaela reached the second division after defeating [[Atlético Ledesma]] by 3–0 with goals scored by López (20 ST and 40ST) and Poelman (35ST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacremaesdeprimera.com.ar/Ascenso_de_1989.htm 1989's Promotion.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201102223/http://www.lacremaesdeprimera.com.ar/Ascenso_de_1989.htm |date=February 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlético de Rafaela played 14 years in the second division until the team won the [[Apertura]] 2002 and the [[Clausura]] 2003 to finally reach [[Primera División Argentina|first division]]. After losing the ''[[2003-2004 in Argentine football#"Promoción" Playoff|promoción]]'' against [[Huracán de Tres Arroyos]], Atlético de Rafaela was relegated to the second division again.

The following season Atlético lost its chance to return to the first division, after losing the ''[[2003-2004 in Argentine football#"Promoción" Playoff|promoción]]'', against [[Argentinos Juniors]].

In 2009 Rafaela earned another chance to return to the Primera División via a [[Primera División Argentina 2008–09#Relegation.2Fpromotion playoffs|playoff]] against [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata]]. After winning the first final 3–0, Rafaela lost the second match by the same score (0–3), and had to stay in the second division once again.

Atlético de Rafaela fans are referred as ''Cremosos'' or ''Celestes'', as well as the group of people that follows the team everywhere is known as ''La Barra de los Trapos'' .

The institution has also an [[Autódromo Ciudad de Rafaela|important car racing circuit]] since 1919, which hosts many competitions including [[Turismo Carretera]] (since 1941) and [[TC 2000]] (since 1983).

The 21st of May 2011, after defeating [[Atlético Tucumán]] by 2–0 with goals scored by [[Oscar Carniello|Carniello]] and [[Alexis Castro (footballer, born 1984)|Aldana]], they earned a spot back on the [[Argentine Primera División|first division]] for the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ole.com.ar/atletico-rafaela/triunfo-propio-campeon_0_485351627.html "An appropriate triumph from a champ", Diario Olé.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beasts of Balance''''' is a [[dexterity]] [[tabletop game]] which is played alongside a [[companion app]] for  [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].  The game was developed by Sensible Object and released in November 2016, its soundtrack was composed by [[Disasterpeace]].  Originally titled ''Fabulous Beasts'', the game had to be renamed following a trademark dispute with [[Warner Bros.]] over their ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' film.

==Gameplay==
The game can be played solo, or co-operatively by up to 4 players. The aim of the game is to stack animal-shaped objects onto a plinth in order to build a tower. Each object is [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tagged; these tags are read by the plinth, and communicated to the companion app via [[Bluetooth]], allowing the app to keep score and set challenges. When the tower topples, a countdown begins, and if the players fail to re-create the tower before the timer runs out, the game ends.&lt;ref name=engadget/&gt;

The game can be extended with new animals which may be purchased individually, such as a [[Yogscast]]-inspired lion. An RFID sticker pack allows players to incorporate any object into the game.&lt;ref name=ahrc/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

==Development==
Alex Fleetwood, founder of Sensible Object, describes the game as an evolution of a project from his previous company, Hide&amp;Seek. Sensible Object received seed funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] through their React programme. The React programme allowed the team to collaborate with [[University of Bath]] academics, and gave access to Young Coaches, children aged 7–12 who acted as playtesters.  The initial prototype was built in four months.&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahrc/&gt;&lt;ref name=react/&gt;

Sensible Object explored using [[computer vision]] to track the stacked objects, but moved to a simpler method combining [[RFID]] tags in the objects and a weight sensor in the plinth.&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt; The game was prototyped on a [[Ultimaker|Ultimaker 2]] [[3D printer]].&lt;ref name=gamasutraGDC/&gt; Tim Burrell-Saward, one of the game's designers, described the importance of prototypes to their process: "We did lots of 3D printing – we couldn't have done this game without access to that. You can design something on screen or on paper, but it isn't until you have it in your hands that you can play with it and see if it's weighted corectly or if the angles are too hard".&lt;ref name=engadget/&gt; The game's electronics were prototyped with [[Arduino]] components, and the mobile apps were built in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]].&lt;ref name=gamasutraGDC/&gt;

The game was partly funded through a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign, raising £168,360 towards the game's development in February 2016.&lt;ref name=kickstarter/&gt; In June 2016, the game was renamed from ''Fabulous Beasts'' to ''Beasts of Balance'' following a trademark dispute with [[Warner Bros.]] over their ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' film.&lt;ref name=gamasutra/&gt; The game was demoed at multiple events throughout its development, including the [[Game Developers Conference]], [[Spiel]], and the [[American International Toy Fair]]. At the 2015 [[Indiecade]] festival, it won the Technology Award.&lt;ref name=gamasutraGDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahrc/&gt;&lt;ref name=toy/&gt;&lt;ref name=paste/&gt; The game was released in November 2016.&lt;ref name=toyRel/&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Stuart Dredge awarded the game 4/5 stars.  He described how the game was able to maintain the interest of his 7 and 9 year old sons, but did note how they would argue over whose fault it was following a tower collapse.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;  Matt Jarvis, in his review for ''Tabletop Gaming'' magazine, highlighted how the challenges presented by the app could introduce difficulty for experienced players, and how the scoring system introduced an element of strategy to the gameplay.  He concluded that the game was "one of the finest examples of physical and digital gameplay working together yet".&lt;ref name=ttg/&gt;

In [[American football]], '''blocking''' or '''interference''' (or '''running interference''') involves legal movements in which one player obstructs another player's path with their body. The purpose of blocking is to prevent defensive players from tackling the ball carrier, or to protect a [[quarterback]] who is attempting to pass or hand off the ball. [[Lineman (American football)|Offensive linemen]] and [[Fullback (American football)|fullbacks]] tend to do the most blocking, although [[wide receivers]] are often asked to help block on running plays and [[halfback (American football)|halfbacks]] may be asked to help block on passing plays, while [[tight end]]s perform pass blocking and run blocking if they are not running routes to receive passes.  Overall, blocking is a skill that virtually every football player may be required to do at some point, even defensive players in the event of a turnover.

Essentially, blocking is pushing, with certain restrictions; in blocking one may not grasp another player or do any sort of pulling, and the hands must not extend beyond the line of each armpit; otherwise a holding penalty will be assessed. Blocking is also not permitted beyond five yards from the line of scrimmage until the quarterback has handed off the ball to a runner or a [[wide receiver|receiver]] has touched the [[football (ball)|ball]] after it has been passed.

Outside sports, "running interference" is a metaphor that refers to a person's helping someone in the performance of a task without directly assisting in the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=Third, they [mentors] may serve as a buffer between the organization and the individual by running interference for the protégé and providing special access to information, contacts, and resources.|title=Barriers to mentoring: The female manager's dilemma|author=BR Ragins|journal=Human relations|date=1989|url=http://hum.sagepub.com/content/42/1/1.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this is done by attracting attention to oneself (so as to deflect attention from the other person) or throwing oneself into harm's way.

===Zone blocking scheme===
{{More footnotes|section|date=April 2009}}
Zone blocking is a technique that is a simple and effective scheme for creating lanes for running plays. In a zone blocking scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]]. Coordination and technique matter more than muscle in implementing a successful scheme because defensive linemen are often double-teamed at the point of attack. In this blocking scheme, which takes much from the [[Veer]] blocking system, creating movement on the defensive line is more important than opening a specific hole in the defense.

===Team support in zone blocking===

One of the simplest reasons many teams have incorporated zone blocking in their offenses is that zone blocking rules do not change based on the defensive front. In a "man block" system, blockers are paired with defenders according to certain rules to create a running lane. If the defensive front changes, or if the defense stunts or blitzes, the blocking rules may change. This requires learning multiple rules for the same play. Zone blocking uses very consistent rules that do not change according to the defensive front.

Some teams base their entire offense on it, including the [[NFL]]'s [[Washington Redskins]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Adopting a variation of this scheme's core principles, the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia Mountaineers]] rely on it in the run-based [[spread offense]], devised by former head coach [[Rich Rodriguez]] and former offensive line coach Rick Trickett, that they have used even after their departure. The [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]] under head coach [[Kirk Ferentz]], a former NFL offensive line coach, utilizes zone blocking and the inside/outside stretch play as the basis for their offense. The [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] also started using zone blocking under head coach [[Lloyd Carr]] in the 2006 season, and continued to do so under his successor, Rodriguez.

The [[Carolina Panthers]] made the switch to zone blocking under offensive coordinator Jeff Davidson for the 2007 season. They had previously employed a man-blocking scheme for a downhill running attack under coordinator Dan Henning, but during the 2006 season, the team's undersized linemen were consistently overpowered by opposing defensive linemen. The power running game became stagnant, and especially ineffective in goal-line/short yardage situations, thus resulting in Henning's firing and the switch to zone blocking. Thanks in part to the new blocking scheme they implemented, the Panthers saw their 2008 campaign characterized by the running of [[DeAngelo Williams]] and [[Jonathan Stewart]] to great effect, gaining them play off status. That season also saw the emergence of rookie [[Steve Slaton]] with the Houston Texans under their new Alex Gibbs-designed zone blocking scheme.

===Linemen techniques in zone blocking===

[[File:Will Johnson American Football 46 blocking on a punt 2013.jpg|thumb|160px|Blocking]]
Using a running back out of the backfield, zone plays are usually categorized into three types: Inside Zone (IZ), Outside Zone (OZ) and Stretch. These types describe the initial landmark of the ball carrier. A common approach is: Inside the tackles for IZ, just outside the tackle for OZ and just inside the last offensive player for the stretch.

For each type of zone there are many different blocking schemes available:
* The most basic form asks the offensive linemen to identify whether he is covered or uncovered. If uncovered, he is asked to help play-side on a double team by using wide lateral steps or even bucket steps. The resulting double team then reacts to the movement of the linemen as well as the movement of the linebacker. The initial movement of the double teams helps to equalize defensive talent and creates cutback lanes.
* Another scheme asks the offensive linemen to imagine a "railroad track" parallel to the running backs path and block everything they find on their way. This could be a linebacker, but also a slanting defensive linemen from somewhere else.
* Starting from either inside or outside, some offensive lines always pair two on one and use a fullback to block the remaining defender outside. This makes it necessary for the offensive linemen to use a variety of line-splits and steps.
* By using a counting system some offenses try to eliminate unfavorable matchups that can be the result of unusual defensive alignment. This is often used in conjunction with other schemes.
* For the outside varieties of the zone play a scheme that is called Pin&amp;Pull has had great success. The linemen do not step play-side, but try to "pin" a backside defensive linemen, while the next backside offensive linemen pulls around the block and up to a track to the second level.
 
Today every NFL team uses some form of zone blocking but not all of them rely on it entirely.

====Cut blocking controversies====

The linemen of some teams that use zone blocking schemes have been criticized for their alleged penchant for cut blocking the knees of defenders, sometimes away from the play. Cut blocks are legal unless a defensive player is engaged by another offensive player. Although some consider the technique unsportsmanlike because of the risk of serious injury, when taught and applied correctly it is a very effective tactic. In fact, some defensive players employ the technique to eliminate blockers so other defenders can make the tackle.

====Sophisticated schemes====
[[File:Aaron dobson.jpg|thumb|Receiver [[Aaron Dobson]] blocking]]
Zone blocking schemes frequently employ deception. For example, plays may be called in which blitzing defensive linemen and linebackers are permitted to rush into areas of the offensive backfield that are unimportant in the play called by the offense. Meanwhile, the offensive linemen who vacated the unimportant area migrate to the point of attack, blocking material defensive players.

====Role of other players====
Players other than offensive linemen may enhance the success of a zone blocking scheme. For example, in a run-based spread attack like West Virginia's the primary responsibility of receivers is less to catch passes then to execute downfield blocks, springing the ball carrier and extending the run.

==History==
[[File:Wedge.png|thumb|300px|The flying wedge]]
Interference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes to today. The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its [[Offside (rugby)|offside rule]], which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal. At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner. Interference developed out of a practice called "guarding;" run by [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], wherein a player ran at each side of the runner, but not in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbgHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA222|title=Football, the American Intercollegiate Game|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bo Molenda vs. Minnesota (1925).jpg|thumb|left|Michigan's [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] blocking, 1925.]]
When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed against during a game he refereed between Harvard and Princeton in 1879, he was at first appalled, but the next year he had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team at Yale. During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the [[Flying wedge]] or "V-trick formation", which was first employed by Richard Hodge at Princeton in 1884 in a game against Penn, however, Princeton put the tactic aside for the next 4 years, only to revive it again in 1888 to combat the three-time All-American Yale guard [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]]. Heffelfinger soon figured out how to break up the formation by leaping high in the air with his legs tucked under him, striking the V like a human cannonball.

In 1892, during a [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|game]] against [[Yale University|Yale]], Harvard fan and student [[Lorin F. Deland]] first introduced the flying wedge as a kickoff play. Two five man squads would line up about 25 yards behind the kicker, only to converge in a perfect flying wedge running downfield, where Harvard was able to trap the ball and hand it off to the speedy All-American Charley Brewer inside the wedge. Despite their effectiveness, the flying wedge, "V-trick formation" and other tactics which involved interlocking interference, were outlawed in 1905 through the efforts of the rule committee led by [[Parke H. Davis]], because of its contribution to serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm Introduction: A Brief History of College Football] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828190115/http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm |date=August 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-interlocking interference remains a basic element of modern American football, with many complex schemes being developed and implemented over the years, including zone blocking and pass blocking.
[[File:Michigan running play against Navy (1925).jpg|thumb|280px|Michigan running interference, 1925.]]
The current body block technique has been attributed to one of football history's greatest head coaches: [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]]. Prior to his early 1900's coaching at [[Carlisle Indians football|Carlisle Indian Industrial School]], blocking was done using one's shoulders. It was Warner who implemented the technique of blocking being done by hands rather than shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powers|year=1969|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cap-tied''' is an adjective, used primarily in [[association football]], to describe a player who has represented a national football team in a competitive game and as a result is unable to represent another FIFA-affiliated national team. The term is a play on "[[cup-tied]]", which refers to a player who is not eligible to appear in a cup competition for a new team after having appeared for another team earlier in the season.

There are several ways that a player can become 'cap-tied' to a national team. A player is 'cap-tied' once he has played in an official competition for the senior national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Statutes (August 2014)|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/41/81/55/fifastatuten2014_e_neutral.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2014|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player can also be cap-tied once he has played in an official competition for a national team at any level providing that the player was not eligible to play for another national team at the time of his match appearance. For example, [[Adama Traoré (footballer, born 1990)|Adama Traoré]], an [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] youth international, had shown interest in playing for the [[Australia national football team|Socceroos]] after having moved to Australia; however, in October 2013, the FFA released a statement saying that he was ineligible for Australia because of his prior appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adama Traore confirmed ineligible for Socceroos |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/283909,adama-traore-confirmed-ineligible-for-socceroos.aspx |publisher=FourFourTwo |accessdate=22 October 2013 |date=3 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014010736/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/283909%2Cadama-traore-confirmed-ineligible-for-socceroos.aspx |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the event where a player is eligible to play for multiple nations, he is only 'cap-tied' to a nation after playing for its senior team in an official competition, or having played in an official competition at youth level and later submitting a request to change national association with [[FIFA]].

Playing in friendly competitions at any level does not cap-tie a player. A player who competes for one nation in a friendly match is not considered cap-tied and may represent another nation in a competitive fixture, should the opportunity present itself. An example of this is [[Jermaine Jones]], who had played three friendlies for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2008 but started competing for the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] in 2010. 

In some instances, players have sought refuge in another country having represented their national team in an official competition. Players such as [[Maykel Galindo]], [[Lester Moré]] and [[Osvaldo Alonso]] have represented the [[Cuba national football team]] and since defected to the United States but are now unable to represent another nation.

The second and final first-class match held at the ground came in 1887 when [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] played [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/414_f.html First-Class Matches played on Chiswick Park Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match held on the ground came in 1888 when the Gentlemen of West Middlesex played the Parsees during [[Parsees cricket team in England in 1888|their tour of England]].

The '''Rev. James M. Demske Sports Complex''' is a [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[lacrosse]], and [[softball]] venue in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States.  It is home to the [[Canisius Golden Griffins]] [[baseball]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[lacrosse]], and [[softball]] teams of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] (MAAC).

To save space and money in the college's urban setting, the 14-acre facility is home to six Canisius athletic programs.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

From 1989 to 2008, the facility had an [[AstroTurf]] 12 surface.  In 2008, renovations installed 123,000&amp;nbsp;ft.² of A-Turf, which lessens the impact on athletes who play on the surface.  Also in 2008, new scoreboard and baseball [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s were added.  The facility also features stadium lighting and [[locker room]]s.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

In 2004, 2009, and 2011, the venue hosted the MAAC Men’s Lacrosse Championships.  In 2010, it hosted the MAAC Softball Championships.  In May 2012, it hosted the MAAC Women's Lacrosse Championships.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

[[File:1996 Dominique Wilkins Panathinaikos.jpg|thumb|upright|240px|[[Dominique Wilkins]] was the [[EuroLeague]]'s Final Four MVP in 1996.]]
The '''EuroLeague Final Four Most Valuable Player Award''' is presented and [[EuroLeague awards|awarded]] to the [[basketball]] player who has exhibited the most exceptional play during the [[EuroLeague Final Four]]. The award often goes to the best player on [[European professional club basketball system|the European-wide top-tier level]] [[EuroLeague]]'s best team. It is generally considered to be the most prestigious individual award in European [[professional sports|professional]] [[sports club|club]] basketball.

The Final Four MVP award was first given at the end of the [[1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup|1987–88 season]], when the competition that would later become called [[EuroLeague]], was then known as the FIBA European Champions Cup. Prior to the 1987–88 season, the [[EuroLeague Finals Top Scorer|Top Scorer]] of the [[EuroLeague Finals]] was noted. However, an actual MVP was not named until the first EuroLeague Final Four of the modern era was held.

== EuroLeague Finals Top Scorers (1958 to 1987)==
From the [[1958 FIBA European Champions Cup|1958]] to [[1986–87 FIBA European Champions Cup|1986–87]] seasons, the Top Scorer of the [[EuroLeague Finals]] was noted, regardless of whether he played on the winning or losing team. However, there was no actual [[MVP]] award given.&lt;ref name="euroleague1958"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/11836/180/item |title=European club champions: 1958-2014 |publisher=Euroleague.net |date=2013-10-14 |accessdate=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting criteria==

† The 2000–01 season was a transition year, with the best European teams splitting into two different major leagues: The [[2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague|SuproLeague]], held by [[FIBA Europe|FIBA]], and the [[2000-01 Euroleague|EuroLeague]], held by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]]. That season's EuroLeague Basketball tournament did not end with a Final Four tournament. Instead, it ended with [[2001 Euroleague Finals|a 5-game playoff series]]. So, [[Manu Ginóbili]] was named the ''EuroLeague Finals MVP'' that season.

Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on September 30, 1971, resulted in the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] forfeiting the game to the [[New York Yankees]].]]
In rare cases, [[baseball]] games are [[forfeit (sport)|forfeited]], usually when a team is no longer able to play. In the event of forfeiture, the score is recorded as 9–0, as stated in rule 2.00 of the [[Major League Baseball]] Rules Book. The 9–0 score equates to the number of innings in a regulation game. Actual game statistics are recorded as they stand at the time of the forfeit; the game is recorded as a loss in the standings for the forfeiting team and a win for the other team, even if the forfeiting team is ahead at that point. 

Although not uncommon in baseball's early days, forfeits are now rare. There have been only five forfeits in Major League Baseball since 1954; the last forfeit was in 1995, and prior to that, 1979.  Since 1914, there has only been one incident where a team deliberately made a decision to forfeit a game, by the [[1977 Baltimore Orioles season|1977 Baltimore Orioles]].

Sports with seven-inning games, such as high school baseball or softball, generally award a rule-based score of 7–0. The same is true for [[Little League Baseball]], per Rule 2.00, under the definition of "Forfeit", there is one run allocated per inning, so for Minors and Majors divisions, that would be score of 6–0, and for Intermediate and above divisions, that would be a score of 7–0. In [[college baseball]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] has the authority to retroactively forfeit games if the winning team is found to have violated NCAA rules. This can also happen for [[Little League World Series]] games, and occurred following the [[1992 Little League World Series|1992]] and [[2014 Little League World Series|2014]] events.

== MLB forfeits before 1970 ==
Forfeits were more common in the early days of [[Major League Baseball]]. In 1871, six games were forfeited in two months. There was at least one forfeit almost every year from 1882 until 1909. 1884 saw forfeits in the double digits, many because one team failed to appear for a game or refused to continue playing. Game 2 of the [[1885 World Series]] was forfeited when St. Louis pulled its team from the field to protest the umpiring. There were five forfeits in the National League in [[1886 in baseball|1886]]. The high rate of forfeits slowed after 1910, with one forfeit every few years. Game 7 of the [[1934 World Series]] was in jeopardy of being forfeited when [[Detroit Tigers]] fans began showering the outfield with debris after [[St. Louis Cardinals]] left fielder [[Joe Medwick]] slid hard into Tigers third baseman [[Marv Owen]]; however, a potential black eye to the Series was averted when Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] ordered both Medwick and Owen replaced in the one-sided game.

In games that were played before the advent of stadium lighting (or had an enforced curfew), forfeits were also sometimes declared as a result of a team's stalling tactics. A baseball game is not official until 5 innings have been completed, or {{frac|4|1|2}} innings if the home team is winning.  Consequently, a team that was behind by a considerable number of runs before the end of the fifth inning might deliberately slow down the game, in the hopes that darkness or the curfew would come before the game was declared official. Note, however, that deliberate attempts to slow down play for this reason are subject to a forfeiture being declared.  The last such incident took place in 1954. On July 18, the visiting [[Philadelphia Phillies]] were leading the hometown [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 8–1 in the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader. With darkness approaching and the game not yet official, Cardinals manager [[Eddie Stanky]] brought in three new pitchers in the inning.  Umpire [[Babe Pinelli]], citing an unnecessary delay of the game on the part of the Cardinals, forfeited the game to the Phillies.

Forfeits have become extremely rare in recent years. The advent of night baseball has eliminated the use of stalling tactics to beat the sunset. No major league city has been regularly subject to a general curfew in recent decades. In the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a temporary curfew in a city scheduled to host MLB games (such as the [[1989 San Francisco earthquake|1989 World Series earthquake]]), it is extremely unlikely Major League Baseball would allow the game(s) to be played. In such cases, MLB has invariably rescheduled the game(s), moved the game(s) to the opponents' stadium or a neutral venue and/or ordered the game(s) played [[behind closed doors (sport)|without spectators]] (the latter scenario [[2015 White Sox–Orioles crowdless game|first occurring as a consequence]] of the [[2015 Baltimore protests]]).

Of the five forfeits that have occurred in the expansion era of baseball (post-1960), all but one have been the result of fans disrupting the game to a point where the stadium staff cannot control them, at which point the home team is forced to forfeit.

== MLB forfeits since 1970==
* [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]]' final game at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]: On September 30, 1971, the home team led the [[New York Yankees]] by 7–5 with two outs in the top of the ninth inning. Senators fans were angered by the team's impending move to [[Dallas]]&amp;ndash;[[Fort Worth]], where the Senators were to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in [[1972 in baseball|1972]]. Forgetting one out was left in the game, they [[pitch invasion|stormed the field]] and vandalized the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leventhal|first=Josh|title=Take Me Out to the Ballpark: An Illustrated Tour of Baseball Parks Past and Present|publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers|year=2000|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=1-57912-112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Yankees Win Finale on a Forfeit, 9-0|newspaper=The New York Times|page=49|date=October 1, 1971|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/10/01/79155298.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no prospect of order being restored (the [[security guard]]s had simply left early during the game which resulted in many fans walking in without paying), the umpires forfeited the game to the Yankees.&lt;ref name="sensforfeit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra|last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ten Cent Beer Night]]: A promotion held by the [[Cleveland Indians]] on June 4, 1974, backfired when intoxicated Cleveland fans ran  onto the field and attacked [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[outfielder]] [[Jeff Burroughs]] with the score tied 5–5 in the ninth inning. This led to a riot in which the drunken and rowdy fans—armed with an array of debris including chunks of the stadium seating—[[wikt:brawl|brawl]]ed with players from both teams as well as with umpires. The umpires forfeited the game to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Riot by Indians' Fans in 9th Forfeits Game to Rangers|newspaper=The New York Times|pages=35|date=June 5, 1974|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/06/05/79627644.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the September 15, 1977, game between the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]] at [[Exhibition Stadium]], a light rain had been falling, and the grounds crew placed a tarpaulin over the two mounds in the Blue Jays' bullpen, which was in foul territory, outside the left field foul line.  Before the start of the bottom of the fifth inning (with the Blue Jays leading 4–0), Orioles manager [[Earl Weaver]] came out of the dugout and claimed to umpire [[Marty Springstead]] that the tarp endangered his players by exposing them to the risk that they could slip or trip on it when entering the bullpen to catch a fly ball. Weaver removed his team from the field and said that they would not return until the tarp was removed. Springstead ordered the tarp removed from the mound that was closest to fair territory, but refused to order the removal of the tarp from the other mound and told Weaver that he could play the game under protest. After arguing with Springstead for nearly twenty minutes, Weaver returned to the dugout. Springstead then waited five minutes (the period of time specified by the rule book) for the Orioles to retake the field. When they did not do so, he ordered the game forfeited to the Blue Jays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Orioles Lose by a Forfeit In Bull-Pen Mound Dispute|page=93|date=September 16, 1977|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/09/16/91215328.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only time since 1914 that a major-league baseball team has deliberately forfeited a game.{{Fact|date=April 2018}}
* [[Disco Demolition Night]]:  On July 12, 1979, the [[Chicago White Sox]] held a game in which Chicago radio personality [[Steve Dahl]] came onto the field to blow up a box full of [[disco]] records between games of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. After the box was blown up, rowdy and intoxicated fans who had packed [[Comiskey Park]] beyond capacity  stormed the field, engaged in various acts of vandalism and theft, and did not leave the field until the arrival of Chicago police in full riot gear. The field was so badly torn up that the umpires decided the second game could not be played. [[American League]] President [[Lee MacPhail]] later forfeited the second game to [[Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Anti-Disco Rally Halts White Sox|page=A16|date=July 13, 1979|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/07/13/284376162.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=C2|date=July 14, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 10, 1995, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] gave out baseballs to paying customers as they entered the [[Dodger Stadium]] gates for a game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. However, fans interrupted the game in the seventh inning when they threw these baseballs onto the field. In the bottom of the ninth inning, the Cardinals were leading the game 2–1. The first batter, [[Raúl Mondesí]], was called out on strikes and then ejected by home plate umpire [[Jim Quick]] for arguing, as was Dodger manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] moments later. Dodger fans, fueled by a series of close calls again threw their souvenir baseballs onto the field. The Cardinals left the field due to safety concerns and the field was cleaned up so play could resume. However, when the Cardinals returned to the field, at least one ball sailed out of the center field bleachers and the umpires immediately forfeited the game to [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/sports/baseball-rowdy-fans-cause-dodgers-to-forfeit-game.html?scp=1&amp;sq=dodgers&amp;st=nyt|title=Rowdy Fans Cause Dodgers to Forfeit Game|work=The New York Times| date= August 11, 1995|page=B9|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-11/sports/sp-34067_1_baseball-fans|title=Three Strikes and Dodgers Forfeit: Baseball Game is called after fans throw balls on the field with one out in the ninth.

'''Houston Field House''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located on the campus of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) in [[Troy, New York]]. 
It is the nation's third-oldest college hockey rink, behind [[Northeastern University]]'s [[Matthews Arena]] and [[Princeton University]]'s [[Hobey Baker Memorial Rink]].  Further, it is the second-oldest arena in the [[ECAC Hockey League]], behind Princeton's rink.  Until the opening of the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1990, it was the largest arena in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital Region]].

==Origins==
Popular legend holds that Houston Field House was previously an [[Aircraft|airplane]] or [[Airship|dirigible]] [[hangar]] for the [[United States armed forces]] during World War II. In reality, it originated as a [[warehouse]] for the [[United States Navy]] in Davisville, Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrpi.org/sports/h_hfh.html|title=Houston Field House|publisher=WRPI|accessdate=2008-09-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703154549/http://www.wrpi.org/sports/h_hfh.html|archivedate=2008-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]] established the Veterans Education Facilities Program (VEFP) to help colleges build facilities to handle the increased enrollment of veterans returning from the war. One aspect of the VEFP was to offer buildings designated as "war surplus" to colleges and academic institutions who applied for them.

Originally, the RPI Board of Trustees, led by then-RPI President Dr. Livingston W. Houston, sought a hangar from the VEFP in order to establish a "sports-civic arena" for the RPI campus and the city of Troy. Unfortunately, hangars were not considered "war surplus." An investigation sponsored by the Board of Trustees discovered the warehouse facility in [[Rhode Island]] and applied under the VEFP to bring it to campus, despite the fact that its original design was not satisfactory for the creation of an arena.

The VEFP underwrote both the cost of transporting the warehouse from Davisville to Troy and the cost to reassemble it upon its arrival. RPI, however, spent nearly $500,000 on its own to redesign the warehouse to its own specifications, including the re-fabrication of initial materials and the purchase of new materials.

Construction was originally planned to be completed by June 1948; however, inclement weather throughout the project pushed completion back 16 months to October 1949. On October 13, Houston officially opened the building as the RPI Field House as part of a ceremony honoring the Institute's 125th anniversary.

==Early history==
A month later, on November 12, 1949, the RPI Field House hosted its first event, an Interfraternity Ball, with music performed by Elliot Lawrence and his Orchestra. On December 3, 1949, the first sporting event in the Field House's history took place as RPI defeated the [[State University of New York Maritime College|New York State Maritime Academy]] 55-43 in [[basketball]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/aux_serv/fieldhouse/history.html|title=Field House History|last=Garwood|first=Paula|publisher=RPI|accessdate=2008-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513105624/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/aux_serv/fieldhouse/history.html|archivedate=2008-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large impetus for the construction of the Field House was to create a home for the school's [[ice hockey]] team, which had played its first games in 1901 at Van Schaick Pond in nearby [[Cohoes, New York]], and later played in various other locations in Cohoes and [[Albany, New York]]. From 1912 to 1938 (with the exception of 1937), the team played on an outdoor rink built every winter on campus along Sage Avenue, at the current location of Anderson Field. After the 1938 season, the team went into hiatus. Houston, an RPI [[alumn]]us who played hockey for RPI during his school years, originally sought to build the Field House as a means of returning hockey to campus. On January 10, 1950, the "Engineers" under legendary head coach [[Ned Harkness]] played their first game at home since 1938, dropping an 8-2 contest to [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]]. However, and possibly thanks to the construction of the Field House, Harkness would lead the Engineers to an [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA championship]] only four years later in 1954.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;

Two weeks after the first hockey game, the RPI Field House hosted its first [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony, on January 27, 1950. General [[Omar Bradley]], the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], gave the first commencement address.

On December 27, 1951, the Field House hosted the first annual [[Rensselaer Holiday Tournament|RPI Invitational Tournament]]. The first tournament featured 8 schools playing 12 games over three days, and was won by [[Brown Bears men's ice hockey|Brown University]]. The following year, the tournament was cut to 4 teams playing a round-robin schedule over 3 days, which remained the tournament's format until 1982, when it gained a 2nd-day consolation game/championship game format. The RPI Invitational was the nation's oldest in-season invitational tournament in college hockey until its final iteration in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rensselaer Holiday Tournament|url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/t_rpi_01.html|work=College Hockey Historical Archives|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, several RPI sporting events were held at the RPI Field House, including basketball, [[tennis]], [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and even pistol and rifle shooting.

In March 1959, the Field House hosted the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournament known today as the [[Frozen Four]]. [[University of North Dakota|North Dakota]] won its first of several NCAA championships, defeating [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], [[Boston College]], and [[St. Lawrence University|St. Lawrence]]. Three of the tournament's four games went into overtime.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the RPI Field House was often referred to as "The [[Madison Square Garden]] of Upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]".&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; In its first two decades, it played host to more than 300 theatrical and musical events, countless hockey games, and several commencement ceremonies.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;

==Hockey Line==
As the popularity of hockey grew, tickets became hot items among students. Owing to its origins as a military warehouse, most views were obstructed at least some angle between the rink and the seats due to large support columns that held up the Field House's roof. This led to the birth of what is known simply as "hockey line." Groups of people – usually members of various [[fraternities and sororities]] – take a place outside of the RPI [[Student Union]] building. Traditionally, the line began sometime during late July or early August prior to the beginning of Fall classes and continued until tickets went on sale in mid-September. People in line are allowed to buy up to eight tickets and can have people hold their place in line while they eat or go to class. Students set up beds, couches, television sets, and, more recently, computers and video games to pass the time as someone occupies each place in line on a 24-hour basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cioffi|first=Mike|title=Ticket line tradition continues at RPI|url=http://www.troyrecord.com/general-news/20120911/ticket-line-tradition-continues-at-rpi|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=The Record|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Engineers' 1985 national championship victory, the [[Epsilon Iota]] chapter of the [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity set a hockey line record by beginning the line on the very next day – March 31, 1985 – and continuing the line through the summer until tickets went on sale on September 25, 1985 &amp;mdash; besting the previous record of 33 days with 178 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Robert|title=HOLD THAT LINE|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119993/2/index.htm|work=SI Vault|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation and rejuvenation==
In 1978, a new tradition started that continues today – the annual Big Red Freakout! event. This event fills the Field House with thousands of screaming fans, and there is a giveaway each year.

At the 1978 Commencement ceremonies, it was announced that the RPI Field House would be renamed Houston Field House in honor of former president [[Livingston W. Houston]], who had died the previous winter. Houston had been RPI's 11th president from 1943 to 1958, and was president when the Field House was built.

1983 brought several changes to the Field House. The Institute spent $2.5 million to renovate the building during the summer, including a support renovation which allowed the removal of all but four of the columns.  Some think the view obstruction caused by the original columns gave rise to "hockey line" and that column removal led to the demise of "hockey line", but popularity of hockey was at least as large a factor.  Indeed, "hockey line" reached its peak several years after the 1983 renovations.  New scoreboards were installed, and the ice surface was lengthened to a full NHL size. In 1984, the NCAA tournament returned to Houston Field House for the first time since 1959 as the Engineers took on North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux, coming in as heavy underdogs, upset the homestanding Engineers on consecutive nights, ending the Engineers national title hopes. The next season, the Field House would host its final two NCAA tournament games as RPI dispatched [[Lake Superior State University|Lake Superior State]] on their way to their second NCAA championship. Today's NCAA tournament games all take place at neutral ice sites with a minimum capacity higher than that of the Field House.

During the mid-1980s, Houston Field House was part of a vibrant [[boxing]] scene in the Capital District. [[Mike Tyson]] fought twice at the venue in 1986, but Tyson's rise to the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight championship]] at the end of the year helped lead to a decline, and boxing has not been featured at Houston Field House in recent years.

The 1987 Big Red Freakout! event featured plastic [[vuvuzela|horns]] as the giveaway. These horns made Houston Field House reverberate with noise – so much noise, in fact, that the evening's opponent, Brown, filed a complaint with the NCAA. In turn, this led to the creation of what is today known as "the RPI rule" nationwide, which prohibits fans from bringing artificial noisemakers into NCAA events.

In 1990, the [[New York Islanders]] of the NHL moved their primary minor-league team to Houston Field House, naming them the Capital District Islanders. "CDI" played in the [[American Hockey League]] from 1990 to 1993.  In 1993, the Capital District Islanders were sold to Albert Lawerence and moved across the river the play at the Knick/Pepsi/Times Union Center as the Albany River Rats. The team affiliated with the New Jersey Devils.

The RPI women's hockey team, a club team beginning in 1976, hosted the AWCHA national women's club championship at Houston Field House in 1994, winning the national championship, and in 1995, when they finished in 3rd. The team became a varsity program later that year, and joined their male counterparts in NCAA's Division I in 2005.

During the 1998–1999 hockey season, a new four-sided scoreboard was added to the center of the Field House, replacing the scoreboards on the eastern and western walls.

==Today==
Today, the Houston Field House seats 4,780 for hockey games, and remains the largest capacity in the [[ECAC Hockey League]] despite a decrease from its capacity of 5,217 in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Its modern function is primarily as a home for the RPI men's and women's hockey teams to compete and practice, though several skating clubs also call the Field House home. The Capital District Selects of the Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL) also practice and compete at Houston Field House.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Before the opening of the Times Union Center in Albany, the Houston Field House was the Capital District's main venue for concerts. Recent guests have included [[The Offspring]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]], [[moe.]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Guster]] &amp; [[Of A Revolution|O.A.R.]], among others.

Since the Field House's opening, the Institute has opened several other venues for athletic teams to play in, and today is used only by the hockey teams among the 21 other varsity sports offered at RPI. This decrease in activity allowed the Institute's intramural hockey program to utilize the Field House. Also, with the increase in enrollment, the Field House now no longer serves as the primary location for Commencement ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Today, the ceremonies are held at next-door East Campus Stadium. Houston Field House is considered the emergency venue, last holding ceremonies on May 25, 2013 when low temperatures and rain forced the ceremony indoors.  Ironically, what may have initially prompted moving commencement out of the Field House was its lack of [[air conditioning]], as the May, 1989 commencement was shortened because of the near-90° heat and stifling temperatures inside the arena.

Today's "hockey line" is a shadow of what it was during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. With the number of obstructed view seats now at a minimum, it is no longer necessary to stay on line for weeks to ensure good seats, and the men's hockey team is currently not as successful as it once was. When the Student Union itself was renovated in the late 1990s, the hockey line all but died completely. Today, the [[Delta Phi]] fraternity tends to start the line every year in early September, and most other fraternities and many dormatories join the line a day or two before tickets go on sale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When it was a more major local concert venue in the 1970s and 1980s, one would frequently see lines for those tickets as well. In a usual occurrence in 1985, tickets for a joint [[Night Ranger]]/[[Jefferson Starship]] concert were to go on sale the morning after a [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] concert commenced, so many people attending the concert went on line right after to wait for the ticket booth to open. As Howard Jones left his concert, he noticed the fans waiting outside in the 35° cold and asked what was going on.  To show support he offered to sign autographs for everyone on the line.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Notable features in the Field House today include the Rensselaer Alumni Association display at the entrance to the arena, which features RPI hockey players who have been named [[All-America]]ns and those who have played in the NHL.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} On the eastern side of the Field House is a stage, upon which "[[RPI Pep Band|America's Pep Band]]" plays during hockey games. On the western wall of the Field House, centered by the seal of the Institute, are six banners honoring the men's team's NCAA championships in 1954 and 1985, their ECAC championships in 1984, 1985 and 1995 and a banner honoring the women's club team's AWCHA national championship of 1994.

On November 5, 2004, RPI began its "Ring of Honor" at Houston Field House by unveiling a banner honoring [[Adam Oates]] and his number 12. Oates' banner was joined on November 12, 2005 by one recognizing number 9, [[Joé Juneau]]. Legendary coach [[Ned Harkness]] and 1954 standout [[Frank Chiarelli]] have since been added to the Ring as well.

As part of a major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village, the Houston Field House underwent several renovations starting in 2007. These included the renovations of the locker rooms, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/campaign/newsletter/houstonfield%20house.pdf|format=PDF|title=Houston Field House Renovation|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as part of the renovations, solar panels were added installed on the roof to supply power to the building through a government grant.

The [[indie pop]] duo [[Matt &amp; Kim]] recorded a [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]] video during a concert at the Houston Field House on February 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DABphlXEyW8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit''' was a temporary [[street circuit]] located in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. The track hosted the 2015 [[Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix]] for several categories and was contracted to host [[Supercars]] from 2017 to 2019.&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/kl-city-400-supercar-extravaganza-cancelled/ | title=KL City 400 Supercar Extravaganza cancelled | publisher=Supercars | date=1 June 2016 | accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing legal issues have cancelled subsequent events at the circuit.&lt;ref name="cancel"/&gt;

==Layout==
The 3.3 kilometre circuit winded through central Kuala Lumpur and was designed to showcase the city to the world via television broadcasts of the event.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=About |url=http://gtcitygrandprix.com/news/index.php/about/ |newspaper=GTCityGrandPrix.com |location= |date= |access-date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed several major landmarks including the [[Petronas Towers]], [[Menara KL]] and [[Suria KLCC]]. One of the major overtaking spots was on [[Jalan Ampang]], one of the main roads in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The initial reaction to the circuit was positive, however the drivers visiting from the [[V8 Supercars]] series noted the track's difficulty. [[Chaz Mostert]] described the circuit as like one from a [[video game]], while [[Todd Kelly]] described the track as the "craziest" street circuit he had ever been to.&lt;ref name="v8impressions"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartholomaeus |first=Stefan |date=7 August 2015 |title=Drivers debrief ‘crazy, ballsy’ KL GP circuit|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2015/08/07/drivers-debrief-crazy-ballsy-kl-gp-circuit/ |newspaper=SpeedCafe |location= |access-date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other drivers cited the circuit's bumps, narrow width and camber changes as providing a unique challenge.&lt;ref name="v8impressions" /&gt;

The [[FIA]] Grade 3 circuit was designed by Apex Circuit Designs, who have previously designed and redeveloped a range of circuits including [[Dubai Autodrome]], [[Hampton Downs Motorsport Park|Hampton Downs]] and a street circuit in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix - Malaysia |url=http://apexcircuitdesign.co.uk/portfolio/kuala-lumpur-city-grand-prix/ |newspaper=Apex Circuit Design |location= |date= |access-date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix}}
The Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit was opened in August 2015 to host the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix. The inaugural event included a variety of action, ranging from [[Group GT3|GT3]] cars in the form of a flagship GT race, the KL GT City Cup, and the [[Lamborghini Super Trofeo|Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia]], to [[open wheelers]] in the form of [[Formula Masters China]] and a [[touring car]] demonstration in the form of five cars from the [[International V8 Supercars Championship]].&lt;ref name="2015card"&gt;{{cite news |last=Haqqin |first=Zie |date=3 August 2015 |title= KL City Grand Prix is All Ready to Go|url=http://gtcitygrandprix.com/news/index.php/2015/08/03/kl-city-grand-prix-is-all-ready-to-go/ |newspaper=GTCityGrandPrix.com |location=Kuala Lumpur |access-date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2016, the event was due to host a full championship round of V8 Supercars.&lt;ref name="camsannounce"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=V8 Supercars announce four-year agreement with Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix |url=https://www.cams.com.au/media/news/latest-news/v8-supercars-announce-four-year-agreement-with-kuala-lumpar-city-grand-prix |newspaper=[[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] |location= |date=3 June 2015 |access-date=8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 event was later cancelled due to legal issues, which remained unresolved as of 2017.&lt;ref name="cancel"/&gt;

'''Multnomah Greyhound Park''' is a former dog track located in [[Wood Village, Oregon]], part of the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. The park opened in 1957 and closed in 2004. After standing empty and disused for almost 12 years, the buildings at the site were demolished in summer 2016.&lt;ref name="tribune-2016jul"/&gt;

==History==
[[Greyhound racing]] in the [[Portland metropolitan area]] began in 1933, organized by the Multnomah Kennel Club (MKC)&lt;ref name=trials&gt;{{cite news|title=Dogs Stage Trials on Stadium Track: Portland Gets First Look at Greyhound Racing|date=May 17, 1933|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|at=Section 2, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LHGregory&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=L. H.|title=Greg's Gossip &lt;nowiki&gt;[regular column by newspaper's Sports Editor]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=July 14, 1957|newspaper=The Oregonian|at=Section 2, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held at Multnomah Stadium&lt;ref name=trials/&gt; (now [[Providence Park]]).  In 1956, dog racing moved to [[Portland Meadows]],&lt;ref name=meadows&gt;{{cite news|title=Hounds Go At Meadows|date=August 27, 1956|newspaper=The Oregonian|at=Section 2, p. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the stadium's owners notified MKC that the club would have to find a new venue, to make room at the stadium for the [[Portland Beavers]] baseball team, which was set to relocate from [[Vaughn Street Park]].&lt;ref name=oreg-1955july13&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Wallace|title=Proposed For Center|date=July 13, 1955|newspaper=The Oregonian|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greyhound races were only held at Portland Meadows – which was primarily a [[horse racing]] track – for one season, the 1956 season (Aug.&amp;nbsp;13–Oct.&amp;nbsp;17,&amp;nbsp;1956).

In January 1956, MKC purchased a {{convert|90|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in [[Wood Village, Oregon]], with plans to build a new dog track and stadium there.&lt;ref name="dog club buys"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dog Club Buys Wood Village's 90-Acre Tract|date=January 6, 1956|page=1|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new dedicated greyhound racing track opened in 1957&lt;ref name=LHGregory/&gt;&lt;ref name="MKGP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grey2kusa.org/pdf/historyOR.pdf|title=History of Greyhound Racing in Oregon|accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally named '''Fairview Park''', but in 1978 it was renamed '''Murray Kemp Greyhound Park''' in honor of MKC's founder and longtime president.&lt;ref name="mkc track renamed"&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|title=MKC track to be renamed|date=August 17, 1978|newspaper=The Oregonian|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the name was changed to '''Multnomah Greyhound Park'''. 

1987 would mark the track's record season for attendance with 611,430; after the 1987 season the Multnomah Kennel Club would claim that greyhound racing was "the number one spectator sport in the state."&lt;ref name="MKGP" /&gt; Throughout the 1990s, the track's attendance would continue on a steady decline. In December 2004, the track's owner, [[Magna Entertainment Corp.|Magna Entertainment]], refused to renew their lease on the building. This would mark the end of use for Multnomah Greyhound Park and the end of greyhound racing in Oregon.&lt;ref name="MKGP" /&gt; The track would go to great lengths to try to ensure that all remaining greyhounds were adopted and sold for an average of $175 each to avoid greyhound homelessness.&lt;ref name="homelessness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/closing-racetrack-leaves-greyhounds-homeless-147710?contentID=147710|title=Closing Racetrack Leaves Greyhounds Homeless|accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months of the park's closure, two businessmen from [[Lake Oswego]] proposed a $490-million casino and entertainment complex to be built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developers eye dog track for nontribal casino|newspaper=Lewiston Tribune|agency=AP|date=March 13, 2005|accessdate=2012-06-07|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G5hfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QTEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2534%2C3579523}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ballot measure to authorize the plan was defeated in 2010 with 68 percent of voters opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State voters deliver definitive ‘no’ to Wood Village casino|newspaper=Portland Tribune|first=Shannon|last=Wells|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=2012-06-07|url=http://portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=128875590788562500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two ballot measures (Measures 82 and 83) which would have allowed building of a casino at the park were both soundly defeated in November 2012.

In October 2015, "the Grand Ronde tribal confederation announced it was purchasing the defunct greyhound racetrack in Wood Village, sparking new speculation about whether a casino could end up on the site."&lt;ref name="oreg-2015oct"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mapes|first=Jeff|title=Grand Ronde tribe buys former dog racing track, sparking new casino speculation|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=October 15, 2015|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2015/10/grand_ronde_tribe_purchases_fo.html|accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purchase by the [[Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon]] was completed in December 2015.&lt;ref name="tribune-2016jul"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Jules|title=Dog track comes down: Konell Construction &amp; Demolition tears down the Multnomah Greyhound Park|url=http://pamplinmedia.com/but/239-news/314528-192872-dog-track-comes-down|accessdate=2016-07-14|newspaper=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=July 12, 2016|at=Business Tribune section, p. 6|orig-year=published online July 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What type of redevelopment will take place on the property has not been decided, but  demolition of the then-existing buildings began at the end of June 2016.&lt;ref name="tribune-2016jul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ault|first=Trevor|title=Multnomah Greyhound Park demolition begins|url=http://koin.com/2016/06/28/multnomah-greyhound-park-demolition-begins/|accessdate=2016-07-14|publisher=[[KOIN]]|date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The track==
The track's max capacity was 18,760 people with a seating capacity of 6,064.&lt;ref name="MGP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mecoregonracing.com/mgp/about/facility.html|title=Multnomah Greyhound Park|accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track's length was 1,382.5 feet and was made of sand from the [[Columbia River]]. The kennel area had a maximum capacity of 840 [[greyhound]]s.

The '''National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame''' is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit institution honoring exceptional [[United States|U.S.]] [[sportsperson|athlete]]s of [[Italian American|Italian descent]]. In 1977 George Randazzo created the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame.  This was as a means for raising money for local Catholic youth programs.  After a successful year and dinner honoring 23 former Italian American boxing champions, Randazzo created the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.  The original location was in [[Elmwood Park, Illinois]].  The first induction ceremony honored  [[Lou Ambers]], [[Eddie Arcaro]], [[Charley Trippi]], [[Gino Marchetti]], [[Dom DiMaggio]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Vince Lombardi]]. Since its founding in 1978, more than 230 Italian Americans have been inducted into this [[hall of fame]].

A 44,000-square-foot (4,000 m²) building for the Hall of Fame and [[museum]] is on Taylor Street in the heart of Chicago's "[[Little Italy, Chicago|Little Italy]]".

== History ==
In 1977, George Randazzo founded the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame as a way to raise money for a struggling local Catholic youth program. Randazzo collected boxing photos and memorabilia, a hobby that inspired him to organize a fundraising dinner that brought together a list of boxing greats and celebrities. The dinner honored twenty-three former Italian American boxing world champions, including Rocky Graziano, Jake LaMotta, Sammy Angott, Willie Pep, and posthumously Rocky Marciano, Primo Carnera and Tony Canzoneri.

The results were so overwhelming that a friend and local businessman, Don Ponte, encouraged Randazzo to start a Hall of Fame to honor all Italian American athletes. One year later, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame was founded as a non-profit, educational institution. The first induction ceremony and banquet was a star-studded event, as the Hall of Fame honored Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, Charlie Trippi, Gino Marchetti, Dom DiMaggio and “The Yankee Clipper,” Joe DiMaggio. Mrs. Vince Lombardi also accepted the posthumous induction of her late husband, Coach Vince Lombardi.

In the years that followed, celebrities from all walks of life have come to the annual induction ceremonies to pay tribute to outstanding Italian American sports champions and heroes. An uninvited guest took part in the 1980 induction ceremony: President [[Jimmy Carter]] offered his congratulations and addressed the crowd. In 1988 the Hall of Fame moved its headquarters from Elmwood Park to Arlington Heights.

The NIASHF enjoyed a new beginning in 1998 with the help of Phoenix Suns Chairman/CEO [[Jerry Colangelo]]. A 1994 Inductee and [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]] native, Colangelo was asked by Randazzo to serve as Chairman of an ambitious new Hall of Fame building project in the heart of Chicago’s Little Italy. Colangelo accepted, and has succeeded in bringing together civic-minded men and women from across the country in support of the project. In 2000 the new facility was dedicated as “The Jerry Colangelo Center,” a tribute to his efforts and leadership. There are over 230 Inductees enshrined in the NIASHF.

== Grand Piazza ==

The Grand Piazza is located on the third floor of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. This banquet and dining area features an adjacent outdoor terrace and banquet space with a commercial kitchen, an event space used corporate luncheons, dinner meetings, weddings, or any sit-down reception of up to 300 guests. The Rooftop Terrace is located on the fourth floor of the Hall of Fame, and overlooks the city of Chicago.

The '''Pohang Steel Yard''' is a football [[stadium]] in [[Pohang]], [[South Korea]]. It is the home stadium of [[Pohang Steelers]]. The stadium holds 17,443 spectators and was built in 1990 as the first [[football-specific stadium]] in South Korea.

Its balcony typed structure presents a full view at any place to the spectators for a clear view. The stadium has a [[seating capacity]] for 17,443 spectators along with supporters seats of 500, which are located at the left side of headquarters. The supporters seats, equipped in 1999, are the exclusive place for supporters and they are the first and only facilities among domestic stadiums.

In 2003, the stadium was upgraded with full repair works such as an all-season lawn, up-to-date sound facilities, and new lockers for players. The electric scoreboard and lightings, sound facilities and convenient facilities are rated as good as those of the World Cup stadiums.&lt;ref name = "renovation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://footballtripper.com/pohang-steel-yard-stadium-guide/ | title = Pohang Steel Yard | author = Football Tripper | publisher = footballtripper.com | date = 2 July 2015 | accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sport of [[baseball]], a [[baserunner]] is said to be in '''scoring position''' when they are on [[second base|second]] or [[third base]].  The distinction between being on [[first base]] and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only score if the [[batter (baseball)|batter]] hits an [[extra-base hit]], while a runner on second or third can score on a [[single (baseball)|single]].  This is also known as "ducks on the pond".  '''Runners left in scoring position''' refers to the number of runners on  second  or third at the end of an inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.

Many of baseball's "[[small ball (baseball)|small ball]]" or "one run" tactics center on attempts to move a runner on base into scoring position.  Such tactics were dominant in the 1890s and the [[dead-ball era]], when extra-base hits were relatively rare.

==Batting average with runners in scoring position==
'''Batting average with runners in scoring position''' (abbreviated '''BA/RISP''' or '''BA/RSP''') is a [[baseball statistic]] derived by dividing a players hits with runners in scoring positions by their at bats with runners in scoring position.

BA/RISP is often used as an indicator of [[clutch hitter|clutch ability]], as a hit with a runner on second base or third will likely score the runner and is thus considered a clutch situation.  Recently, however, the statistic has been replaced with [[Win Probability Added]], considered to be a better measure of clutch ability.

A variation to this statistic is called '''Batting Average with two outs and Runners in Scoring Position''', which is also calculated by dividing a players' hits with runners on second or third by their at bats in this situation. A hit is more likely to score at least one or two runs-depending on the speed of the runner, the strength of the outfielder's arm, the number of runners in scoring position, etc.-because the runners will be going on contact—that is, they run once the batter hits the ball. But if the batter records an out, then the inning ends with those runners left on base.

A '''sports film''' is a [[film genre]] that uses [[sport]] as the theme of a [[film]]. It is a production in which a sport, sporting event, athlete (and their sport), or follower of sport (and the sport they follow) are prominently featured, and which depend on sport to a significant degree for their plot motivation or resolution. Despite this, sport is ultimately rarely the central concern of such films and sport performs primarily an allegorical role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sport and Film|last=Crosson|first=Seán|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415569934|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Fan (person)#Sports|sports fan]]s are not necessarily the target demographic in such movies, but sports fans tend to have a large following or respect for such movies.

==Subgenres==
Several sub-categories of sports films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in live action, are somewhat fluid.

The most common Sports subgenres depicted in movies are Sports drama and Sports comedy. Both categories typically employ play ground settings, match, game creatures and other elements commonly associated with biological stories.

Sports films tend to feature a more richly developed sport world, and may also be more player-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of adventure origins and a clear distinction between loss and victory set against each other in a play time struggle.

'''Stoney Lane''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[West Bromwich]], England. It was the home ground of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] from 1885 until 1900.

==History==
West Bromwich Albion moved to Stoney Lane in 1885 from their [[West Bromwich Albion F.C. former grounds|Four Acres]] ground in 1885. A 600-seat grandstand was built on the southern touchline, with open wooden stands on each side of the grandstand. Banking was raised on the northern touchline.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p126, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 West Bromwich Albion were founder members of [[the Football League]], and the first league match was played at Stoney Lane on 29 September 1888, with West Brom beating [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 4–3 with 2,100 in attendance. The ground's record league attendance of 19,700 was set on 5 January 1895 when West Brom lost 5–4 to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]],&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; whilst the overall record attendance of 20,977 was set in March 1895, for Albion's 1–0 victory over local rivals [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Tony; Mackenzie, Colin (1987) ''Albion! A Complete Record of West Bromwich Albion 1879–1987'', Breedon Books, p233–234 {{ISBN|0-907969-23-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[1899–1900 Football League|1899–1900 season]] the club moved to [[the Hawthorns]], taking the wooden grandstand with them. The final league match was played at Stoney Lane on 16 April 1900, with West Brom beating [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 8–0. Stoney Lane remained in use as a training ground for some time, and was later known as the Fairground because of its use by visiting fairs. It was used to build a housing estate in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; The area which was covered by the pitch is now a road named Albion Field Drive.

The '''Wii''' ({{IPAc-en|w|iː}} {{respell|WEE}}; known unofficially as the '''Nintendo Wii''') is a [[home video game console]] released by [[Nintendo]] on November 19, 2006. As a [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] console, the Wii competed with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] and [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]]. Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-14-nintendo-qa_x.htm|title=Nintendo hopes Wii spells wiinner|accessdate=August 16, 2006|date =August 15, 2006|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2016|alt=As of the first quarter of 2016}}, the Wii led its generation over the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/hard_soft/|title=IR Information : Sales Data - Dedicated Video Game Sales Units|work=Nintendo Co., Ltd.|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 101&amp;nbsp;million units sold; in December 2009, the console broke the sales record for a single month in the United States.&lt;ref name="NPD: Wii, DS Sales Topped Seven Million In December"&gt;{{cite web|title= Wii and DS thrash competition in US News |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/wii-and-ds-thrash-competition-in-us|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wii introduced the [[Wii Remote]]&lt;!-- See Talk page discussion on "wiimote". --&gt; [[Game controller|controller]], which can be used as a handheld [[pointing device]] and which [[accelerometer|detects movement]] in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]].

It succeeded the [[GameCube]], and early models are fully [[Backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first spoke of the console at the [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2004]] [[News conference|press conference]] and later unveiled it at [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2005]].

In late 2011, Nintendo released a reconfigured model, the "[[#Family Edition|Wii Family Edition]]", which lacks Nintendo GameCube compatibility; this model was not released in Japan. The [[#Wii Mini|Wii Mini]], Nintendo's first major console redesign since the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Model SNS-101)|compact SNES]], succeeded the standard Wii model and was released first in Canada on December 7, 2012. The Wii Mini can only play [[Nintendo optical disc|Wii optical discs]], as it omits GameCube compatibility and all [[Computer network|networking]] capabilities; this model was not released in Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. The Wii's successor, the [[Wii U]], was released on November 18, 2012. On October 20, 2013, Nintendo confirmed it had discontinued production of the Wii in Japan and Europe.&lt;ref name=engadget-discontinue&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/20/nintendo-stops-selling-wii-consoles-in-japan/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=October 20, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013|author=Jon Fingas|title=Nintendo stops selling Wii consoles in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GSJapOnly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131026130505/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/time-also-called-on-wii-in-europe/0123162|title=Time also called on Wii in Europe {{!}} Games industry news {{!}} MCV|date=2013-10-26|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}
The console was conceived in 2001, as the [[Nintendo GameCube]] was first released. According to an interview with Nintendo game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. "The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061201013947/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii|date=2006-12-01|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, game [[game engine|engineers]] and [[Game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company "had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] later unveiled and demonstrated the [[Wii Remote]] at the September [[Tokyo Game Show]].&lt;ref name="TGSspeech" /&gt;

The [[Nintendo DS]] is said to have influenced the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, "[...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as the [[Wii U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/arts/video-games/nintendo-unveils-its-video-game-successor-to-the-wii.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology |title=Nintendo Unveils Successor to the Wii |author= Seth Schiesel |date=June 7, 2011 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
The console was known by the code name "Revolution" from May 11, 2004 when its codename was announced at Nintendo's 2004 pre-Electronics Entertainment Expo press conference in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] until April 27, 2006, immediately before [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]. Before the Wii's codename was announced, the media referred to the console as "GCNext" or Gamecube Next and "N5" or Nintendo's fifth major home console.&lt;ref name="revolution renamed to wii"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/nintedo-revolution-renamed-to-nintendo-wii/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105041140/http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/nintedo-revolution-renamed-to-nintendo-wii/|archivedate=November 5, 2006|publisher=Console Watcher|work=Console Watcher|title=Nintendo Revolution Renamed To Nintendo Wii|accessdate= November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223150534/http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=344|title=N-Sider.com|date=2004-12-23|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504001204/http://www.nintendoplayers.com:80/article.php?articleID=232|title=Nintendo Players: News Article|date=2006-05-04|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nintendo's spelling of "Wii" (with two lower-case "i" characters) is intended to resemble two people standing side-by-side (representing players gathering together) and to represent the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.&lt;ref name="introducing_wii"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9075|publisher=CMP|work=Gamasutra| title=Breaking: Nintendo Announces New Revolution Name - 'Wii'|accessdate=September 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason the company has given for this name choice since the announcement is:

{{quote box
| quote = Wii sounds like 'we', which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion.&lt;ref name="introducing_wii"/&gt;

Some [[video game developer]]s and members of the press stated that they preferred "Revolution" over "Wii".&lt;ref name="gamasutra_dev_interviews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wii Reactions: Developers Comment|first=Brandon|last=Sheffield|url=http://gamasutra.com/features/20060501/sheffield_01.shtml|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date= May 1, 2006|accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' expressed a fear "that the name would convey a continued sense of 'kidiness' to the console."&lt;ref name="forbes_criticism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iwata's Nintendo Lampooned For 'Wii' |first=Parmy |last=Olson |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IOGqktjs?url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/04/28/nintendo-wii-console-cx_po_0428autofacescan08.html |archivedate=July 26, 2013 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/04/28/nintendo-wii-console-cx_po_0428autofacescan08.html |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] reported the day after the name was announced that "a long list of puerile jokes, based on the name," had appeared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="BBC article"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4953650.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=March 14, 2007|title=Nintendo name swap sparks satire | date=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nintendo of America's Vice President of Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan defended the choice of "Wii" over "Revolution" and responded to critics of the name, stating "Live with it, sleep with it, eat with it, move along with it and hopefully they'll arrive at the same place."&lt;ref name="IGN Kaplan Interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/703/703593p1.html|accessdate=March 14, 2007|publisher=IGN|title=Nintendo Talks to IGN about Wii|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321164248/http://wii.ign.com/articles/703/703593p1.html#|archive-date=March 21, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo of America's president [[Reggie Fils-Aime]] acknowledged the initial reaction and further explained the change:

{{quote box
| quote = Revolution as a name is not ideal; it's long, and in some cultures, it's hard to pronounce. So we wanted something that was short, to the point, easy to pronounce, and distinctive. That's how 'Wii,' as a console name, was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michael | last1=Donahoe | first2=Shane | last2=Bettenhausen|title=War of the Words|page=25|publisher=Electronic Gaming Monthly|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{clear left}}

The Nintendo Style Guide refers to the console as "simply Wii, not Nintendo Wii",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo Style Guide|url=http://cryptosystem.org/lcvg/e32k6/Corporate/FACT_Nintendo_style_guide_FINAL.pdf|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first home console Nintendo has marketed outside Japan without the company name in its trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wii U &amp; Nintendo's Brand Confusion|url=http://www.crit-hit.net/wii-u-nintendos-brand-confusion/|publisher=A Critical Hit!|accessdate=April 26, 2013|author=Critical Kate|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wii's successor, the [[Wii U]], was also marketed without Nintendo in its name, although its successor, the [[Nintendo Switch]], brought back the Nintendo name in marketing.

[[File:Wii-optical-case.png|thumb|Wii optical disc in case|alt=Wii disc in open case]]

Retail copies of games are supplied on proprietary, [[DVD]]-type [[Nintendo optical disc|Wii optical discs]], which are packaged in [[keep case]]s with instructions. In Europe, the boxes have a triangle at the bottom corner of the paper sleeve-insert side. The triangle is color-coded to identify the region for which the title is intended and which manual languages are included. The console supports [[regional lockout]] (software purchased in a region can be only played on that region's hardware).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020012458/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/15/wii-not-even-remotely-region-free/|title=Wii not even remotely region-free - Joystiq|date=2006-10-20|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New games in Nintendo's flagship franchises (including ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Mario (franchise)|Super Mario]]'', ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'', and ''[[Metroid]]'') have been released, in addition to many original titles and third-party-developed games.

==Demographic==
Nintendo has hoped to [[target market|target]] a wider [[demographic profile|demographic]] with its console than that of others in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]].&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; At a press conference for the then-upcoming [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies]]'' in December 2006, Satoru Iwata insisted "We're not thinking about fighting [[Sony]], but about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, but that we want to get new people playing games."&lt;ref name="IwataSony"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest IX Q&amp;A|date=December 12, 2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 16, 2006|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/750/750610p1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in Nintendo's series of [[television advertisement]]s in North America (directed by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Stephen Gaghan]]) and its Internet ads. The advertising slogans were ''"Wii would like to play"'' and ''"Experience a new way to play''"; the ads began November 15, 2006, and had a total budget of over [[United States dollar|US$]]200&amp;nbsp;million for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516084139/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/12/nintendo-wii-marketing-to-exceed-200-million/|title=Nintendo Wii marketing to exceed $200 million - Joystiq|date=2007-05-16|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions were Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and included a two-minute [[video clip]] showing an assortment of people enjoying the Wii system: urban apartment-dwellers, ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children.

The Wii was Nintendo's smallest home console at the time (the current smallest is hybrid home-portable console Nintendo Switch, when in portable mode); it measures 44&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (1.73&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]]) wide, 157&amp;nbsp;mm (6.18&amp;nbsp;in) tall and 215.4&amp;nbsp;mm (8.48&amp;nbsp;in) deep in its vertical orientation, slightly larger than three [[keep case|DVD cases]] stacked together.

An SD card can be used for uploading photos and backing up [[saved game]] data and downloaded [[Virtual Console]] and [[WiiWare]] games. To use the SD slot for transferring game saves, an [[patch (computing)|update]] must be installed. Installation may be initiated from the Wii options menu through an Internet connection, or by inserting a game disc containing the update. Virtual Console data cannot be restored to any system except the unit of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522080838/https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/data.jsp|title={{!}} Nintendo - Customer Service {{!}} Wii - Data Management|date=2008-05-22|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An SD card can also be used to create customized in-game music from stored [[MP3]] files (as first shown in ''[[Excite Truck]]'')&lt;ref name="Excite Truck Custom Soundtrack Confirmed"&gt;{{cite web|date=November 10, 2006|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/745/745360p1.html|title=Excite Truck Custom Soundtrack Confirmed|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126085904/http://wii.ign.com/articles/745/745360p1.html#|archive-date=January 26, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and music for the slide-show feature of the [[Photo Channel]].

At the Nintendo Fall Press Conference in October 2008, Satoru Iwata announced that Wii owners would have the option to download WiiWare and Virtual Console content directly onto an SD card. The option would offer an alternative to "address the console's insufficient memory storage". The announcement stated that it would be available in Japan in spring 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://kotaku.com/5057877/save-wii-games-direct-to-sd-card-starting-spring-2009|title=2008 Nintendo Fall Press Conference: Save Wii Games Direct To SD Card (Starting Spring 2009)|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo made the update available on March 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/5183763/wii-system-update-adds-play-from-sd-card-support|title=Wii System Update Adds Play From SD Card Support|last=Fahey|first=Mike|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the previously announced feature, the update also allows users to play games directly from an SD card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/games/nintendo-wii-now-plays-games-directly-from-sd-cards-725431/|title=Nintendo Wii now plays games directly from SD cards - Geek.com|date=2009-03-25|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update also added support for [[Secure Digital|SDHC]] cards with up to 32&amp;nbsp;GB of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/18036/the-wii-sd-card-menu-a-walkthrough|title=The Wii SD Card Menu: A Walkthrough - News|website=Nintendo World Report|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Technical specifications}}Specifications===
Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. Although none of these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally indicate that the console is an extension (or advancement) of the [[Nintendo GameCube]] architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;times as powerful as its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Wii: The Total Story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/launchguide/hardware1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218073811/http://wii.ign.com/launchguide/hardware1.html|archivedate=December 18, 2006|title=Wii: The Total Story|accessdate=November 20, 2006| publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Wii FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p7.html|title=IGN's Nintendo Wii FAQ|publisher=IGN|date=September 19, 2006|accessdate=November 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031001548/http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p7.html#|archive-date=October 31, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on specifications, the Wii has been called the least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.&lt;ref name=NYTWii&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/arts/24wii.html|title=Getting Everybody Back in the Game|first=Seth|last=Schiesel|publisher=New York Times|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Wii system software update (via WiiConnect24) caused a small number of launch units to become [[Brick (electronics)|completely unusable]]. This forced users to either send their units to [[Nintendo]] for repairs (if they wished to retain their saved data) or exchange them for free replacements.&lt;ref name="Wii Firmware down"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=149572|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080616142826/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=149572|archivedate= June 16, 2008|title=Wii Connect 24 Kills Wiis|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]| date=November 21, 2006|first=Mike|last=Jackson|accessdate=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of dual-layer Wii Optical Discs, Nintendo of America stated that some Wii systems may have difficulty reading the high-density software (due to a contaminated laser lens). Nintendo offers retail lens-cleaning kits and free console repairs for owners who experience this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/repair_form_us_ssbb.jsp|title=Repair Form for U.S. Residents|accessdate =March 11, 2008|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRAWLERROS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gonintendo.com/?p=40081|title=Brawl disc read errors return, but this time it's Mario Kart|publisher=GoNintendo|date= April 11, 2008|accessdate=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wii Remote can lose track of the Wii system it has been set to, requiring that it be reset and resynchronized. Nintendo's support website provides instructions for this process and troubleshooting related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.nintendo.com/|title=Nintendo support website|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Wii console, Wii Remote and other accessories were the focus of these lawsuits.

In August 2008 [[Hillcrest Labs|Hillcrest Laboratories]] Inc. filed a complaint against Nintendo with the [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S International Trade Commission]], alleging that the Wii Remote infringed on three of its patents. A fourth Hillcrest patent (for graphical interfaces displayed on television screens) was also allegedly violated.

In September 2011, ThinkOptics Inc. filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in [[U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Texas|United States District Court of the Eastern District of Texas]] over their controller, the Wavit Remote, claiming that the Wii violated its patent for a "handheld vision based absolute pointing system", a "Handheld Device for Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System", and a "Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System", which make up the basis for the Wavit Remote. They also said that the Wii U infringes on their patents as well and claims that Nintendo was aware of the fact that the Wii allegedly violates ThinkOptics' patents. The lawsuit sought an [[injunction]] against violating products, [[Royalty payment|royalties]], [[Attorney's fee|attorney's fees]], and damages for lost profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/nintendo-gets-sued-over-the-wii/|title=Nintendo Gets Sued Over The Wii|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/269491/thinkoptics-sues-nintendo-over-remote-control-patents|title=ThinkOptics Sues Nintendo Over Remote Control Patents - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by ThinkOptics in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insight.rpxcorp.com/lit/txedce-132096-thinkoptics-v-nintendo-of-america|title=ThinkOptics, Inc v.

Starting in December 2012, iLife Technologies Inc. sued several large companies over patent infringement over a set of patents they held related to "systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body relative to an environment", principally aimed at the medical field; Nintendo was sued by iLife in December 2013 for the Wii Remote's infringement on their patents, with the lawsuit seeking $144 million in damages, based on a $4 fine for the 36 million Wii and Wii U units it had sold to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/a-dallas-inventor-is-suing-nintendo-for-stealing-his-idea-for-wii-us-motion-sensors-7124540|title=A Dallas Inventor Is Suing Nintendo for Stealing His Idea for Wii U's Motion Sensors|last=Nicholson|first=Eric|date=December 16, 2013|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury trial was heard in August 2017, and the jury ruled in favor of iLife Technologies and Nintendo was forced to pay {{USD|10.1 million}} in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/jury-finds-nintendo-wii-infringes-dallas-inventors-patent-awards-10m/|title=Jury finds Nintendo Wii infringes Dallas inventor’s patent, awards $10M|last=Mullin|first=Joe|date=September 1, 2017|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nintendo appealed this decision, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] upheld the jury's decision in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/appeals-court-upholds-ilife-patent-in-10m-wii-gaming-judgment-w514792|title=Appeals Court Upholds iLife Patent in $10M Wii Gaming Judgment|date=December 28, 2017|work=[[Glixel]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wrist strap issues====
The wrist strap of the Wii Remote has also been an issue.

In mid-December 2006, the law firm Green Welling LLP filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against Nintendo for its "defective wrist straps". A few days later, Nintendo issued a [[product recall]] for the wrist straps and issued a new version of the strap with an improved securing mechanism for the wrist, leading to the lawsuit being dropped sometime thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/BW-Nintendo-Recalls-Defective-Wii-Wrist-Straps-1850489.php|title=Nintendo Recalls Defective Wii Wrist Straps After Class Action Filed by Green Welling LLP|date=December 16, 2006|accessdate=March 23, 2007|publisher=Business Wire|via=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5108362/nintendo-faces-new-remote-strap-lawsuit|title=Nintendo Faces New Remote Strap Lawsuit|last=Fahey|first=Mike|date=December 12, 2008|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second class-action lawsuit was filed by a mother in Colorado in December 2008, claiming the updated wrist straps were still ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/3725869/Nintendo-sued-over-dangerous-Wii-controllers.html|title=Nintendo sued over 'dangerous' Wii controllers|last=Beaumont|first=Claudine|date=December 12, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suit was dismissed by September 2010, finding for Nintendo that the wrist straps were not knowingly faulty under Colorado consumer protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/196315/nintendo-sends-wii-safety-strap-case-packing|title=Nintendo Sends Wii Safety Strap Case Packing|last=Howard|first=Samual|date=September 24, 2010|work=[[Law360]]|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trademark issues====
In 2000, the term "[[Weemote]]" was trademarked by [[Miami]] based TV remote manufacturer [[Fobis Technologies]] and was later used as the name of their remote designed for young children.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1824499,00.html|title=The Weemote vs. Wiimote Tiff|author=Padgett, Tim|date=2008-07-18|work=TIME.com|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remotecentral.com/weemote/index.html|title=RC: Fobis Technologies Weemote Kids' Remote Control Review (1)|website=www.remotecentral.com|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While spelled differently, the term "Weemote" is phonetically identical to "Wiimote", the unofficial term for the Wii Remote.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/07/23/small-firm039s-weemote-came-first-steamrolled-nintendo039s-wiimote|title=Small Firm's Weemote Came First, But Steamrolled by Nintendo's Wiimote|date=2008-07-23|work=GamePolitics.com|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the Weemote, which totalled less than one million as of 2008 had fallen due to confusion with the Wiimote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808075839/http://www.time.com:80/time/business/article/0,8599,1824499,00.html|title=The Weemote vs. Wiimote Tiff - TIME|date=2008-08-08|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fobis Technologies claims this to be [[trademark infringement]], however Nintendo does not actually use the term "Wiimote" in official promotional materials; but many retailers that sell the Wii Remote do use the term.&lt;ref name="gp1" /&gt; Fobis sent out up to 100 [[cease and desist]] letters to retailers and have made offers to Nintendo for them to purchase the trademark.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gp1" /&gt; Nintendo declined the offer, stating that it "does not use and does not plan to use the Weemote trademark".&lt;ref name="gp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/07/24/nintendo-comments-weemote-wiimote-flap-online-retailer-pressured|title=Nintendo Comments on Weemote-Wiimote Flap; Online Retailer Pressured|date=2008-07-24|work=GamePolitics.com|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trademark application for the Wii was filed in 2006, but it was not registered by the [[Us government|US government]] until July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/5599903/wii-is-now-a-registered-trademark|title=Wii Is Now a Registered Trademark|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trademark application for the Wii Remote was initially rejected by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] after the trademark was filed in March 2008. The USPTO claimed that the word "[[Remote control|remote]]" is commonly used, and therefore should not be trademarked. The USPTO said they would accept Nintendo's trademark filing if the company disclaims exclusive rights to the word "remote" in the term and if the word “remote” would always precede the word “Wii” in marketing and manuals. The USPTO accepted the “Wii Remote” trademark in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/02/wee-bit-of-trouble-nintendo-cant-trademark-wii-remote/|title=Wee bit of trouble: Nintendo can't trademark 'Wii Remote'|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/774/27/wii-77427250.html|title=WII REMOTE Trademark of Nintendo of America Inc. - Registration Number 4177430 - Serial Number 77427250 :: Justia Trademarks|website=trademarks.justia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{See also|Wii system software}}
The console has a number of internal features made available from its hardware and [[firmware]] components. The hardware allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the firmware (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the [[WiiConnect24]] service.&lt;!--
The latest firmware version for the Wii system is 2.2U. In order to use Channels requiring Internet access, a firmware update is required.&lt;ref name="IGN Firmware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/745/745341p1.html|title=IGN: Wii Channels to Require Upgrade|accessdate=October 12, 2006|date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Wii Menu===
[[File:Wiimen.png|thumb|[[Wii Menu]]|alt=Screenshot of Wii Menu]]
{{Main article|Wii Menu}}

The Wii Menu interface is designed to emulate [[television channel]]s. Separate channels are graphically displayed in a grid, and are navigated using the pointer capability of the [[Wii Remote]]. Except for the Disc Channel, it is possible to change the arrangement by holding down the A and B buttons to "grab" channels and move them around. There are six primary channels: the Disc Channel, Mii Channel, Photo Channel, Wii Shop Channel, Forecast Channel and News Channel. The latter two were initially unavailable at launch, but were later activated in updates. The Wii + Internet Video Channel was pre-installed on all Wii consoles starting in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090225181747/https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsWiiInternetVideo.jsp|title={{!}} Nintendo - Customer Service {{!}} Wii - Wii + Internet Channel Video|date=2009-02-25|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional channels are available for download from the [[Wii Shop Channel]] through [[WiiWare]], and appear with each [[Virtual Console]] title; these include the [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Internet Channel]], [[Check Mii Out Channel]] and the [[Nintendo Channel]].

===Backward compatibility===
&lt;!-- - Wii Download Games Should not Be Mixed With Launch Titles - --&gt;
[[File:Wii-gamecube-compatibility.jpg|thumb|The first model of the Wii has [[Nintendo GameCube]] Memory Card and controller slots to provide backward compatibility.|alt=Wii console with black GameCube controller]]
Wii consoles with the original design are [[backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with all [[Nintendo GameCube]] software, Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards and controllers. Software compatibility is achieved by the slot-loading drive's ability to accept [[Nintendo optical disc|Nintendo GameCube Game Discs]]. However, redesigned "Family Edition" Wiis and the Wii Mini are not backward-compatible.&lt;ref name="Wii2.0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EurogamerReview" /&gt;

A Wii console running a GameCube disc is restricted to GameCube functionality, and a GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games.&lt;ref name=CNETAcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9663541-1.html|title=Must-have Nintendo Wii accessories|first=John P.|last=Falcone|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=September 13, 2012|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the [[Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter]].&lt;ref name=CNETFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-10166_7-6676348-1.html|title=Which of my older video games will work on the new consoles?|date=December 12, 2006|first=John|last=Falcone|publisher=CNET|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nintendo DS connectivity===
The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the [[Nintendo DS]] without any additional accessories. This connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and [[touchscreen]] as inputs for Wii games. The first game utilizing Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''. Players with either the [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' or ''Pearl'']] Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller.&lt;ref name="connectivity returns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|date=June 7, 2006|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/711/711657p1.html|title=Connectivity Returns|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 7, 2006|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69fwCYFLF?url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/711/711657p1.html#|archive-date=August 4, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time]]'', released on both Nintendo DS and Wii, features connectivity in which both games can advance simultaneously. Nintendo later released the [[Nintendo Channel]], which allows Wii owners to download [[game demo]]s or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process similar to that of a [[DS Download Station]].&lt;ref name="Iwata Tech-On 3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Naoki|last=Asami|author2=Hiroki Yomogita |date=May 25, 2006|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117498/?P=3|title=Regaining what we have lost: Nintendo CEO Iwata's Ambitions for the "Wii"|work=Tech-On!|page=3|publisher=Nikkei Business Publications|accessdate=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.&lt;ref name="connectivity returns" /&gt;

===Online connectivity===
{{Main article|Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|WiiConnect24|Internet Channel|List of Wii Wi-Fi Connection games|Wii Menu#Downloadable_channels}}

The Wii console connects to the Internet through its built-in [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|802.11b]]/[[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|g]] Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter; either method allows players to access the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service.&lt;ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /&gt; The service has several features for the console, including [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiConnect24]], the [[Internet Channel]], the [[Forecast Channel]], the [[Everybody Votes Channel]], the [[News Channel (Wii)|News Channel]] and the [[Mii|Check Mii Out Channel]]. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless [[local area network|LAN]], enabling local wireless multi-playing on different television sets. ''[[Battalion Wars 2]]'' first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multi-playing between two (or more) televisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/727/727651p1.html|title=Battalion Wars 2 Hands On|publisher=IGN|first=Mario|last=Kablau|date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=January 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902202730/http://wii.ign.com/articles/727/727651p1.html#|archive-date=September 2, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental controls===
The console features [[parental controls]], which can be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or [[Virtual Console]] game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the [[Internet Channel]] and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to [[Nintendo GameCube]] functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.&lt;ref name=CNETParent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9880634-1.html|title=Super-Easy Game Play - Nintendo Wii Reviewi|publisher=PC Magazine|first=Will|last=Greenwald|date=February 29, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wii's success caught third-party developers by surprise, leading to apologies for the quality of their early games.

Game designer and ''[[The Sims]]'' creator [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] shared his thoughts on the Wii in the context of the seventh console generation: "The only next gen system I've seen is the Wii&amp;nbsp;– the PS3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last, but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.

An executive for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, due to the perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers.&lt;ref name="Wary Publishers"&gt;{{cite web|last= Martin|first=Matt|title=Publishers wary of creating Nintendo titles, says Wii developer|date=January 24, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry.biz]]|accessdate=January 27, 2007|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/publishers-wary-of-creating-nintendo-titles-says-wii-developer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211030359/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=22368| archivedate=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[blog]], [[1UP.com]] editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007.

Worse than on GameCube...the resulting third-party content is overwhelmingly bargain-bin trash."&lt;ref name="JeremyParish2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|title=-3 in 2007|publisher=[[1UP.com]] blog|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8601568&amp;publicUserId=5379721|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=September 25, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522130049/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8601568&amp;publicUserId=5379721|archivedate=May 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and ''Forbes'' noted that the Wii had few successful third-party titles compared to its rivals (due, in part, to its weaker hardware). Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously ("blockbusters like the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form"). ''Forbes'' observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], [[Mass Effect 3]], [[Portal 2]], [[L.A. Noire]], [[Battlefield 3]], [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only ''Modern Warfare 3'' received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the "dilemma of having fallen out of sync with its rivals in the console cycle"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the [[Wii U]]. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/video-games/controller-freak/whats-wrong-with-nintendo/article2219854/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=What's wrong with Nintendo? | date=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/04/26/nintendo-reports-461-2m-in-losses-is-selling-3ds-below-cost/ | title=Nintendo Reports $461.2M in Losses | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi | date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/05/10/sony-posts-record-losses-as-playstation-sales-drop/ | title=Cardiac Arrests At Sony, Nintendo As Consoles Show Their Age | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', in suggesting why Nintendo posted a record loss of $926&amp;nbsp;million for the initial six months of its 2011–2012 fiscal year, blamed the Wii's design for being "short-sighted". The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a "gaming gimmick". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012–2013) "as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved" later in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|generation]]. Furthermore, price cuts and the introduction of motion-sensor controllers for the Xbox 360 and PS3 nullified advantages once held by the Wii. ''The Globe'' suggested that there were other reasons for Nintendo's poor financial performance, including a strong yen and a tepid reception to the Nintendo 3DS handheld as mobile gaming became popular on smartphones and tablets, such as the [[iPad]].&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail" /&gt;

The '''Wii Family Edition''' is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally (the vertical feet are still present; however, the front labels are rotated and a stand is no longer included) and removes the [[GameCube]] controller and memory card ports, although the casing under the top cover still has the [[GameCube]] controller and memory card ports holes with no ports and no slots.  For this reason, the Family Edition variant is incompatible with GameCube games and accessories. The console was announced on August 17, 2011 and was released in the United States on October 23, 2011 and Europe on November 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="Wii2.0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2011/Nintendo-launches-Wii-Family-Edition-on-4th-November-and-Wii-Fit-Plus-bundle-on-2nd-December-252719.html|title=Nintendo launches Wii Family Edition on 4th November and Wii Fit Plus bundle on 2nd December|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114130448/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/31328/newsnew-black-wii-bundle-includes-mario-cd/|title=Wii News: New black Wii bundle includes Mario CD - Official Nintendo Magazine|date=2011-11-14|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bicycle]] business of the [[Wright brothers]], '''the Wright Cycle Company''' (originally the ''Wright Cycle Exchange'') successively occupied six different locations in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. Orville and Wilbur Wright began their bicycle repair, rental and sales business in 1892, while continuing to operate a print shop (they ended their local newspaper business in 1890).&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 they began manufacturing and selling bicycles of their own design, the ''Van Cleve'' and ''St. Claire'', named after their ancestors.  They invented the self-oiling hub and the innovation of machining the [[crankarm]] and pedal on the left side of the bike with left-hand threads to prevent the pedal from coming unscrewed while cycling. The brick building at 22 South Williams St., where the Wrights worked from 1895 to 1897, is the only extant building on its original foundation and in its original location that housed a Wright bicycle shop. They ran their printing shop on the second-floor. The 22 South Williams Street building is part of [[Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park]] and the [[National Aviation Heritage Area]].&lt;ref name=naha1&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of the Wright Brothers|url=http://www.aviationheritagearea.org/|publisher=National Aviation Heritage Area|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wrights used the profits from the Wright Cycle Company to finance their aviation experiments.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; In 1901 they fitted a third bicycle wheel horizontally above the front wheel of one of their St. Claire bicycles and used the apparatus as a test platform to study [[airfoil]] design. They built a six-foot [[wind tunnel]] on the second floor of their bicycle shop at 1127 West Third St., the last location of their bicycle business, and from October to December they conducted pioneering tests in the tunnel of over 200 shapes of scale-model wings.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

In that same building they designed and constructed their gliders and first airplane, the [[Wright Flyer]], which cost under $1,000 to build.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; The shop closed in 1909 and they started their aviation company.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; In 1937, with Orville's cooperation, the building at 1127 West Third St. was moved to [[Greenfield Village, Michigan#Greenfield Village|Greenfield Village]], Dearborn, Michigan by [[Henry Ford]].

== Wright Cycle Exchange (1892-1893) ==
After both brothers purchased bicycles in the spring of 1892, their aptitude with bicycle repairs and the high demand for repairmen led them to starting their own repair shop. In December of 1892 they rented a storefront at 1005 West Third Street, where they officially started the Wright Cycle Exchange. They sold bicycles from $40 to $100. In addition to these sales, they rented bicycles, and sold parts and accessories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The brothers then moved the shop to 1015 West Third street, where they even had a newspaper ad for the Exchange.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of 1893 the shop was moved to 1034 West Third Street, where the name was changed from Wright Cycle Exchange to Wright Cycle Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cliffhanger76.tripod.com/bikewest/wright/index.html|title=The Bicycle &amp; The West - The Wright Cycle Company|website=cliffhanger76.tripod.com|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wright Cycle Company (1894-1909) ==
In 1895 the Wright Brothers moved to 22 South Williams Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/daav/learn/historyculture/wright-cycle-company-complex.htm|title=Wright Cycle Company Complex - Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only location of the six that is still standing today. It has been turned into the Wright Cycle Company Complex and the [[National Aviation Heritage Area]]. A second branch opened at 20 West Second Street in 1895, but closed down the next year. In 1986 the Wright Brothers began selling their own bikes. They sold the more expensive ''Van Cleve'', and the cheaper ''St. Clair.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Wright_Story/Career_Choices/Bicycle_Craze/Bicycle_Craze.htm|title=The Bicycle Craze|website=www.wright-brothers.org|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orville made his own additions to the bicycles, including the Oil-Retaining Wheel Hub.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the greatest era of success for the Wright Brothers.They operated at 22 South Williams Street from 1895 to 1897.

In 1897 the Wright Brothers moved their shop to 1127 West Third Street, the sixth and final location for the Wright Cycle Company. In 1900 they produced their [http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Bicycles/Van_Cleve_Catalog.htm Van Cleve Catalog], a catalog which promoted their famous ''Van Cleve'', which now came in two models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Bicycles/Van_Cleve_Catalog.htm|title=1900 Van Cleve Catalogue|website=www.wright-brothers.org|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming increasingly invested in [[Wright Glider|the Wright Glider]], the Brothers manufactured very few bicycles after 1902, and completely stopped after 1904. In 1909, the shop at 1127 West Third Street was converted completely for airplanes, and the Wright Brothers sold the company to W.F. Meyers, who continued to sell ''Van Cleves'' until 1939.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This marks the end of the Wright Cycle Company.{{double image|left|OrvilleInBikeShop.jpg|225|WilburInBikeShop.jpg|225|Left photo: Orville and boyhood friend Ed Sines (left); right photo: Wilbur.
