The '''1907 Tiflis bank robbery''', also known as the '''Yerevan Square expropriation''',{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=75}} was an armed robbery on 26 June 1907{{ref label|Note 1|a|a}} in the city of [[Tiflis]] in the [[Tiflis Governorate]] in the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus Viceroyalty]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s capital, Tbilisi). A bank cash shipment was stolen by [[Bolshevik]]s to fund their revolutionary activities. The robbers attacked a bank stagecoach and surrounding police and military using bombs and guns while the stagecoach was transporting money through [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Yerevan Square]] (now Freedom Square) between the post office and the Tiflis branch of the [[State Bank of the Russian Empire]]. The attack killed forty people and injured fifty others, according to official archive documents.  The robbers escaped with 341,000&amp;nbsp;[[Russian ruble|rubles]] (equivalent to around US 3.86&amp;nbsp;million in 2017).

The robbery was organized by a number of top-level [[Bolshevik]]s, including [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Maxim Litvinov]], [[Leonid Krasin]], and [[Alexander Bogdanov]], and executed by a party of revolutionaries led by Stalin's early associate Ter-Petrosian ([[Kamo (Bolshevik)|Kamo]]). Because such activities were explicitly prohibited by the [[5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|5th Congress]] of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), the robbery and the killings caused outrage within the party against the Bolsheviks (a faction within the RSDLP). As a result, Lenin and Stalin tried to distance themselves from the robbery. The events surrounding the incident and similar robberies split the Bolshevik leadership, with Lenin against Bogdanov and Krasin. Despite the success of the robbery and the large sum involved, the Bolsheviks could not use most of the large bank notes obtained from the robbery because their serial numbers were known to the police.  Lenin conceived of a plan to have various individuals cash the large bank notes at once at various locations throughout Europe in January 1908, but this strategy failed, resulting in a number of arrests, worldwide publicity, and negative reaction from European [[social democrats]].

Kamo was caught in [[German Empire|Germany]] shortly after the robbery but successfully avoided a criminal trial by feigning insanity for more than three years. He managed to escape from his psychiatric ward but was captured two years later while planning another robbery.  Kamo was then sentenced to death for his crimes including the 1907 robbery, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment; he was released after the [[1917 Revolution]]. None of the other major participants or organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial. After his death, a grave and monument to Kamo was erected near Yerevan Square in Pushkin Gardens. This monument was later removed, and Kamo's remains moved elsewhere.

== Background ==
[[File:Lenin-1895-mugshot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[mug shot|Police photograph]] of V. I. Lenin from December 1895|alt=A mugshot of a young balding man with a Van Dyke beard.]]

The RSDLP, the predecessor to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], was formed in 1898. The goal of the RSDLP was to carry out a [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[proletarian revolution]] against the [[Russian Empire]].  As part of their revolutionary activity, the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups (such as [[anarchists]] and [[Socialist Revolutionaries]]) practised a range of militant operations, including "expropriations", a euphemism for armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities.{{sfn|Trotsky|1970|loc=Chapter IV: The period of reaction}}{{sfn|Geifman|1993|pp=4, 21–22}}

From 1903 onwards, the RSDLP were divided between two major groups: the [[Bolshevik]]s and the [[Menshevik]]s.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=3–4}} After the suppression of the [[1905 Revolution]] by the Russian Empire, the RSDLP held its [[5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|5th Congress]] in May–June 1907 in [[London]] with the hopes of resolving differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=94}} One issue that still separated the two groups was the divergence of their views on militant activities, and in particular, "expropriations".{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=94}} The most militant Bolsheviks, led at the 5th Congress by [[Vladimir Lenin]], supported continuation of the use of robberies, while Mensheviks advocated a more peaceful and gradual approach to revolution, and opposed militant operations.  At the 5th Congress, a resolution was passed condemning participation in or assistance to all militant activity, including "expropriations" as "disorganizing and demoralizing", and called for all party militias to be disbanded.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=94}} This resolution passed with 65&amp;nbsp;per cent supporting and 6&amp;nbsp;per cent opposing (others abstained or did not vote) with all Mensheviks and even some Bolsheviks supporting the resolution.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}

Despite the unified party's prohibition on separate committees, during the 5th Congress the Bolsheviks elected their own governing body, called the [[Bolshevik Centre]], and kept it secret from the rest of the RSDLP.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} The Bolshevik Centre was headed by a "Finance Group" consisting of Lenin, [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Among other party activities, the Bolshevik leadership had already planned a number of "expropriations" in different parts of Russia by the time of the 5th Congress and was awaiting a major robbery in Tiflis, which occurred only weeks after the 5th Congress ended.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|pp=91–92, 94}}{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=262–263}}

== Preparation ==
Before the 5th Congress met, high-ranking Bolsheviks held a meeting in [[Berlin]] in April 1907 to discuss staging a robbery to obtain funds to purchase arms. Attendees included Lenin, Krasin, Bogdanov, [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Maxim Litvinov]]. The group decided that Stalin, then known by his earlier ''[[nom de guerre]]'' Koba,{{ref label|Note 2|b|b}} and the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Kamo (Bolshevik)|Simon Ter-Petrossian]], known as Kamo, should organize a bank robbery in the city of [[Tiflis]].{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=58}}

The 29-year-old Stalin was living in Tiflis with his wife [[Ekaterina Svanidze|Ekaterina]] and newborn son [[Yakov Dzhugashvili|Yakov]].{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=4–5}} Stalin was experienced at organizing robberies, and these exploits had helped him gain a reputation as the Centre's principal financier.{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=75}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=3–4}} Kamo, four years younger than Stalin, had a reputation for ruthlessness; later in his life he cut a man's heart from his chest.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}} At the time of the conspiracy, Kamo ran a criminal organization called "the Outfit".{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=4}} Stalin said that Kamo was "a master of disguise",{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}} and Lenin called Kamo his "Caucasian bandit".{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}  Stalin and Kamo had grown up together, and Stalin had converted Kamo to [[Marxism]].{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}

After the April meeting, Stalin and Litvinov travelled to Tiflis to inform Kamo of the plans and to organize the raid.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=58}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=165}}  According to Roman Brackman's ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'', while Stalin was working with the Bolsheviks to organize criminal activities, he was also acting as an informant for the [[Okhrana]], the Russian secret police. Brackman alleges that once the group returned to Tiflis, Stalin informed his Okhrana contact, Officer &lt;!-- First name not known? That is correct First name is unknown--&gt;Mukhtarov, about the bank robbery plans and promised to provide the Okhrana with more information at a later time.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=58}}

In Tiflis, Stalin began planning for the robbery.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=58}}  He established contact with two individuals with inside information about the [[State Bank of the Russian Empire|State Bank's]] operations: a bank clerk named Gigo Kasradze and an old school friend of Stalin's named &lt;!--Note; I can't seem to find any source that states the first name of Voznesensky--&gt;Voznesensky who worked at the Tiflis banking mail office.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Kun|2003|pp=77–78}} Voznesensky later stated that he had helped out in the theft out of admiration for Stalin's romantic poetry.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Kun|2003|pp=77–78}} Voznesensky worked in the Tiflis banking mail office, giving him access to a secret schedule that showed the times that cash would be transferred by stagecoach to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=165}} Voznesensky notified Stalin that the bank would be receiving a large shipment of money by horse-drawn carriage on 26 June 1907.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Kun|2003|pp=77–78}}

Krasin helped manufacture bombs to use in the attack on the stagecoach.{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=75}} Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}} Only weeks before the robbery, Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=178}} The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=60}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=231}} Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered by the time of the robbery.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=231}}

== Day of the robbery ==
On the day of the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, including Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 minutes from the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=5}} The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=4}} To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=4}}

The gang members mostly dressed themselves as peasants and waited on street corners with revolvers and grenades.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}} In contrast to the others, Kamo was disguised as a cavalry captain and came to the square in a horse-drawn [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]], a type of open carriage.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}

The conspirators took over the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in preparation for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in Yerevan Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later turned out to be one of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=6–7}}

The Tiflis branch of the [[State Bank of the Russian Empire]] had arranged to transport funds between the [[post office]] and the State Bank by horse-drawn [[stagecoach]].{{sfn|Brackman|2000|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=127}} Inside the stagecoach was the money, two guards with rifles, a bank cashier, and a bank accountant.{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=75}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}} A phaeton filled with armed soldiers rode behind the stagecoach, and mounted cossacks&lt;ref name="Salisbury, Harrison E. 1981 221"&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; rode in front, next to, and behind the carriages.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}

=== Attack ===
[[File:Phaeton (PSF).png|thumb|A typical [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]], as used in the robbery|alt=Drawing of a man holding a whip, sitting on top of an open carriage pulled by two horses.]]

The stagecoach made its way through the crowded square at about 10:30&amp;nbsp;am. Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the carriage with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square.{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=75}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=76}} Bombs were thrown from all directions.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}}{{r|Bombs Kill Many}} The Georgian newspaper ''Isari'' reported: "No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs&amp;nbsp;... The sound caused panic everywhere&amp;nbsp;... almost across the whole city, people started running. Carriages and carts were galloping away".{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=8}}  The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every pane of glass for a mile around.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=227}} [[Ekaterina Svanidze]], Stalin's wife, was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child. When they heard the explosions, they rushed back into the house terrified.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=9}}

One of the injured horses harnessed to the bank stagecoach bolted, pulling the stagecoach with it, chased by Kupriashvili, Kamo, and another robber, Datiko Chibriashvili.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=9}}  Kupriashvili threw a grenade that blew off the horse's legs, but Kupriashvili was caught in the explosion, landing stunned on the ground.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}} He regained consciousness and sneaked out of the square before police and military reinforcements arrived.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}  Chibriashvili snatched the sacks of money from the stagecoach while Kamo rode up firing his pistol,{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} and they and another robber threw the money into Kamo's phaeton.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} Pressed for time, they inadvertently left twenty thousand rubles behind,{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}} some of which was pocketed by one of the stagecoach drivers who was later arrested for the theft.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}

=== Escape and aftermath ===
[[File:Tiflis map (Moskvich guide, 1913)-2.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the 1913 map of Tiflis, highlighting Yerevan Square and adjacent streets]]

After securing the money, Kamo quickly rode out of the square; encountering a police carriage, he pretended to be a captain of the cavalry, shouting, "The money's safe. Run to the square."{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} The deputy in the carriage obeyed, realizing only later that he had been fooled by an escaping robber.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} Kamo then rode to the gang's headquarters where he changed out of his uniform.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} All of the robbers quickly scattered, and none were caught.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}

One of the robbers, Eliso Lominadze, stole a teacher's uniform to disguise himself and came back to the square, gazing at the carnage.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} Fifty casualties lay wounded in the square along with the dead people and horses.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{r|Bombs Kill Many}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} The authorities stated that only three people had died, but documents in the Okhrana archives reveal that the true number was around forty.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}}

The State Bank was not sure how much it actually lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], worth around 3.4&amp;nbsp;million [[US dollars]] as of 2008.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial numbers were known to the police.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}}

=== Stalin's role ===
[[File:Stalin's Mug Shot.jpg|left|thumb|The information card on "I. V. Stalin", from the files of the Tsarist secret police in Saint Petersburg, 1911|alt=Set of three photographs and a filled form, all profiling a man with a thick mustache and dark hair, dressed in a hat, black overcoat, white shirt, black pants and black shoes.]]

Stalin's exact actions on the day of the robbery are unknown and disputed.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}} One source, P. A. Pavlenko, claimed that Stalin attacked the carriage itself and had been wounded by a bomb fragment.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=11}} Kamo later stated that Stalin took no active part in the robbery and had watched it from a distance.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} Another source stated in a police report that Stalin "observed the ruthless bloodshed, smoking a cigarette, from the courtyard of a mansion."{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} Another source claims that Stalin was actually at the railway station during the robbery and not at the square.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} Stalin's sister-in-law stated that Stalin came home the night of the robbery and told his family about its success.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}}

Stalin's role was later questioned by fellow revolutionaries [[Boris Nicolaevsky]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]. The latter, Stalin's rival, [[Assassination of Leon Trotsky|was later assassinated]] on orders from Stalin. In his book ''Stalin&amp;nbsp;– An Appraisal of the Man and his Influence'', Trotsky analyzed many publications describing the Tiflis expropriation and other Bolshevik militant activities of that time, and concluded, "Others did the fighting; Stalin supervised them from afar".{{sfn|Trotsky|1970|loc=Chapter IV: The period of reaction}} In general, according to Nicolaevsky, "The role played by Stalin in the activities of the Kamo group was subsequently exaggerated".{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} Kun later discovered official archive documents however clearly showing that "from late 1904 or early 1905 Stalin took part in drawing up plans for expropriations", adding, "It is now certain that [Stalin] controlled from the wings the initial plans of the group" that carried out the Tiflis robbery.{{sfn|Kun|2003|pp=73–75}}

== Security response and investigation ==

Schmerling, 1906).jpg|thumb|"Necessary equipment for money transfer", a caricature by Oscar Schmerling from the Georgian press, 1906|alt=A cartoon of a man dressed in an iron suit, wearing a black top hat with a lockbox chained to his neck, getting into a horse-drawn carriage made out of metal and covered with spikes and cannons.]]

The robbery featured in headlines worldwide: "Rain of Bombs: Revolutionaries Hurl Destruction among Large Crowds of People" in the London ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', "Tiflis Bomb Outrage" in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, "Catastrophe!" in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'' in Paris, and "Bomb Kills Many; $170,000 Captured" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{r|Bombs Kill Many}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}

Authorities mobilized the army, closed roads, and surrounded the square hoping to secure the money and capture the criminals.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}} A special detective unit was brought in to lead the police investigation.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{r|Bombs Kill Many}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}  Unfortunately for the investigators, witness testimony was confusing and conflicting,{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}} and the authorities did not know which group was responsible for the robbery. [[Polish Socialist Party|Polish socialists]], [[Armenians]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionaries]], and even the [[Russian Empire|Russian State]] itself were blamed.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=13}}

According to Brackman, several days after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov questioned Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin in the face and had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to [[Baku]] to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000&amp;nbsp;rubles in stolen money in July 1907.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}} While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his [[Early life of Joseph Stalin|early life]] has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.{{r|Felshtinsky-Okhrana}}

== Moving the money and Kamo's arrest ==
The funds from the robbery were originally kept at the house of Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=12}} The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|pp=14, 87}} The mattress was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory,{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} possibly because Stalin had worked there.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}} The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=14}}

A large portion of the stolen money was eventually moved by Kamo, who took the money to Lenin in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Kamo spent the remaining summer months staying with Lenin at his [[dacha]].  That autumn, Kamo traveled to Paris, to [[Belgium]] to buy arms and ammunition, and to [[Bulgaria]] to buy 200&amp;nbsp;detonators.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=60}} He next traveled to Berlin and delivered a letter from Lenin to a prominent Bolshevik physician, [[Jacob Zhitomirsky|Yakov Zhitomirsky]], asking him to treat Kamo's eye, which had not completely healed from the bomb blast.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=60}} Unknown to Lenin, Zhitomirsky had been secretly working as an agent of the Russian government and quickly informed the [[Okhrana]],{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=60}} who asked the Berlin police to arrest Kamo.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=60}} When they did so, they found a forged Austrian passport and a suitcase with the detonators, which he was planning to use in another large bank robbery.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=61}}

== Cashing the marked notes ==
[[File:Maxim Litvinov 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maxim Litvinov]] in 1902]]

After hearing of Kamo's arrest, Lenin feared that he too might be arrested and fled from [[Finland]] with his wife.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}} To avoid being followed, Lenin walked three miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across a frozen lake at night to catch a steamer at a nearby island.{{r|Krupskaya, Again Abroad}} On his trek across the ice, Lenin and his two companions nearly drowned when the ice started to give way underneath them; Lenin later admitted it seemed like it would have been a "stupid way to die".{{r|Krupskaya, Again Abroad}}  Lenin and his wife escaped and headed to Switzerland.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}}{{r|Krupskaya, Again Abroad}}

The unmarked bills from the robbery were easy to exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them impossible to exchange in Russian banks.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=59}} By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}} Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=181}} Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in [[Repino|Kuokkala]]).{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously at a number of banks throughout Europe.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}} Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana,{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}} who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=62}}

In January 1908, a number of individuals were arrested while attempting to exchange the notes.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=64}}{{r|Held as Tiflis Robbers}} ''The New York Times'' reported that one woman who had tried to cash a marked 500-ruble note later tried to swallow evidence of her plans to meet her accomplices after the police were summoned, but the police stopped her from swallowing the paper by grabbing her throat, retrieved the paper, and later arrested her accomplices at the train station.{{r|Held as Tiflis Robbers}} Most prominent among those arrested was Maxim Litvinov, caught while boarding a train with his mistress at Paris's [[Gare du Nord]] with twelve of the 500-ruble notes he intended to cash in London.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|pp=63–64}}{{r|Nihilists}} The [[French Minister of Justice]] expelled Litvinov and his mistress from French territory, outraging the Russian government, which had requested his extradition.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|pp=63–64}}  Officially the French government stated that Russia's request for extradition had been submitted too late, but by some accounts, they denied the extradition because French socialists had applied political pressure to secure his release.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|pp=63–64}}

[[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], Lenin's wife, discussed these events in her memoirs:

{{quote |text=
The money obtained in the Tiflis raid was handed over to the Bolsheviks for revolutionary purposes. But the money could not be used. It was all in 500-ruble notes, which had to be changed. This could not be done in Russia, as the banks always had lists of the note numbers in such cases&amp;nbsp;...The money was badly needed. And so a group of comrades made an attempt to change the 500-ruble notes simultaneously in various towns abroad, just a few days after our arrival&amp;nbsp;... Zhitomirsky had warned the police about the attempt to change the ruble notes, and those involved in it were arrested. A member of the Zurich group, a Lett, was arrested in Stockholm, and Olga Ravich, a member of the Geneva group, who had recently returned from Russia, was arrested in Munich with Bogdassarian and Khojamirian. In Geneva [[Nikolai Semashko (medicine)|Nikolai Semashko]] was arrested after a postcard addressed to one of the arrested men was delivered to his house.{{r|Krupskaya, Years of Reaction}}
}}

Brackman claims that despite the arrests, Lenin continued his attempts to exchange the 500-ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=64}} According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests,{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}{{r|Paris – 1909–1910}}

== Trials of Kamo ==
{{quote |text=
[R]esigned to death, absolutely calm.  On my grave there should already be grass growing six feet high. One can't escape death forever. One must die some day. But I will try my luck again. Try any way of escape. Perhaps we shall once more have the laugh over our enemies&amp;nbsp;... I am in irons. Do what you like.  I am ready for anything."
|source=Note from Kamo to a fellow prisoner in 1912 while awaiting the death penalty.{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=103}}
}}[[File:Krasin Baku c 1903.jpg|left|thumb|197x197px|[[Leonid Krasin]] around 1903]]After Kamo was arrested in Berlin and awaiting trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity so that he would be declared unfit to stand trial.{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=101}} To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and ate his own excrement.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=55}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|pp=101–102}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=234}} To make sure that he was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a long needle, and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act.{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|pp=101–102}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|pp=236–237}} After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that "there is no foundation to the belief that [Kamo] is feigning insanity.  He is without doubt mentally ill, is incapable of appearing before a court, or of serving sentence. It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover."{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=237}}

In 1909 Kamo was extradited to a Russian prison, where he continued to feign insanity.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=102}} In April 1910, he was put on trial for his role in the Tiflis robbery,{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=238}} where he ignored the proceedings and openly fed a pet bird that he had hidden in his shirt.{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=238}} The trial was suspended while officials determined his sanity.{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=238}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|pp=57–58}}  The court eventually found that he had been sane when he committed the Tiflis robbery, but was presently mentally ill and should be confined until he recovered.{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=239}} In August 1911, after feigning insanity for more than three years, Kamo escaped from the psychiatric ward of a prison in Tiflis by sawing through his window bars and climbing down a homemade rope.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=102}}{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=67}}

Kamo later discussed these experiences:

{{quote |text=
What can I tell you?  They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like.  One of the men forced me to look into the mirror.  There I saw−not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth.  I thought to myself, "Maybe I've really gone mad!" It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror.  You know I think they liked that&amp;nbsp;... I thought a great deal: "Will I survive or will I really go mad?" That was not good.  I did not have faith in myself, see?&amp;nbsp;... [The authorities], of course, know their business, their science.  But they do not know the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]].  Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned.  Well, who will drive whom mad?  Nothing developed.  They stuck to their guns and I to mine.  In Tiflis, they didn't torture me.  Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes.{{sfn|Shub|1960|pp=246–247}}
}}
After escaping, Kamo met up with Lenin in Paris,{{r|Paris – 1909–1910}} and was distressed to hear that a "rupture had occurred"{{r|Paris – 1909–1910}} between Lenin, Bogdanov, and Krasin.{{r|Paris – 1909–1910}} Kamo told Lenin about his arrest and how he had simulated insanity while in prison.{{r|Paris – 1909–1910}}  After leaving Paris, Kamo eventually met up with Krasin and planned another armed robbery.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}} Kamo was caught before the robbery took place and was put on trial in Tiflis in 1913 for his exploits including the Tiflis bank robbery.{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=103}}{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=244}} This time, Kamo did not feign insanity while imprisoned, but he did pretend that he had forgotten all that happened to him when he was previously "insane".{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=244}} The trial was brief and Kamo was given four death sentences.{{sfn|Shub|1960|pp=244–245}}

Seemingly doomed to death, Kamo then had the good luck along with other prisoners to have his sentence commuted to a long prison term as part of the celebrations of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] tricentennial in 1913.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=245}} Kamo was released from prison after the [[February Revolution]] in 1917.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=246}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Effect on Bolsheviks ===
Apart from Kamo, none of the organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial,{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=15}} and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} The leader of the Mensheviks, [[Georgi Plekhanov]], called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, [[Julius Martov]], said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Souvarine|2005|p=99}} The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}[[File:Tavisupleba square. Monument of St. George.jpg|thumb|Freedom Square, Tbilisi (called Tiflis at the time of the robbery) in 2007|alt=A city square; at center is a large pillar with a golden statue on top; in the background is a large building with a steeple.]]

The robbery made the Bolsheviks even less popular in Georgia and left the Bolsheviks in Tiflis without effective leadership. After the death by natural causes of his wife Ekaterina Svanidze in November 1907, Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis. Other leading Bolsheviks in Georgia, such as [[Mikhail Tskhakaya]] and [[Filipp Makharadze]], were largely absent from Georgia after 1907. Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik, [[Stepan Shahumyan]], moved to [[Baku]]. The Bolsheviks' popularity in Tiflis continued to fall, and by 1911, there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city.{{sfn|Jones|2005|pp=220–221}}

The robbery also made the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} Lenin's desire to distance himself from the legacy of the robbery may have been one of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}} Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Kun|2003|p=77}}

=== Later careers ===
After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1917]], many of the Bolsheviks who had been involved in the robbery gained political power in the new [[Soviet Union]]. Lenin went on to become its first [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|premier]] until his death in 1924, followed by Stalin until his death in 1953. Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat, serving as [[Ministry of External Relations (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] (1930–1939). Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909, but rejoined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution and served as the Soviet trade representative in London and as People's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926.{{sfn|Nicolaevsky|1995}}

After Kamo's release from prison, he worked in the Soviet customs office, by some accounts because he was too unstable to work for the [[secret police]].{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}} He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling.{{sfn|Ulam|1998|pp=279–280}} Although there is no proof of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=370}}

Bogdanov was expelled from the party in 1909, ostensibly over philosophical differences. After the Bolshevik Revolution, he became the leading ideologist of [[Proletkult]], an organization designed to foster a new [[proletarian culture]].

=== Monument ===
Yerevan Square, where the robbery took place, was renamed [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Lenin Square]] by the Soviet authorities in 1921, and a large statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956.{{sfn|Burford|2008|p=113}}{{r|Sydney}} Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens, near Yerevan Square.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=15}}{{r|USSR Information Bulletin}} Created by the sculptor [[Iakob Nikoladze]], it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were moved to another location.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=370}} The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|final moments of the Soviet Union]]—and replaced by the [[Freedom Monument (Tbilisi)|Liberty Monument]] in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.{{sfn|Burford|2008|p=113}}{{r|Fell}}

== Notes ==
* {{note label|Note 1|a|a}} Sources give the date of the robbery as either 13 June 1907{{sfn|Brackman|2000|p=58}}{{sfn|Shub|1960|p=227}} or 26 June 1907,{{r|Bombs Kill Many}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=3}} depending on whether [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] or New Style [[Gregorian calendar]] dates are used. The Russian government used the Julian calendar until February 1918 when it switched to the Gregorian calendar by skipping thirteen days in that year so that 1 February 1918 was followed by 15 February 1918.{{sfn|Christian|1997|p=6}} For purposes of this article, dates are provided according to Gregorian calendar dates.
* {{note label|Note 2|b|b}} Joseph Stalin used a variety of names during his lifetime. His original Georgian name was "Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili", but his friends and family called him "Soso".{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=xxxi}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=23}} During his early revolutionary years, which would include the years of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery, he mostly went by the revolutionary [[nom de guerre]] "Koba", which he obtained from a character in [[Alexander Kazbegi|Alexander Kazbegi's]] novel ''[[The Patricide]]''.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=xxxi}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=63}} He published poetry under the name "Soselo".{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=xxxi}} In 1912, he began to use the name Stalin and later adopted this as his surname after October 1917.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=xxxi}} The name Stalin is translated to mean "Man of [[Steel]]."{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=xxxi}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2008|p=268}} This article uses the name by which he is most commonly known to the world, "Joseph Stalin", for clarity.

'''African immigration to Norway''' refers to [[Immigration|immigrants]] to [[Norway]] from [[Africa]]. An estimated 88,764 people in Norway are either first or second generation immigrants from Africa.&lt;ref name="Statnorpim"/&gt;

==Distribution==
===North and Northeast Africans===
Immigration from countries in Africa to Norway grew slightly from the end of the 1980s, but grew markedly from 2000 onwards. The growth is owed mainly to a rise in the number of immigrants from North and Northeast Africa, including [[Somalis in Norway|Somalia]] (25,496), [[Moroccans in Norway|Morocco]] (8,058), [[Eritreans in Norway|Eritrea]] (5,789) and [[Ethiopians in Norway|Ethiopia]] (5,156).&lt;ref name="Statnor2010"/&gt;

===Other Africans===
Compared to North and Northeast Africans, the percentage of Africans from other regions as a proportion of recent immigrants to Norway from Africa is relatively low.

Most other Africans in Norway come from [[West Africa]], especially [[Ghana]] (2,034), [[Gambia]] (1,409) and [[Nigeria]] (1,247).&lt;ref name="Statnor2010"/&gt; There is also a sizeable population of Africans from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (2,050).

==Demographics==
===Country of origin===
Most African Norwegians have a background from the following countries:

{{Main|Age of consent reform}}

Since the 1970s, a number of movements have taken place in the [[United Kingdom]] in favour of reforming or abolishing the [[age of consent]], in support of [[children's rights]], [[gay liberation]]ism or, more recently, "as a means to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and [[sexually transmitted infections]] via education and health promotion".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew.

New York/London: Palgrave MacMillan. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-2173-4}}. {{ISBN|1-4039-2173-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waites&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Waites|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-age-of-consent-matthew-waites/?K=9781403921734|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-23718-6}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=kLhhPwAACAAJ Google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1275, the first age of consent was set in [[England]], at age 12 (Westminster 1 statute).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robertson, Stephen|title=Age of Consent Laws|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230|website=Children and Youth in History|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|location=[[Sydney]], [[Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, the [[Offences against the Person Act 1875|Offences Against the Person Act]] raised the age to 13 in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]], and ten years later the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885]] raised it to 16.&lt;ref name="Odem1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary E. Odem|title=Delinquent Daughters: Protecting and Policing Adolescent Female Sexuality in the United States, 1885-1920 (Gender and American Culture) |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Rng2oOq1Ep8C |page=13 }} |year=1995|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4528-8|page=13|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Swarbrick |url=http://www.swarb.co.uk/acts/1885Criminal_Law_AmendmentAct.shtml |title=Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (-) |publisher=swarb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, a bill raising the age of consent in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] from 16 to 17 was defeated by only one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age of consent: A response to the consultation on the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2007|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/wp-content/downloads/age-of-consent.pdf|publisher=[[Christian Institute]]|accessdate=9 November 2015|location=[[Northern Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]]|format=PDF|ISBN=978-1-901086-39-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] passed the [[Children and Young Persons Act (Norther Ireland)|Children and Young Persons Act]], which successfully raised the age of consent to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldmerit/109/10907.htm|title=House of Lords - Merits of Statutory Instruments - Nineteenth Report|author=|date=|work=parliament.uk|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2008 this enactment was reversed by the British government in the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008, which made the age of consent in Northern Ireland 16, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110800936_en_1 |title=The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216064745/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110800936_en_1 |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given for this Order being made was to bring the age of consent into line with the rest of the United Kingdon. The Criminal Justice Minister, [[Paul Goggins]], said there was no compelling reason for the age to be different in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7104052.stm | work=BBC News | title=NI age of consent to be lowered | date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of consent in [[Ireland]] is 17,&lt;ref name="irlcitiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_offences/law_on_sex_offences_in_ireland.html|title=The law on sexual offences in Ireland|work=Citizens Information|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=12 June 2013|location=Dublin, Ireland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628040525/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_offences/law_on_sex_offences_in_ireland.html|archivedate=28 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to vaginal, oral, or anal sex, and vaginal or anal penetration.&lt;ref name="irlact2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0015/print.html |title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 |date=2 June 2006 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives it one of the highest ages of consent in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=ODwyer&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/the-age-of-consent-debate-where-does-ireland-stand-264694.html|title="The age of consent debate: Where does Ireland stand?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the sexual offences legislation in Ireland, a girl under 17 cannot be prosecuted for engaging in sexual intercourse, even if her partner is younger. For example, a girl is 16 and a boy is 13; she is immune from criminal charges, but a 16-year-old boy having sex with a 13-year-old girl would result in jail and registration as a sex offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/15/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] age of consent in the [[United Kingdom]] was set at 21 in the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|Sexual Offences Act of 1967]] (following the recommendations of the [[Wolfenden Report]]), then lowered to 18 in the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], and finally lowered to 16 in [[England]] and [[Scotland]] in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1047291.stm |title=Gay consent at 16 becomes law |author= |date=November 20, 2000 |work=BBC News |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the [[age of consent]] for [[penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]] and [[mutual masturbation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] is 16 years. If any individual has sex with someone under this age, then he or she may be charged with a criminal offence and may receive a 14-year prison sentence or if they are under 18 a 5-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age Of Consent|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4hPrqzTRSBvvzHkTckNYNZ5/age-of-consent|website=BBC Radio 1|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2000]] prohibits a person in a [[position of trust]] from performing sexual acts with someone who cannot consent, which includes minors and "very vulnerable people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/documents/UnderstandingSexualOffencesReform.htm |title=understanding sexual offence reform |publisher=Jubilee-centre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily used for the protection of those who are above the age of consent but under the age of 18, or who have [[mental disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanatory Notes to Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/44/notes|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html G.R.

==Religious groups==

In April 1972, the Society of Friends Social Responsibility Council (a [[Quaker]] conference), passed a resolution in favour of lowering the age of consent in Britain from 16 to 14.&lt;ref name="Waites, Matthew 2005, p.132"&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p.132).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quakers make 13 age of consent", ''Sunday Express'', 16 April 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, [[Dr. John Robinson]], Dean of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and chair of the UK's Sexual Law Reform Society, defended an age of consent of 14 in a lecture at a [[Methodist]] Conference.&lt;ref name="Waites, Matthew 2005, p.132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Robinson puts case for age of consent to be 14", ''The Times'', 6 July 1972; "Consent to what?", editorial, New Law Journal, vol. 122, no. 5554, 13 July 1972, pp.621-622.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political parties and advocacy groups==

In May 1974, the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] suggested a basic age of consent of 16, but that could be as low as 12 "in cases where a defendant could prove the existence of meaningful consent".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., pp. 132 and 243, Note 6.6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay News, no. 46, 9 May 1974, p.3 – 'CHE Report angers reformers'.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sexual Law Reform Society'' proposed in September of that year lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18 the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., p.132).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1976, the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]] (NCCL), called for an equal age of consent of 14, or 10, in Britain.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Rowena |title=Harman v Daily Mail: claims and counterclaims over NCCL's link to PIE |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/25/harriet-harman-daily-mail-argument-nccl-link-pie |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The submission to the Criminal Law Revision Committee generated extensive newspaper coverage. While the report recognised the merits of abolishing the age of consent, it proposed retaining a prohibition on sex under the age of 14 "as a compromise with public attitudes",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p.135-136). The age of consent – Young people, Sexuality and Citizenship. New York/London: Palgrave MacMillan. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-2173-4}}. {{ISBN|1-4039-2173-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "although it is both logical and consistent with modern knowledge about child development, to suggest that the age of consent should be abolished, we fear that, given the present state of public attitudes on this topic, it will not be politically possible to abolish the age of consent".&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Offences: Evidence to the Criminal Law Revision Committee, NCCL report no. 13, February 1976, p.6. (London: National Council for Civil Liberties).&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that "childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage" and suggested that more harm was caused when the children retold their experiences in court or to the press. The submission was signed by [[Harriet Harman]], who later became [[leader of the House of Commons]] and deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Harriet Harman under attack over bid to water down child pornography law | date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman denies ever supporting the age of consent being lowered to 10.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

In 2000 a committee of twelve teenage girls, set up to advise the UK government on youth issues, recommended that the age of consent be reduced to 12. The website from which the group was recruited conducted a poll of 42,000 girls between the ages of 12 and 16 on the age of consent; 87% agreed that it should be lowered from 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1376140/Girls-say-teenage-sex-campaign-is-out-of-touch.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nicole | last=Martin | title=Girls say teenage sex campaign is 'out of touch' | date=29 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2000/12/29/183175.html|title=Sarah's chance to air seriously 'wicked' views|accessdate=31 October 2015|work=The Northern Echo|date=29 December 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617063002/http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2000/12/29/183175.html|archivedate=17 June 2009|quote=A North-East teenager has been chosen to represent the region on a national board which looks at the important issues affecting teenage girls.

==Contemporary context==
Contemporary arguments for lowering the age of consent in the United Kingdom do not necessarily comprise values like individual freedom or [[children's rights]]. Specifically, they tend to focus on a pragmatic analysis of a new situation, including puberty at earlier ages, a higher proportion of young people sexually active below the age of consent and a trend to negotiate sexual behavior in secrecy in certain age groups.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew. (2005, pp. 212-214 and 220).&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Matthew Waites, author of ''The age of Consent – Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship'', observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the mid-1970s the case for a lower minimum age for all was finding wider support, with questions being posed concerning the merits of lowering the legal age for male/female sexual behaviour – not only within [[Sexual revolution|grassroots sexual movements]], but also within religious organisations and [[Liberalism|liberal]] intellectual circles. [...] Significant sections of liberal opinion in the political mainstream, including prominent campaigners for children’s interests and sexual health, support at least some selective decriminalisation of sexual activity between young people under 18.&lt;ref name=Waites /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More generally in academic work, particularly in [[sociology]], recent writing on [[human sexual behaviour]] from various perspectives has questioned the extent of prohibitions on sexual activity involving children.&lt;ref name=Waites&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., pp. 132-133, 220)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2010, on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Sunday Morning Live (BBC)|Sunday Morning Live]]'' program, the viewing public was asked for their [[Text messaging|text]] poll, "Should the age of consent be lowered to 13?" At the end of the program it was announced that 16% voted yes and 84% voted no.&lt;ref name=BBC_SML001 &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhknx |title= Sunday Morning Live - Episode 14 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=17 Oct 2010 |accessdate=17 Oct 2010  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101017083931/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhknx| archivedate= 17 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to lower the age of consent to 15 from the Faculty of Public Health president, Professor [[John Ashton (public health director)|John Ashton]], were rejected by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM rejects call to lower age of consent to 15|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24976929|accessdate=31 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=17 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504183719/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24976929|archivedate=4 May 2015|deadurl=no|quote=The prime minister has rejected a call from a leading expert on public health to lower the age of consent to 15.

===Research===

Research by [[Jean Golding]] shows that [[puberty]] is occurring earlier than in the 1970s, with an average age of [[menarche]] in girls now at 12 years and 10 months,&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew. (2005, p. 212).&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the average age of 14 for puberty in general that was accepted as evidence by the Policy Advisory Committee of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The UK’s Policy Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences was created in December 1975, by Roy Jenkins, then Home Secretary of the British government, with the specific task of examining the law on the age of consent. Sources: Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., p.133); Policy Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences (PAC, June 1979, p. iii) – Working Party on the Age of Consent in Relation to Sexual Offences (London:HMSO).&lt;/ref&gt; Golding's research has found that "one girl in six hits puberty at the age of eight".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew. (2005, pp. 212 and 246, Note 9.1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘One girl in six hits puberty by age of eight’, The Observer, 18 June 2000, pp.1-2; ‘Too much too young’, The Observer, 18 June 2000, Review, pp.1, 4; ‘Sex from 8 to 18’, UK’s Channel Four, Tuesday 27 June 2000, 9 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent British research conducted by the Centre for Family and Household Research, "an increasing proportion of young people are sexually active below the age of consent".&lt;ref&gt;Wertheimer, A. and Macrae, S. (1999, p.19). Family and Household Change in Britain: A Summary of Findings from Projects in the Economic and Social Research Council Population and Household Change Programme (Oxford: Centre for Family and Household Research, Oxford Brookes University). Cited by Waites, Matthew (2005, p.214).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK's first [[National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles]] (NATSAL), which collected data up to 1990, found that a high proportion of young people engage in other forms of sexual activity prohibited by the law, including mutual masturbation and oral sex, beginning on average at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A.M.; Wadsworth, J.; Wellings, K.; and Field, J. with Bradshaw, S. (1994) – Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications). Cited by Waites, Matthew (2005, p.214).&lt;/ref&gt;

Waites also observed that "qualitative research reveals a picture of many young people negotiating sexual behaviour in a context of secrecy, constrained by power relationships while lacking confidence, resources and support".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew. (2005, p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J.; Ramazanoglu, C.; Sharpe, S.; and Thomson, R. (1998) – The Male in the Head: Young People, Heterosexuality and Power (London: Tufnell Press). Cited by Waites, Matthew (2005, p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "It is argued by some sexual health professionals that the age of consent should be lowered [...] to facilitate more effective support from health and education services".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authors===
[[Peter Tatchell]], British gay activist and author, has defended an age of consent of 14 in Britain since the mid-1990s, repeating the arguments presented in the 1970s by the NCCL and the Sexual Law Reform Society. He cited [[Romeo and Juliet]], aged 14 and 13, as "one of the greatest love stories of all time".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, pp. 220 and 222).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatchell, Peter (1996) – "Is Fourteen Too Young for Sex?", Gay Times, June, pp. 36-38; Tatchell, Peter (2002) – "Why the Age of Consent in Britain Should be Lowered to Fourteen", Legal Notes 38 (London: Libertarian Alliance).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he does not favour total abolition, [[Francis Bennion]], a British liberal humanist also influenced by the historical context of the issue, emphasised the fact that children are "sexual beings", concluding that this in itself makes legal prohibitions unfair.&lt;ref&gt;Bennion, Francis (2003, p.13) – Sexual Ethics and Criminal Law: A Critique of the Sexual Offences Bill 2003 (Oxford: Lester Publishing). Cited by Waites, Matthew (2005, p.220 and 222).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miranda Sawyer]], British journalist specialised in music and youth culture, suggested that "we have sexual feelings from a very early age", considering that sex is "natural behaviour". She favoured lowering the age of consent to 12 in the UK while labeling the criminalisation of sexual activity under the age of 16 as "laughably unrealistic".&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Miranda (2003). ‘Sex is not Just for Grown-ups’, The Observer, Review section, 2 November, pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anwar Iqbal Baloch''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''انور اقبال'''}}}}) is a veteran Pakistani television actor and director,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/117478-A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2111053/bio&lt;/ref&gt; who got fame with the hit Pakistani drama series "Shama" and later with the historic epic series "Akhri Chattan" (آخری چٹان)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7179038-akhri-chattan
&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Naseem Hijazi]] in the early 80's. He is a son of a well-known politician from [[Balochistan]], Mr. [[Haji Muhammed Iqbal Baloch]], who played prominent role in the independence of Pakistan as well as in highlighting the importance of "Gawadar" port to the Pakistani government.&lt;ref&gt;http://visiongwadar.com/historical-perspective/&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the production of the [[Balochi cinema|first Balochi feature film]], ''Hammal o Mahganj'' in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/117478-A&lt;/ref&gt;

Iqbal completed his Masters from [[University of Karachi]] and commenced his career in 1976 with the production (and acting in) "Hammal o Mahganj". He went on to produce three years later the Sindhi drama "Dosten jo Piar", but he got his real breakthrough with the popular family drama series ''Shama'', which became a widespread success and household name throughout the nation in late 70's and early 80's. He cites his initial success on the silver screen as a result of encouragement by the famous Pakistani writer [[Fatima Surayya Bajia]] and veteran director and producer [[Qasim Jalali]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/637796&lt;/ref&gt; He rapidly emerged as a prominent actor with his memorable role in Shama as "Nana ki Jan Qamru (The beloved grandson of Qamar)". His debut as a director began with the Drama "Ishq Pecha" in 1984. Since then, he has acted in countless Urdu and Sindhi drama's and directed a few. He is also a popular teacher, teaching at a private school and working with a private TV channel.

He is particularly noted for his historic epic roles, for which he has been appreciated by, among others, the veteran PTV director [[Agha Nasir]] for his impressive depiction of the historic character "Shiwani Khan ([[Muhammad Shaybani]]" in the PTV Series "Babur" (life story of the first Mogul emperor [[Babur]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X5RsEvqtts&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}
'''Aristocracy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία ''aristokratía'', from  ἄριστος ''[[Wikt:aristocrat#English|aristos]]'' "excellent", and κράτος, kratos 'rule') is a [[form of government]] that places strength in the hands of a small, privileged [[ruling class]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1989 |title=Aristocracy |trans-title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022358/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''aristokratia'', meaning "rule of the best-born".&lt;ref&gt;''A Greek–English Lexicon'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, Roderick McKenzie (editors). "ἀριστο-κρᾰτία, ἡ,
A, rule of the best-born, aristocracy, ἀ. σώφρων Th.3.82, cf. Henioch.5.17, Isyll.1, etc.; rule of the rich, Pl.Plt.301a. II ideal constitution, rule of the best, Arist. Pol.1293b1 sqq., EN1160a33, Pl.Mx.238c, 238d, Plb.6.4.3." http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B1 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to British History'', John Cannon (Editor), Oxford University Press, 1962, {{ISBN|978-0-19-866176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The term is synonymous with [[hereditary government]], and hereditary succession is its primary philosophy, after which the hereditary monarch appoints officers as they see fit. At the time of the word's origins in [[ancient Greece]], the Greeks conceived it as rule by the best qualified citizens—and often contrasted it favourably with [[monarchy]], rule by an individual. In later times, aristocracy was usually seen as rule by a privileged group, the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic class]], and has since been contrasted with [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The idea of hybrid forms which have aspects of both aristocracy and democracy are in use in the [[parliament]] form.

== Concept ==
The concept evolved in Ancient Greece, whereby a council of leading citizens was commonly empowered and contrasted with [[representative democracy]], in which a council of citizens was appointed as the "senate" of a [[city state]] or other political unit. The Greeks did not like the concept of monarchy, and as their democratic system fell, aristocracy was upheld.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;
In the 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', [[Thomas Hobbes]] describes an aristocracy as a commonwealth in which the representative of the citizens is an assembly by part only. It is a system in which only a small part of the population represents the government; "certaine men distinguished from the rest".&lt;ref name="Hobbes2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hobbes|title=Leviathan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKLPStfcpjoC&amp;pg=PA81|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Digireads.com Publishing|isbn=978-1-4209-3699-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern depictions of aristocracy tend to regard it not as the ancient Greek concept of rule by the best, but more as an [[oligarchy]] or [[plutocracy]]—rule by the few or the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The concept of aristocracy per [[Plato]], has an ideal state ruled by the philosopher king. Plato describes these "philosopher kings" as "those who love the sight of truth" ([[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 475c) and supports the idea with the analogy of a captain and his ship or a doctor and his medicine. According to him, sailing and health are not things that everyone is qualified to practice by nature. A large part of the Republic then addresses how the educational system should be set up to produce these philosopher kings.

'''Bailey's Beach''' (officially named and owned by the '''Spouting Rock Beach Association''') is an elite private beach and club in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

==History==
According to the ''Providence Journal'', Bailey's Beach in Newport Rhode Island was

&lt;blockquote&gt;founded in the 1890s after new trolley service gave mill workers from Fall River ready access to Easton's Beach, a wide expanse closer to downtown Newport that the well-to-do had claimed as their own. Not wishing to associate with people who took their lunches in buckets, high society relocated several miles to Spouting Rock, smaller and often seaweedy but safely beyond the reach of trolleys. Today, approximately 500 families belong, and for the most part, new members are added only when old ones die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/specials/newportsummer/chapter1.htm "The Grande Dame"], Chapter 1, 7/2/2000, ''[[The Providence Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Spouting Rock Beach Association, named for a geological formation, and membership in it tends to define summer life here in ways that are sometimes difficult to comprehend, even for insiders.&lt;ref&gt;GUY TREBAY, "SUMMER PLACES; At Bailey's Beach, The Ruling Class Keeps Its Guard Up," Published: Sunday, July 20, 2003[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/style/summer-places-at-bailey-s-beach-the-ruling-class-keeps-its-guard-up.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organization has attracted notable members of nearby families such as the [[Vanderbilt family]], and the [[Astor family]]. The [[1938 Hurricane]] destroyed the original [[wikt:clubhouse|clubhouse]], and the current clubhouse and [[cabana (structure)|cabanas]] appear relatively modest to passersby. Bailey's Beach was one of the centers of elite Newport social life along with other institutions such as the [[Redwood Library]], [[Newport Country Club]], [[Trinity Church (Newport)|Trinity Church]], [[Clambake Club]], [[Newport Reading Room]], [[New York Yacht Club]] summer clubhouse and the [[Newport Casino]]. Despite the exclusive status of the beach club and membership, the northeast end of the beach is open to the public and known colloquially as Reject's Beach.

'''Bankan Tey Dogon''', at first called '''Walo-Kumbe Dogon''' after the two main villages it is spoken in, also known as '''Walo''' and '''Walonkore''', is a divergent, recently described [[Dogon language]] spoken in [[Mali]]. It was first reported online by Roger Blench,[https://web.archive.org/web/20130615111624/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Dogon/Dogon%20page.htm] who reports that it is "clearly related to [[Nanga Dogon|Nanga]]", which is only known from one report from 1953.

A third village investigated at the time, Been, speaks a related but lexically distinct form, [[Ben Tey Dogon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">The '''Bilala''' or '''Bulala''' are a Muslim people that live around [[Lake Fitri]], in the [[Batha Prefecture]], in central [[Chad]]. The last Chadian [[census]] in 1993 stated that they numbered 136,629 persons. Their language, [[Naba language|Naba]], is divided in four dialects and is in the [[Nilo-Saharan]] group; it is shared by two of their neighbours, the [[Kuka people|Kuka]] and the [[Medogo]]. These three peoples are collectively known as [[Lisi people|Lisi]] and are believed to be descendants of main ethnic groups of the [[Sultan]]ate of [[Yao, Chad|Yao]].

They first appeared in the 14th century near lake Fitri as a [[nomad]]ic clan led by scions of the [[Sayfawa dynasty]]. They were originally a political entity that came about as a result of fusion of the Kayi (old Zaghawa = current Kanembu, the clan exist even today in Kanem) and [[Ngizim people|Ngizim]]is Kanembu clan, which exists event today in Dibbinintchi, [[Lake Tchad]] inhabitants of the Fittri region.&lt;ref&gt;^  H. R. Palmer "History of the first twelve years of the reign of Mai Idris Alooma of Bornu (1571-1583), by his Imam Ahmed Bin Furtua"&lt;/ref&gt; Settled east of the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Kanem Empire]], in today's [[Chad]], they shattered the empire's power, killing five of six of Kanem's ''mais'' (kings) between 1376 and 1400. 

At the end the Bulala conquered [[Kanem (region)|Kanem]] and forced the Kanem ''mais'' to migrate to [[Borno State|Bornu]]. As a result, the Bulala put their hands on Kanem, founding in the 15th century the Muslim sultanate of Yao. The Kanem-Bornu Empire counter-attacked a century later under [[Ali Gaji]]. Kanem was retaken by Ali's son after a great battle at Garni Kiyala, forcing the Bulala to move east, where they were to remain a menace for centuries to Kanem-Bornu. It continued also to be a flourishing kingdom: the traveller [[Leo Africanus]] even thought that the Bulala's reign was richer than Kanem-Bornu for its prosperous trade with [[Egypt]].

Their power survived in diminished forms until the onset of colonialism, when they submitted to the [[France|French]].

There is a '''Brazilian diaspora in Mexico'''. Although the first Portuguese-speaking immigrants in [[Mexico]] were the [[Portuguese Mexican|Portuguese]], [[Brazilians]] today are the largest Portuguese-speaking community living in the country.

==History==
There has been a Brazilian presence in Mexico since at least 1895, when the [[Censo General de Población y Vivienda|National Census]] counted 91 residents.&lt;ref name=EHM&gt;{{cite web|title=Estadísticas Históricas de México|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/historicas10/Tema1_Poblacion.pdf|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|National Institute of Statistics and Geography]]|accessdate=30 September 2015|pages=83, 86|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201212345/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/historicas10/Tema1_Poblacion.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]], around one hundred individuals were admitted into Mexico as [[political refugees]].&lt;ref name="Wollny"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wollny|first1=Hans|title=México y el reto del asilo: una visión desde afuera|url=http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/revista/pdf/DerechoComparado/69/art/art7.pdf|publisher=UNAM|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilians residing in Mexico are mainly businessmen, traders, models, escorts, athletes, students, academics and scientists.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} There are major Brazilian communities in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla and Ensenada. There is also a Brazilian presence in the [[Riviera Maya]].

==Institutions==
Founded in 1945 in Mexico City, the main cultural organization is the Centro Cultural Brasil-México.&lt;ref name="Ventura"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ventura|first1=Abida|title=Un pedazo de Brasil en México|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/cultura/artes-visuales/2016/06/10/un-pedazo-de-brasil-en-mexico|website=El Universal|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than fourteen thousand works, the center houses the largest collection of Brazilian books in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Ventura"/&gt; The collection grew through the donations from the Brazilian community, the Brazilian Embassy and publishers that have participated in the [[Guadalajara International Book Fair]].&lt;ref name="Ventura"/&gt; Other organizations include the Casa do Brasil and Ce.Bras, both also in Mexico City.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The '''Chinese Household Income Project, 2002''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/21741?q=chinese+household+income+project&amp;archive=DSDR]&lt;/ref&gt; measures and estimates the distribution of personal income and related economic factors in both rural and urban areas of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The principal investigators based their definition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of additional components. Data were collected through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and urban areas at the end of 2002. There are ten separate datasets. The first four datasets were derived from the urban questionnaire. The first contains data about individuals living in urban areas. The second contains data about urban households. The third contains individual-level economic variables copied from the initial urban interview form. The fourth contains household-level economic variables copied from the initial urban interview form. The fifth dataset contains village-level data, which was obtained by interviewing village leaders. The sixth contains data about individuals living in rural areas. The seventh contains data about rural households, as well as most of the data from a social network questionnaire which was presented to rural households. The eighth contains the rest of the data from the social network questionnaire and is specifically about the activities of rural school-age children. The ninth dataset contains data about individuals who have migrated from rural to urban areas, and the tenth dataset contains data about rural-urban migrant households.

'''''Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge''''' is a 1998 book by biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], in which the author discusses methods that have been used to unite the sciences and might in the future unite them with the humanities. Wilson uses the term ''[[consilience]]'' to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor.

==Definition of ''consilience''==
"Literally a 'jumping together' of knowledge by the linking of facts and fact-based theory across disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation." (page 7)

==Examples of consilience discussed by Wilson==

===Chapter 1===
* '''The "New Synthesis"'''. Unification of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution with [[genetics]]. 
* '''[[Gerald Holton]]'s "Ionian Enchantment"'''. The conviction that the world has a unified order and can be explained by [[physical law|natural laws]].
* '''Theory that water is fundamental'''. [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] proposed that water is the unifying basis for all material things. Often cited as the first materialistic theory of a unified view of nature.

===Chapter 4===
* '''The [[Atomism|Greek Atomists]]'''. Greeks such as [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] are credited with the [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] idea that matter has fundamental components. Scientific investigation of this idea has resulted in unification across the natural sciences. Example: the molecular structure of [[DNA]] accounts for [[genetics|genetic]] storage in living cells.

===Chapter 5===
* '''Reduction vs. synthesis'''. Many examples comparing consilience by reduction (dissect a phenomenon into its components) and consilience by synthesis (predicting higher-order phenomena from more basic physical principles). One specific example is Wilson's own work on the [[Pheromone|chemical signals]] that regulate [[Eusociality|insect social behavior]].
* '''Magician to Atom'''. An example of consilience by reduction in which Wilson tries to account for the prevalence of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent symbols]] in human cultures. Incorporates the "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12805675 activation-synthesis model]" of [[dream]]ing.
* '''Consilience between biology disciplines'''. Discussion of successes ([[cell (biology)|cell]]s explained in terms of their [[chemical]] components, [[Developmental biology|embryo]] development in terms of interactions between the cells of an embryo) but also points to the remaining problem of dealing with [[complex systems]] as in [[neuroscience]] and [[ecology]].
* '''[[Statistical mechanics]]'''. A classical example in which the behavior of volumes of gas is explained in terms of the molecules of the gas ([[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]).
* '''[[Quantum chemistry]]'''. Prediction of chemical properties by quantum mechanical calculations.

===Chapter 6===
* '''Explaining [[consciousness]] and [[emotion]] in terms of brain activity'''. Wilson describes the neurobiological approach to accounting for consciousness and emotion in terms of brain physiology and how this effort is guided by collaboration between biologists, psychologists and philosophers. 
* '''Neurobiology of [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics in art|aesthetics]]'''. Wilson proposes that it will be possible to construct a neurobiological understanding of subjective experiences that are shared and explored by [[art]]. Common neural patterns of activity will be found to correspond to fundamental aesthetic experiences. 
* '''Artificial [[emotion]]'''. Wilson proposes that human-like artificial intelligence will require the engineering of a computational apparatus for processing an array of rich sensory inputs and the capacity to learn from those inputs in the way that children can learn. Requires consilience between biology, psychology and computer science.

===Chapter 7===
* '''The relationship between [[gene]]s and [[culture]]'''. Wilson posits that the basic element of culture is the [[meme]]. When a meme exists in a brain it has the form of a neuronal network that allows the meme to function within semantic [[memory]]. The link from genes to culture is that our genes shape our brains (in cooperation with the environment) and our brains allow us to work with memes as the basic units of culture.

'''Danny Almonte ''' (born April 7, 1987) is a former baseball player, currently an assistant [[baseball]] coach at [[Cardinal Hayes High School]] in [[New York City]]. Almonte was born in [[Moca, Dominican Republic]]. A former [[Little League]] [[pitcher]] that threw up to {{convert|76|mph}}, he became the subject of considerable media attention in 2001. Considered a phenomenon as he led his [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] team to a third-place finish in the [[2001 Little League World Series]], Almonte was revealed to have actually been two years too old to play Little League baseball. Although there were many allegations during the 2001 Series, the truth was not revealed until weeks later.

==Little League phenomenon==
In 2000, Almonte moved to the Bronx, where he began playing Little League baseball. His father, Felipe, who had moved to the United States six years earlier, had begun a youth baseball league in Moca that still bears his name.

With his high leg kick and a [[fastball]] that reached a top speed of 76 miles per hour (the equivalent, for that distance, of a 102&amp;nbsp;mph major-league fastball),&lt;ref name="Revenge of the Baseball Gods"&gt;Friend, Tom. [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=cerda]. ''[[ESPN]]'', 2014.&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; the 5-foot-8 Danny soon became a sensation. His imposing frame won him the nickname "Little Unit," a nod to [[Randy Johnson|Randy "Big Unit" Johnson]]. He threw a [[no-hitter]] in the 2001 Mid-Atlantic Regional finals against [[State College, Pennsylvania]], sending his team to the Little League World Series in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].

In a round-robin game four days later, Almonte also threw the first [[perfect game]] in the Little League World Series since 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1979 Little League World Series|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/1979_Little_League_World_Series|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the team from [[Apopka, Florida]]. However, his team was defeated by the same Florida team in the U.S. championship game (Almonte could not pitch in the championship game under Little League rules, as he had pitched a complete game the day before). He finished the 2001 tournament with 62 [[strikeout]]s (out of 72 batters faced), giving up only three hits in three starts, and only one unearned run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2001/08/31/almonte_14_ap/ | work=CNN | title=Almonte's team forfeits LLWS victories}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team, nicknamed "the Baby Bombers" because they played in the shadow of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], was the feel-good story of the Little League World Series, and were honored before a [[New York Yankees]] game shortly after the series. They also received the [[key to the city]] from Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].

==Concerns about age==
Danny's imposing appearance and command on the mound, as well as the velocity of his fastball, led to rumors that he was older than 12 years old, the age limit for Little League Baseball. A team from [[Staten Island]] hired a private investigator to look into the ages of the entire team. A similar investigation was conducted by a team from [[Pequannock Township, New Jersey]]. Neither turned up any evidence that the players were too old. Rolando Paulino, the league president, adamantly insisted that Danny had in fact been born on April 7, 1989. Paulino was initially backed by Little League and Dominican officials, who said the Baby Bombers had followed all proper procedures regarding age verification. Officials at Little League headquarters even took the unusual step of checking each of the player documents due to the rumors surrounding the team.&lt;ref name="SIFront"&gt;Thomsen, Ian, and Luis Fernando Llosa. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/cover/news/2001/08/27/llwseries One for the Ages]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', August 27, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Little League officials had increased scrutiny of player eligibility after the [[1992 Little League World Series|1992 Series]], in which the champions from [[Zamboanga City]] in [[The Philippines]] were stripped of their title due to a large number of out-of-district and overage players.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reporters went to the civil records building in Moca two weeks after the end of the Little League World Series. They discovered a notation in the birth ledger showing that in 1994, Felipe Almonte had registered his son's birth date as April 7, 1987 at Dr. Toribio Bencosme Hospital—which would have made him 14 years old at the time of the Little League World Series. It was common for Dominican parents to wait years before registering the birth of a child.&lt;ref name="SIFront"/&gt;

Their report, posted on the magazine's website just before being published, triggered a full investigation by Little League, even as Almonte and his teammates were being feted in the Bronx. His mother, Sonia Rojas Breton, owned a handwritten birth certificate saying that he had been born at home in [[Jamao al Norte|Jamao]] with the help of a [[midwifery|midwife]] in 1989. She had registered Danny's 1989 birth date in 2000.

Both of Almonte's parents, though separated, insisted their son was born in 1989, condemning the other documents as false. Felipe Almonte appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' at the time of the investigation, proclaiming his son's innocence.

==Almonte's real age==
As part of Dominican officials' investigation, Victor Romero, head of the national public records office, interviewed the witnesses whose signatures appeared on the 1989 birth certificate. They both denied knowing Danny's parents, let alone signing the certificate. On August 31, Romero announced that Danny had in fact been born in 1987.

As a result, Danny was retroactively declared ineligible, and the Baby Bombers had to forfeit all their wins in tournament play. All of their records were removed from the books, and the team was required to demonstrate compliance with all regulations before entering the 2002 tournament. Felipe Almonte was banned from Little League competition for life. Paulino was also banned, since Little League rules make the league president responsible for player eligibility. Dominican prosecutors filed criminal charges against Felipe Almonte for falsifying a birth certificate. Danny, who did not speak [[English language|English]] at the time, apparently knew nothing about the falsified documents and was cleared of wrongdoing. Little League president Stephen Keener said that Danny and his teammates had been "used ... in a most contemptible and despicable way" and that "millions of Little Leaguers around the world were deceived." [[ESPN]]'s [[Jim Caple]] called Felipe Almonte "the worst stereotype of the Little League parent sprung to life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/caple_jim/1246591.html ESPN.com: MLB - Nobody wins when the winners cheated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Danny's godmother later begged forgiveness, saying that "we had to commit this little fraud" to give Danny a chance to compete in a tournament as significant as the Little League World Series.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://espn.go.com/moresports/llws01/s/2001/0906/1248657.html ESPN.com: MORESPORTS - Almonte attends U.S. school for first time&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the same time, New York City child welfare officials discovered that Almonte had not been enrolled in school for the 2000–01 year—which would be a violation of state law, and grounds for placing Danny in [[foster care]]. Danny's registration listed him as attending Public School 70 in the Bronx. However, Dominican school officials said they had records that Danny had actually attended school in the Dominican Republic until June 15. This would have made him ineligible for the Little League World Series even if he had actually been 12 years old. Little League rules require a player to have appeared in at least half of his team's games by June 15 in order to be eligible for the all-star team that competes in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/moresports/llws01/s/2001/0903/1247319.html ESPN.com: MORESPORTS - Almonte's dad faces charges in the Dominican&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Danny then enrolled at Public School 52 in the Bronx in September.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Aftermath==
After his father's visa expired, Danny remained in New York under the guardianship of Rolando Paulino. He played, along with four of his former teammates, in the 2004 Public Schools Athletic League championship. In early 2005, Danny moved to the [[Miami]] area, where he did not play baseball due to residency requirements. The following year he returned to New York, where he pitched for [[James Monroe High School (New York)|James Monroe High School]] in the Bronx.

In September 2005, Almonte was rumored to have been married to an older woman. This allegation was later confirmed in May 2006 as Almonte proclaimed he was married to 30-year-old Rosy Perdomo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/baseball/2006-05-19-almonte-wedding_x.htm|title=Now 19, Almonte admits marriage to 30-year-old woman|publisher=USA Today|date=May 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the [[National Amateur Baseball Federation]] (NABF) wood-bat summer league, he played for Youth Service.

There had been some reports that he would be selected in the [[2006 Major League Baseball Draft]], though this did not happen. He attended a [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] tryout in October 2006. After the draft he said he would play baseball for [[New Mexico Junior College]] in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]. The team made it to the National [[Junior College]] championship game in 2007.

In 2007, Almonte joined the [[Southern Illinois Miners]] of the [[Frontier League]], an independent [[minor league|minor-league]] circuit—and thus forfeited his [[NCAA]] collegiate eligibility. He pitched his first game on May 27, 2007 against the [[Evansville Otters]]. The Miners lost, 3–2. He was released on June 30, 2007. His record was 0–1, with a 5.29 ERA in six appearances. By at least one account, his poor performance was due to his being out of shape at the time.&lt;ref name="braziller"/&gt;

In fall 2007, Almonte enrolled as a freshman in [[Western Oklahoma State College]], a community college in [[Altus, Oklahoma]], where he pitched and played right field for the Pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western.cc.ok.us/woscbaseball/08Pioneers.html |title=2008 Western Oklahoma St. Pioneers |publisher=Western Oklahoma St. Pioneers |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225235832/http://www.western.cc.ok.us/woscbaseball/08Pioneers.html |archivedate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almonte and the Pioneers were ranked fourth in the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] Division 2 poll and advanced to the NJCAA D-2 World Series. Almonte finished as one of the top hitters in JUCO baseball, hitting .497 with 14 home runs and going 7–1 with one save as a pitcher. In his second year at the school, Almonte hit .472, with 18 home runs, and had a pitching record of 9–0. Despite those statistics, however, he was not selected by any Major League Baseball organization in the [[Rule 4 draft]].&lt;ref name="braziller"&gt;Braziller, Zach. (April 17, 2010). "[http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/now_danny_almonte_starting_over_PXOCRWkR7ZMAReNqjkUJVI Now 23, Danny Almonte starting over — as a coach]", ''[[New York Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced to give up pitching due to a sore arm, Almonte played [[semi-professional|semi-pro]] baseball in the summer of 2009 as an outfielder. As of 2010, Almonte had returned to the Bronx, where he was serving as a volunteer assistant coach for his high school alma mater's baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Mitch. (January 14, 2010). "[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2010/01/14/2010-01-14_almonte_looking_for_fresh_start.html 2001 Little League World Series darling Danny Almonte looking for fresh start]", ''[[New York Daily News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was reportedly no longer with his wife, though he would not discuss details of the relationship. Almonte indicated an intent to return to semi-pro baseball that summer, after the end of the school year, but said that he no longer held expectations of some day playing in the Major Leagues.&lt;ref name="braziller" /&gt;

==Media==
The episode "[[Foul Play (Law &amp; Order episode)|Foul Play]]" of the legal drama series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' was inspired by Almonte's story.

'''Datadog''' is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a [[Software as a service|SaaS]]-based data analytics platform.

== Technology ==
Datadog uses a [[Go (programming language)|Go]] based agent, rewritten from scratch since its major version 6.0.0 released on February 28, 2018&lt;ref&gt;GitHub, [https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent "Datadog / datadog-agent."] Retrieved June 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was formerly [[Python (programming language)|Python]] based &lt;ref&gt;GitHub, [https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent "Datadog / dd-agent."] Retrieved February 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, forked from the original created in 2009 by David Mytton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/commit/9311d425aec52cf165a3476d54fd2d6caeddee56|title=First commit · DataDog/dd-agent@9311d42|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Server Density]] (previously called Boxed Ice). Its backend is built using a number of [[Open source|open]] and [[closed source]] technologies including [[D3.js|D3]], [[Apache Cassandra]], [[Apache Kafka|Kafka]], [[PostgreSQL]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Hakka Labs, Alexis Lê-Quôc, [https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/realtime-data-analytics-at-datadog "Realtime Data Analytics at Datadog."] January 9, 2014. Retrieved February 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, Datadog support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers including [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), [[Microsoft Azure]], [[Google Cloud Platform]] and [[Red Hat]] [[OpenShift]]. Today, the company supports over 150 integrations out-of-the-box.

== History ==
Datadog was founded in 2010&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = http://www.stephpalmeri.com/post/867616712/quick-note-on-seedstart-demo-day | title = Quick Note on SeedStart Demo Day | access-date = 16 November 2018 | last = Palmeri | first = Steph | date = 27 July 2010 | website = StephPalmeri.com | quote = Here, the five SeedStart companies (DataDog, Introspectr, Lexeem, Reducify, and Risktail) debuted to over 100 venture capitalists, angel investors, and strategics from the New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. areas. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100801231724/http://www.stephpalmeri.com/post/867616712/quick-note-on-seedstart-demo-day | archive-date = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc, who met while working at Wireless Generation. After Wireless Generation was acquired by NewsCorp, the two set out to create a product that could reduce the friction they experienced between developer and system-admin teams, who were often working at cross-purposes.

They built Datadog to be a cloud infrastructure monitoring service, with a dashboard, alerting, and visualizations of metrics. As cloud adoption increased, Datadog grew rapidly and expanded its product offering to cover service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, and [[OpenStack]].&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/monitoring-service-datadog-gets-31m-funding/2015/01/ | title = Monitoring Service Datadog Gets $31M in Funding | access-date = 16 November 2016 | last = Moriarty | first = Erin | date = 29 January 2015 | website = Sdxcentral.com | quote = Last year, support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat OpenShift, and the company added OpenStack support as well.

In 2015 Datadog announced the acquisition of Mortar Data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Ben Kepes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/02/11/datadog-acquires-mortar-data-to-tie-analytics-to-monitoring/#4575e46a476a |title=DataDog Acquires Mortar Data To Tie Analytics To Monitoring |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing on its team and adding its data and analytics capabilities to Datadog’s platform. That year Datadog also opened a research and development office in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris O&amp;#039;Brien |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/10/07/datadogs-french-founders-announce-their-ny-based-company-will-open-paris-rd-office/ |title=Datadog's French founders announce their NY-based company will open Paris R&amp;D office |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2015-10-07 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2016 Datadog moved its New York City headquarters to a full floor of the New York Times Building to support its growing team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161103005060/en/Datadog-Moves-York-Times-Building-Listed-Forbes%E2%80%99 |title=Datadog Moves Into The New York Times Building, Listed In Forbes’ Cloud 100 and Other Awards |publisher=Business Wire |date=2016-11-03 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which doubled over the course of the year. Datadog announced the beta-release of Application Performance Monitoring in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Konrad |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/09/22/new-york-cloud-startup-datadogs-new-product-puts-it-on-a-collision-course-with-new-relic/#51777b9c3814 |title=Cloud Startup Datadog's New App Monitoring Product Puts It On A Collision Course With New Relic |publisher=Forbes.com |date= 22 September 2016|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering for the first time a full-stack monitoring solution. As of 2017, the company has close to 300 employees, the vast majority of which are located in the US (with offices in Manhattan, Boston, and Baltimore) and a new R&amp;D facility in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hostadvice.com/blog/datadog-cloud-infrastructure-application-data-single-place/|title=Datadog – All of Your Cloud Infrastructure and Application Data in a Single Place |website=HostAdvice|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Datadog acquired the Paris-based Logmatic.io, a platform-agnostic service for querying and visualizing logs to monitor and troubleshoot online services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/datadog-acquires-logmatic-io-to-add-log-management-to-its-cloud-monitoring-platform/|title=Datadog acquires Logmatic.io to add log management to its cloud monitoring platform |website= [[TechCrunch]]|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Democracy Index]] 2016 study, [[Israel]] (#29 worldwide) is the only democracy in the [[Middle East]], while [[Tunisia]] (#69 worldwide) is the only democracy in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://infographics.economist.com/2017/DemocracyIndex/|title=EIU Democracy Index 2016|website=infographics.economist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of the level of democracy in nations throughout the world published by [[Freedom House]] and various other [[freedom indices]], the Middle Eastern and North African countries with the highest scores are [[Israel]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], and [[Kuwait]]. Countries that are occasionally classified as partly democratic are [[Egypt]] and [[Iraq]]. The remaining countries of the Middle East are categorized as [[authoritarian regime]]s, with the lowest scores held by [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]].

[[Freedom House]] categorizes Israel and Tunisia as "Free", Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait and Morocco "Partly Free", and the remaining states as "Not Free" (including [[Western Sahara]], which is controlled by Morocco). Events of the "[[Arab Spring]]" such as the [[Tunisian Revolution]] may indicate a move towards democracy in some countries which may not be fully captured in the democracy index. In 2015, Tunisia became the first Arab country classified as free since the beginning of Lebanon's civil war 40 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/28/why_was_tunisia_the_only_arab_spring_country_that_turned_out_well.html|title=Why Was Tunisia the Only Arab Spring Country That Turned Out Well?|first=Joshua|last=Keating|date=28 January 2015|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Theories are diverse on the subject. "Revisionist theories" argue that democracy is slightly incompatible with Middle Eastern values.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "post-colonial" theories (such as those put forth by [[Edward Said]]) for the relative absence of [[liberal democracy]] in the Middle East are diverse, from the long history of imperial rule by the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[British Empire|Britain]] and [[French colonial empires|France]] and the contemporary political and military intervention by the [[United States]], all of which have been blamed for preferring authoritarian regimes because this simplifies the business environment, while enriching the governing elite and the companies of the imperial countries. Other explanations include the problem that most of the states in the region are [[rentier state]]s, which experience the theorized [[resource curse]].

This article follows sources that place [[Cyprus]] in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1016541.stm|title=BBC News – Cyprus country profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe map / Map of Europe – Facts, Geography, History of Europe – Worldatlas.com|url=http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; not the Middle East.

==History==
After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, many of the empire's former territories fell under the rule of European countries under [[League of Nations]] mandates.  Thus, European powers were instrumental in establishing the first independent governments that emerged from the Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Cold War]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] competed for allies in the region and the U.S. has been accused of supporting dictatorships  contrary to its stated democratic principles.  The 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] was the beginning of a policy of [[American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA), leading, for example, to American intervention on behalf of the democratically elected government in the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]].

Following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. war in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] were a significant turning point for the U.S.'s shift, from political rhetoric, to the real cause of democratisation in the region, as the invasions of those countries were partly for purposes of organising democratic governments.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, N. (2007),"Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World": London: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the act have, however, criticised that democracy cannot be imposed from outside. The two countries have since had relatively successful elections, but have also experienced serious security and development problems.

Some believe that [[democracy]] can be established "only through force" and the help of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1351 Democracy in the Middle East Can Only Be Established by Force] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as Michele Dunne, when writing for the Carnegie Paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org |title=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher=Carnegieendowment.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; concurs with the rhetoric of the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin (at that time, referring to peace and terrorism) that the foreign policy position of the US should be to 'pursue peace as though there were no democratization, and pursue democratization as though there were no peace. In other words, the U.S. government should pursue reform and democratization as policy goals in the first instance without worrying excessively about tradeoffs with other goals."&lt;ref&gt;Michele Dunne, "Integrating Democracy Promotion into U.S. Middle East Policy", Carnegie Paper No. 50, October 2004. p 8, {{cite web |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1381 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214110716/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1381 |archivedate=2007-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. pressure behind the calling of the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]] backfired, resulting in the democratically sound victory of [[Hamas]], rather than the US supported [[Fatah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012601009.html |title=Bush Is Conciliatory in Accepting Victory of Hamas |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2006-01-27|accessdate=2011-02-01 |first=Glenn |last=Kessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing upon the ideas of Middle East scholar Nicola Pratt it can be argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…the outcome of democratization efforts is [in reality]…contingent upon the degree to which actors' chosen strategies contribute to either reproducing or challenging the relations of power between civil society and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, N (May 2004) "Bringing politics back in: examining the link between globalization and democratization"  ''Review of International Political Economy'' 11:2,  p 331, {{doi|10.1080/0969229042000249831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, recent academic critics have characterized intervention in the Middle East as a means towards engendering democracy a failure. The 2011 study [[Costs of War]] from [[Brown University]]'s [[Watson Institute for International Studies]] concluded that democracy promotion has been flawed from the beginning in both Iraq and Afghanistan, with corruption rampant in both countries as the United States prepares to withdraw many of its combat troops. On a scale of democratization established by [[Transparency International]], Iraq and Afghanistan are two of the worst-ranked countries in the world, surpassed in corruption by only [[Myanmar]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the wars bring democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq?|url=http://costsofwar.org/article/did-wars-bring-democracy-afghanistan-and-iraq|work=Costs of War|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703093122/http://costsofwar.org/article/did-wars-bring-democracy-afghanistan-and-iraq|archivedate=3 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Amitai Etzioni]] has pointed out that the prerequisite sociological conditions for the establishment of liberal democracies were not present in Iraq and Afghanistan when the United States attempted to engage in nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=The Democratisation Mirage|journal=Survival: Global Politics and Strategy|date=August–September 2015|volume=57|issue=4|pages=139–156|url=https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/survival/sections/2015-1e95/survival--global-politics-and-strategy-august-september-2015-c6ba/57-4-10-etzioni-c9f9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures of democracy==
{{Main|List of freedom indices}}
There are several non-governmental organizations that publish and maintain [[List of freedom indices|indices of freedom]] in the world, according to their own various definitions of the term, and rank countries as being free, partly free, or unfree using various measures of freedom, including political rights, economic rights, freedom of the press and civil liberties.

===Annual assessment===

An analysis on the level of constitution around the world is conducted every year by [[Freedom House]]. Freedom House analyses political rights (PR), civil liberties (CL) and overall regime status. PR and CL are rated from one to seven, with one being most free and seven being least free. Regimes are classed as either 'free, partly free or not free'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=351&amp;ana_page=342&amp;year=2008|title=Introduction|website=www.freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The below table summarizes the findings of the 2010 - 2015 [[Freedom in the World#Middle East and North Africa|Freedom in the World]] report on the countries of the Middle East and North Africa.

==Current state==
There are a number of pro-democracy movements in the Middle East.  A prominent figure in this movement is [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] who advocates and campaigns for democracy in Egypt and the wider region, working with the Ibn Khaldun Centre for Development Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eicds.org/|title=Ibn Khaldun Centre for Development Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serving on the Board of Advisors for the [[Project on Middle East Democracy]].

When asked about his thoughts regarding the current state of democracy in the region he said:

{{quote|People's memories... have become tuned or conditioned to thinking that the problems in the Middle East must be a chronic condition, not that they are only 30 years old, and not realizing that the reason for the current state of the Middle East was first, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and two, the Cold War.

The Cold War made the United States and other western democracies look the other way when it came to political oppression and allowed them to deal with tyrants and dictators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.2/ibrahim_interview.htm|title=SAAD EDDIN IBRAHIM IN CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- LOGOS 4.2 SPRING 2005|website=www.logosjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Middle East Forum]], a think tank based in Philadelphia, recently published their table for measurement of democracy within Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/970#_ftn23 The Middle East Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Their contention is that little has changed, post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], and if anything the "[[War on Terror]]" has enabled many regimes to stifle democratic progress. The results showed very little progress from 1999-2005. The report even states that this pattern may be counter-productive to US interests, with Islamism being the only viable opposition to regimes in many Middle Eastern countries. As an additional measure of US attitudes towards the issue of Middle Eastern democratization, on 14 December 2006, the US Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice stated that democracy in the Middle East was "non-negotiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2006/ioi/061219-rice-democracy.html|title=Rice discusses Middle East Democracy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle East scholar Louise Fawcett notes how the United Nations Development Programme's ''Arab Human Development Report 2002'', drafted by Western-educated Arab intellectuals, is modelled "on universal democratic principles."&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L. (2005) ''International Relations in the Middle East'' Gosport: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-926963-7}}  p 123&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fawcett argues that "Constitutional democracy is viewed not only as an intrinsic good by the putative globalisers who drafted this Report; it is also an instrumental necessity if the region is to stop stagnating and begin to catch up with the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L(2005) ''International Relations in the Middle East'' Gosport: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-926963-7}}  p 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of democratic process varies widely from country to country.  A few countries, such as Saudi Arabia, do not claim to be democracies; however, most of the larger states claim to be democracies{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, although this claim is in most cases disputed{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

===Presidential republics===
{{main|Presidential republic}}
A number of [[republic]]s embracing [[Arab Socialism]], such as [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]], regularly hold [[election]]s, but critics assert that these are not full [[multi-party system]]s. Most importantly they do not allow citizens to choose between lots of different candidates for presidency election.&lt;ref&gt;[[Egypt]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Syria]]&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of modern Egypt has always given the president a virtual monopoly over the decision making process, devoting 30 articles (15 percent of the whole constitution) to presidential prerogatives. According to the constitution, the Egyptian president's powers are equivalent to those of the [[prime minister]] in parliamentary systems and to the president of the [[French Fifth Republic]].&lt;ref name="Iranian Public on Current Issues"&gt;"MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT"&gt;MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT, "Better Governance for Development in the Middle East and North Africa"The World bank, Washington, D.C. 2003, pg 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yemen]], [[Lebanon]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]], while also partly accepting this ideology, are generally considered more democratic than other states that do so, but the power of institutions in the latter two are limited by the domination of Syria and Israel, respectively.

===Absolute monarchy===
[[Absolute monarchy]] is common in the Middle East. [[Saudi Arabia]] and a few other kingdoms on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] are considered absolute monarchies. The endurance of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East is notable in comparison to the rest of the world. While such regimes have fallen throughout sub-Saharan Africa, for example, they have persisted in the Middle East. Yet Middle Eastern history also includes significant episodes of conflict between rulers and proponents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Prepstein Posusney, Michele Penner Angrist, eds. "Authoritarianism in the Middle East: regimes and resistance"[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], London, 2005, pg, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional monarchy===
'''Constitutional monarchy''' is a form of [[government]] in which a [[monarch]] acts as [[head of state]] within the guidelines of a [[constitution]], whether it be a written, [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], or blended constitution. This form of government differs from [[absolute monarchy]] in which an absolute monarch serves as the source of power in the state and is not legally bound by any constitution and has the powers to regulate his or her respective government.

Most constitutional monarchies employ a [[parliamentary system]] in which the monarch may have strictly ceremonial duties or may have reserve powers, depending on the constitution. Under most modern constitutional monarchies there is also a [[prime minister]] who is the head of government and exercises effective political power. The Middle Eastern countries with [[Constitutional monarchies]] are generally considered democratic.  For example: [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Morocco]], and [[Bahrain]] are considered constitutional monarchies.

===Islamic governments===
The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 resulted in an electoral system (an Islamic Republic with a constitution), but the system has a limited democracy in practice. One of the main problems of [[Iran]]'s system is the consolidation of too much power in the hands of the [[Supreme Leader]] who is elected by [[Assembly of Experts]] for life (unless the [[Assembly of Experts]] decides to remove him which has never happened). Another main problem is the closed loop in the electoral system, the elected [[Assembly of Experts]] elect the [[Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader of Iran]], who appoints the members of the [[Guardian Council]], who in turn vet the candidates for all elections including the elections for [[Assembly of Experts]]. However some elections in Iran, as the election of city councils satisfies free and democratic election criteria to some extent. In other countries, the ideology (usually out of power) has fostered both pro-democratic and anti-democratic sentiments.  The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] is a moderate democratic Islamist party that has come to power in traditionally secular [[Turkey]].  Its moderate ideology has been compared to [[Christian Democracy]] in Europe.  The [[United Iraqi Alliance]], the winner of the recent elections in Iraq, is a coalition including many religious parties.

===Iran===

====History of political systems====
Historically Iranians were ruled by an [[absolute monarchy]] for [[History of Iran|several thousand years]], at least since the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550 B.C.E.) until the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran|Constitutional Revolution]] in the early 20th century. The Constitutional Revolution in 1906 replaced the [[absolute monarchy]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Persian Constitution of 1906|constitution]] went under several revisions during the following decades. During [[World War II]] Iran stayed neutral but in 1941 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (the [[USSR]] and [[Great Britain]]) [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invaded]] Iran and replaced the Iran's Shah [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]] (who was perceived as being pro-German) with his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] to protect their access to Iranian oil, and to secure routes to ship western military aid to the Soviet Union. [[Iran]]'s parliamentary government led by Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] was toppled in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|1953 coup d'état]] by royalist forces supported and funded by [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] after [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] nationalized Iranian oil. Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] became the preeminent leader in Iran, and instated [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] from the military as the new Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Amin saikal and Albrecht Schnabel, "Democratization in the Middle East" United Nations University Press New York, 2003, pg.70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]] has considered the Shah as a close ally and Iran as its main base in the [[Middle East]]. The Shah also tried to modernize Iran's economy and westernize Iran's culture. These and other policies contributed to alienating nationalists, leftists, and religious groups.

The monarchy was overthrown in 1979 by the [[Iranian Revolution]]. In the same year a referendum was held by [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], that asked whether there should be an 'Islamic Republic' or not. The [[Iranian Islamic Republic referendum, March 1979|1979 referendum]] (in favor of an Islamic Republic) got 98% support of those who voted. The constitution was modeled on the 1958 constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] by the [[1st Assembly of Experts|Assembly of Experts for Constitution]] (who were elected by direct popular vote) and Khomeini made himself the new [[Supreme Leader]] of Iran. The constitution received above 99% support in another [[Iranian constitutional referendum, December 1979|1979 referendum]]. After Khomeini's death, the [[Assembly of Experts]] (which is made of Islamic scholars elected by direct vote) appointed [[Ali Khamenei]] as the new [[Supreme Leader]]. The constitution was also amended through a [[Iranian constitutional referendum, 1989|referendum]] in 1989 with 97% support a few months before [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] died increasing the powers of [[Supreme Leader]]. Iran holds regular national elections by universal suffrage for all citizens (regardless of race, religion, or sex, who are of voting age) for electing the [[President of Iran|President]], members of [[Consultative Assembly of Iran|Parliament]], [[Assembly of Experts]], [[City and Village Councils of Iran|City and Village Councils]] where political parties support candidates.

====Issues with the current political system====
The current political system in Iran was designed to allow Iranians to decide their future by themselves without being oppressed by authorities, but in practice only allows a limited democracy. One of the main problems of [[Iran]]'s system is the consolidation of too much power in the hands of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] who is elected by the [[Assembly of Experts]] for life (unless the Assembly of Experts decides to remove him, which has never happened). The power of the Supreme Leader under [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's constitution]] is almost unlimited and unrestricted in practice. This combined with the view that he is the representative of God held by some religious groups, being the head of the security and armed forces, and controlling the official state media (the radio and television are restricted to state radio and television) makes him immune from any kind of criticism and unchallengeable. Critics of the system or the Supreme Leader are punished severely. Critical newspapers and political parties are closed, social and political activists like writers, journalists, human right activists, university students, union leaders, lawyers, and politicians are jailed for unreasonably long periods for making simple criticism against the Supreme Leader, the Islamic Republic system, [[Islam]] and [[Shia]] doctrines, the government, and other officials. They have been even threatened by death sentence (though all such verdict in recent years have been dropped in higher courts in recent years) and some have been assassinated by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Ministry of Intelligence]] and militias in the past (no such case has been reported in recent years).

Another main problem is the closed loop in the electoral system, the elected [[Assembly of Experts]] elects the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], so in theory he is elected indirectly by popular vote, but in practice the system does not satisfy the criteria for a free election since the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] appoints the members of the [[Guardian Council]] who in turn vet the candidates for all elections including the elections for [[Assembly of Experts]]. This loop limits the possible candidates to those agreeing with the views held by [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] and he has the final say over all important issues.

Also the fourth unchangeable article of constitution states that all other articles of the constitution and all other laws are void if they violate Islamic rules, and the [[Guardian Council]] is given the duty of interpreting the constitution and verifying that all laws passed the parliament are not against Islamic laws. Many articles of constitution about political freedoms and minority rights (e.g. education in mother language for language minorities) have not been applied at all.

Other problems include the issues with the [[Human rights in Iran|rights]] of racial and religious minorities, influence and involvement of armed forces specially the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] and [[Basij]] in political activities, widespread corruption in the ruling elite, problems with security forces like police and militias like [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]], and corruption in Judiciary.

====Public opinion of Iranians regarding the current political system====
One should note that against all short-comings of the current system as a democracy mentioned above some recent polls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/65872019/Iran-Public-Opinion-2010 |title=Iran Public Opinion 2010 |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |title=Executive Summary |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723044939/http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep09/IranUS_Sep09_quaire.pdf |title=Iranian Public on Current Issues |publisher=worldpublicopinions.org |date=2010-09-10 |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225030539/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep09/IranUS_Sep09_quaire.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iran by a number of respected Western polling organizations show that a considerable majority of Iranians support the system including and the religious institutions and trust it about the elections (even the disputed [[Iranian presidential election, 2009#Polls by Western Organizations|presidential elections in 2009]]). Some Iranians and political activists dispute the results of these polls arguing that the results of these polls cannot be trusted because people fear to express their real opinion and the limitations on the follow of information allows the state to control the opinion of people living in more traditional parts of the country. Some of these polling organizations have responded to these claims and defended their results as correctly showing the current opinion of Iranians. The polls also show a divide between the population living in large modern cities like [[Tehran]] and people living in other more traditional and conservative parts of the country like rural areas and smaller cities.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon has traditionally enjoyed a confessional democratic system.&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, Heather., "The Middle East and the Problems of Democracy", Open university Press, Philadelphia, 1993, pg.103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese constitution, doctored in 1926, was based on the French constitution and guaranteed liberty and equality for all its citizens. A large number of political parties with very different ideologies, are active in Lebanon, but most of them form political alliances with other groups of similar interests. Even though certain high-profile positions in the government and the seats in the parliament are reserved for specified sects, intense competition is usually expected of political parties and candidates.

In January 2015, the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], released a report stating that Lebanon ranked the 2nd in [[Middle East]] and 98th out of 167 countries worldwide for [[Democracy Index]] 2014, which ranks countries according to election processes, pluralism, government functions, political participation, political cultures and fundamental freedoms.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] is a parliamentary democracy represented by a very large number of parties, with universal suffrage for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, who are of voting age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian Authority===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] operates presidential and parliamentary elections with universal suffrage for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, or sex, who are of voting age. However, no national elections have been held since the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]] erupted into violence in 2006.

==Arab Spring==
{{details|Arab Spring}}
The protests, uprisings and revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa, beginning on 18 December 2010, brought about the overthrow of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments. [[Libya]] was brought into a 6-month [[2011 Libyan Civil War|civil war]] which brought about the end of [[Gaddafi]]'s 41-year rule. [[2011 Bahraini uprising|Bahrain]] and [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]] are experiencing uprisings. The uprising in [[Syrian civil war|Syria]] led to full-scale civil war. Tunisia and Egypt have held elections that were considered fair by observers. [[Mohamed Morsi]] was sworn in as Egypt's first president to gain power through an election on 30 June 2012; however, after [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|protests against him in June 2013]], as well as a 48-hour deadline by the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] to respond to the protesters' demands that he did not comply with, Morsi was removed from office in July 2013. Morsi's [[Ministry of Defence and Military Production|Defence Minister]], [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], who served as a general in the Egyptian Armed Forces at the time, was responsible for announcing the overthrow on state television. Many other countries in the region are also calling for democracy and freedom, including: [[2010-2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]], [[2011 Armenian protests|Armenia]], [[2011 Azerbaijani protests|Azerbaijan]], [[2011 Djiboutian protests|Djibouti]], [[2011 Iranian protests|Iran]], [[2011 Iraqi protests|Iraq]], [[2011 Jordanian protests|Jordan]], [[2011 Omani protests|Oman]], [[2011 Yemeni protests|Yemen]], [[2011 Kuwaiti protests|Kuwait]], [[2011 Mauritanian protests|Mauritania]], [[2011 Moroccan protests|Morocco]], [[2011 Saudi Arabian protests|Saudi Arabia]], [[2011 Sudanese protests|Sudan]] and [[2011 Kurdish protests in Turkey|Turkey]]. Research confirms that (in general) people in Islamic societies support democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Min-Hua Huang, "Islam and Democracy: A Global Perspective." ''[[Taiwan Journal of Democracy]]'', 1(2), 2005, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tessler, "Islam and Democracy in the Middle East: The Impact of Religious Orientations on Attitudes toward Democracy in Four Arab Countries." ''Comparative Politics'', 34(3), 2002, p. 348-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularism==
{{Main|Secularism in the Middle East}}
[[Secularism]] in the Middle East was pioneered by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who, though he himself had some authoritarian tendencies, helped establish the first modern Middle Eastern secular democracy in [[Turkey]].  Arab Socialism has also fostered secularism, though sometimes in what has been seen as a less democratic context.  Secularism is not the same as [[freedom of religion]], and secular governments have at times denied the rights of Islamists and other religious parties.  A trend of a more liberal secularism supporting broader freedom of religion has developed recently in Turkey, while some Arab Socialist states have moved away from secularism to some extent, increasingly embracing religion, though many say without really increasing the rights of religious parties. Lebanon also is a secular state.

==The state, democratization and the Middle East==
The reasons for the lack of democratization in the Middle East are outlined by analysts such as Albrecht Schnabel, who says that a strong civil society is required to produce leaders and mobilize the public around democratic duties, but in order for such a civil society to flourish, a democratic environment and process allowing freedom of expression and order is required in the first place. This theory therefore supports the intervention of outside countries, such as the U.S., in establishing democracy. "If domestic capacities are lacking, external support may be required.  Externally supported creation of fragile, yet somewhat functioning institutions is meant to trigger the momentum needed to encourage the evolution of a functioning civil society.  The latter will, after a few years of consolidation and post-conflict stability, produce the first wholly internally crafted government.  At that time, external involvement, if still provided at that point, can cede."&lt;ref&gt;Schnabel, Albrecht. "Democratization and Peacebuilding." Democratization in the Middle East: Experiences, Struggles, Challenges. Ed. Amin Saikal and Albrecht Schnabel. New York: United Nations University Press, 2003. p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Schnabel argues that democratization in the Middle East must come from both below and above, given that pressure from below will be pointless if the political leadership is opposed to reform, while top-down reform (which has been the norm in the Middle East) is not a fruitful endeavor if the political culture in society is not developed.&lt;ref&gt;Schnabel, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts draw different conclusions. Drawing from the work of Alexis de Tocqueville and Robert Putnam, these researchers suggest that independent, nongovernmental associations help foster a participatory form of governance. They cite the lack of horizontal voluntary association as a reason for the persistence of authoritarianism in the region.&lt;ref name="MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT"&gt;MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT, "Better Governance for Development in the Middle East and North Africa" The World bank, Washington, D.C. 2003, pg 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts believe that the lack of a market-driven economy in many Middle Eastern countries undermines the capacity to build the kind of individual autonomy and power that helps promote democracy.&lt;ref name=Marsha &gt;{{Cite book| author= Bellin, Eva | title= "Coercive Institutions and Coercive Leaders" in Posusney, Marsha Pripstein and Michele Penner Angrist, eds., "Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance" | publisher= Boulder, CO: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2005 | isbn=1-58826-342-8 |pages = 21–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the relationship of the state to civil society is one of the most important indicators of the chances of democracy evolving in a particular country.&lt;ref name= Korany &gt;{{Cite book| author= Korany, Bahgat, Rex Brynen and Paul Noble, eds. | title= Political Liberalization &amp; Democratization in the Arab World: Volume 2, Comparative Experiences | publisher= Boulder: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=1998 | isbn=1-55587-599-8 |pages = 3, 8, 274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty, inequality, and low literacy rates also compromise people's commitment to democratic reforms since survival becomes a higher priority.  Some analysts point to MENA's saturation with Islam as an explanation for the region's failure to democratize.&lt;ref name=Marsha /&gt;

Other analysts believe that the failure of democratization results from the power of the state.  Inspired by Skopcol's work on revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Skocpol, Theda| title= States and Social Revolutions| publisher= Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press | year=1979 | isbn=0-521-29499-1|page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belin&lt;ref name=Marsha /&gt; argues that democratic transition can only be carried out when the state's coercive apparatus lacks the will or capacity to crush opponents. Authoritarianism has been exceptionally robust in the MENA region because many of the states have proven willing and able to crush reform initiatives. Moreover, almost every Arab state has been directly involved in some form of international conflict over the past decades. Research suggests that conflict involvement has a direct influence on the country's prospects for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Brynen, Rex, Bahgat Korany and Paul Noble, eds. | title= Political Liberalization &amp; Democratization in the Arab World: Volume 1, Theoretical Perspectives | publisher=London: Lynne Reinner Publishers | year=1995 | isbn=1-55587-579-3 |page = 285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, critics of these theories observe that some countries which experience many of these democracy-inhibiting factors are successful in their quest for democratization.

'''EMO''' is a European [[trade show]] for the [[manufacturing]] industries. It occurs every odd-numbered year, with a cycle that finds it at the [[Hanover Fairground]] in [[Hanover]], Germany for 2 shows, then the [[Fiera Milano]] exhibition center in [[Milan]], Italy for 1 show.

The name ''EMO'' came from the name Exposition Mondiale de la Machine-Outil (Machine Tool World Exposition), and the scope of the content still reflects the [[machine tool]] heritage, although it now also extends beyond it. The show covers the spectrum of [[metalworking]] technologies, such as machine tools for [[milling (machining)|milling]], [[turning]], and [[forming (metalworking)|forming]]; manufacturing systems; precision measuring tools; automated materials handling; computer technology; industrial electronics; and accessories. 

EMO is run by CECIMO, the European Association of the Machine Tool Industries (Comité européen de coopération des industries de la machine-outil) (www.cecimo.eu).&lt;ref name="CECIMO_website_home"&gt;{{cite web |author=CECIMO |title=CECIMO website |url=http://www.cecimo.eu/ |accessdate=2015-12-23 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Verein Deutscher Werkzeugmaschinenfabriken (German Machine Tool Builders’ Association), or VDW, is responsible for the organization of the trade show when in Hanover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vdw.de/web-bin/owa/homepage?p_bereich=messe&amp;p_menue_id=1000000044&amp;p_sprache=e|title= VDW: The World of Metalworking|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while UCIMU, the Association of Italian Manufacturers of Machine Tools, Robots, Automation Systems and ancillary products (NC, tools, components, accessories) manages the Milan show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ucimu.it/attivita/fiere/v/emo-milano|title=UCIMU EMO Milano|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement between the [[Association for Manufacturing Technology]] (AMT), which organizes the US-based [[International Manufacturing Technology Show]] (IMTS) and CECIMO coordinates the IMTS and the EMO such that every even-numbered year the IMTS is held in Chicago, and every odd-numbered year the EMO is held in Europe.

==History==
EMO began as the EEMO (Exposition européenne de machines-outils, European machine tools exhibition).&lt;ref name="CECIMO-about-history"&gt;{{Citation |author=CECIMO |title=CECIMO's history |url=http://www.cecimo.eu/site/about-us/history/ |accessdate=2015-12-23 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first EEMO was held in 1951.&lt;ref name="CECIMO-about-history"/&gt; The name changed in 1975 to EMO (Exposition Mondiale de la Machine-Outil).&lt;ref name="CECIMO-about-history"/&gt; Nowadays its scope extends beyond machine tools, and the acronym expansion is not used by CECIMO anymore.

'''Edward Porta''' (born November 13, 1954) was an [[Argentinian people|Argentinian]] [[textile]] [[merchant|trader]] based in the area of [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="USMS-20090409"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]]|title=Local Man Wanted by U.S. Marshals Featured on AMW.com|url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2009/040909f.htm|accessdate=July 29, 2010|date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of [[Conspiracy (crime)#Conspiracy to defraud|conspiracy to defraud]] the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] of more than $400,000. In February 2008, Porta [[prison escape|escaped]] from the [[minimum security]] camp at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lee|U.S. Penitentiary in Lee County]], [[Virginia]] and was profiled on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name="AMW-20090422"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[America's Most Wanted]]|title=Edward Porta|url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=64489|accessdate=July 28, 2010|date=April 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417210635/http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=64489|archivedate=April 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Porta was married and divorced four times, and has two children. He has five siblings who he claims he did not have contact with for 40 years, according to police.&lt;ref name="AMW-20090422" /&gt;

===Textile business===
Porta began his career working for his father's textile business. Police stated that he plotted to take advantage of federal programs such as the [[Export Credit Guarantee Program]],&lt;ref name="TimesNews-20080226" /&gt; intended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to assist small U.S. and foreign [[export]]ers of cotton to compete against large corporations. As president of Porta Textiles and Porta Technologies, he acted as both the importer and the exporter, according to the police. Along with money he defrauded from the government, police said that Porta also swindled banks and other businesses of over $2 million. After his arrest, Porta said that he moved around various parts of the United States and Latin America during his life.&lt;ref name="AMW-20090422" /&gt;

==Incarceration, escape and recapture==
Porta pleaded guilty on December 20, 2005 to the charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina|U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina]]. On May 2, 2007, the court in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] sentenced Porta to 38 months at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lee|U.S. Penitentiary in Lee County]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="USMS-20090409" /&gt; He was ordered to pay $2.9 million [[restitution]].&lt;ref name="SHJ-20090410"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|author=Craig Peters|title=Fugitive featured on Web site has ties to Spartanburg|url=http://www.goupstate.com/article/20090410/ARTICLES/904101068|accessdate=July 29, 2010|date=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porta was assigned federal inmate register number 18862-058.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inmate Locator: Edward Porta|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=Porta&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=Edward&amp;Race=&amp;Sex=&amp;Age=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities believe Porta had walked away from the [[minimum security]] camp at the penitentiary when he turned up missing during a 4 p.m. count on February 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="TimesNews-20080226"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Kingsport Times-News]]|author=Walter Littrell|title=Inmate on the lam from U.S. Penitentiary in Lee County|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9005309|accessdate=July 28, 2010|date=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been placed in the low security area and was given a significant amount of freedom because he had been convicted of a business-related [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref name="AMW-20090422" /&gt; He was scheduled to have been released on April 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="TimesNews-20080226" /&gt; Porta was profiled on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name="AMW-20090422" /&gt;

Porta was captured on May 28th, 2016 at a motel near Seattle Tacoma International airport after being featured on 'Washington's Most Wanted'&lt;ref name="MYNW-20160526"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[MyNorthwest.com]]|author=AP|title=8-year run after prison escape ends with arrest near Seattle|url=http://mynorthwest.com/301978/8-year-run-after-prison-escape-ends-with-arrest-near-seattle/|date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Prisoner at USP Lee Sentenced for 2008 Escape|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/former-prisoner-usp-lee-sentenced-2008-escape|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=24 March 2018|location=ABINGDON, VIRGINIA|language=en|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eloyi''' (also called Afao, Afo, Afu, Aho, Epe, Keffi) are an ethnic group of central [[Nigeria]].
About 100,000 people identify themselves as Eloyi.  They are related to the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic group.{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=412}}

==Language==

As of 2000, about 25,000 people in the [[Awe, Nigeria|Awe]] and [[Nasarawa, Nasarawa State|Nasarawa]] Local Government Areas (LGAs) of [[Nasarawa State]] and the [[Otukpo]] LGA of [[Benue State]] were reported to speak the [[Eloyi language]], in the [[Idomoid languages|Idomoid]] branch of the [[Benue–Congo languages |Benue-Congo]] group.
Many use [[Hausa language|Hausa]] as their second or primary language.{{sfn|Lewis|2009}} 

==History==

Traditionally, most of the Eloyi lived in a {{convert|15|mi}} range of rocky hills in what today is Nasarawa State.
They revolted against the British in 1918 and were forced to leave their homeland.  
Today they are scattered in different parts of Nasarawa and Benue states, although some have moved back to the original hills.  
The British divided the Eloyi into ten village areas in 1932, appointing a head for each village, but these village heads were not recognized by the Eloyi.{{sfn|Eloyi - Joshua}}

==Society==

The Eloyi are one of the more economically advanced of the [[Benue Valley]] tribes.  In the hills they grow guinea corn, cotton, yams, and tobacco.
They practice in weaving and dying, producing cloth that is much in demand and can be traded.
The Eloyi villages in the hills are made up of round huts with conical thatched roofs grouped around a central courtyard.
In the plains the Eloyi are mostly farmers, selling dried fish and palm oil for cash.
The plains Eloyi build large houses within compounds and fortify their villages.{{sfn|Eloyi - Joshua}}

==Organization and beliefs==

The village is the largest political unit, independent of its neighbors.  A chief is assisted by a council of elders in administering the village and resolving disputes.
The ''gado'' is the father of the village, the authority on customs and law, in charge of planting and harvest rites.
Most Eloyi practice their traditional beliefs, which center on the god Owo, who is symbolized by a white silk cotton tree or a fig tree.
They worship their ancestors, whose spirits are thought to live on and to require food and care.
Religious rites include masked impersonation of ancestors, witchcraft, magic, and divination with strings.
A small number of Eloyi have adopted the Muslim religion.{{sfn|Eloyi - Joshua}}

'''Freemasonry in Barbados''' is one of the oldest established organisations in the country. [[Regular Freemasonry]] is controlled from London and Edinburgh by the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (UGLE) and the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] through local [[Provincial Grand Lodges (UGLE)|Provincial Grand Lodge]]s. More recently [[Prince Hall Freemasonry]] has also been established on the island.

==History==
As a fraternal organisation, Freemasonry was introduced to the island in 1740 by [[Alexander Irvine (freemason)|Alexander Irvine]] (c. 1694-1743).&lt;ref name="Barbados Heritage"&gt;{{cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean  Publishers Limited|page=82|isbn=0-333-92068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first lodge formed was the St. Michael's Lodge No 94 (or No 186).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masonictravels.com/2006/07/masonic-history-in-barbados.html |title=Masonic History in Barbados |publisher=MasonicTravels.com |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105152708/http://www.masonictravels.com/2006/07/masonic-history-in-barbados.html |archivedate=November 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this lodge ceased working in the nineteenth century.  Following the closure of this lodge, the Albion Lodge No 196 (UGLE) was formed in 1790, and now remains the longest established lodge in Barbados.

The St. Michael's [[churchyard]] which contains a [[burial vault (tomb)|vault]] where Irvine is entombed has continued to be used by the Barbadian Masonic community.&lt;ref name="Barbados Heritage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.districtgrandlodge.org/history.html |title=District Grand Lodge of Barbados and Eastern Caribbean |publisher=District Grand Lodge of Barbados and Eastern Caribbean |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417001204/http://www.districtgrandlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions==

===United Grand Lodge of England===
'''The District Grand Lodge of Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean''' is the local masonic authority under the English Grand Lodge. It is responsible in Barbados for six Craft lodges,&lt;ref&gt;Lodges officially listed on the [http://www.districtgrandlodge.org/clp/barbados-craft-lodges.html District website].&lt;/ref&gt; and (through its associated [[Holy Royal Arch]] authority) three Royal Arch chapters. Albion Lodge No 196 (see above) is the oldest. Two lodges meet at Bridgetown, and the other four meet at Belleville. One of the lodges has a particular focus on masonic research. The District Grand Lodge also controls Freemasonry in eight other Caribbean nations.

===Grand Lodge of Scotland===
'''The District Grand Lodge of Barbados''' is the local masonic authority under the Scottish Grand Lodge. It is responsible for six Craft lodges, all of which meet in Bridgetown. The former [[Governor-General of Barbados]], [[Elliott Belgrave|Sir Elliott Belgrave]] is a member and former [[District Grand Master]].&lt;ref&gt;See reports [http://www.pglfk.org/index.php/barbados here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince Hall Freemasonry===
'''The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Caribbean''' is the newest masonic authority on Barbados. In 1960 a Barbadian educator, Mr G. Halley Marville, was introduced to Prince Hall Freemasonry in California, whilst studying in the United States of America. This led eventually to the consecration of the first Prince Hall lodge in Barbados in 1965, under the authority of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the State of New York.&lt;ref&gt;See full history at the jurisdiction's own [https://sites.google.com/site/phglocarib/home].&lt;/ref&gt; An autonomous Grand Lodge was formed on 24 April 1993, and now controls lodges throughout the Caribbean, from its headquarters in Barbados. It has twenty lodges across the region, of which five are in Barbados.

'''French immigration to Jamaica''' began in 1791 when problems broke out in [[Saint Domingue]], the French part of the island of [[Hispaniola]], equivalent of modern [[Haiti]]. Thousands of French people fled from Saint Domingue and arrived in Jamaica.

==History==
In 1694, Jamaica came under attack by the French, led by Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste du Casse]]. The French far outnumbered their opponents, but were eventually turned back, after losing hundreds of men in the conflict; they were successful in damaging or destroying many [[sugar estate]]s and [[plantation]]s on Jamaica, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/north-america/caribbean-atlantic/jamaica/jamaica-history-heritage.html#ixzz2lZrmbyvR Jamaica - History and Heritage &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gav-Paradhi''' are one of the [[Pardhi|Paradhi]] [[Tribe]]s of [[India]]. Unlike the other Paradhi tribes they were not classed as a '[[Denotified Tribes|Criminal Tribe]]' by the [[British Raj]] government, under [[Criminal Tribes Act]] 1871. This was because unlike the other Paradhi tribes like the [[Phase Pardhi]], the Gav-Paradhi had become settled agriculturalists.

The Gav-Paradhi live primarily in the [[Amravati District]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41347">'''Gender policing''' is the imposition or enforcement of [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender expression]]s on an individual who is perceived as [[gender variance|not adequately performing]], through appearance or behavior, the [[assigned sex|sex that was assigned to them at birth]] (see [[gender performativity]]). Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the [[gender binary]]. According to [[Judith Butler]], rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Butler|url=http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf|editor=Laura J. Nicholson|title=Gender Trouble Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|publisher=Routledge|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender mainstreaming]] is a [[public policy]] concept, whereas gender policing is a more general [[social phenomenon]].

It is common for normative gender performances of gender to be encouraged and rewarded, while non-normative performances are discouraged through punishment or generally negative reactions. Policing of non-normative performances ranges in intensity from relatively minor discouraging comments to brutal acts of violence. Tactics of gender policing also vary widely, depending in part on the perceived gender of the individual target.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|title=The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays - Assault On Gay America |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heteronormativity and the gender binary==

Gender policing aims to keep gender roles rigid and aligned according to the [[gender binary]]. The gender binary is the idea that gender exists as the opposition between man and woman. [[Heteronormativity]], as an institution, is an extension of this belief that posits that gender and sexuality are expressions of biology. This functionalism of biology asserts that male and female genitalia only serve the purpose of procreation, which creates gender roles that manifest from a perceived innate desire, giving sexuality a specific purpose within society.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Gayle Rubin]]'s writing in "The Traffic in Women" links the creation of the gender binary to the subordination of women in western society. Rubin studied the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Levi Strauss]] to gain a better understanding of the creation of the "sex/gender system". Rubin found that "woman" was a role created in opposition to "man" and served the purpose of building power, trade relationships, and mutual aid through the exchange of women by marriage. These [[Kinship]] systems necessitated rules, which had to be policed to ensure their continued survival. These rules crystalized into heteronormativity, culturally instilling the rules for accepted sexuality in western society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/the-rraffic-in-women.pdf|contribution=The Traffic in Women|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender binary in western society was formalized from the interpretations of men and women during the [[hunter-gatherer]] ages. During this [[Mesolithic]] or Middle Stone Age in North-West Europe, hunting and gathering food was a prominent survival strategy. Early interpretations of these survival techniques is one of the main reasons for the current idea of the gender binary within western society. In his review of the ethnography of gathering shellfish, Clive Bonsall incorrectly presumed that women and children were primarily gatherers and men were the hunters do to their stronger skill set. These assumptions of past societies shaped the current structure of western society into the beliefs that men are the providers and women are the supporters. Additionally in the idea of heterosexual marriage as the societal norm came from the analysis of the interactions between different Mesolithic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Hannah|date=2005|title=Straight down the line? A queer consideration of hunter-gatherer studies in north-west Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240500395862|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=630–636|doi=10.1080/00438240500395862|issn=0043-8243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mentality that strengthens the idea of binary gender within western society is the warrior-breeder relationship. In this mentality, masculinity is characterized by the traits of the model warrior: strong and fearless, yet disposable. Meanwhile, femininity and womanhood revolve around reproduction. In this relationship, there are only two types of people; therefore, two genders. This dichotomy is valued because it keeps society safe in times of war. The warriors fight and protect while the breeders replace the fallen warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=6. Gender Terrorism, Gender Sacrifice Getting beyond Zero-Sum Heterosexuality|date=2014-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/digb16840-007|work=Love and War|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231538404|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the works of LGB activism during the late 1980’s to 1990’s, the [[queer theory]] was created along with the influential work of Foucault and Sedgewick. The queer theory creates a space outside the gender binary. This theory deconstructs and discredits the idea of a gender binary. Disregarding the gender binary caused fears within the western society, ultimately leading to gender policing in order to maintain the idea of binary gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt183q5wt|title=Gender Politics|last=Monro|first=Surya|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9781849644952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man and woman as categories can not exist without the other to enforce what they are and are not. The same can be said of heterosexuality and homosexuality. These categories are created out of their opposition, forming power dynamics. [[Michel Foucault]] referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spargo, Tamsin. Post Modern Encounters Foucault and Queer Theory. New York: Totem, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity==

[[Patriarchy|Patriarchal]] societies perpetuate masculine dominance in all aspects of life. Patriarchy privileges masculine thought and expression creating a gender hierarchy where women and the feminine are subordinated. The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] describes a hierarchy even within masculinity itself. Hegemonic masculinity allows for the terms and expression of masculinity to be renegotiated according to time, culture, and class status, allowing for the rationalization of its continued dominance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist, [[Raewyn Connell]] created the theory of hegemonic masculinity in order to explain the relationships between men and women and between the class of men within a patriarchal system. This theory is based on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony –– conformity or subordination of one group which creates class-based domination. Connell’s theory explains the ways in which ideal or normalized masculine traits have the highest values in western society. These masculine attributes include wealth, control over resources, fertility, attractiveness, heterosexuality, physical strength, and emotional detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400842629|title=The New Arab Man|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2012-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400842629|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrakis Z. Demetriou further divided hegemonic masculinity into two types: external and internal. External hegemonic masculinity refers to the subordination of women under men. Internal hegemonic masculinity is the spectrum of masculinity seen within men. This spectrum is defined by the amount of power and masculinity a man holds. The patriarchy needs hegemonic masculinity in order to maintain power. In order to keep this power, men must be policed and women must me dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=R. W.|last2=Messerschmidt|first2=James W.|date=2005|title=Hegemonic Masculinity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=6|pages=829–859|doi=10.1177/0891243205278639|issn=0891-2432|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ideal form of masculinity is seen by patriarchal power, men that fit in this norm are seen as what a human should embody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemon|first=Jennifer|date=1995|title=Masculinity in Crisis?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4065897|journal=Agenda|issue=24|pages=61|doi=10.2307/4065897|issn=1013-0950}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gender hierarchy created by patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity creates competition for dominance resulting in the policing of gender and sexuality. Policing of masculinity in a heteronormative society reinforces the gender binary. Individuals seeking to reaffirm their position in a masculine hierarchy seek out and police individuals performing inadequately. Those performing inadequately must either conform to the accepted forms of gender and sexual expression or risk violence and ostracism.&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

Fathers are more likely than mothers to enforce gender boundaries, or police the gendered expressions of their children. Second, both fathers and mothers enforce gender boundaries more frequently with sons than with daughters.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Research on the topic of parental gender policing has shown that female children who display traditionally masculine traits or behaviors receive more social and parental acceptance than male children who exhibit traditionally feminine tendencies.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many scholars on the subject argue that this is due to the greater value assigned to "masculine" traits or behaviors compared to "feminine" ones, and/or beliefs that "tomboyism" is temporary.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At least one study indicates that parents across various social locations celebrate and encourage their preschool age daughters to engage in gender nonconformity, such as wearing sports-themed clothing and participating in traditionally male activities.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; However, other research indicates that in part due to peer and parental pressures, "tomboys", or female children with "masculine" traits or behavioral tendencies, frequently either abandon these tendencies in adolescence, or adopt a more feminine performance but retain many masculine skills and traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pressures to conform to gender norms increase with age, and often manifest in these children being "instructed or shamed to conform to traditional femininity – in dress, appearance, posture, manner, interests, and dating."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychoanalysis== 

Fields of knowledge that claim to be universal are still created within societal frameworks that have their own rules and biases. A patriarchal society gives privilege to masculine thought and excludes other points of view and histories. All discourse created in a patriarchal society can be said to acquiesce to hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Michel Foucault viewed [[Psychoanalysis]] as a secular confession concerned with finding our natural sexual selves. The problem, Foucault argued, is that sexuality is cultural and any narrative created around it gives the subject the illusion of identity rather than experience. Psychoanalysis conducted in a hetero-normative society would view any deviation as a failing to achieve that ideal. Rather than someone being seen as performing an act, they would be seen as embodying that which society deemed inadequate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Gayle Rubin wrote about Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory in "The Traffic In Women". Rubin states that [[Jacques Lacan]]'s analysis of Freud views the [[Oedipus complex]] as the crisis experienced by a child when internalizing kinship rules. The child becomes aware of the sex/gender system and organizes itself accordingly. [[Neurosis]] is seen as having an understanding of this system yet failing to adapt to it. Lacan's separation of the [[Phallus]] from the physical penis elucidates societies privileging of the masculine and gender's separation from biology. In Rubin's view psychiatry further policed accepted gender and sexual expression by deeming non normative behavior as mentally and emotionally stunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf|title=Thinking Sex|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also saw that this system of internalizing norms privileged heterosexual masculinity while outlining the psychic oppression society inflicts on women and femininity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Intersectionality ==

Gender policing affects different social identifications in different ways. Along with gender, characteristic attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender identity]], [[Social class|class]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, [[creed]], and disability interact with each other and are affected differently by gender policing. The effect of intersection of these social categories are studied in [[intersectionality]] theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Understanding intersectionality within gender policing can be done by tracing back and analyzing the relation between race and gender in history. Race and gender over time produced hierarchies within themselves. Similar to the way the classification of "man" cannot exist without "woman", "white" people cannot exist without "black" people. Race as a classification arose from European capitalist colonialism. European colonists deemed those who weren't "white", primitive and deserving of domination and "civilizing". Global colonialism by European capitalists imposed European ways of knowing and being on the peoples they colonized. This included a racialized and patriarchal conception of gender. The view of colonized peoples as primitive created a distinction between "white" (human) and "black" (property or inhuman). The view of "black" as other than human excluded "black" people from classifications of gender. In western society, being "white" and middle class continue to inform gender norms, leaving "non-white" people unable to perform accepted [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]].

In modern day times, intersectionality now touches upon various other forms of human characterizations, affecting people in countless different ways. How a white transgender woman may experience gender policing is going to differ greatly from how an asian heterosexual woman might (etc). 

==Socialization==

An individual's expression of gender is often first policed by their parent(s), as well as other elder authorities such as teachers and day care providers, at a very young age. Gender policing is part of the process of "gendering" children, or socializing them in a way considered conventionally appropriate to their assigned sex. Once children are taught gender norms and experience their enforcement, they are likely to begin policing others – both their peers and their elders.

=== Early Childhood ===
Gender policing begins with gender enforcing from parents teaching their children what is "masculine" and what is "feminine" in the traditional sense of these terms. These traditional ideas of gender are reinforced through practices such as referring to children as "boys" and "girls" which "makes sex/ gender the central component of how kids think of themselves, understand their social group, and view themselves through their parents’ eyes."&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd98k|title=Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Demeter Press|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Fiona Joy|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Friedman|editor-first2=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jane Ward, professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside, writes in her chapter of the book ''Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices'', even parents who hope to redefine "boyhood" or "girlhood" (such as through allowing a "tomboy" daughter, or dressing a son in dresses, for example), still reinforce the concept of gender as a binary which is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; The gender binary is already enforced in obvious places, such as in the segregation of toys in stores, for example.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Ethnographic research in preschools has also contributed to the body of knowledge related to gender policing. This research has suggested that teachers give their students gendered instructions about what to do with their bodies. Across several schools, teachers gave boys explicit bodily instructions more frequently than girls, indicating that boys' bodies are policed more often than girls'.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, K. 1998. Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools. ''American Sociological Review'', 63(4), 494-511.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be because teachers were more forceful with their instructions to girls, who were also usually quicker to follow instructions, thus teachers did not need to repeat themselves as often. Teachers were also more likely to direct boys to cease behaviors (e.g. running, throwing objects), whereas they were more apt to instruct girls to alter them. For example, girls were given directive bodily instructions such as "talk to her, don't yell, sit here, pick that up, be careful, be gentle, give it to me, put it down there."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; As a result, a wider range of potential activities is available to boys than girls, because although they are dissuaded from some, they are not directed to engage in specific activities as often as girls are. According to Martin, the scholar and sociologist who conducted this research, "Gendering of the body in childhood is the foundation on which further gendering of the body occurs throughout the life course. The gendering of children's bodies makes gender differences feel and appear natural, which allows for such bodily differences to emerge throughout the life course."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

Relatively recent efforts have been made to limit gender policing, particularly in childhood. Sweden's reformation of their school system in 1962 resulted in a new curriculum which included objectives to limit gender policing in early education. Within this new curriculum it was determined that "Pre-schools should work to counteract traditional gender and gender roles. Girls and boys in pre-schools should have the same opportunities to try and develop their abilities and interests without being limited by stereotyped gender roles." &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayne|first=Emma|date=|title=Gender Pedagogy in Swedish Pre-Schools: An Overview|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-009-9076-x#citeas|journal=Springer Link|volume=Vol. 26|pages=130-140|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preschools, elementary, and secondary schools aim to reduce the gender policing placed onto children, but through doing this must show how teachers and other pedagogical adults may accidentally reinforce gender stereotypes. Tools teachers use to combat this include practices such as keeping journals and videotaping classroom interactions (a practice proposed by Susanne Rithander). A general pedagogical practice in these Swedish schools in called ''compensatory pedagogy'', which plays off the idea that, per traditional gender roles, boys are encouraged to maintain autonomy while girls are encouraged to maintain closeness with others. ''Compensatory pedagogy'' challenges these traditional gender roles by encouraging girls to maintain autonomy and boys to build closeness with others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Some parents have attempted to limit gender policing through their parenting styles, as is the case with Storm's parents, who chose no to gender their child but instead to wait until their child could decide for his/herself. Unlike the relative success so far of Swedish schools in limiting gender policing, individual efforts by Kathy and David, Storm's parents, faced huge media backlash. In the chapter titled ''Get Your Gender Binary Off My Childhood!: Towards a Movement for Childrenʹs Gender Self-Determination'', Ward shows how Storm's parents were often called deceitful and manipulative, as Ward puts it, "For not revealing what they knew about Storm’s genitals, Kathy and David were accused of hiding Storm’s very selfhood." &lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is a developmental stage in which [[peer group]]s are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It is also a stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative gender expressions and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.

''[[Dude, You're a Fag]]'', a book by [[CJ Pascoe]], examines [[masculinity]] and gender policing in high schools through [[ethnographic]] research. Pascoe largely focuses on high school boys' use of the [[Faggot (slang)|fag]] [[epithet]] to establish their own masculinity by questioning or challenging others'. In this context, the use of the fag epithet is a form of gender policing, frequently applied to boys who lack heterosexual prowess or are deemed inadequately masculine or strong. According to Pascoe, "[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dude You're A Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007), by C.J. Pascoe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of male students of a co-educational, Catholic high school demonstrates insights from adolescent males themselves in regard to gender policing. This study highlights the gender policing of males by each other through exploring the types of bullying being practiced. Forms of bullying (and gender policing) come from accusations of males being homosexual. One participant in the study explains that he was bullied for dancing ballet and described his bullying as "Just a lot to do with being a woman", thus showing an association of specific activities with a specific gender (and that deviance from typical gender roles proves a perceived grounds for bullying). &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Wayne|date=2000-01-01|title=Policing Masculinities: Investigating the Role of Homophobia and Heteronormativity in the Lives of Adolescent School Boys|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3149/jms.0802.213|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=213–236|doi=10.3149/jms.0802.213|issn=1060-8265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the practice of conducting interviews, the study briefly explores an observed policing of male behavior by females. One interviewee "appears to be drawing attention to the different norms for governing the conduct of girls who police boys’ bullying practices through a condemnation of violent behaviors".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interviewees also draw attention to the confirmation and reinforcement of attitudes and practices considered "masculine" within males. In addition, these "masculine" identifiers are further enforced through female interaction and confirmation. In conducting these interviews, it is also found how adolescents view the stereotypical concept of masculinity as a concept which is ingrained early on in their lives and “passed on from their fathers".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, gender policing generally becomes more subtle. However, for an individual whose gender is perceived as ambiguous, blatant forms still exist. These range from curious inquiries by children (e.g. "Are you a boy or a girl?") to gender policing in bathrooms (discussed in the following section). People who are gender-normative in appearance experience primarily behavioral gender policing, such as reminders to act in a more (or less) feminine or masculine manner. Men are more often dissuaded and shamed for feminine behavior than women are for masculine behavior. It is theorized that this is due, at least in part, to the higher societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kane, E.|year=2006|title=No Way My Boys Are Going to be like That!" Parents' Responses to Children's Gender Nonconformity|journal=Gender and Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, C. L.|year=1998|title=Tomboy Resistance and Conformity: Agency in Social Psychological Gender Theory|journal=Gender and Society|volume=12|issue=5|pages=528–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender policing has been reinforced in adults for many years. As [[Angela Davis|Angela Y. Davis]] points out, early women's prisons relied on gender policing as a means of reformation. The first women's reformatory in the U.S. opened in Indiana and included areas designed as kitchens, living rooms, and nurseries. The idea was to train women about domesticity through activities such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Are Prisons Obsolete?|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Publishers Group Canada|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58322-581-3|location=Toronto, ON|pages=60-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex verification in sports|Sex testing]] and verification in sports and athletics shows gender policing as a practice still relevant to many countries and athletic organizations in recent history. In the case of the nineteen-year-old Missouri runner Helen Stephens in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]], who finished first place in the 100-meter race, many questioned her sex because they could not fathom a the concept of a woman running so quickly. Sex testing and verification has existed throughout human history, even being traced back to practices in ancient Greek contests. Within these Greek traditions, women were deterred from participation and even spectatorship at times. In the examples of both Greek practices and the story of Helen Stephens of Missouri, it can be seen how women are often more likely to be subject to sex verification processes and accusations of deceit (i.e. women are often accused of actually being men disguised as women; men are not often accused of being women disguised as men).&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf|title=Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women's Sports|last=PIEPER|first=LINDSAY PARKS|date=2016|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252040221|doi=10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf.5#metadata_info_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals==
The severity of gender policing is often proportional to the extremity of non-normativity. For example, [[transgender]] individuals are likely to be victims of the most extreme and violent forms of gender policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incite-national.org/sites/default/files/incite_files/resource_docs/3515_toolkitrev-policinggender.pdf|title=Policing Gender|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research regarding conformity pressures and gender resistance among [[transfeminine]] individuals (those who are assigned the male sex at birth but identify as more feminine than masculine) indicates that these persons experienced "intense and pervasive" pressures to conform to traditional masculinity, and feared exposure of their gender identity would result in physical danger or loss of legal, economic, or social standing.&lt;ref name="Gagne"&gt;Gagné, P., &amp; Tewksbury, R. 1998. Conformity Pressures and Gender Resistance among Transgendered Individuals. ''Social Problems'', 45(1), 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transgender individuals must often choose between self-preservation and expressing their self-identified gender.&lt;ref name="Gagne" /&gt;

Gender policing is especially prevalent in bathrooms due to the increased salience of gender in explicitly gendered environments (and the forced binary of "men" and "women").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/09/02/guest-post-go-where-sex-gender-and-toilets/|title=Go Where? Sex, Gender, and Toilets - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this issue is frequently encountered by transgender and [[genderqueer]] individuals, to a lesser extent, it is also experienced by persons with [[androgynous]] or gender ambiguous appearances. For individuals with non-normative gender identities, the choice of which bathroom to use is often laden with "anxiety, ambivalence, and anticipated harassment."&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance"&gt;Embodied Resistance: Challenging the Norms, Breaking the Rules (2011), edited by C. Bobel and S. Kwan.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for gender-normative people to alert security of the presence of transgender (or androgynous) individuals in a bathroom, regardless of whether the bathroom they are using conforms to their sex or to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance" /&gt; According to [[Judith Halberstam|Jack Halberstam]], the main distinction between gender policing in the women's room and in the men's room is that in the former, not only trans women, but all gender ambiguous females are scrutinized, whereas in the latter, biological males are less frequently deemed out of place.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity"&gt;Female Masculinity (1998), by Judith Halberstam.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to trans women in the women's room, trans men in the men's room are likely to be less scrutinized because men are less vigilant about intruders than women.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; However, a trans man in the men's room is more likely to be met with violence if he does not succeed in [[Passing (sociology)|passing]].&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; 

Transwomen and transmen are “six times more likely to experience discrimination” than non-trans people.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender-Baird|first=Kyla|date=2015-09|title=Peeing under surveillance: bathrooms, gender policing, and hate violence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0966369X.2015.1073699?needAccess=true&amp;|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=7|pages=983–988|doi=10.1080/0966369x.2015.1073699|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 incidents of anti-LGBT hate crimes were reported to the [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] in 2013. In 2014, there was a national study of trans violence discovered with the results of  “53% of respondents reporting verbal assault and 8% physical assault in a place of public accommodation”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. As a site where gender norms are policed, bathrooms are the most common public accommodation where trans people and gender non-conforming people experience hate violence. People tend to believe that there is a connection between genitals and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2013-09-24|title=Doing Gender, Determining Gender|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243213503203|journal=Gender &amp; Society|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=32–57|doi=10.1177/0891243213503203|issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the gender segregation of bathrooms is based on genital configuration. Because of this “match” between genitals and gender, trans people often are labeled as “deceivers” and blamed for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathers|first=Lain A. B.|date=2017-04-03|title=Bathrooms, Boundaries, and Emotional Burdens: Cisgendering Interactions Through the Interpretation of Transgender Experience|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.295|journal=Symbolic Interaction|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1002/symb.295|issn=0195-6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a trans or androgynous person is questioned in the bathroom, the reaction is “not to reassess the arbitrary nature of segregating bathrooms by sex but to violently eject the trans or gender non-conforming person”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Using a public bathroom is no longer a simple matter for trans and gender non-conforming people. 

As of March 2017, 19 states (California, Nevada, Hawaii, New York, etc.), the District of Columbia and over 200 cities have enforced the anti-discrimination law toward transgender people allowing them to use any public restroom that corresponds to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most public accommodations changed their restroom signs where there are both genders and the text “Gender Neutral Restroom” or “Inclusive Restroom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/transgender-bathroom-law-facts-myths/index.html|title=3 myths in the transgender bathroom debate|last=CNN|first=Emanuella Grinberg and Dani Stewart,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was passed because of the March 2016 “[[Bathroom bill|Bathroom Bill]]” in North Carolina. The bill argued that banning people from using public restrooms of their choice due to the biological sex listed on their birth certificates (genitals vs. gender) was unreasonable, therefore, it launched transgender rights into the national spotlight. 

== Fashion and Modern Opposition of Gender Policing ==
In 1924, gender norms accepted and re enforced ideologies that shadowed Freud’s hegemonic thesis that “biology is the key determinant of gender identity”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3672297/future-gender-norms/|title=The Past, Present and Future of Gender Norms|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These norms were imbedded into cultural regularity, affecting gender identity in everyday life, law and politics. Gender policing strategies enforced these norms, and a prevalent tactic was to use culturally obligatory [[Dress code|dress codes]] as a tool in forcing people into gender binaries. However progressive movements throughout history have worked vigorously to defy policing, combating restrictive norms through disregard and reformation of policed gender standards. Following of Freud’s theory has steadily begun to dwindle and new studies are beginning to reveal a popular uprising theory that individuals make their own decisions as to which gender distinguishments apply to them.  Modern opposition of gender norms are erasing the aged policing of conforming to the standards of one’s sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to a study by Intelligence Group, a consumer insights company, “More than two-thirds of people ages 14 to 34 agree that gender does not have to define a person in the way that it used to… and 6 in 10 say that men and women do not need to conform to traditional gender roles or behaviors anymore.” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style|title=For These Millennials, Gender Norms Have Gone Out Of Style|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Gender Policing Dress Codes ===
Older fashion protocols systematically enforced normative gender binaries, confining people to dress and accessorize in a way that connected to their sex. Society would use gender policing tactics to enforce cultural and societal acceptance of a gendered dress code. Women were to dress in a feminine style, while men had to style themselves in a masculine way. The way one dressed was meant to represent their sex and it’s stereotypes, “Circumstantial or societal norms dictate the outfits we choose to wear, often reflecting the expectations we are held to” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uresearch.unm.edu/breaking-gender-norms-through-fashion.pdf|title=Breaking Gender Norms through Fashion: Lessons from Georgia O’Keeffe|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its only recently that most [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary]] type laws, laws used to enforce “gender appropriate clothes” and arrest people who “impersonate” another gender, have been overturned. For example, “a person perceived as male who dressed in clothing customarily designed for women could technically be arrested in New York for “impersonating a female” as recently as 2011 — the remnants of a 19th century statewide law prohibiting wearing “the dress of the opposite sex.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/arresting-dress-timeline-anti-cross-dressing-laws-u-s|title=Arresting dress: A timeline of anti-cross-dressing laws in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cultural policing tactics such as slut shaming, [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]] are still used today to police fashion. There is still a long way to go for those pushing for the elimination of policed gendered dress codes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Using Fashion in Modern Opposition ====
This reformation campaign against gender policed conformity has found a focus in developing cultural acceptance for fluidity in modern cultural dress codes. Nowadays decisions on gender identity are seen as self made and a form of “self expression”. A prevalent way of expressing ones identity and not conforming to gender norms is through personal choice in style. These choices include apparel, accessories and beauty habits. Style has a “symbolic meaning” of self expression, “giving us a means to cultivate our own visions of the culture we experience around us”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. Therefor, fashion nonconformity has expansively become wonted and accepted by a rising number of millennials who believe in bending past policed gendered binaries. They do this by ignoring the outdated dress codes that were previously used to confine someone to their gender identity. In disregarding a dress code that has been used as a weapon in enforcing gender binary, millennials have found a powerful opposition to gender policing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;


Modern gender-specific fashion has become more flexible to personal preference, becoming visibly more directed against old gendered style constraints. The refusal to conform to the rules of outdated fashion protocol is being embraced by [[a la mode]] fashion and mainstream style. A recent pattern in clothing and accessories that transcend gender style norms has become steadily vogue and evidently pioneering fashion trends have increasingly grown accepting to the fusion of normally gender specific style details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/06/famous-women-who-have-worn-menswear#11|title=Famous Women Have Been Defying Gender Norms and Rocking Menswear for Years|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|date=|website=Vanities|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trendy nonconforming styles empower women to dress in an inclusively “masculine” manner and enable men to adapt “feminine” attributes in their style, for example women choosing to wear suits to work, or men wearing nail polish, etc. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Image:Scots Gaelic speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|336px|right|Geographic Distribution of Gaelic speakers in Scotland (2011)]]
The '''Gàidhealtachd''' ({{IPA-gd|ˈkɛːəl̪ˠt̪əxk|-|Gaidhealtachd.ogg}}; [[Scottish English|English]]: ''Gaeldom''), sometimes known as '''A' Ghàidhealtachd''' (English: ''The Gaeldom''), usually refers to the [[Highlands and Islands]] of [[Scotland]] and especially the [[Scottish Gaelic]]-speaking culture of the area. The corresponding [[Irish language|Irish]] word ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' refers strictly to Irish-speaking areas.

The term is also used to apply to the Scottish Gaelic-speaking Canadian areas of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Glengarry County, Ontario]].

"The ''Gàidhealtachd''" is not truly interchangeable with "[[Scottish Highlands]]" as it refers to the [[language]] and not to the [[geography]]. Also, many parts of the highlands no longer have substantial Gaelic-speaking populations, and some parts of what is now thought of as the Highlands have long been [[Scots language|Scots-speaking]] or English-speaking areas: [[Caithness]], [[Cromarty]], [[Grantown-on-Spey]], [[Campbeltown]], etc.{{dubious|note that Campbeltown was still 50% Gaelic speaking into the 19th century and Caithness for many centuries had Gaelic and Scots/Norn existing side by side|date=July 2017}} Conversely, several Gaelic-speaking communities lie outwith the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Outer Hebrides]] council areas, for example [[Isle of Arran]] and parts of [[Perth and Kinross]], not to mention [[Nova Scotia]], [[North Carolina]], and other areas to which there was significant migration. ''Gàidhealtachd'' also increasingly refers to any region where Scottish Gaelic is spoken as a [[first language]] by much of the population. {{Where?|date=September 2013}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

''Galldachd'' (''Gall-dom'', ''Gall'' referring to a non-[[Gaels|Gael]]) is often used for the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], although it is also notable that the [[Hebrides]] are known as ''Innse Gall'' due to the historical presence of [[Norsemen]].

==History==
Until a few centuries ago, the Gàidhealtachd would have included much of modern-day Scotland north of the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[Galloway]] (up until the 18th century, and maybe later), excepting the [[Northern Isles]], as evidenced by the prevalence of Gaelic-derived place names throughout most of Scotland and contemporary accounts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} These include [[Dundee]] from the Gaelic ''Dùn Deagh'', [[Inverness]] from ''Inbhir Nis'', [[Argyll]] from ''Earra-Ghàidheal'', [[Galloway]] from ''Gall-Ghaidhealaibh'', and possibly [[Stirling]] from ''Sruighlea'' (though the etymology is uncertain; see article). Gaelic speakers from what would be considered traditionally English-speaking/non-Gaelic regions today included [[George Buchanan]] (from Stirlingshire), [[Robert the Bruce]] (from Galloway), and [[Margaret McMurray]] (from Ayrshire).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For historical reasons, including the influence of a [[Scots language|Scots]]-speaking [[court (royal)|court]] in [[Edinburgh]] and the [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] of [[merchant]] [[burgh]]s in much of the south and east, the Gàidhealtachd has been reduced massively to the present region of the Outer Hebrides, the [[Northwest Highlands]], the [[Skye]] and [[Loch Alsh]] and [[Argyll and Bute]], with small Gaelic populations existing in [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The [[Highland Clearances]] of the 18th and 19th centuries also contributed to the decline of the language, as they reduced the population of the Scottish Highlands, which were predominantly Gaelic-speaking at the time.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Canadian Gàidhealtachd==
{{main|Canadian Gaelic}}[[File:Distribution-gd-CA.png|thumb|330px|right|The Gaelic-speaking areas of Maritime Canada.]]
Scottish Gaelic has survived among communities descended from immigrants in parts of [[Nova Scotia]] (especially [[Cape Breton Island]]), [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] in present-day [[Ontario]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  The [[Codroy Valley]] on the [[island of Newfoundland]] had a Gaelic-speaking minority until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.library.mun.ca/1319/|title=Some aspects of the Scottish Gaelic traditions of the Codroy Valley, Newfoundland|first=Bennett,|last=Margaret|date=5 June 1975|website=research.library.mun.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kazakhstan]] is a source, transit, and destination country for men, [[trafficking in women|women]], and [[trafficking of children|girls]] [[human trafficking|trafficked]] from [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Ukraine]] to Kazakhstan and on to [[Russia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (U.A.E.) for purposes of [[commercial sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labor]] in the construction and agricultural industries. Kazakhstani men and women are trafficked internally and to the U.A.E., [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]], Russia, and [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] for purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Kazakhstan". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 4, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Kazakhstan]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Kazakhstan demonstrated increasing efforts to combat trafficking over the previous year, specifically by improving efforts to convict and sentence traffickers to time in prison. The number of traffickers convicted in 2007 significantly increased, and the majority of convicted traffickers served adequate sentences in prison. The government also took steps to address government officials’ complicity in trafficking. Kazakhstan allocated nearly $35,000 for victim assistance during 2007.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Kazakhstan government made significant progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the reporting period. Kazakhstan prohibits trafficking in persons for both labor and sexual exploitation through Articles 128, 133, 125(3)(b), 126(3)(b), and 270 of its [[Parliament of Kazakhstan|penal code]], which prescribe penalties of up to 15 years’ imprisonment – penalties sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police conducted 22 trafficking investigations and initiated 16 prosecution cases in 2007, compared to 13 investigations and seven prosecutions in 2006. Courts convicted 19 trafficking offenders in 2007, a significant improvement from one conviction in 2006. Of the 19 convicted trafficking offenders, one was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment, four were sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment, five were sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, four were sentenced to six years’ imprisonment, two were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and three were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. During the year there were reports of trafficking complicity of some border guards, migration police, prosecutors, and police. The government prosecuted three corrupt police officials, including the former head of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit in [[Almaty]]. One officer was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment and two officers fled authorities and remained in hiding at the time of this report.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government improved efforts to assist and protect victims during the year. The law provides that victims are not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked; however, [[NGO]]s continued to report that some victims, as the result of not being identified by authorities, were detained in jail and prevented from leaving the country for periods ranging from a few days to several months. NGOs reported that while law enforcement officials have improved their use of formal procedures to identify victims among vulnerable populations, some labor trafficking victims remain unidentified. In 2007, the police formally identified 87 victims of labor trafficking and 25 victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The government permitted identified victims to remain in Kazakhstan for the duration of the criminal investigation. Many victims refuse to testify for fear of retribution and Kazakhstan has not devoted sufficient resources to address the physical safety of the identified trafficking victim.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government conducted active public awareness efforts. In 2007, the government funded the production of approximately 3,000 booklets that were distributed by NGOs among groups vulnerable to trafficking, including people in rural areas and school children. The government provided at least $12,500 for anti-trafficking NGOs to conduct awareness campaigns during the reporting period. The government monitors formal [[Human migration|migration]] patterns for evidence of trafficking. The government did not implement measures to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex]] acts during the reporting period. Kazakhstan has ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol in 2008.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2578">Since 1991, Korea has experienced a large influx of [[foreign worker]]s, and the government has utilized trainee programs since 1992. About 10,000 Asian workers came to Korea under this program in 1992, and there were about 57,000 trainees in Korea in June 1996. However, the trainee program experienced problems: the trainees became undocumented workers due to a difference in wages and since they were not classified as laborers, they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law. The Employment Permit Program for foreigners (the government’s foreign-labor policy since 2004) is a product achieved by a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers. However, these issues have more details to be resolved. On the legal front, the Korean state still allows foreigners to apply for low-wage jobs and excludes them from social benefits. The social dimension of nationhood is shown by public-opinion polls of Korean citizens' attitudes towards foreign workers, which demonstrate discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Random Checks for Illegal Aliens Upset Foreigners  |work=[[Korea Times]]|date=|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/04/117_52277.html|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of June 2011, 166,518 foreigners had overstayed their working visas, a reduction from 177,955 in 2009 and 168,515 in 2010, according to the authorities.

The '''Jawi Peranakan''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: '''جاوي ڤرانقن''') is an ethnic group found primarily within the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Penang]] and in [[Singapore]], both regions were part of the historical [[Straits Settlements]] where their culture and history is centred around. The term "Jawi Peranakan" refers to locally born, Malay-speaking [[Muslim]]s of mixed [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ancestry. Over time, this has grown to include people with Arab ancestry as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/46073 {{lang-ms|Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were an [[elite]] group within the British Malayan community in mid-19th century [[British Malaya|Malaya]].  In addition to their substantial wealth and social standing, they are remembered for setting up the first Malay newspaper in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and China, the ''Jawi Peranakan''. They are often referred to as “mamak” although some find this term to be derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeExjdWUmJYC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=Jawi+Peranakan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PWMRJrBiUf&amp;sig=YNX2IJxNN0e7MtDEH6Au7_UrEKE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAxqyO6L7KAhWBMZQKHQEqA1w4ChDoAQgqMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Jawi+Peranakan&amp;f=false|title=Indian Communities in Southeast Asia (First Reprint 2006)|first1=K.

==History==
Since [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]'s founding in 1786 and 1819, the number of [[Indians in Singapore|South Asian immigrants]] to these colonies grew rapidly. Many were South Indian men. However, Jawi Peranakan ancestry does include a large number of other South Asians, from northern India and Pakistan. Women travelled to Singapore only from the 1860s, and even then in small numbers. This led to a shortage of South Asian brides, and so South Asian Muslim men often married Malay Muslim women. The descendants of these unions were called Jawi Peranakan.

"Jawi" is an [[Arabic]] word to denote [[Southeast Asia]], while [[Peranakan]] is a Malay word meaning "born of" (it also refers to the elite, [[Peranakan|locally born Chinese]]). More broadly, South Asian Muslims without mixed parentage but born in the [[Straits Settlements]] were sometimes also called Jawi Peranakan, as were children from [[Arab people|Arab]]-Malay marriages. Similar terms for mixed Malay-South Asian people were "Jawi Pekan" (mostly used in [[Penang]]). Jawi Peranakan families were found throughout Malaysia, especially Penang, and Singapore.

==Description==
The Jawi Peranakan chose their spouses carefully, screening prospective matches for wealth and status, rather than racial origins. This enabled intermarriage between Jawi Peranakan and other prosperous local Muslim communities, like the Arabs, Indians and the Malay aristocrats. Despite assimilating into the Malay culture, the Jawi Peranakan maintained a distinct identity which was captured in their architecture, clothing, jewelry and cuisine. Also, the community placed a strong emphasis on getting an English education, especially since many Jawi Peranakans hold Colonial Government jobs. Culturally, they contributed to the arts scene of the region, especially in music.

The Jawi Peranakan were enterprising and progressive and by the late 19th century, they had accumulated considerable wealth and status and contributed to the economy as merchants and landlords. They were also literate and English-educated, easily qualifying for government jobs. A group of Jawi Peranakan financed the first Malay language newspaper, the Jawi-Peranakan. Its first editor was [[Munsyi Mohamed Said Bin Dada Mohiddin]], a South Indian Muslim who remained as editor for 12 years, from 1876 to 1888.

==Demise of the community==
There are a few Jawi Peranakan families left in Singapore and Malaysia, especially Penang, which used to be their largest settlement. However, most today register as Malays. The loss of their identity is due to various causes. Economically, other competing mercantile groups were emerging. The [[Great Depression]] led many Jawi Peranakan business empires to bankruptcy and a severe fall in rent collected by landlords. Over time, the Jawi Peranakan grew increasingly dependent on government and clerical jobs.

By the turn of the 20th century, the political climate favoured the Malays. As the largest racial group and the indigenous people of Malaya, they were seen as the natural successors to the British, with the waning of the [[British Empire]]. Projecting an identity that was distinctly apart from the Malays was therefore not expedient. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Jawi Peranakan were also criticised for their brand of religious belief of [[Hanafi|Hanafi Islam]] which different from [[Shafi'i|Shafi'i Islam]] practised by the Malays. Furthermore, the Jawi Peranakan tended to be reformist and they challenged the authority of Malay royalty in religious matters. Most were born and bred in the [[Straits Settlements]], and had never been a subject of the [[Sultan]]. They therefore lacked this political and cultural quality which was seen to define a "true Malay".

==Descendants of the Jawi Peranakan==
In colonial Singapore and [[British Malaya]], the Jawi Peranakan remain a community held in high regard by the local Malays primarily due to the educational achievements and the wealth inherited. Families such as the Angullias have left their mark on modern day Singapore with places like Angullia Park near Singapore's famous [[Orchard Road]] still bearing the name of the clan. Other families include the Maricars or Maricans.

While due to the intermarriage with other Muslim communities, many of their descendants inherited an Arab (Syed, Sayyid) or to some extent Malay surnames (Tengku, Wan, Megat). Many whom are married to the Malays have also dropped their surnames since most Malays practised a [[Patronym]] naming system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">A '''Joalduna''' is a traditional character of the culture of [[Navarre]], especially in some small villages of the north of [[Navarre]]: [[Ituren]] and [[Zubieta]]. His function is to shake some cowbells to warn people about the arrival of the [[carnivals]], which are celebrated annually on the last weekend of January.
[[File:Ioaldunak 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''Joaldunak'' in ''Ituren'', on the road to ''Zubieta''.]]

==Location==
[[File:Localización de Navarra.png|thumbnail|right|Navarre]]
The tradition of the ''Joaldunak'' takes place in some villages of Navarre, specially in the region of ''Malerreka''. ''Ituren'' and ''Zubieta'' are located in the [[Pyrenees]], 56.5&amp;nbsp;km due north of [[Pamplona]], capital city of Navarre. They are situated on the flood plain of the River Ezkurra, a tributary of the River Bidasoa, in the shadow of the Mendaur mountain (1060m). The distance between the two villages is no more than 3&amp;nbsp;km.

==Name==
Although the original name is Joaldun, this character is referred to in a number of other ways: ''kaldurro'', ''ttuntturro'', ''txantxurro''... However, the most used but not totally correct name is '''Zanpantzar'''.

===Zanpantzar===
The name Zanpantzar has become more common over the years, although nobody in ''Zubieta'' or ''Ituren'' uses this name.

Zanpantzar, therefore, means:
* A doll made of straw and fern, which is famous because of his trial, sentencing, and burning in the carnivals of some Basque villages. (This process is part of a cleansing ritual that burns diseases at the same time as the doll.)
* The carnivals.

==Costume==
The original suit of a Zanpantzar had some characteristics in common, although nowadays each individual group has modified the costume. The features of the costume are:
[[File:Ioaldun 001.jpg|thumb|right|Hats and sprinklers of the ''Joaldunak''.]]
* A hat named ''Tunturro'' on the head, which is a cone (0.5 metres long) and has colourful ribbons and feathers.
* A kerchief around the neck.
* A shirt and short skirt made of sheep skin.
* Two cowbells at the waist.
* A white skirt.
* A sprinkler made of horsehair  in the right hand.
* The footwear are the ''abarcas''.

===Variations===
Although the costumes of the village are similar to each other, there are some vatiations:
* The ''Zubieta'' costume does not include the fur-lined jacket as the attire of ''Ituren'' does.
* The kerchief of ''Zubieta'' is a blue square and smaller than that of ''Ituren'', which is red.

==Who is a ''Joalduna''?==
The tradition was that the costume could only be worn by men, normally over 18 and native of the place, but a few years ago, some girls decided to dress up as ''Joaldun''. However, the children can sometimes march following their older relative's steps.

==The carnivals==
[[File:Zanpanzar.jpg|thumbnail|right]]
A ''Joalduna'' is the character who warns of the arrival of the carnivals, and is the centrepoint of the celebration. The origin of the carnivals and their objective are not known, but the tradition is thought to be bound to the (?)canching and [[mysticism]]. In fact, the ''Joaldunak'' are said to have been not only the creatures who protected the cattle, but also the ones who chased the bad spirits away, favouring the good harvests.

===The parade===
On Monday at noon, the ''Zubietar''s (the people of ''Zubieta'') ''Joaldunak'' set off for ''Ituren'' (the road is only 3&amp;nbsp;km). The route follows the course of the river ''Ezkurra'', which flows around the ''Mendaur'' mountain, geographic accidents that give the region its name: ''Malerreka'' ("Malda eta erreka", "Slope and river").

Half way along the route, they will be met by the people of the ''Ittundar'' (the people of ''Ituren'') neighborhood of ''Aurtitz''. After that, they will go towards Latsaga's neighborhood to join with the ''Joaldunak'' of Ituren. There will start the joint parade of approximately forty or fifty ''Joaldun''s (between eighty and a hundred bells) which, after passing through the whole of the centre of Ituren, will end up in the village square. There they will have a communal lunch  to celebrate the brotherhood of the villages.

On Tuesday, the following day, the ''Ituren'' ''Joaldunak'' will pay a return visit to those of ''Zubieta''. This is the end of the carnivals.

[[File:Ioaldunak-001.OGG|thumbnail|right|Joaldun parade]]

==''Joaldunen Biltzarra''==
Every year a celebration is held to honour all the Basque groups that have kept the tradition. This is not confined to just the Navarre villages; many Basque towns have taken up ''Joaldunak'' groups since the establishment of the "''Joaldunen biltzarra''". The festivities include parades, concerts, communal feasts and musical events.

'''Large-group capacitation''' is an [[adult education]] and [[social psychology]] concept associated with the Brazilian [[sociologist]] [[Clodomir Santos de Morais]], and grounded in the "activity"&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, among others, a ''real'' activity (vs. mere [[simulation]] exercise); an [[experiential learning]] activity; a [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)|Cultural-Historical Activity Theory]]-based activity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=5 ss}} on de Morais' use of Activity Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; of the individual and the social psychology of the large group.&lt;ref name="Car2000"&gt;de Morais Chapter 3 in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=34Np73i-06EC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=labra+psicologia+social+necesidad+responsabilidad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PK5KPdtikE&amp;sig=11wPJtuf29KQ7dlKZFwkU02pqjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XiNqUvDYEYia0AXhg4DwDw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=labra%20psicologia%20social%20necesidad%20responsabilidad&amp;f=false Labra, Iván, 1992, 3.2.] p. 82: [[w:es: psicología social de grandes grupos|''"psicología social de grandes grupos"''(Spanish)]]; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000}} Chapter 2;   {{harvnb|Labra|2014}}: Social Psychology of the Large Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGCM"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Large Group Capacitation Method|title=(LGCM)|url=http://www.sociable1.com/v/Large-Group-Capacitation-Method-225125937639629|journal=|access-date=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517131816/http://www.sociable1.com/v/Large-Group-Capacitation-Method-225125937639629#|archive-date=17 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;    When applied to the context of the [[Organization Workshop]] (OW), which, historically, has been used mainly for the purpose of job creation and income generation,&lt;ref&gt;but more recently, especially in [http://www.seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/kwanda/Kwanda%20-%20an%20example%20of%20Civic%20Driven%20Change%20by%20Gavin%20Andersson.pdf  South Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114354/http://www.seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/kwanda/Kwanda%20-%20an%20example%20of%20Civic%20Driven%20Change%20by%20Gavin%20Andersson.pdf# |date=5 November 2013 }} and [http://www.fundevi.ucr.ac.cr/pdf/13_05_TDR3_Dise%C3%B1o.pdf Costa Rica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055557/http://www.fundevi.ucr.ac.cr/pdf/13_05_TDR3_Dise%C3%B1o.pdf |date=23 October 2013 }}, for broader-based [http://www.indsocdev.org/defining-social-development.html Social] and [[Community Development]] initiatives.&lt;/ref&gt; it is known as Metodología da Capacitação Massiva (MCM) in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Método de Capacitación Masiva (MCM)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sobrado|Rojas|2006|p=125}} (online): "Annex: A methodological path".

== Coinage ==

The English term '''capacitation''' is a translation of the [[latino]]&lt;ref&gt;latino, as the method originated in Latin America see: [[Organization Workshop]].&lt;/ref&gt; terms [[w:pt:capacitação|''capacitação'' (Portuguese)]]/[[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]].&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish section of the tri-lingual {{harvnb|UNESCO|1979|}} "Adult Education Glossary" explains that the term [[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]] is usually followed by the adjectives ''vocational'' or ''technical'', ie preparation for qualified employment – re: [[w:es:|''"trabajo calificado"'' (Spanish)]] (p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: the English verb [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/capacitation ''to capacitate''] means ''to make capable; to enable'' – from [[w:lat:capax|''capax'' (Latin)]] = capable.  (As for ''"biological process related to reproduction"'', see: [[Capacitation]]).&lt;/ref&gt;'''Capacitation''' marks the generic difference between [[:wikt:Transitive|transitive]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, '''subject'''-to-subject ''transmission'' of knowledge, skills and communication(s). [[Banking education]] (Freire)  "''in which the teacher issues communiques and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat''" would be an example of such subject-to-subject ''transitive'' mode, in the field of education.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:Intransitive|intransitive]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, non-transitive,  '''object'''-to-subject 'objective activity', i.e. where ''the object teaches'' or ''how adults learn'', ie autonomously – see: [[Andragogy]] and {{harvnb|Sobrado|2012|page=50}} "Andragogy forms the basis of the process".&lt;/ref&gt; modes of [[learning]] and [[communicating]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Correia|2007|page=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The  "Concise Oxford Dictionary" 2004, OUP {{ISBN|978-0-19-8609773}} p. 110 translates [[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]] as [[w:en:training|''training'' (English)]]. – Conversely, the Spanish translation of [[w:en:training|"training"(English)]] is not [[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]], but, instead, [[w:es:entrenamiento|''entrenamiento''(Spanish)]]/ [[w:es:adiestriamiento|''adiestriamiento''(Spanish)]]. Alternatively:   [[w:pt:entrenamento|''entrenamento''(Portuguese)]]/[[w:pt:adestramento|''adestramento''(Portuguese)]].&lt;/ref&gt; implicit in de Morais' aphorism [[w:pt: se aprende, porém não se capacita|''se aprende, porém não se capacita'' (Portuguese)]] :  "[The trainee] learns, but is not capacitated".&lt;ref&gt;Morais in:{{harvnb|Souza|2006}} p. 6 (nb. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] original): ''"Professional training [models] generally transfer elements of theory well before practical elements are produced. The latter aborts the capacitation process: ''the trainee learns, but is not capacitated'': [[w:pt: se aprende, porém não se capacita|''se aprende, porém não se capacita'' (Portuguese)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morais|1987|page=136}} (nb.Spanish original) ''"To prioritize elements of theory before introducing elements of practice, means that the capacitation process of those involved in the setting the "Organization Workshop Enterprise" is being frustrated: ''they learn but are not capacitated'':  [[w:es: se aprende, pero no se capacita|''se aprende, pero no se capacita''(Spanish)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Capacitation''', – from [[w:pt:capacitação|''capacitação'' (Portuguese)]] -,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=166–170}}: "Capacitation".&lt;/ref&gt; here, is reminiscent of the adult education concept of [[Critical consciousness|''conscientization'']] – from [[w:pt:conscientização|''conscientização'' (Portuguese)]] -, popularized by Brazilian theorist, activist and a lifelong friend of Clodomir's, [[Paulo Freire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado}} p. 39: "A final moment with Paulo Freire – 1997".&lt;/ref&gt; While Freire's work was translated into English as early as 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freire|1970}}. See also: [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]&lt;/ref&gt;
de Morais' [[Organization Workshop]] (OW) – and, hence, moraisean '''large-group capacitation''' (LGC) – did not come to the attention of the English-speaking public until the mid-80s, when the Chilean Social Psychologists I. &amp; I. Labra moved to [[Zimbabwe]] and transferred the method to the (southern) African context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|page=115}} Ch 12: "Hard Learning in Zimbabwe".&lt;/ref&gt; Latino texts were initially translated on an 'ad hoc' basis, including the 'dictionary' translation of [[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]] as [[w:en:training|''training'' (English)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Training' also happened to coincide with potential sponsors' Development glossaries, e.g. the [[ILO]]'s 1980s ''Persons with Lower Levels of Literacy'' (LLLs) [http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Themes/TrainingandCapacityBuilding/Trainingmodules/lang--en/index.htm  training modules].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dictionary' translations of [[w:pt:capacitação|''capacitação'' (Portuguese)]]/[[w:es:capacitación|''capacitación'' (Spanish)]] (translated as ''"training"'') occasionally can be found in official documents, as, e.g., in  {{harvnb|Nacif|1998}}, which is a Government translation of Vera Nacif's [http://dc.itamaraty.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revistaesp8-mat3.pdf  original Spanish text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060236/http://dc.itamaraty.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revistaesp8-mat3.pdf |date=23 October 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cherrett's 1992 first ever translation into English of de Morais' ''Apuntes de Teoría de la Organización'',&lt;ref&gt;transl: "Notes on a Theory of Organization" (ETC, Newcastle, UK)&lt;/ref&gt; also, was still referred to as a "Training" Manual.  
It was not until the ALFA International Conference&lt;ref&gt;ALFA – [https://www.up.edu.pe/internacional/Paginas/JER/Detalle.aspx?IdElemento=160ALFA: America Latina Formación Academica]&lt;/ref&gt; in Manchester, UK, in 1998, attended by de Morais and academics from four European and four Latin American Universities,&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Manchester|Manchester]] UK, [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]], Netherlands, [[University of the Basque Country|Basque University]] Spain, [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] Italy, [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Chapingo]] Mexico, [[Central University of Venezuela|Central University]] Venezuela, [[National University of Costa Rica|National University]] and [[University of Costa Rica|Public University]] of Costa Rica. (see:  {{harvnb|Carmen|Labra|Davis|1999}})&lt;/ref&gt; that a consensus was reached on the dedicated terms '''Capacitation''' and '''Large Group Capacitation''' (LGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carmen|Labra|Davis|1999}} p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacitation in community health, adult education and international development ==

[[wikt:Capacitation|Capacitation]] (outside the field of [[Capacitation|biology]]) has been used previously, in English, mainly to emphasize educational content which differs from and/or transcends the basic meaning of the English one-size-fits-all [[:wikt:Training|''training'']].&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.wordreference.com/definition/training Training] quote : ''"from the 14th Century Old French ''trahiner'' – ''to drag''"''.  (NB: which would be a clear indication of its [[:wikt:Transitive|transitive]] pedigree of the English term).&lt;/ref&gt; In some sectors of [[Community health]], "capacitation" is said to be synonymous with ''empowering training''. [[wikt:Capacitation|Capacitation]] has also historically been used in the area of [[adult education]], starting with [[Paulo Freire]], who, in the seventies, uses the term "Technical Proficiency Capacitation" to refer to a (n adult) learning activity which can ''"never be reduced to the level of mere training"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freire|1973|page=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighties, [[wikt:Capacitation|Capacitation]] is defined, by the [[ILO]], as: ''"availability of opportunities for people to build up their capacities to move from the status of object and passive victims of social processes to the status of subjects guided by self-consciousness and active agents of change"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tilakaratna|1987}}  p. 23: "Capacitation".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNRISD]] (Geneva) had started (in the seventies) to promote the term [[wikt:capacitation|capacitation]] as a "problem-solving, educational" alternative to the then prevalent but mainly pragmatic 'social amelioration' approaches to [[International development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolfe|1996}} page 39: "Capacitation of national societies". (NB: [[w:fr:La capacitation|''La capacitation'' (French)]] is a synonym for [[w:fr:la prise en charge|''la prise en charge''(French)]]/''taking charge''(English) – in this case, of one's own destiny).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]]&lt;ref&gt;See comparative table – (between "Growth-led" and "Equity-led" Development – p. 354 in {{harvnb|Pieterse|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts ''"capacitation"''/''human development'', as proposed by ''alternative'' or [[wikt:autonomous|''autonomous'']] (aka self-development) theorists – (such as e.g. Korten, 1990; Max-Neef, 1991; Rahman, 1993 and Carmen, 1996), – with ''"development-as -economic growth"'' theorists' for whom, according to Pieterse, ''[[capital accumulation]]'' is the ultimate Development objective. By the mid-nineties, any mention of ''capacitation'' had virtually disappeared from the [[International Development]] scene, to be replaced by the [[World Bank|World-Bank]]-sponsored ''[[Capacity Building]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eade|1997|page= 2}}:''"No summit goes by without ritual calls for capacity building programmes"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2004}} p 168-9 quote: ''"Much of southern development practitioners' capacity enhancing practice is in the transitive vein of ''providing training courses'' for on one or another identified "capacity need"''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Agencies, prominently the World Bank, as from the nineties, opted for "[[Capacity Building]]", influenced, partly, as {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=168}} suggests, by [[Amartya Sen]]'s then up-and-coming "[[Capability approach]]" to [[International Development]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Capacity) "Building": "To build" means ''"to form by combining materials or parts"''. According to {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=168}}. ''"Capacitation"'', – on the other hand -, "always involves working with the ''whole'' – (i.e. the entire process/activity at the same time) – and not with (a) small part(s) of the system".&lt;/ref&gt; discourse.   Although de Morais worked for many years with a range of UN and International Agencies, his [[Activity theory|"Activity"]]-based&lt;ref&gt;re, e.g.,  {{harvnb|Labra|Labra|2012}}; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=118}} (n.2); see also: "Moraisean Large Group Capacitation (LGC): Overview" section of this article, below&lt;/ref&gt; pedagogy never became common currency there, possibly, as Sobrado suggests, because of, among others, its then presumed “Evil Empire” pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;re: Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: A recent (2011) english language [http://www.gjcpp.org/es/review.php?issue=7&amp;review=11 Critical Community Psychology] textbook does present '''moraisean Capacitation''' as one of four possible "strategies of action":({{harvnb|Kagan et al|2011|page=195–197}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moraisean large-group capacitation (LGC): overview ==

The major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de Morais,&lt;ref name="Car2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Morais|1987}} pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; in the development of the LGC concept and method, is the work of [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}. re also {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=219}}, who sees Alexei Nikolaevich (and his son A.A.) Leontiev as belonging to the wider ''Russian School''  [[Cultural-historical psychology]] tradition, pioneered by Lev [[Vygotsky]] and taken forward in recent years by ([http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/TOOL5100/v08/foiler/F4-CHAT-120208.pdf  '3rd generation']) Finnish Activity theorist [http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/people/engestro/    Yrjö Engeström] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218160515/http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/people/engestro/ |date=18 February 2014 }} – see:  {{harvnb|2004|Andersson|page=214}} and {{harvnb|Andersson|2013}} p. 8, note 17.(Other 'Activity' theorists: [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/People/MCole/ Michael Cole], [[Jean Lave]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=73Vv7Y3vf14C&amp;redir_esc=y  James Wertsch], et al).&lt;/ref&gt; specifically his concept of ''Objective(ized) Activity''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=50 ss}}; {{harvnb|Labra|1992|page=53}}([[w:es:Actividad Objetivada|Actividad Objetivada (Spanish)]]; {{harvnb|Labra|Labra|2012}}; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=118}} &amp; note #2.; {{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=6ss}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that, in order to change the mind-set of individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity – and/or to the object that "suggests" their activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Objectivized Activity'' or [[w:es:Actividad Objetivada|Actividad Objetivada (Spanish)]] and [[w:pt:Atividade Objetivada|Atividade Objetivada(Portuguese)]], from the original [[w:ru: Предметная деятельность|Предметная деятельность(Russian)]] (predmetnaja-dejatelnost), or [[w:de:Gegenständliche Tätigkeit|Gegenständliche Tätigkeit(German)]], also known as ''Objective Activity'', is explained in Chapter three of {{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=50ss}}.  According to the OW approach, the Objectivized Activity concept implies the recognition that, ''in order to change the mind-set of individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity – and/or to the object that "suggests" their activity''. In the [[Organization Workshop]] context, the ''real'' enterprise the participants are engaged in ''is'' that ''"object that teaches"''. From a pedagogical perspective the choice of "object" is crucial. To ensure that a social scale of activity was engendered, de Morais made the requirement that a ''common resource pool'' be put at the disposal of participants, which requires that production processes be regulated (co-ordinated), independently from the whims of various collaborators. {{harvnb|Andersson|2013}} p. 6. ; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Objective(ized) Activity'' is at the core of what Labra has referred to as ''"another"'' tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Labra|2014|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Social Psychology, namely the [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)|Cultural-historical Activity Theory]]-based branch of Social Psychology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cultural-historical psychology]], in Andersson's words, ''"explains de Morais' method"'' re: {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=214}}; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sets it apart from mainstream (behaviorist/[[Kurt Lewin|lewinian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=213}}: Lewinian Social Psychology (e.g. [[Group Dynamics]]); {{harvnb|Labra|2014|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Psychology of small groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|page=165–166}}: 'small group' social psychology; {{harvnb|Andersson|2012}};   {{harvnb|Labra|2014}} pp. 14 &amp; 18: Social Psychology of Small Groups.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'locus'&lt;ref&gt;The word locus (plural ''loci'') is [[Latin language|Latin]] for "place".&lt;/ref&gt; of activity-based LGC is the [[Organization Workshop]](OW),&lt;ref&gt;defined by de Morais as "a practical exercise in the creation of a ''real enterprise''" {{harvnb|Morais|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a learning event where participants, applying [[social division of labor]] principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sobrado|2012}} p. 49.; {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000}} Chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; master new organizational knowledge and skills through a [[experiential learning|learning-by-doing approach]]. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as "[[Zone of proximal development|scaffolding]]" in [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|loc=p. 24 quoting [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]] n.59}} and  {{harvnb|Andersson|2004}}  pp. 227–234: [[Zone of proximal development]] (ZPD) or the '''gap''' between what an individual learner, or group of learners, has already mastered without assistance (the actual level of development), and what they potentially can achieve with the guidance of an experienced assistant or peer".&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor ''who'' teaches, but "the object ''that'' teaches".&lt;ref&gt;Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|loc=p. 209: ''the traditional relationship between trainee and instructor ceases to apply''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The fact that it is the ''"OW Object"'' itself that ''"teaches"'' does not preclude or exclude the provision of [[professional training]] (in the trades, enterprises, services that the participants have chosen to engage in). How 'capacitation' and 'training' go hand in hand is clear, for example, from the diary of a [http://seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/integra/jwdiarymunguinepdf.pdf Resource person] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508025903/http://seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/integra/jwdiarymunguinepdf.pdf# |date=8 May 2014 }} (i.e.trainer) at the 1994 Munguine OW in Mozambique.&lt;/ref&gt; Moraisean '''capacitation''', then...''"involves several elements: mastery of a practical experience,&lt;ref&gt;see  ({{harvnb|Morais|1979}}): The OW is "''a practical exercise in the creation of a real enterprise"''.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps with some theoretical guidance but at least with some theoretical insight;&lt;ref&gt;see the theoretical notions of e.g. "''Zone of Proximal Development"'' (ZPD) and ''"Scaffolding"'' above.&lt;/ref&gt; an element in which the object itself ''guides'' or influences the subject's understanding in the course of the activity;&lt;ref&gt;see: [http://www.seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/OW/OW%20Method%20Laboratories.pdf  Objectivized Activity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105115323/http://www.seriti.org.za/phocadownloadpap/OW/OW%20Method%20Laboratories.pdf# |date=5 November 2013 }} in {{harvnb|Andersson|2010|page=2}} (ppt slides).&lt;/ref&gt; a process of critical reflection on action and on motives of action.&lt;ref&gt;''"Critical Balance"'' (CB), an integral part of the OW process, also known as [[self-regulated learning]] in [[adult education]], ensures that day-to-day tasks always keep sight of long-term objectives. re: ({{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=161}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, it always involves working with ''the whole'' and not a small part of the system"''.&lt;ref&gt;"the whole" as compared to "combining materials or parts" (as e.g. in aforementioned "Capacity ''Building''").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted from {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of application ==

[[File:MatzOW1992.jpg|thumb|right|335px|Part of the group of 850 who took part in the 1992 Matzinho 'Field' Organization Workshop (FOW), in war-torn [[Mozambique]]]]

The insights that gave rise to what came to be known as the moraisean '''Large Group Capacitation Method''' (LGCM)&lt;ref name="LGCM"/&gt; were an unanticipated consequence of a 30-day course, in 1954, for a large group &lt;ref&gt;50 to 60 persons, depending on sources. de Morais, then a lawyer and  one of the Peasant League co-founders, attended as legal consultant.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil]] [[Peasant leagues (Brazil)|Peasant Leagues]]' middle-level leadership to study Brazilian [[Agrarian reform]] law.

The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people |title=Life After People — History.com TV Episodes, Schedule, &amp; Video |work=History.com |accessdate=August 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429170535/http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people/ |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a de facto [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.

==Format==
The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household [[pets]] and [[livestock]] that have to fend for themselves. The [[thought experiment]] is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and the results that have occurred when people discontinue the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins:

{{cquote|What would happen if every human on Earth disappeared?  This ''isn't'' the story of how we might vanish...it's the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind}}

The series' episodes thematically offer examples of [[Urban decay|urban]] and [[Decomposition|biological decay]]. The focus is on specific locations such as [[skyscraper]]s, [[religious icons]], [[bridge]]s and [[dam]]s, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[document]]s and [[human body|human bodies]]. The fate of some kinds of [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]] are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including [[ghost town]]s and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of [[landmark]]s around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.

The various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends up to one hundred million years into the future (one day, one week, one year, 10 years, 15 years, 25 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, etc.).

===Tagline===
The program's tagline is the ominous greeting:

{{cquote|Welcome to Earth...Population: Zero. [while all episodes end with the title fitting the last sentence,] ...in a life after people}}

The subterranean [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park|Carlsbad Caverns]] in New Mexico is repopulated by bats, the [[gypsum]] crystals inside the [[Naica Mine]] grow unchecked, and humankind's former geothermal power sites such as [[the Geysers]] in northern California relinquish their strength to geologic forces. The [[Satellite Transit System]] at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle's airport]] is disabled, the [[Molinere Underwater Sculpture Park|Underwater Sculpture Gardens]] outside of [[St. George's, Grenada]] are taken a hold of by coral reefs, and [[Prairie dogs]] reclaim their territory in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. The episode features the [[Bonne Terre Mine]], which was abandoned in 1960 and subsequently flooded, and also the [[Arabia (steamboat)|steamboat ''Arabia'']] in [[Parkville, Missouri]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41105">This is a list of [[caving|recreational caving]] fatalities in the [[United Kingdom]]. It includes all verified deaths associated with the exploration of natural caves and disused mines in the modern era (post 1880). Deaths involving members of the general public who may have slipped down a shaft, or wandered into a cave without being aware of the risks, have been excluded.

==List of fatalities==

[[File:1 entrance to Porth yr ogof.jpg|right|250px|[[Porth yr Ogof]] - the scene of 11 fatalities|thumb]]

There have been a total of 132 fatalities associated with recreational caving. The main causes of death have been drowning when [[cave diving]], drowning as the result of flooding or negotiating deep water, injuries incurred from falling from a height, and injuries incurred as the result of rock falls. In ten cases the bodies have not been recovered.

The worst incident in UK caving history was the [[Mossdale Caverns]] incident in 1967 when six cavers were drowned following an unexpected cloud burst.&lt;ref name="Kershaw"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershaw|first=Roy|title=What lies beneath: Mossdale caving disaster|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/what-lies-beneath-mossdale-caving-disaster-794268.html|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Digital News and Media Limited|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three incidents when three people have died. The first was when three cavers drowned in Langstroth Pot in 1976 when [[free-diving]] short sections of underwater passage as the result of the air in an air bell becoming foul.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Langstroth deaths - foul air blamed|journal=Descent|date=August 1976|issue=34|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three cavers were killed by a rock fall in [[Ease Gill Caverns]] in 1988,&lt;ref name="Boothroyd 12"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Easegill Tragedy |last=Boothroyd |first=Colin |journal=Descent |date=June–July 1988 |issue=82 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three cavers were drowned in the [[Marble Arch Cave|Marble Arch system]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Kelly 18"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marble Arch fatalities|last=Kelly |first=John |journal=Descent |date=Apr–May 1995 |issue=123 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Porth yr Ogof]], in [[South Wales]], accounts for eleven fatalities, nine of which were the result of people drowning when negotiating the exit pool.&lt;ref name=porth /&gt; Ease Gill Caverns and its associated entrances account for ten deaths; [[Alum Pot]] and its associated entrances account for six, as does Mossdale Caverns (all from the 1967 incident).

The only case of a caver dying in the UK as the result of becoming stuck was [[Neil Moss (caver)|Neil Moss]] in [[Peak Cavern]] in 1959. The cause of death was foul air building up around him.&lt;ref name=lovelock-11-27&gt;Lovelock (1963), pp.&amp;nbsp;11&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakdown of fatalities by cause and area==

The following table summarises the major causes of fatality in UK caving by cause and by area. The commonest cause of fatality in the UK is drowning - accounting for half the deaths when cave diving is included, and 42% when diving is excluded. The second major cause of fatality, when cave diving is excluded, is falling from height which accounts for 20% of fatalities, followed by rock fall which accounts for 14% of fatalities. The 'Other' category includes gas poisoning and asphyxiation.

==Safety and security==
In the afterwake of the [[2009 International Islamic University bombing]] in Islamabad, hundreds of Maldivian students studying in different parts of Pakistan were found fearing for their safety. Among the eight Maldivian students studying at IIU, two of them were present at the University when the bombs went off.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hassanziyau.blogspot.com/2009/10/maldivian-students-in-pakistan-fear-for.html|title=Blogger|website=Hassanziyau.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Maldivian student speaking on the occasion remarked that threats against educational institutions had become widespread and she hoped "they won’t target us."&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; Another said: "Actually now we are used to threats like these…..we expect things to go bad but there is nothing that we can do." In light of the instability, the Maldivian government has claimed to have received and taken into account intelligence on the country's security situation and concerns for safety of Maldivian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hassanziyau.blogspot.com/2010/02/karachi-blasts-increases-concern-for.html|title=Blogger|website=Hassanziyau.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the Government of Maldives recommended Maldivian students to return amid fears that the war in Pakistan could spread further and pose a danger to the students. In addition, it pledged full cooperation to those who wished to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/28360 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617035241/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/28360 |archivedate=2011-06-17 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14178">'''Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas''' ({{lang-el|Αγαμέμνων Κουτσόγιωργας}}; 1922{{spaced ndash}}April 18, 1991), commonly known as '''Menios Koutsogiorgas''' (Μένιος Κουτσόγιωργας), was a [[Greece|Greek]] lawyer, police officer and politician. As a close associate of [[Andreas Papandreou]], the founder and leader of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), Koutsogiorgas emerged as one of the most powerful cabinet member during PASOK's 1981–1989 government, and was widely regarded as Papandreou's heir apparent. Embroiled in the [[George Koskotas]] scandal however, he was brought before a Special Tribunal. During the procedure he collapsed in the court room on 11 April 1991 and died a week later.

== Early life and professional career ==
Koutsogiorgas was born in May 1922 in the village of Rodini in [[Achaea]]. During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] in the [[Second World War]], Koutsogiorgas was active in the ''[[Omiros (resistance group)|Omiros]]'' [[Greek Resistance|resistance group]], and was arrested and imprisoned by the Italian occupation authorities. He studied at the Law School of the [[University of Athens]], and received his law degree in 1945. That same year, he became a police officer in the Athens branch of the [[City Police (Greece)|City Police]]. He served as a police officer for seven years, until he resigned in 1952, in order to become a lawyer and open his own law firm.&lt;ref&gt;Γιώργος Λακόπουλος, Το μυθιστόρημα του ΠΑΣΟΚ, 1999, σελίδες 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he obtained a postgraduate degree in [[Public Law]] from the Law Faculty of the [[University of Paris]].

In the post-war era, he became a prominent Athens lawyer, and was closely associated with  [[Georgios Papandreou]], the leader of the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] and later of the [[Centre Union]]. During the [[ASPIDA scandal]] of 1965, he was defence attorney to the Georgios Papandreou's son, [[Andreas Papandreou]]. 

During the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]], Koutsogiorgas participated in attempts to organize armed resistance against the regime as early as 1967, and was arrested and imprisoned after arms and radio transmitters were discovered at his home. He was later released, but re-arrested in 1970 and held for a while, undergoing interrogation by the infamous [[Greek Military Police|EAT-ESA]].

== Political career ==
As a close associate of Andreas Papandreou, Koutsogiorgas became a founding member of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) during the ''[[metapolitefsi]]''.

He was elected Member of Parliament in the first national election that took place in November 1974 after the fall of the military government. He held a parliament seat for the prefecture of Achaea in all successive national elections until 1989. In the first PASOK cabinet, Koutsogiorgas was appointed Minister to the Presidency of the Government on 21 October 1981, a post he held until 17 January 1984, when he was named [[Minister for the Interior (Greece)|Minister for the Interior]]. He held the post until resigning on 9 May 1985 before the [[Greek legislative election, 1985|parliamentary elections]], with the exception of the period 22 May – 21 June 1984, when he was replaced by an acting minister for the [[European Parliament election, 1984 (Greece)|European Parliament election]].&lt;ref name="Papandreou1981-85"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ggk.gov.gr/?p=1287 | title = ΚΥΒΕΡΝΗΣH ΑΝΔΡΕA ΠΑΠΑΝΔΡΕΟΥ - Από 21.10.1981 έως 5.6.1985 | language=Greek | publisher = General Secretariat of the Greek Government | accessdate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he played a major role in the March 1985 political crisis over the issue of the re-nomination of then-[[President of Greece]] [[Constantine Karamanlis]] for a second term. Papandreou had promised it several times, but the PASOK party base and Koutsogiorgas himself fiercely opposed it. Eventually, largely through Koutsogiorgas insistence PASOK proposed the judge [[Christos Sartzetakis]] for the post.&lt;ref name="Lakopoulos"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=112749 | date = 18 July 1999 | title = Απολύστε την Αεροσυνοδό | language= Greek | author = Giorgos Lakopoulos | publisher = ''[[To Vima]]'' | accessdate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_print?id=76714276,91612836 | title = Ο Μένιος ξεγέλασε Ανδρέα - Καραμανλή | date = 9 December 2001 | language= Greek | publisher = ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'' | accessdate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following PASOK's electoral victory in the 1985 election, Koutsogiorgas was re-appointed Interior Minister on 5 June 1985. In the reshuffle of 26 July 1985, he assumed the [[Minister for Public Order (Greece)|Public Order]] portfolio as well, keeping it until 25 April 1986.&lt;ref name="Papandreou1985-89"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ggk.gov.gr/?p=1291 | title = ΚΥΒΕΡΝΗΣH ΑΝΔΡΕA ΠΑΠΑΝΔΡΕΟΥ - Από 5.6.1985 έως 2.7.1989 | language=Greek | publisher = General Secretariat of the Greek Government | accessdate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained Interior Minister until 5 February 1987, and on 23 September 1987, he was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Greece|Vice-President of the Government]] and [[Minister for Justice (Greece)|Minister for Justice]].&lt;ref name="Papandreou1985-89"/&gt; While popular with the broader PASOK electorate but lacking a strong party base, this appointment made him the ''de facto'' number two in the government. During Papandreou's illness in 1988 and his absence from Greece in August–September for a [[heart bypass]] operation in the [[United Kingdom]] Koutsogiorgas functioned as the virtual Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Lakopoulos"/&gt;

At the same time however, he came under increasing criticism from the press and from within PASOK for his handling of the [[George Koskotas]] and his [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Bank of Crete]] scandal, in particular over a [[bank secrecy]] law that according to some critics would allow Koskotas to evade scrutiny. He continued to enjoy the support of Papandreou: although he was forced to quit the posts of Vice-President of the Government and Justice Minister on 18 November 1988, he was re-appointed as Minister to the Presidency of the Government.&lt;ref name="Lakopoulos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papandreou1985-89"/&gt; The mounting crisis peaked in March 1989, when audio tapes of conversations between Koskotas's wife and an associate of Koskotas (I.Matzouranis) were released by  Koskotas who was already a fugitive and imprisoned in the US. The tapes purported to show that Koutsogiogras had received 2 million US dollars in a Swiss bank account for "tailoring" the bank secrecy law for Koskotas. Koutsogiorgas, denied these claims and accused Koskotas for attempting to blackmail the government at a time he was a fugitive from Greek law and government actions caused his fraudulent empire to crumble. Papandreou survived a vote of confidence in parliament, but Koutsogiorgas submitted his resignation on 16 March 1989.&lt;ref name="Lakopoulos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papandreou1985-89"/&gt; The subsequent investigation showed that a close associate of Koskotas, I. Matzouranis, which used to be a member of the PASOK government and was connected with Koutsogiorgas had mediated in the fall of 1988 to open a bank account for Koutsogiorgas in Switzerland. After a couple of weeks he made a deposit of $1,2 million in that account. A few weeks later, Koutsogiorgas aware of the deposit turned the funds back to Matzouranis and closed the account. When those events were revealed in March 1989 Matzouranis claimed Koutsogiorgas was expecting the deposit. Koutsogiorgas claimed that the account was opened for personal reasons and that the specific deposit was an attempt to get him entrapped by Koskotas and Matzouranis at a critical juncture of the Koskotas case when his illegal activities were exposed. The details of these events remained unexamined as Koutsogiorgas lost his life while defending himself during the proceedings in court.&lt;ref&gt;[ Εφημερίδα Ελευθεροτυπία 23/3/89]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Εφημερίδα Το Ποντίκι 3/9/90]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May, the PASOK Central Committee voted against him standing as a candidate during the [[Greek legislative election, June 1989|June 1989 parliamentary elections]] until the investigation on the Bank of Crete case was complete.&lt;ref name="Lakopoulos"/&gt; On 27 September, in a Parliament vote Koutsogiorgas along with [[Andreas Papandreou]], [[Dimitris Tsovolas]] and [[Giorgos Petsos]] were sent to a Special Tribunal set up to investigate the Koskotas scandal. In a move that at the time was criticized as politicized and excessive, the 68-year-old Koutsogiorgas, alone among the accused, was placed into pre-trial custody at [[Korydallos prison]] on 2 October 1990. The move was supported by the new Mitsotakis (ND) government who had been elected just a few months before on a ticket of battling alleged corruption by the Socialist party. Koutsogiorgas immediately appealed this decision, taking his case to the Athens Appellate Court's Appeals Council; his appeal was successful, and he was released from pre-trial detention and set free on 10 January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Η Καθημερινή, 11 Ιανουαρίου 1991, «Ελεύθερος με εγγύηση ο Μένιος&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began in a heavily politicized atmosphere on 11 March 1991, broadcast on live television. Koutsogiorgas stood his ground and his examination of prosecution witness Ioannis Kamaras (chief auditor of the [[Bank of Greece]]) exposed many flaws in the prosecution's case.&lt;ref&gt;Τα Νέα, 22 Απριλίου 1991&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April, while examining a witness (Stathis Papageorgiou, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece), Koutsogiorgas collapsed in the courtroom and died seven days later. His funeral gathered large crowds in the center of Athens and developed into a political protest against the continuing proceedings of the Special Tribunal. The later was seen by a large part of the press and the population as politically motivated and a result of partisan politics.

'''National Digital Inclusion Alliance''' ('''NDIA''') is a US [[nonprofit organization]] that brings together over 300 non-profit organizations, policy-makers, and academics to advocate for national access to broadband and to put an end to the multiple [[digital divide]]s. &lt;ref name="InnovHub"&gt; {{cite web |title=Innovation Hub |url=http://blogs.wgbh.org/innovation-hub/2018/5/18/dissecting-americas-digital-divide/ |website=WGBH |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the women in the Ottoman Empire|other uses|Odalisque (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Marià Fortuny - The Odalisque - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Marià Fortuny]] – ''The Odalisque'']]
An '''odalisque''' ({{lang-tr|Odalık}}) was a [[maid|chambermaid]] or  a female attendant in a Turkish [[seraglio]], particularly the [[court ladies]] in the household of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Odalisque.jpg|thumb|300px|''Odalisque'' painted by [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]] (1874)]]
The word "odalisque" is French in form and originates from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''odalık'', meaning "[[maid|chambermaid]]", from ''oda'', "chamber" or "room". It can also be [[transliterated]] ''odahlic'', ''odalisk'', and ''odaliq''.

Joan DelPlato has described the term's shift in meaning from Turkish to English and French:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The English and French term odalisque (rarely odalique) derives from the Turkish 'oda', meaning "chamber"; thus an odalisque originally meant a chamber girl or attendant. In western usage, the term has come to refer specifically to the harem [[concubine]]. By the eighteenth century the term odalisque referred to the eroticized artistic genre in which a nominally eastern woman lies on her side on display for the spectator.&lt;ref name="delplato1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Multiple Wives, Multiple Pleasures: Representing the Harem, 1800–1875 |first=Joan |last=DelPlato |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=2002 |page=9 |isbn=0838638805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin as the Turkish ''odalık''==
[[File:Odalisque with an orange.JPG|thumb|300px|''Odalisque with an orange'' by [[Angélique Bègue]] (2014)]]
An ''odalık'' was not a concubine of the harem, but a maid, although it was possible that she could become one. An ''odalık'' was ranked at the bottom of the [[social stratification]] of a harem, serving not the man of the household, but rather, his concubines and wives as personal chambermaids. ''Odalık'' were usually slaves given as gifts to the sultan by wealthy Turkish men. Generally, an ''odalık'' was never seen by the sultan but instead remained under the direct supervision of his mother, the [[Valide Sultan]].

If an ''odalık'' was of extraordinary beauty or had exceptional talents in dancing or singing, she would be trained as a possible concubine. If selected, an ''odalık'' trained as a court lady would serve the sultan sexually and only after such sexual contact would she change in status, becoming thenceforth one of the [[Queen consort|consort]]s of the sultan.

In contrast to European depictions of nude harem women, they more often wore androgynous robes resembling those worn by the male pages of the palace. The conditions of the Ottoman harem "resembled a monastery for young girls more than the bordello of European imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru |title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later western usage of the term==
[[File:Gustave Léonard de Jonghe - The Afternoon Siesta.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Reclining Odalisque'', painted by [[Gustave Léonard de Jonghe]], c. 1870]]
[[W. S. Gilbert]] refers to the "Grace of an odalisque on a divan" in Colonel Calverley's song [[Patience (opera)#Musical numbers|"If You Want A Receipt For That Popular Mystery"]] from the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]].''

In popular use, the word ''odalisque'' also may refer to a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], concubine or [[paramour]] of a wealthy man.

During the 19th century, ''odalisques'' became common fantasy figures in the artistic movement known as [[Orientalism]], being featured in many erotic paintings from that era. 

By the later 19th century, Turkish writers such as Melek Hanum used the word odalisque to refer to slave-concubines when writing in English:&lt;blockquote&gt;
If any lady possesses a pretty-looking slave, the fact soon gets known. The gentlemen who wish to buy an odalisque or a wife, make their offers. Many Turks, indeed, prefer to take a slave as a wife, as, in such case, there is no need to dread fathers, mothers, or brothers-in-law, and other undesirable relations.&lt;ref name="melekhanum"&gt;{{cite book |title=Thirty years in the harem|first=Melek|last=Hanum |publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1872|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Law Society of British Columbia]] brought a discipline hearing against an unnamed lawyer for referring to another lawyer's client as living with an odalisque. The Law Society found the use of the word, though an extremely poor choice, did not rise to the level of professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/lsbc/apps/hearings/viewreport.cfm?hearing_id=575 The Law Society of British Columbia: "Decision of the Hearing Panel on Facts and Determination"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penang Sign Language''' was developed in Malaysia by [[Deaf culture|deaf]] children, outside the classroom, when [[oralism]] was predominant. It is now mainly used by older people, although many younger people can understand it.

==History==

Penang Sign Language began when the first school for the deaf, [[Federation School for the Deaf]] (FSD), was established by Lady Templer, the wife of the British High Commissioner in Malaya, in 1954. Deaf students went to FSD, to learn oral skills, not sign language. However, the students would sign by themselves in the dormitory of FSD every night. 

In the 1960s, Tan Yap went to [[Gallaudet|Gallaudet University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to learn deaf culture and sign language. He brought an ASL book back with him to Malaysia. But Tan Yap's suggestions were rejected by the Government. 

An American, Professor Frances Parsons, travelled around the world in 1976 in order to introduce [[Total Communication]] and Sign Language to poor schools for the deaf, in order to better prepare them for education. In the same year, Frances Parsons went to [[Kuala Lumpur]] to meet with Dr [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], the Minister of Education. After a 45-minute discussion, Dr Mahathir agreed with Parsons's suggestions and theory. In the next few days, Dr. Mahathir announced new legislation that obliged schools in Malaysia to teach Total Communication and Sign Language. Manchester-trained teachers were unhappy with the new law and protested Mohamad's decision. As a result, BIM (Bahasa Isyarat Malaysia) or MSL (Malaysian Sign Language) became similar to American Sign Language after 1976.

The "Projet PIBien-être" is the first official initiative for measuring well-being and [[quality of life]] in [[Luxembourg]].

In 2013, a joint commission led by the [[Conseil économique et social]], the [[Conseil supérieur pour un développement]] durable and the [[Observatoire de la Compétitivité]] introduced a set of indicators measuring the quality of life in Luxembourg. The conclusions of the commission were summarised in a document titled "Projet PIBien-être", which identified 64 indicators belonging to 11 different domains to assess quality of life in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-03-30|others=Eurostat (European Commission)|title=Final report of the expert group on quality of life indicators - EU Law and Publications|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KSFT17004:EN:HTML|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages= 101|doi=10.2785/021270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, within the "Projet PIBien-être", STATEC (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]) presented a preliminary analysis of the "Luxembourgish Index of Well-being" (LIW), a first proposal of synthetic indicator measuring the quality of life in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The presentation entitled "Preliminary Assessment of Quality of Life in Luxembourg" was delivered by Marcin Piekałkiewicz on 16 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951724308|title=Sozialalmanach 2016.

The results were published by STATEC in 2016 in "Rapport travail et cohésion sociale".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/catalogue-publications/cahiers-economiques/2016/PDF-Cahier-121-2016.pdf|title=CAHIER ÉCONOMIQUE N° 121 - Rapport travail et cohésion sociale|last=|first=|publisher=STATEC - Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|year=2016|isbn=978-2-87988-131-7|location=Luxembourg|pages=144–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of life domains ==
The quality of life domains identified in the "Projet PIBien-être" are as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Income and wealth;
# Occupation;
# Housing;
# Health;
# Private and working life balance;
# Education and skills;
# Social relationships;
# Governance;
# Environment;
# Safety and physical integrity;
# Subjective well-being.
In total the "Projet PIBien-être" includes 63 indicators calculated based on international surveys – e.g. European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), European Value Study (EVS), Eurobarometer – as well as administrative data available at STATEC and in other Luxembourgish institutes, such as the IGSS (L'Inspection générale de la sécurité sociale).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3930">A '''race-conscious policy''' is a policy that aims to improve the conditions of [[racial minorities]]. In the United States, such policies are typically aimed at improving the status of [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/race-conscious-policies | title=Race-Conscious Policies | work=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences | date=2008 | accessdate=18 May 2017 | author=Sears, David O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different kinds of race-conscious policies exist, ranging from nondiscrimination policy to strict numerical [[racial quota]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxKGAgAAQBAJ | title=A Different Vision: African American Economic Thought | publisher=Routledge | author=Boston, Thomas D. | year=2002 | pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main purpose is twofold: to compensate for past discrimination against the target race, and to increase [[equality of opportunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=John|title=Group Rights v. Individual Rights: The Case of Race-Conscious Policies|journal=Journal of Social Policy|date=20 January 2009|volume=23|issue=01|pages=55|doi=10.1017/S0047279400021322}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Education==
In the United States, race-conscious policies like [[desegregation busing]] have long been used to counteract [[school segregation]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in favor of these measures more in the 1960s and the 1970s than it has since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ericdigests.org/2003-2/race.html | title=Constitutional Law and Race-Conscious Policies in K-12 Education | work=ERIC Digest | date=1 July 2002 | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Ancheta, Angelo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==International variations==
[[France]], unlike many other Western European countries (including [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), has avoided adopting race-conscious policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/race-policy-in-france/ | title=Race Policy in France | work=Brookings Institution | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Bleich, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in these policies between Britain and France are in large part due to the different [[framing (social sciences)|frames]] through which the policies were portrayed in the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleich|first1=Erik|title=Integrating Ideas into Policy-Making Analysis|journal=Comparative Political Studies|date=November 2002|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1054–1076|doi=10.1177/001041402237506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
Whites are the least supportive of race-conscious policies, while African Americans are the most supportive of them. Latinos and Asian Americans take intermediate stances in their opinions of these policies. This pattern persists after controlling for measures of [[racial prejudice]], class status, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Linda|last2=Pantoja|first2=Adrian D.|title=Beyond Black and White: General Support for Race-Conscious Policies Among African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Whites|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=December 2004|volume=57|issue=4|pages=633–642|doi=10.1177/106591290405700411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among white liberals, [[racial resentment]] predicts support for race-conscious programs only for black students. In contrast, among white conservatives, racial resentment is closely related to opposition to such programs regardless of the recipient's race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=Stanley|last2=Huddy|first2=Leonie|title=Racial Resentment and White Opposition to Race-Conscious Programs: Principles or Prejudice?|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=January 2005|volume=49|issue=1|pages=168–183|doi=10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Rosenfeld''' (born December 20, 1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n93057731.html | title=Richard Rosenfeld | work=Library of Congress | accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American criminologist and Founders Professor at the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]].

==Education==
Rosenfeld received his B.A. in 1972 and his Ph.D. in [[sociology]] in 1984, both from the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.umsl.edu/ccj/pdfs/vitae/rosenfeldvitae.pdf | title=Richard Rosenfeld CV | accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After working as an assistant professor of sociology at [[Skidmore College]] for four years, Rosenfeld first joined the University of Missouri–St. Louis in 1989 as an assistant professor and research fellow at their [[Center for Metropolitan Studies]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 2007, he was appointed Curators Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, and became a Founders Professor there in 2014.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research==
Rosenfeld's research focuses on crime statistics and policies aimed at reducing crime, also known as [[crime control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.umsl.edu/ccj/faculty/rosenfeld.html | title=Richard Rosenfeld | work=University of Missouri–St. Louis | accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study, Rosenfeld and his graduate student, Joshua Williams, found that most defendants in gun crime cases in St. Louis were young males with prior felony arrests, and that about 40 percent of people arrested for such crimes were never charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2015/02/10/umsl-professor-explains-felony-firearm-study/23196077/ | title=UMSL professor explains felony firearm study | work=KSDK | date=10 February 2015 | accessdate=18 January 2016 | author=Meckles, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/health/in-missouri-fewer-gun-restrictions-and-more-gun-killings.html | title=In Missouri, Fewer Gun Restrictions and More Gun Killings | work=New York Times | date=22 December 2015 | accessdate=18 January 2016 | author=Tavernise, Sabrina}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research has also found that half of all violent crime in St. Louis occurs in only 5 percent of the city's street blocks, most of which were in disadvantaged neighborhoods on the city's north side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2015/07/28/umsl-criminologist-most-stl-murders-concentrated-in-north-city/ | title=UMSL Criminologist: Half of STL Murders Concentrated In North City | work=CBS St. Louis | date=28 July 2015 | accessdate=18 January 2016 | author=Blume, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report authored by Rosenfeld and released by the [[Sentencing Project]] that found that there was no convincing evidence of the alleged [[Ferguson effect]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/a-ferguson-effect-on-crime-rates-st-louis-criminologist-finds/article_18fec298-eb63-5ad6-ba0e-f96521608456.html | title=A 'Ferguson effect' on crime rates?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1282">Under [[Law of the Netherlands|Dutch law]], a '''samenlevingscontract''' is a written agreement loosely translating to "[[cohabitation agreement]]". It has been compared to marriage, but merely governs the so-called property relationships between two or more persons who are cohabiting. It does not necessarily imply a marriage-like (or sexual) relationship exists, but the contract can include agreements about any children within the cohabitation arrangement.

Since the 1980s the contract has been popular among two different groups in Dutch society: people who wanted to formalise their relationship, but did not want to marry, and people who wanted to marry but could not legally do so. With the introduction first of [[Civil union#Netherlands|registered partnerships]] and later the broadening of marriage to include same-sex couples in the [[Netherlands]], the need for a samenlevingscontract for the latter has become less pronounced.

'''[[Sectarian violence]] among [[Violence and Christianity|Christians]]''' has been noted from the time of the first Christian [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s to the present day.

==Late antiquity==

Andrew Stephenson describes late antiquity as "one of the darkest periods in the history of Christianity" characterizing as mingling the evils of " worldly ambition, false philosophy, sectarian violence  and riotous living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The history of Christianity from the origin of Christianity to the time of Gregory the Great, Volume 2 |first=Andrew |last=Stephenson |publisher=R.

Sectarian violence became more frequent and more intense during the reign of [[Constantius II]].  When Paul, the orthodox bishop of Constantinople, was banished by imperial decree, a riot broke out that resulted in 3000 deaths.  Paul was deposed five times before finally being strangled by imperial decree.  Monks in Alexandria were the first to gain a reputation for violence and cruelty.  Although less frequent than in Antioch and Constantinople, sectarian disturbances also racked Antioch.  At Ephesus, a fight broke out in a council of bishops resulting in one of them being murdered.  Gibbon's assessment was that "the bonds of civil society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions."  [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] lamented that the Kingdom of heaven had been converted into the "image of hell" by religious discord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Overland monthly, and Out west magazine, Volume 20 |first=Bret |last=Harte |publisher=Samuel Carson |year=1892 |page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swMNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Arianism+%22sectarian+violence'&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nTb_TK3HD4nCsAOut6iwCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Arianism%20%22sectarian%20violence'&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athanasius of Alexandria===
{{main|Athanasius of Alexandria}}

[[File:Athanasius of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|220px|Statue of the saint in St Athanasius' [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]].]]
There are at present two completely opposite views about the personality of Athanasius. While some scholars praise him as an orthodox saint with great character, others see him as a power-hungry politician who employed questionable ecclesiastical tactics.  [[Richard E. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]] and [[Timothy Barnes]] have painted a less than flattering picture of the saint.  One of the allegations against him involves suppression of dissent through violence and murder.&lt;ref name = "wxdxek"&gt;Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993),37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein,106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arianism===
{{main|Arianism}}

Following the abortive effort by [[Julian the Apostate]] to restore [[paganism]] in the empire, the emperor [[Valens]]&amp;mdash;himself an Arian&amp;mdash;renewed the persecution of Nicene hierarchs.  However, Valen's successor [[Theodosius I]] effectively wiped out Arianism once and for all among the elites of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]] through a combination of imperial decree, persecution, and the calling of the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] in 381, which condemned Arius anew while reaffirming and expanding the Nicene Creed.&lt;ref&gt;See Vasiliev, A.,[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/vasilief/church-state-fourth-century.asp?pg=3 "The Church and the State at the End of the Fourth Century"], from ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', Chapter One.  Retrieved on 2010-02-02. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.iii.html The text of this version of the Nicene Creed]&lt;/ref&gt;  This generally ended the influence of Arianism among the non-Germanic peoples of the Roman Empire.

===Circumcellions===
The [[Circumcellions]] were fanatical bands of predatory peasants that flourished in North Africa in the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary"&gt;"Circumcellions." Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At first they were concerned with remedying social grievances, but they became linked with the [[Donatist]] sect.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary" /&gt; They condemned property and slavery, and advocated canceling debts and freeing slaves.&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book|first=Will |last=Durant |title=The age of faith. |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donatists prized martyrdom and had a special devotion for the [[martyr]]s, rendering honours to their graves.  The Circumcellions had come to regard martyrdom as the true Christian virtue, and thus disagreed with the [[Episcopal see of Carthage]] on the primacy of chastity, sobriety, humility, and charity. Instead, they focused on bringing about their own martyrdom—by any means possible.  They survived until the fourth century in Africa, when their desire for martyrdom was fulfilled due to persecution.

===Council of Chalcedon===

In 451, [[Pope Leo I]] urged [[Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople|Anatolius]] to convene an [[ecumenical council]] in order to set aside the 449 [[Second Council of Ephesus]], better known as the "Robber Council".  The [[Council of Chalcedon]] was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the [[Christological]] debates that broke apart the church of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 {{ISBN|0-85323-039-0}}, pages 1-5 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Severus of Antioch]] is said to have stirred up a fierce religious war among the population of Alexandria, resulting in bloodshed and conflagrations (Labbe, v. 121). To escape punishment for this violence, he fled to Constantinople, supported by a band of two hundred Non-Chalcedonian monks. Anastasius, who succeeded Zeno as emperor in 491, was a professed Non-Chalcedonian, and received Severus with honor. His presence initiated a period of fighting in Constantinople between rival bands of monks, Chalcedonian and Non, which ended in AD 511 with the humiliation of Anastasius, the temporary triumph of the patriarch Macedonius II, and the reversal of the Non-Chalcedonian cause (Theophanes, p.&amp;nbsp;132).  At the [[Council of Constantinople (518)|Council of Constantinople]] in 518, Syrian monks placed the responsibility for the slaughter of 350 Chalcedonian monks and the appropriation of church vessels on Severus' shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Justinian and the making of the Syrian Orthodox Church |first=Volker-Lorenz |last=Menze |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated theological disputes, political rivalry, and sectarian violence produced a schism that persists to this day between [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] and [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]] churches.

===Albigensian Crusade===
{{Main|Albigensian Crusade}}

Jonathan Barker cited the [[Albigensian Crusade]], launched by [[Pope Innocent III]] against followers of [[Catharism]], as an example of Christian [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; The 20-year war led to an estimated one million casualties.&lt;ref name="massacre_pure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897752-1,00.html|title=Massacre of the Pure|publisher=TIME Magazine|date=1961-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cathar]] teachings rejected the principles of material wealth and power as being in direct conflict with the principle of love. They worshiped in private houses rather than churches, without the sacraments or the cross, which they rejected as part of the world of matter, and sexual intercourse was considered sinful, but in other respects they followed conventional teachings, reciting the Lord's prayer and reading from Biblical scriptures.&lt;ref name="massacre_pure"/&gt; They believed that the Saviour was a "heavenly being merely masquerading as human to bring salvation to the elect, who often have to conceal themselves from the world, and who are set apart by  their special knowledge and personal purity".&lt;ref name="massacre_pure"/&gt;

Cathars rejected the [[Old Testament]] and its God, whom they named [[Rex Mundi (disambiguation)|Rex Mundi]] (Latin for "king of the world"), whom they saw as a blind usurper who demanded fearful obedience and worship and who, under the most false pretexts, tormented and murdered those whom he called "his children" They proclaimed that there was a higher God—the True God—and [[Jesus]] was his messenger. They held that the physical world was evil and created by Rex Mundi, who encompassed all that was corporeal, chaotic and powerful; the second god, the one whom they worshipped, was entirely disincarnate: a being or principle of pure spirit and completely unsullied by the taint of matter – He was the god of love, order and peace.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Catharism]] and [[Catharism#Theology]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barker, the Albigenses had developed a culture that "fostered tolerance of Jews and Muslims, respect for women and women priests, the appreciation of poetry, music and beauty, [had it] been allowed to survive and thrive, it is possible the Europe might have been spared its wars of religion, its witch-hunts and its holocausts of victims sacrificed in later centuries to religious and ideological bigotry".&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;{{cite book|title=The no-nonsense guide to terrorism|author=Jonathan Barker|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=1-85984-433-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}} When asked by his followers how to differentiate between heretics and the ordinary public, Abbe Arnaud Amalric, head of the [[Cistercian]] monastic order, simply said "Kill them all, God will recognize his own!".&lt;ref name="massacre_pure"/&gt;

==Catholic–Protestant==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}
Historically, some Catholic countries once persecuted Protestants as heretics. For example, the substantial Protestant population of [[France]] (the [[Huguenot]]s) was expelled from the kingdom in the 1680s following the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]. In [[Spain]], the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] sought to root out not only [[Protestantism]] but also [[Marrano|crypto-Jews]] and [[Morisco|crypto-Muslims]] (''[[expulsion of the Moriscos|moriscos]]''); elsewhere the [[Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] held similar goals.
In most places where Protestantism is the majority or "official" religion, there have been examples of Catholics being persecuted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In countries where the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was successful, this often lay in the perception that Catholics retained allegiance to a 'foreign' power ([[the Papacy]]), causing them to be regarded with suspicion. Sometimes this mistrust manifested itself in Catholics being subjected to restrictions and discrimination, which itself led to further conflict. For example, before [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, Catholics were forbidden from voting, becoming MPs or buying land in Ireland.

{{As of| 2010}}, bigotry and discrimination in employment are usually restricted to a few places where extreme forms of religion{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} are the norm, or in areas with a long history of sectarian violence and tension, such as Northern Ireland (especially in terms of employment; however, this is dying out in this jurisdiction, thanks to strictly-enforced legislation. [[Reverse discrimination]] now takes place in terms of employment quotas which are now applied). In places where more "moderate" forms of Protestantism (such as [[Anglicanism]] or Episcopalianism) prevail, the two traditions do not become polarized against each other, and usually co-exist peacefully. Especially in England, sectarianism is nowadays almost unheard of. However, in [[Western Scotland]] (where [[Calvinism]] and [[Presbyterianism]] are the norm) sectarian divisions can still sometimes arise between Catholics and Protestants. In the early years following the [[Scottish Reformation]] there was internal sectarian tension between [[Church of Scotland]] Presbyterians and '[[High Church]]' Anglicans, the former regarding the latter as having retained too many attitudes and practices from the pre-Reformation Catholic era.

==European wars of religion==

{{Main|European wars of religion}}

[[File:Schlacht am Weißen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] in [[Bohemia]] (1620)—one of the decisive battles of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]
Following the onset of the [[Protestant Reformation]], a series of wars were waged in Europe starting [[circa]] 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to Miroslav Volf, the [[European wars of religion]] were a major factor behind the "emergence of secularizing modernity".

===Netherlands===

The Low Countries have a particular history of religious conflict which had its roots in the [[Calvinist]] reformation movement of the 1560s. These conflicts became known as the [[Dutch Revolt]] or the Eighty Years' War. By dynastic inheritance, the whole of the Netherlands (including present day Belgium) had come to be ruled by the kings of Spain. Following aggressive Calvinist preaching in and around the rich merchant cities of the southern Netherlands, organized anti-Catholic religious protests grew in violence and frequency.

===France===
{{Further|St. Bartholomew's Day massacre}}

The [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–98) is the name given to a period of [[civil war|civil infighting]] and [[military operation]]s, primarily fought between [[France|French]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] ([[Huguenot]]s). The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the [[House of Bourbon]] and [[House of Guise]] ([[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[Massacre of Vassy]] in 1562 is generally considered to be the beginning of the Wars of Religion and the Edict of Nantes at least ended this series of conflicts. During this time, complex diplomatic negotiations and agreements of peace were followed by renewed conflict and power struggles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At the conclusion of the conflict in 1598, Huguenots were granted substantial rights and freedoms by the Edict of Nantes, though it did not end hostility towards them. The wars weakened the authority of the [[monarchy]], already fragile under the rule of [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] and then [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], though it later reaffirmed its role under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations, followed by a wave of [[Roman Catholic]] [[mob violence]], both directed against the [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Calvinist]][[Protestant]]s), during the [[French Wars of Religion]].  The massacre began two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], the military and political leader of the Huguenots.  Starting on 23 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]) with murders on orders of the king of a group of Huguenot leaders including Coligny, the massacres spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre extended to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead vary widely between 5,000 and 30,000 in total.

The massacre also marked a turning point in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file, and those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it "was the worst of the century's religious massacres."&lt;ref name=Koenigsberger&gt;H.G. Koenigsberger, George L.Mosse, G.Q. Bowler, "Europe in the Sixteenth Century", Second Edition, Longman, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe, it "printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Chadwick, H.]]}} &amp; Evans, G.R. (1987), ''Atlas of the Christian Church'', Macmillian, London, {{ISBN|0-333-44157-5}} hardback, pp. 113;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory XIII]] sent the leader of the massacres a [[Golden Rose]], and said that the massacres "gave him more pleasure than fifty[[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battles of Lepanto]], and he commissioned [[Vasari]] to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican".&lt;ref name="gilmour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terrorism review|author1=Ian Gilmour |author2=Andrew Gilmour |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=2|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|pages=136|doi=10.1525/jps.1988.17.3.00p0024k}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings have been called "the worst of the century's religious massacres",&lt;ref name=Koenigsberger /&gt; and led to the start of the ''fourth war'' of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

Since the 14th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in [[Ireland]]. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with [[nationalism]].  [[Northern Ireland]] has seen inter-[[communal]] conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for absentee landlords, aspiring politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late eighteenth century (See 'Two Hundred Years in the Citadel'[http://orangecitadel.blogspot.com/])

===Northern Ireland===
{{Further|The Troubles|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland}}

Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote "The Northern Ireland conflict is a religious conflict. Economic and social considerations are also crucial, but it was the fact that the competing populations in Ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Bruce|title=God Save Ulster|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|page=249|isbn=0-19-285217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|249}} Reviewers agreed "Of course the Northern Ireland conflict is at heart religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The English Historical Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=104|issue=413|date=October 1989|title=God Save Ulster: The Religion and Politics of Paisleyism by Steve Bruce (review)|author=David Harkness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hickey wrote "Politics in the North is not politics exploiting religion. That is far too simple an explanation: it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use. In the case of Northern Ireland the relationship is much more complex. It is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion. It is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth‑century England than to the last quarter of twentieth century Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hickey|title=Religion and the Northern Ireland Problem|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|year=1984|page=67|isbn=0-7171-1115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 1969 to 2002 is known as "[[The Troubles]]". Nearly all the people living in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to either the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] or the [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] community. People of no religion and non-[[Christian]] faiths are still considered as belonging to one of the two "sects" along with churchgoers. In this context, "Protestants" means essentially descendants of immigrants from [[Scotland]] and [[England]] settled in [[Ulster]] during or soon after the 1690s; also known as "[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]]" or "[[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]]" because they generally support politically the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the [[United Kingdom]]. "Catholics" means descendants of the pre-1690 indigenous [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] population; also known as "[[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]]" and "[[Irish republicanism|Republicans]]"; who generally politically favour a [[united Ireland]].

Reactions to sectarian domination and abuse have resulted in accusations of sectarianism being levelled against the minority community. It has been argued, however, that those reactions would be better understood in terms of a struggle against the sectarianism that governs relations between the two communities and which has resulted in the denial of human rights to the minority community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orangecitadel.blogspot.com/ Mulholland, P. (1999) Drumcree: A Struggle for Recognition]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The [[Corrymeela Community]] of [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The [[Ulster Project]] works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the [[United States]] to provide safe, [[non-denominational]] environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities.

Northern Ireland has introduced a Private Day of Reflection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayofreflection.com/Private Day of Reflection : Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; since 2007, to mark the transition to a post-[sectarian] conflict society, an initiative of the cross-community Healing through Remembering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healingthroughremembering.org/ Healing through Remembering : Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; organisation and research project.

==United Kingdom==
{{Further|Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom}}

[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Saint [[Thomas More]]]]

The [[Act of Supremacy]] of 1534 declared the [[English crown]] to be 'the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England' in place of the pope. Any act of allegiance to the latter was considered treasonous because the papacy claimed both spiritual and political power over its followers. It was under this act that saints [[Thomas More]] and [[John Fisher]] were executed and became martyrs to the Catholic faith.

The Act of Supremacy (which asserted England's independence from papal authority) was repealed in 1554 by Henry's daughter [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] (who was a devout Catholic) when she reinstituted Catholicism as England's state religion. Another Act of Supremacy was passed in 1559 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], along with an [[Act of Uniformity]] which made worship in [[Church of England]] compulsory. Anyone who took office in the English church or government was required to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]]; penalties for violating it included hanging and quartering. Attendance at [[Anglican]] services became obligatory—those who refused to attend Anglican services, whether Roman Catholics or Protestants ([[Puritans]]), were fined and physically punished as [[recusant]]s.

In the time of Elizabeth I, the persecution of the adherents of the Reformed religion, both Anglicans and Protestants alike, which had occurred during the reign of her elder half-sister Queen Mary I was used to fuel strong anti-Catholic propaganda in the hugely influential [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]. Those who had died in Mary's reign, under the [[Marian Persecutions]], were effectively canonised by this work of [[hagiography]]. In 1571 the Convocation of the [[Church of England]] ordered that copies of the ''Book of Martyrs'' should be kept for public inspection in all cathedrals and in the houses of church dignitaries. The book was also displayed in many Anglican parish churches alongside the [[Holy Bible]]. The passionate intensity of its style and its vivid and picturesque dialogues made the book very popular among [[Puritan]] and [[Low Church]] families, Anglican and Protestant[[Nonconformism|nonconformist]], down to the nineteenth century. In a period of extreme partisanship on all sides of the religious debate, the exaggeratedly partisan church history of the earlier portion of the book, with its grotesque stories of popes and monks, contributed to fuel anti-Catholic prejudices in England, as did the story of the sufferings of several hundred Reformers (both Anglican and Protestant) who had been burnt at the stake under Mary and [[Edmund Bonner|Bishop Bonner]].

Anti-Catholicism among many of the English was grounded in the fear that the pope sought to reimpose not just religio-spiritual authority over England but also secular power of the country; this was seemingly confirmed by various actions by the Vatican. In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] sought to depose Elizabeth with the [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which declared her a [[heresy|heretic]] and purported to dissolve the duty of all Elizabeth's subjects of their allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth's subjects who persisted in their allegiance to the Catholic Church politically suspect, and made the position of her Catholic subjects largely untenable if they tried to maintain both allegiances at once.

Elizabeth's persecution of Catholic [[Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] led to the executions of many priests such as [[Edmund Campion]]. Although at the time of their deaths, they were considered traitors to England, they are now considered [[martyr]]s by the Catholic Church.

Later several accusations fueled strong anti-Catholicism in England including the [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which [[Guy Fawkes]] and other Catholic conspirators where accused of planning to blow up the English Parliament while it was in session.

In the 1830s and 1840s, prominent Protestant leaders, such as [[Lyman Beecher]] and [[Horace Bushnell]], attacked the Catholic Church as not only theologically unsound but an enemy of republican values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beecher |first=Lyman |title=A Plea for the West |url=http://libsysdigi.library.uiuc.edu/oca/Books2007-07/pleaforwest00beec/ |accessdate=10 April 2010 |year=1835|publisher=Truman &amp; Smith |location=Cincinnati |page=61 |quote=The Catholic system is adverse to liberty, and the clergy to a great extent are dependent on foreigners opposed to the principles of our government, for patronage and support.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars view the anti-Catholic rhetoric of Beecher and Bushnell as having contributed to anti-Irish and anti-Catholic mob violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html |first=Terry |last=Matthews |title=Lecture 16 - Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America |accessdate=3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20010529012128/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html |archivedate=29 May 2001 |df= }}{{cite book |title=Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ78Vd4O9d4C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%22Lyman+Beecher+and+Horace+Bushnell%22+Catholic |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, Inc. |author=Stravinskas, Peter, M.J., Shaw, Russell |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-87973-669-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecher's well-known "Plea for the West" (1835) urged Protestants to exclude Catholics from western settlements. The Catholic Church's official silence on the subject of slavery also garnered the enmity of northern Protestants. Intolerance became more than an attitude on 11 August 1834, when a mob set fire to an [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] convent in Charlestown, Massachusetts.

The resulting "nativist" movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism that led to mob violence, the burning of Catholic property, and the killing of Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |title=The History of Anti-Catholicism |accessdate=2008-11-10 |author=Jimmy Akin |work=This Rock |publisher=Catholic Answers |date=2001-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907171941/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This violence was fed by claims that Catholics were destroying the culture of the United States. Irish Catholic immigrants were blamed for spreading violence and drunkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-19-503268-0 | page = 119 | last = Hennesey | first = James J.  | title = American Catholics | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late nineteenth century southern United States evangelical Protestants used a wide range of terror activities, including lynching, murder, attempted murder, rape, beating, tar-and-feathering, whipping, and destruction of property, to suppress competition from black Christians (who saw Christ as the saviour of the black oppressed), Mormons, Native Americans, foreign-born immigrants, Jews, and Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Mob: Violence against Religious Outsiders in the U.S. South, 1865-1910|author=Patrick Q.

===Mormonism===
{{Main|Violence against Mormons|Mormonism and violence}}

Early Mormon history is marred by many instances of violent persecution, which has helped shape the faith's views toward violence. The first significant violent persecution occurred in [[Missouri]]. Mormons tended to vote as a bloc there, wielding "considerable political and economic influence," often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Monroe, R.D. |year=  |title= Congress and the Mexican War, 1844-1849 |work= lincoln.lib.niu.edu |url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html |accessdate= 2006-06-03 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060613030726/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html |archivedate= 2006-06-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences culminated in the [[Mormon War (1838)|Missouri Mormon War]] and the eventual issuing of an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] (since called the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] within the LDS community) by [[Missouri governor]] [[Lilburn Boggs]], which declared that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State." Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at [[Haun's Mill massacre|Haun's Mill]], resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The extermination order was not formally rescinded until 1976.

In [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], persecutions were often based on the alleged tendency of Mormons to "dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they landed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author= VandeCreek, Drew E. | year=  | title= Religion and Culture | work= lincoln.lib.niu.edu | url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/religionculture.html | accessdate= 2006-06-03 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901114806/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/religionculture.html | archivedate= 2006-09-01 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the [[Nauvoo Legion]] (the Mormon [[militia]]) continued to grow. Other issues of contention included [[plural marriage]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[History of slavery in the United States#Anti-Slavery|anti-slavery]] views expressed by Smith during his 1844 presidential campaign, and Smith's teachings on the [[King Follet discourse|deification of man]].  After the destruction of the press of the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', Smith was arrested and incarcerated in [[Carthage Jail]] where [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|he was killed by a mob]] on June 27, 1844.  The [[Illinois Mormon War|persecution in Illinois]] became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the [[Mississippi River]] in February 1846.

Even after Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in [[Utah Territory]] convinced U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States; critics pointed to the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] and [[plural marriage]] as signs of the rebellion. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the American standing army in 1857 to Utah in what is known as the [[Utah War]].

The [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] of September 11, 1857 was widely blamed on the church's teachings of blood atonement and other anti-[[United States]] rhetoric by LDS Church leaders during the [[Utah War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The widely publicized massacre was a mass killing of Arkansan emigrants by a Mormon militia led by prominent Mormon leader [[John D. Lee]], who was later executed for his role in the killings. After escalating rumors that some of the emigrants had participated in early Mormon persecution, the militia conducted a siege, and when the emigrants surrendered, the militia killed men, women, and children in cold blood, adopted some of the surviving children, and attempted a cover-up.
Though widely connected with the blood atonement doctrine by the United States press and general public, there is no direct evidence that the massacre was related to "saving" the emigrants by the shedding of their blood (as they had not entered into Mormon covenants); rather, most commentators view it as an act of intended retribution. Young was accused with either directing the massacre, or with complicity after the fact. However, when Brigham Young was interviewed on the matter and asked if he believed in blood atonement, he replied, "I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime." He said "we believe that execution should be done by the shedding of blood instead of by hanging," but only "according to the laws of the land"{{Harv|Young|1877|p=242}}.

An example used by some to illustrate the alleged practice blood atonement is the 1866 murder of the former-slave, Thomas Coleman (or Colburn), who was in good standing as a member of the LDS Church. As Mormon historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] has documented, Coleman was apparently secretly courting a white Mormon woman. The two were discovered together behind the old Arsenal (on what is now Capitol Hill in Salt Lake) on December 11 and the group hit Coleman with a large rock. Using his own bowie knife, his attackers slit his throat so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, as well as slicing open his right breast, in what some believe was a mimicry of penalties illustrated in the temple ritual. Not all of Coleman's wounds correlated with the temple ritual, however, since he was also castrated. A pre-penciled placard was then pinned to his corpse stating, "NOTICE TO ALL NIGGERS - TAKE WARNING - LEAVE WHITE WOMEN ALONE." A grave was dug and Coleman's body was buried less than three hours after its discovery. Less than twelve hours after that, Judge Elias Smith, first cousin of Joseph Smith, appointed George Stringham (a Mormon ruffian and vigilante with ties to Porter Rockwell, Jason Luce, and William Hickman) as the foreman of the Coroner's Jury; they briefly met and summarily dismissed the case as a crime that was committed either by a person or by persons unknown to the jury, ending all official inquiry into the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Extensions of Power, p. 256 and Daily Union Vedette, 15 December 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the ritualistic elements involved in the execution of Coleman’s murder may have been in response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, “I am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1863|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is [[death on the spot]]. This will always be so." Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, “for their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1863|p=110}} Young also declares that he is “neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man” but that if he had to choose, he would “be against the pro-slavery side of the question.”&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to Coleman's murder, LDS apologists point out that the practice of "blood atonement" is said to apply to ''endowed Mormons who apostatized''. Coleman was a member in good standing and was not endowed, suggesting that his death may have actually been the result of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Blood Atonement| publisher= Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research|url= http://fairwiki.org/index.php/Blood_atonement }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the examples cited by critics of the church is a set of murders in [[Springville, Utah]] of individuals who, according to historical documents and court records, were "very questionable characters." Judge Elias Smith stated in regard to the case: "We have carefully examined all the evidence furnished by a remarkably accurate stenographic reporter, and can only conclude that evidence before the court goes to show' that Durfee, Potter and two of the Parrishes got into a row about matters best, if not only, known to themselves, and for that Potter and two Parrishes were killed."&lt;ref&gt;Records published in the [[Deseret News]], April 6th, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

At the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Roman Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Anti-Catholicism was widespread in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Dumenil (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) in the 1920s, anti-Catholic rhetoric intensified. The Catholic ''[[National Shrine of the Little Flower|Church of the Little Flower]]'' was first built in 1925 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], a largely Protestant area.  Two weeks after it opened, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Shannon |first1= William V.|authorlink1= William V.

Although the [[First Crusade]] was initially launched in response to an appeal from [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]][[Alexios I Komnenos]]for help in repelling the invading [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] from [[Anatolia]], one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to "further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The genealogy of violence: reflections on creation, freedom, and evil |first=Charles K.|last=Bellinger |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2001 |page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjBW2JsNPPcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Crusades+Christianity+Orthodox+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pMTwTNnoBoL6swP1rYCdDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byzantine Constantinople-en.png|thumb|right|350px|Map showing Constantinople and its walls during the Byzantine era]]

The [[Siege of Constantinople]] (also called the [[Fourth Crusade]]) occurred in 1204; it destroyed parts of the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as it was confiscated by [[Western Europe]]an and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Crusaders]].

After the fall of Constantinople, the Crusaders inflicted a savage sacking on the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agiasofia.com/emperors/fall1204.html|title= Sack of Constantinople, 1204|publisher=Agiasofia.com|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed.  Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared.

The [[Massacre of the Latins]] occurred in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], in 1182. It was a large-scale massacre of the "[[Frankokratia|Latin]]" ([[Roman Catholic]]) merchants and their families, who at that time dominated the city's [[maritime trade]] and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at over 60,000 at the time,&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Middle Ages: 950-1250 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-521-26645-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IhKYifENTMC | pages=506–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; was wiped out or forced to flee. The [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Pisa]]n communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the Turks.&lt;ref name="Nicol107"&gt;{{cite book | last=Nicol|first=Donald M. | title=Byzantium and Venice: A Study in Diplomatic and Cultural Relations | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1992 |isbn= 978-0-521-42894-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rymIUITIYdwC | page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yugoslav wars ===
{{Main|Yugoslav wars}}

The civil wars in the [[Balkans]] which followed the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s have been heavily tinged with sectarianism. [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]] have traditionally been Catholic, [[Serbs]] and [[Macedonian Slavs|Macedonians]] [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Bosniaks]] and most [[Albanians]] Muslim. Religious affiliation served as a marker of group identity in this conflict, despite relatively low rates of religious practice and belief among these various groups after decades of [[communism]]. Some scholars doubt to religion had much of influence in that events.

'''T-ough Press''' is a "subterranean" publishing house based in the southern suburbs of Moscow. It was established by Alex Kervey.

Kervey started the business when he found he could not get his own translations published. Existing publishers had either never heard of such writers as Hunter S Thompson, or found the material offensive. He has used young translators in their twenties to publish a range of texts from [[Western Europe]] and [[United States|America]], such as:
*[[William S. Burroughs]]: ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junky]]'' and ''[[Ghost of Chance]]''
*[[Hunter S. Thompson]]: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (novel)|Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' and ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]''
*[[Aleister Crowley]]: ''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]''
*[[Irvine Welsh]]: ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]''
*[[Stewart Home]]: ''Blow Job'', ''Come Before Christ and Murder Love''
*[[Tony White (writer)|Tony White]] ''Road Rage!/Satan! Satan! Satan!''

In 2006 T-ough Press faced prosecution for publishing Home's ''Come Before Christ and Murder Love'' and White's ''Road Rage!/Satan! Satan! Satan!''. They were accused of pornography and insulting Christian values. Their premises were also fire bombed. This has been ascribed to [[fascism|fascists]]. The [[National Bolshevism|National Bolsheviks]] have taken particular exception to ''Blow Job'' which satirises their blend of right-left politics. Legal and political pressure has also delayed the appearance of Home's ''Tainted Love'' and ''Slow Death''.

'''Tamikrest''' ([[Tamashek]] for ''junction, alliance, the future'') is a group of musicians who belong to the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] people. The band was founded in 2006 in [[Tamanrasset]], [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyeplug.net/magazine/?p=1889 |title=Tamikrest |publisher=eyeplug.net |date=2011-05-21 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mix traditional African music with Western rock and pop influences and sing in [[Tamashek]]. Main songwriter and leader of the band is Ousmane Ag Mossa.

Their music is characterized by electric guitars and vocals, youyous, bass, drums, djembé and other percussion instruments.

== Band History ==

[[File:Horizonte 2013 0166 02.JPG|thumb|left|Tamikrest]]
[[File:Horizonte 2013 0039.JPG|thumb|left|Tamikrest]]
When Tamikrest was founded in 2006, the musicians were all in their early twenties. They originate from the region around [[Tamanrasset]], a city in southern of [[Algeria]]. All of them visited the ''Les enfants de l'Adrar school'' in [[Tinzaouaten|Tinzawaten]], a small oasis in the middle of the desert, which was funded by European foundations. It was there that the future members of Tamikrest got their basic musical training. Their youth was shaped by the [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|civil war that took place between 1990 and 1995]]. Many family members and friends died while the Tuareg fought for their autonomy. When new riots broke out in 2006, Ousmane Ag Mossa and his friend Cheick Ag Tiglia decided not to fight with weapons, but to call attention to the Tuareg’s cause with musical means.

In their youth they played the traditional music of the [[Tuareg people|Kel Tamasheq]] (as the Tuareg call themselves) and the songs of the Tuareg band [[Tinariwen]], who already mixed African traditional music with western rock music in the eighties. Through the internet and mp3 culture, the Tamikrest members got to know bands and musicians like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Mark Knopfler]] who influenced the shaping of the special Tamikrest sound as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamikrest.net/en/biography.php |title=Biografie |publisher=Tamikrest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AcCfeWRP?url=http://www.tamikrest.net/en/biography.php |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance meeting with the American-Australian band [[Dirtmusic]] at the ''Festival Au Désert'' in 2008, which took place in [[Essakane]] (about 50 miles west of [[Timbuktu]]), led to a friendship and musical cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://label.glitterhouse.com/artists.php?show=8 |title=Glitterhouse Records :: Artists |publisher=Label.glitterhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dirtmusic recorded their second album, ''BKO'', in a studio in [[Bamako]] (the capital of Mali) in 2010, Tamikrest were invited to play on that album. Chris Eckman (member of Dirtmusic and [[The Walkabouts]]) also produced ''Adagh'', Tamikrest's first album. In 2010, both bands toured Europe together and played festivals like [[Sziget Festival|Sziget]] and ''Orange Blossom Special'', the latter organized by their label [[Glitterhouse Records]]. In October 2010, Chris Eckman produced Tamikrest's second album ''Toumastin'', which was released in April 2011.

{{Governance}}

'''Technology governance''' means the [[governance]], i.e., the [[steering]] between the different sectors&amp;mdash;state, business, and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s&amp;mdash;of the development of [[technology]]. The concept is based on the notion of [[innovation]] and of techno-economic paradigm shifts according to the theories of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter|Joseph A. Schumpeter]], [[Christopher Freeman]], [[Carlota Perez]], etc.  

The idea is that certain periods in [[economic development]] are dominated by a paradigm-leading technology that influences through [[finance]] mechanisms, organizational change, greater returns, etc. Also, the economic and social sphere to such an extent that an entire [[paradigm]] is coined by them. Currently, that paradigm-leading technology is [[information and communications technology]] (ICT). According to Innovation Theory (and empirical findings as well), states, regions, or other communities do not automatically promote, or even go into, these key technologies, but rather need to be guided there by active [[wikt:intervene|intervention]], by the State sector (in close cooperation and coordination). Technology governance, (as a field of scholarly inquiry and academic instruction) is therefore about how this is theoretically and practically done, which [[institutions]] are optimal for such a venue, how the [[education]] of [[Academic administration|administrator]]s have to look like if they are going to have the administrative capacity to deal with such matters, etc.

Technology governance is a [[public policy]] concept; it is not to be confused with inner-corporate arrangements of organisation ([[corporate governance]]) and IT arrangements, sometimes called "Information Technology Governance".

'''The Pirate Bay trial''' is a joint [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] prosecution in [[Sweden]] of four individuals charged for promoting the [[copyright infringement]] of others with the [[torrent tracker|torrent tracking]] website [[The Pirate Bay]].&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Kravets |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/pirate-bay-futu.html |title=Pirate Bay Future Uncertain After Operators Busted |work=Threat Level |publisher=[[Wired News]] Blogs |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larsson&gt;{{cite web |first=Linus |last=Larsson |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.143146 |title=Charges filed against the Pirate Bay four|work=[[Computer Sweden]]|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of [[intellectual rights]] holders led by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Lindenberger |date=20 February 2009 |title=Internet Pirates Face Walking the Plank in Sweden |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1880981,00.html |work=[[TIME]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden|Swedish]] [[prosecutor]]s filed charges on 31 January 2008 against [[Fredrik Neij]], [[Gottfrid Svartholm]], and [[Peter Sunde]], who ran the site; and [[Carl Lundström]], a Swedish businessman who through his businesses sold services to the site. The prosecutor claimed the four worked together to administer, host, and develop the site and thereby facilitated other people's breach of [[copyright]] law. Some 34 cases of copyright infringements were originally listed, of which 21 were related to music files, 9 to movies, and 4 to games.&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt; One case involving music files was later dropped by the copyright holder who made the file available again on the website of [[The Pirate Bay]]. In addition, claims for damages of 117 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (US$13 million) were filed.&lt;ref name=timescharges&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Harvey |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5754740.ece |title=Half of Pirate Bay charges dropped |publisher=The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was decided jointly by a professional judge and three appointed [[lay judge#Sweden|lay judges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piratnämndeman fick lämna uppdrag |publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]] |date=10 February 2009 |url=http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article412141/Piratnamndeman-fick-lamna-uppdrag.html |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114165949/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article412141/Piratnamndeman-fick-lamna-uppdrag.html |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial started on 16 February 2009 in the [[Stockholm District Court]], [[Sweden]]. The hearings ended on 3 March 2009 and the verdict was announced at 11:00 AM on Friday 17 April 2009: Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström were all found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine of 30 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (about [[€]]2.7 million or [[US$]]3.5 million).&lt;ref name="appealdatepcw"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mikael |last=Ricknäs |date=11 March 2010 |title=Pirate Bay Appeals Looks Set to Start in September |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/191304/pirate_bay_appeals_looks_set_to_start_in_september.html |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the defendants appealed the verdict, and in November 2010 the appeal court shortened the prison sentences, but increased damages.

On 1 February 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] refused to hear an appeal in the case, prompting the site to change its official domain name from thepiratebay.org to thepiratebay.se.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10782968 Pirate Bay shifts domains after appeal fails] ''New Zealand Herald'', 2 February 2012.

On 31 May 2006 the Swedish police organized a raid on The Pirate Bay in 12 different premises,&lt;ref name=nilsson&gt;{{cite news |last=Nilsson |first=David |title=Bevisen: Mejl och fakturor |date=16 February 2009 |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article4428662.ab |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; confiscating 186 servers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 April 2007 |title=Police cleared of wrongdoing in Pirate Bay raid |url=http://www.thelocal.se/6882/20070402/ |work=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/Webbnav/index.aspx?nid=3451&amp;rm=2007/08&amp;bet=JO1&amp;typ=frsrdg Redogörelse 2007/08:JO1 - Justitieombudsmännens ämbetsberättelse].

The raid, alleged by The Pirate Bay to be politically motivated and under pressure from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Steal This Film]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reported as a success by the MPAA in the immediate aftermath but with the website being restored within days and file sharing firmly in focus in the Swedish media, with ''[[TorrentFreak]]'' calling the raid "highly unsuccessful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ernesto|title=The Pirate Bay: One year After the Raid|url=https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-one-year-after-the-raid/|publisher=''TorrentFreak''|accessdate=4 June 2016|date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torrentfreak_1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-not-impressed-by-announced-prosecution/| date=4 May 2007| publisher=TorrentFreak| title=The Pirate Bay Not Impressed by Announced Prosecution| accessdate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police, however, conducted a preliminary investigation on the confiscated material and by interrogating associated people.

{{See also|Judicial system of Sweden}}

On 31 January 2008 Swedish prosecutors filed charges against four individuals they associated with The Pirate Bay for "promoting other people's infringements of copyright laws".&lt;ref name=kravets /&gt;&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt; One of the artists represented by IFPI, Max Peezay, withdrew from the case, decreasing his distributor's compensation demand by 120 000 SEK. Peezay hadn't been asked about participating in the case, and he in fact supports file sharing for private use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tobias |last=Brandel |date=16 April 2008 |title=Ifpi ber Max Peezay om ursäkt |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_1137149.svd |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peezay noted however that being unfamiliar with the site, his withdrawal shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of support for their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tobias |last=Brandel |date=16 April 2008 |title=Artist hoppar av Pirate bay-åtalet |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_1137879.svd |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in February 2009.

===First day of the trial===
[[File:Peter gottfried rick marcin2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Sunde]], [[Gottfrid Svartholm]], [[Rick Falkvinge]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcin de Kaminski|sv}} at the demonstration by the court house on the first day of the trial]]

On 16 February 2009 defense lawyer Per E. Samuelson stressed to the court that "file sharing services can be used both legally and illegally". Samuelson argued that "it is legal to offer a service that can be used in both a legal and illegal way according to Swedish law" and that The Pirate Bay's services "can be compared to making cars that can be driven faster than the speed limit". Defense attorney Jonas Nilsson insisted that "the individual Internet users who use Pirate Bay services... must answer for the material they have in their possession or the files they plan to share with others."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gyIR6YvH9ITqz0v5d2S2W8bUdwdA Pirate Bay chiefs deny illegal downloading at trial], AFP (via Google News), 16 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second day of the trial===
On 17 February 2009 (the second day of the trial) half of the charges against The Pirate Bay were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/17640/20090217/ Pirate Bay prosecutor amends charges] [[The Local]], February 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to defense lawyer Per Samuelson, "This is a sensation. It is very rare to win half the case in just one and a half days and it is clear the prosecutor took strong note of what we said yesterday". Peter Danowsky, legal counsel for the music companies, stated "It's a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay. In fact it simplifies the prosecutor’s case by allowing him to focus on the main issue which is the making available of copyrighted works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trelleborgsallehanda.se/article/20090217/TTINRIKES/941131515 Lawyers say it is a sensation], Trelleborgs Allehanda, 17 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor was unable to prove that the [[.torrent]] files brought as evidence were actually using The Pirate Bay's tracker. Furthermore, prosecutor Håkan Roswall did not adequately explain the function of [[Distributed Hash Table|DHT]] which allows for so-called "trackerless" torrents. These shortcomings in the evidence resulted in prosecutor Håkan Roswall having to drop all charges relating to "assisting copyright infringement", leaving "assisting making available" as the remaining charge. Roswall stated that "everything related to reproduction will be removed from the claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://torrentfreak.com/50-of-charges-against-pirate-bay-dropped-090217/ | title=50% of charges dropped | publisher=TorrentFreak | date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanna Wolk, a doctor in law and researcher at Stockholm University observed that "this is not surprising, at least for those who follow the matter. We knew that The Pirate Bay wasn't making any copies directly".&lt;ref name=timescharges /&gt;

===Third day of the trial===
On the third day of The Pirate Bay trial, prosecution witnesses claimed damages on the basis that it should have obtained worldwide licenses for the content it distributed. Where content wasn't officially available, a [[Beatles]] song, for example, it should be charged at 10 times the going rate. This calculation underlines the prosecution's demand for 117 million SEK (US$12.9 million, €10.2 million) in compensation and damages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/02/labels-want-13-million-from-pirate-bay-as-trial-starts.ars Big Content wants $13 million from Pirate Bay as trial starts] [[ARS Technica]], 16 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===="King Kong" defense====
On day three of the trial, defense attorney Per Samuelson presented an argument later dubbed the "King Kong defense":&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/g-defense-090218/ Day 3&amp;nbsp;— The Pirate Bay’s ‘King Kong’ Defense] TorrentFreak, 18 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be responsible, the service provider must initiate the transfer. But the admins of The Pirate Bay don’t initiate transfers. It’s the users that do and they are physically identifiable people. They call themselves names like King Kong...  According to legal procedure, the accusations must be against an individual and there must be a close tie between the perpetrators of a crime and those who are assisting. This tie has not been shown. The prosecutor must show that Carl Lundström personally has interacted with the user King Kong, who may very well be found in the jungles of Cambodia...&lt;ref&gt;[http://svtplay.se/v/1448829/24direkt/dag_3_-_advokat_per_e_samuelson_sakframstallning_for_carl_lundstrom?cb,a1366518,1,f,105865/pb,a1366516,1,f,105865/pl,v,,1446413/sb,k105865,1,f,105865 Dag 3&amp;nbsp;— Advokat Per E Samuelson sakframställning för Carl lundström] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222155217/http://svtplay.se/v/1448829/24direkt/dag_3_-_advokat_per_e_samuelson_sakframstallning_for_carl_lundstrom?cb%2Ca1366518%2C1%2Cf%2C105865%2Fpb%2Ca1366516%2C1%2Cf%2C105865%2Fpl%2Cv%2C%2C1446413%2Fsb%2Ck105865%2C1%2Cf%2C105865 |date=2009-02-22 }} svtplay.se, 18 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Samuelson was referring to a real Pirate Bay user who posts via the [[username]] "King Kong", who Samuelson hypothesizes could be in [[Cambodia]]. He used this scenario to illustrate that Lundström had no control over the actions undertaken by Pirate Bay users. His main objection was that although the prosecutor had said that the accused would be tried individually, he had not once referred to them individually, but always as "them", "they" or "Pirate Bay". Samuelson said the persons behind The Pirate Bay could not be held collectively responsible for a crime committed by other identifiable individuals, such as "King Kong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/02/pirate_wednesda.html |work=Threat Level |publisher=[[Wired News]] Blogs |title=Pirate Bay Crew Chums Up to Foes Over Lunch |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009|first=Oscar |last=Swartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "King Kong defense" was quickly popularized by [[blogs]], [[file sharing]] news feeds, and media reports on the Pirate Bay trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kristoffer |last=Rengfors |date=19 February 2009 |title=Internet hyllar King Kong-försvar |url=http://www.metro.se/se/article/2009/02/18/17/3449-45/index.xml |work=[[Metro International|Metro]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=18 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to the [[Chewbacca defense]] from the TV series ''[[South Park]]'', citing a reference to the "jungles of Cambodia" as "the kind of extraneous detail that makes the Chewbacca defense hilarious".&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/chris-dannen/techwatch/torrent-site-fights-legal-action-chewbacca-defense|title=Torrent Site Fights Legal Action with 'Chewbacca Defense'|author=Chris Dannon|publisher=[[FastCompany]]| date=19 February 2009|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its April verdict, the court found that because the defendants indeed had collective responsibility for the site and knew that some torrent files on it pointed to copyrighted material, the EU directive did not apply.&lt;ref name=lewan /&gt;

===Fourth day of the trial===
On 19 February 2009, the fourth day of the trial, Fredrik was questioned several times. It came to the court’s attention that Tobias Andersson, a future witness in the case, was in the court where he was later asked to leave the room. When it was movie industry lawyer [[Monique Wadsted]]’s turn, she introduced new evidence without warning. Noting the breach of protocol, the presiding judge asked if it was acceptable for the court to be considering evidence that was not already presented pre-trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/day-4-pirate-bay-defense-calls-foul-over-evidence-090219/|title=Day 4 - Pirate Bay Defense Calls Foul Over Evidence&amp;nbsp;— TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth day of the trial===
Day five of the proceedings saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted to introduce evidence that had not been shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial. The defense objected vehemently with defense lawyer [[Peter Althin]] equating the tactic to something out of the old [[Perry Mason]] TV show. “Suddenly, the door opens and in walks an entirely new witness.” The presiding judge stopped the case to deliberate the matter and found in favor of the defense, instructing the prosecution to immediately hand over all material they planned to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/9002/pirate-bay-5.html Pirate Bay Trial Day 5: Perry Mason Episode Delays Trial]&amp;nbsp;– [[MP3 Newswire]], 20 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution and the defense spent the remainder of the day delivering conflicting portrayals of the Pirate Bay. The prosecution attempted to show the Pirate Bay as an immensely profitable business that made its money helping others violate copyright law. The defense attempted to show the Pirate Bay as nothing more than a search engine, no different from Google and thus subject to the same protections.

===Seventh, eighth and ninth days of the trial===
On days seven to nine, the court heard [[expert witness]]es called by the prosecution and the defense.&lt;ref name=plan&gt;[http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/23/83/PB_forhands_2marsc.pdf Trial plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318074937/http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/23/83/PB_forhands_2marsc.pdf |date=2009-03-18 }} revised on 2 March 2009. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited contradicting [[academic publishing|academic research]] on the effects of file sharing on sales in the music and film industry globally&lt;ref&gt;

==Verdict and reactions==
The four operators of the site were convicted by Stockholm district court on 17 April 2009 and sentenced to one year in jail each and a total of 30&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;[[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] (approximately [[US$]]3.5&amp;nbsp;million, [[€]]2.7&amp;nbsp;million) in fines and damages. The court found that the defendants were all guilty of [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to crime against copyright law, strengthened by the commercial and organized nature of the activity.&lt;ref name=sentenced&gt;{{cite news |authors=Stiernstedt, Jenny; Johansson, Astrid E; Söderling, Fredrik; Grassman, Oliver |date=17 April 2009 |title=The Pirate Bay sentenced to one year in prison |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/the-pirate-bay-sentenced-to-one-year-in-prison-1.846915 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, however, never presented its [[corpus delicti]] (that is, it never attempted to prove that a crime was committed, but it succeeded in proving that someone was an accessory to that crime).

The international public following the trial received the verdict with varying opinions.

At the end of May 2009, Swedish [[Minister for Culture (Sweden)|Minister for Culture]] [[Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth]] made a speech to The Swedish Society of Popular Music Composers, expressing her opinion that "I was among those pleased about the Pirate Bay verdict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Johan |last=Arvidsson |date=26 May 2009 |title=Kulturministerns utfall mot Pirate Bay |url=http://nyheter24.se/nyheter/inrikes/232341-kulturministern-gjorde-utfall-mot-pirate-bay |work=Nyheter24 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529080944/http://nyheter24.se/nyheter/inrikes/232341-kulturministern-gjorde-utfall-mot-pirate-bay |archivedate=29 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[ministerstyre]] in the [[Constitution of Sweden]], it is unconstitutional for ministers to influence ongoing cases, and many political commentators criticised the minister's statement.

===Subsequent events===
Over 25,000 people joined the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] in the ten days following the guilty verdict,&lt;ref name="blogpirate"&gt;[http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/04/17/result-of-verdict-for-the-pirate-party/ Result of Verdict, for the Pirate Party] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420024204/http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/04/17/result-of-verdict-for-the-pirate-party/ |date=2009-04-20 }}.

In Stockholm and other cities, the Pirate Party organized protests against the court's verdict.

Following the conviction, the IFPI demanded that Swedish [[internet service provider]]s block The Pirate Bay, but the ISPs have refused to do this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/18940/20090418/ ISPs refuse to shut down Pirate Bay] ''[[The Local]]''. 18 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Karlung, managing director of [[Bahnhof]], stated that "we will not censor sites for our customers; that is not our job.

Several Swedish file sharing sites have closed voluntarily with The Pirate Bay verdict as a [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrent]] and as a result of further police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tobias |last=Olsson |date=20 April 2009 |title=Flera fildelningssajter stängda |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_2766265.svd |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2009,  [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] mobilized "Operation Baylout", which included a [[DDoS]] attack on the IFPI International website, causing the site to go offline for a few hours. They released a statement asking supporters of file-sharing to refrain from making any industry-related media purchases during the months of April and May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/04/20/anon-causes-mischief-for-ifpi-calls-for-a-media-boycott/ Anon Causes Mischief For IFPI, Calls For A Media Boycott] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424060634/http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/04/20/anon-causes-mischief-for-ifpi-calls-for-a-media-boycott/ |date=2009-04-24 }}.

Gottfrid Svartholm, one of the TPB founding members, was arrested on 2 September 2012, in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]], while evading Swedish authorities following the 2009 verdict and conviction. A group of Anonymous hackers claimed to have attacked websites and internet systems belonging to the Cambodian government in the wake of the arrest.

==Bias allegations==
In mid 2008 after the indictment had been served, it was discovered that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer [[Peter Althin]] questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation.&lt;ref name=thorkildsen&gt;{{cite news |first=Joakim |last=Thorkildsen |date=18 April 2008 |title=Pirate Bay-etterforsker fikk jobb hos filmgigant |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2008/04/18/532940.html |work=[[Dagbladet]] |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone if that was the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Monica |last=Kleja |date=18 April 2008 |title=Pirate Bay-polisen bytte sida - Utredningen kan vara ogiltig |url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/internet/article333849.ece |work=Ny Teknik |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Kuprijanko |date=21 April 2008 |title=Pirate Bay-polisen begärde tjänstledigt under utredningen |url=http://sydsvenskan.se/digitalt/article317679/Pirate-Bay-polisen-begarde-tjanstledigt-under-utredningen.html |work=[[Sydsvenskan]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510145921/http://sydsvenskan.se/digitalt/article317679/Pirate-Bay-polisen-begarde-tjanstledigt-under-utredningen.html |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case.&lt;ref name=thorkildsen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linus |last=Larsson |date=18 April 2008 |title=Åklagaren: Det har hänt förr |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.156968 |work=[[Computer Sweden]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/23/83/PB_plan_20feb3.pdf Trial plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306090746/http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/23/83/PB_plan_20feb3.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }} revised on 20 February 2009. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/45/70/23/PB_forhands_25feb.pdf Trial plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014091350/http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/45/70/23/PB_forhands_25feb.pdf |date=2009-10-14 }} revised on 25 February 2009. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://svtplay.se/v/1456457/24direkt/dag_7_-_forhor_med_anders_nilsson__antipiratbyran Dag 7 - Förhör med Anders Nilsson, Antipiratbyrån.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227120446/http://svtplay.se/v/1456457/24direkt/dag_7_-_forhor_med_anders_nilsson__antipiratbyran |date=2009-02-27 }} 24 Direkt, [[Sveriges Television]] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only days before the trial began, one of the three appointed [[lay judge#Sweden|lay judges]] was discovered to be a member of a composers' association that among others works on protecting copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Oscar |last=Levy |date=10 February 2009 |title=Pirate Bay-nämndeman är partisk |url=http://nyheter24.se/nyheter/inrikes/131267-pirate-bay-namndeman-ar-partisk |publisher=Nyheter24 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418134700/http://nyheter24.se/nyheter/inrikes/131267-pirate-bay-namndeman-ar-partisk |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussing with judge Tomas Norström the problem the membership could pose to the trial, the composer recused himself from acting as a lay judge in the case and he was replaced with another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Stiernstedt |date=23 April 2009 |title=Domaren var orolig för vad som skulle kunna hända om jag satt kvar |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/domaren-var-orolig-for-vad-som-skulle-kunna-handa-om-jag-satt-kvar-1.850753 |work=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irene |last=Sokolow |date=17 April 2009 |title=Dom i Pirate Bay-mål idag |url=http://www.e24.se/branscher/reklammedia/artikel_1251685.e24 |work=[[E24 Näringsliv]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the trial, presiding judge Tomas Norström, the same judge that ordered the [[The Pirate Bay raid|2006 raid]] on The Pirate Bay's servers, came under scrutiny after allegations of bias. [[Sveriges Radio P3]] News organized an investigation that found on 23 April that Norström had several engagements with organisations interested in [[intellectual property]] issues. Peter Danowsky, Monique Wadsted and [[Henrik Pontén]] from the prosecution side are also members of one of the organisations, the Swedish Copyright Association (SFU).&lt;ref name=localretrial&gt;{{cite news |date=23 April 2009 |title=Pirate Bay lawyer calls for retrial |url=http://www.thelocal.se/19028/20090423/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wadsted commented that all intellectual property lawyers in Stockholm are part of the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Stiernstedt |date=23 April 2009 |title=Monique Wadstedt: "Vi har ingen privat relation" |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/monica-wadstedt-pirate-bay-jav-domare-1.850489 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Norström, the organisations are involved in discussion about copyright, while the earlier lay judges's organisation advocates further copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny|last=Stiernstedt |date=23 April 2009 |title=The Pirate Bay-rättegången kan tas om |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/the-pirate-bay-rattegangen-kan-tas-om-1.850410 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norström however also sits in the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property,&lt;ref name=localretrial /&gt; which along with the SFU are the Swedish branches of [[International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (AIPPI) and Association littéraire et artistique internationale (ALAI).

Following the discovery on 23 April, Peter Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin announced that he would request for a retrial.&lt;ref name=localretrial /&gt; The Swedish [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] decided not to investigate the bias since the question had already been requested to be taken up in the [[Svea Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Niklas |last=Malmborg |date=24 April 2008 |title=JO prövar inte Pirate Bay-jävet |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/jo-provar-inte-pirate-bay-javet-1.852016 |work=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court of appeal received the case on 18 May and assigned it to judge Ulrika Ihrfelt.

In Swedish appeal proceedings for criminal cases where the sentence is greater than a fine, the court usually consists of three professional judges and two lay judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sveriges Domstolar |date=11 May 2007 |title=Hearing in the Court of Appeal |url=http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____4525.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Ihrfelt, again appointed to the case, informed the parties in mid September 2009 that one of the appointed lay judges is working for the music streaming service [[Spotify]], which is partly owned by record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 September 2009 |title=New bias suspicions in Pirate Bay legal battle |url=http://www.thelocal.se/22206/20090921/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lay judge himself didn't feel biased because of his work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexandra |last=Hernadi |date=21 September 2009 |title=Ännu ett misstänkt jäv i TPB-rättegång |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_3552947.svd |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; but prosecuting attorney Danowsky commented that anyone both judging the case and working for Spotify has a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars-Peter |last=Hielle |date=21 September 2009 |title=Peter Sunde: "Uppenbart jäv" |url=http://www.sr.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1646&amp;artikel=3113389 |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio P3]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the same week, defense attorney Samuelsson submitted allegations to the appeal court of Ihrfelt and another professional judge being biased for their membership in the same interest groups judge Norström was investigated for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 September 2009 |title=Bias allegations mount in Pirate Bay case |url=http://www.thelocal.se/22270/20090924/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the court's opinion, the judges' memberships did not constitute bias, whereas the lay judges's impartiality was questionable and he was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sveriges Domstolar |date=6 October 2009 |title=Svea hovrätt ogillar jävsinvändningar i Pirate Bay-målet mot två av hovrättens domare (B 4041-09) |url=http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_Press____11265.aspx |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sveriges Domstolar |date=29 September 2009 |title=Svea hovrätt förklarar nämndeman jävig att delta i handläggningen av Pirate Bay-målet |url=http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_Press____11239.aspx |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision was appealed, and in May 2010 the supreme court affirmed the appeal court's decision on the bias question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sofia |last=Benholm |date=9 December 2009 |title=Förstår om det kan tyckas lite konstigt |url=http://svt.se/2.27170/1.1806013/forstar_om_det_kan_tyckas_lite_konstigt |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212161736/http://svt.se/2.27170/1.1806013/forstar_om_det_kan_tyckas_lite_konstigt |archivedate=12 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Vinthagen Simpson |date=12 May 2010 |title=Pirate Bay judges ruled unbiased |url=http://www.thelocal.se/26612/20100512/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2010 |title=TPB-domare är opartiska |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1646&amp;artikel=3692272 |work=P3 News |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==
After sentencing, the defendants decided to appeal the verdict of the first trial. The appeal started on 28 September 2010 and concluded on 15 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Jenselius, Michael |title= Pirate Bay-rättegången över - dom i november |url= http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.346725/pirate-bay-rattegangen-over---dom-i-november |work= idg.se |publisher= [[International Data Group|IDG]] |language= Swedish |date= 18 October 2010 |accessdate= 18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2010, the verdict was announced. In the verdict, the court found that “The Pirate Bay has facilitated illegal file sharing in a way that results in criminal liability for those who run the service.”&lt;ref name="Fiveash2010"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Fiveash, Kelly |title=Pirate Bay Verdict: Three Operators Lose Appeal |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/26/pirate_bay_appeal_verdict/ |date= 26 November 2010 |accessdate= 30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the verdict, the sentences of three of the defendants would be reduced and the total fines would be increased. The fourth defendant, Gottfrid Svartholm, was not present at the time due to medical reasons. His time for appeal expired on 14 October 2011, and the original 2009 sentence became legally binding for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 October 2011 |title=AWOL pirate's guilty verdict comes into force |url=http://www.thelocal.se/36744/20111014/ |work=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence from the appeal traded jail time for increased fines. After the initial trial, each defendant was to serve a year of jail time and pay fines just under one million dollars each.&lt;ref name="Ernesto2010"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Ernesto |title= The Pirate Bay Appeal Verdict: Guilty Again |url= http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-appeal-verdict-101126/ |date= 26 November 2010 |accessdate= 30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the appeal, Fredrik Neij was sentenced to 10 months, Peter Sunde to eight months, and Carl Lundstrom to four months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Bryant, Martin |title= Pirate Bay trial appeal: Defendants face $6.5m fine and jail time |date= 26 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Svea Court of Appeal decided to grant all Nordic companies their full request in compensation for copyright infringement due to The Pirate Bay, with outside companies being granted smaller gains in compensation. The total fine for the three defendants was increased from 32 million Kronor to 46 million Kronor (US$6.5 million).&lt;ref name="Fiveash2010" /&gt; Each defendant was issued different sentences because of individual contribution toward facilitating illegal file sharing. Instead of issuing all defendants the same sentence, they were each judged on their contribution and sentenced accordingly.&lt;ref name="Ernesto2010" /&gt; However, the fine is to be paid by the three defendants present at the sentencing.&lt;ref name="Fiveash2010" /&gt; The verdict was appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Hässler |title=Fredrik Neij överklagar till Högsta Domstolen |url=http://www.realtid.se/fredrik-neij-overklagar-till-hogsta-domstolen |date=22 December 2010 |publisher=Realtid |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events during the trial==

===Support campaign===
On 18 February 2009 the [[Norway|Norwegian]] socialist party [[Red (Norway)|Red]] began a global campaign in support of [[The Pirate Bay]] and filesharers worldwide that lasted until 1 May. The campaign was timed to coincide with the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author= Kalstad, Lise Marit | title= Rødt med egen piratkampanje | url= http://www.vl.no/kultur/article4135697.ece | work= [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]] | date= 18 February 2009 | language= Norwegian | accessdate= 18 February 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219165005/http://www.vl.no/kultur/article4135697.ece | archivedate= 19 February 2009 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the website filesharer.org individuals were encouraged to upload their photographs, as "[[mugshots]]", to "let the music and movie industry know who the file-sharers are." The site encourages participation urging people to "Upload a picture of yourself and show them what a criminal looks like!". Red politician Elin Volder Rutle is the initiator of the campaign and she states to the media that "If the guys behind Pirate Bay are criminals, then so am I, and so are most other Norwegians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Alle disse er kriminelle | url=http://www.nettavisen.no/it/article2546717.ece | work= [[Nettavisen]] | date= 18 February 2009 | language=Norwegian | accessdate= 18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IFPI website hack===
The website of the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) was hacked and defaced with a message to Håkan Roswall, the prosecutor in the trial. The website subsequently became inaccessible, possibly owing to a [[denial-of-service attack]]. It was shortly brought back online. [[Peter Sunde]], one of the defendants, responded to news of the attack with the comment "Our case is going quite well as most of you have noticed. In the light of that it feels very bad that people are hacking web sites which actually puts us in a worse light than we need to be in." To the perpetrators of the attack he also pleaded, "If anyone involved in the acts going on is reading this—please stop, for our sake. We don’t need that kind of support."&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

===Flower storm===
During the ninth day of the trial, after the testimony of [[professor emeritus]] [[Roger Wallis]] had been completed, he was asked according to Swedish court procedures if he wanted any compensation for appearing in court. He declined this but commented to the court that they were welcome to send flowers to his wife if they wished. This was rejected by the judge but quickly caught on amongst supporters of The Pirate Bay following the proceedings via live feeds and other Internet services. A channel was started on the EFnet network on [[IRC]] and a website followed and by the evening flowers for almost [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 40.000 (US$5,000, €3,000) had been ordered for the couple through Internet florists such as [[Interflora]] and local florists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Oscar |last=Julander |date=26 February 2009 |title=Professorn vittnade - då strömmade blommorna in |url=http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.1480620/professorn-vittnade-da-strommade-blommorna-in |publisher=[[Expressen]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonnier Amigo website hack===
The website of independent record company [[Bonnier Amigo Music Group|Bonnier Amigo]] was hacked on March 1. A similar message to the one on the hacked [[IFPI]] website was published, but this time directed to prosecuting attorney Peter Danowsky representing the record labels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.215184/annu-en-webbplats-hackad-i-protest-mot-skivindustrin |title=Ännu en webbplats hackad i protest mot skivindustrin |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |language=Swedish | date=2 March 2009 | accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/03/01/music-industry-website-hacked-again/ |title=Another Music Industry Website Hacked |publisher=The Blog Pirate |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=3 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303120058/http://www.blogpirate.org/2009/03/01/music-industry-website-hacked-again/ |archivedate=3 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Stop lying Peter Danowsky!

You censor us, we censor you. Freedom of speech goes both ways.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a war you can never win. The people always win one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;
The people will always have their freedom.&lt;br /&gt;
Brothers stand behind us and together we will win this fight!

The [[United Nations General Assembly]], in December 2003, proclaimed the years 2005-2015 as the '''International Decade for Action ‘Water for Life’'''. Its primary goal is to promote efforts to fulfill international commitments made on water and water related issues . in the ''[[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs)'' by 2015.

Waterforlife 
.

In order to help to achieve the internationally agreed water-related goals contained in the''' United Nations Millennium Declaration''', and in '''[[Agenda 21]]''' and the '''Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit of Sustainable Development (WSSD)''' the Decade focuses on water-related issues at all levels and on the implementation of programmes and projects, and the furtherance of cooperation at all levels.

During the [[International Drinking Water Decade, 1981-1990|first UN Decade on Water]] from 1981–1990, it is estimated that more than a billion people gained access to safe [[drinking water]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaian-chronicle.com/thestory.asp?id=8110 |title=60 years of United Nations existence; What next? |first=Lovelace |last=Opoku–Agyemang |date=October 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225113100/http://www.ghanaian-chronicle.com/thestory.asp?id=8110 |archivedate=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of the 'Water for Life' Decade is to promote efforts to fulfill international commitments made on water and water-related issues by 2015.

These commitments include the [[Millennium Development Goals]] to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe [[drinking water]] by 2015 and to stop unsustainable exploitation of water resources. At the [[WSSD|World Summit]] in Johannesburg in 2002, two other goals were adopted: to aim to develop [[IWRM|integrated water resource management]] and [[water efficiency]] plans by 2005 and to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation.

[[World Water Day]], 22 March 2005, marked the official commencement of the ‘[[Water for Life]]’ Decade.

==Themes==


Central water related themes include: food, health, environment, disaster prevention, energy, [[Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes|transboundary water issues]], scarcity, culture, sanitation, pollution and agriculture. As women play a central role in water provision and management, a special emphasis will be placed on ensuring the [[Water supply and women in developing countries|participation and involvement of women]] in these development efforts.

==Activities==


An up-to-date Calendar of Events has the latest on the activities planned throughout the Decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/water_events/Date&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national level, it is expected that each country will take its own approach to organize activities around the ‘Water for Life’ Decade. All activities that promote public awareness of issues related to the ‘Water for Life’ theme are encouraged, including the organization of conferences, seminars, expositions and other such public events.

==Organizers==


[[UN-Water]] is coordinating the International Decade for Action ‘Water for Life’, 2005-2015. UN-Water is the United Nations system-wide inter-agency gathering of all relevant agencies, departments and programmes involved with water-related issues.UN-Water is the inter-agency mechanism for the implementation of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation water-related provisions and the Millennium Development Goals concerning freshwater. The terms of reference and modalities of work of UN-Water cover the elements of a detailed inter-agency plan for addressing water as well as sanitation issues, and include mechanisms for interacting with non-United Nations system stakeholders.

The chairmanship of UN-Water rotates and is currently held by the [[United Nations University]] (UNU), while the Secretariat for UN-Water is based at the United Nations [[Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UNDESA). Within UNDESA, the Water, Natural Resources and Small Island Developing States Branch in the Division for Sustainable Development will be responsible for the ‘Water for Life’ Decade.

'''Åsa M. Waldau''' {{IPA-sv|ˈoːsa maˈriːa ˈvaldau|}}  is the leader of a [[Christian sect]] in [[Knutby]], [[Sweden]]. She was born October 26, 1965.  She is one of originally four sisters, the youngest of whom was the victim of the [[Knutby murder]] on January 10, 2004.

==Biography==
In 1985 Åsa Waldau had one month's theological training in a Pentecostal bible school in [[Stockholm]]. In 1990 Waldau (then Björk) was hired by the Pentecostal church in [[Uppsala]] as a children's pastor. However, because of her actions and because she divorced, she was forced to resign. She then moved to Knutby, where she  lived with the Waldau family, whose young son Patrik (born 1975) she had befriended in Uppsala. They married in June 1994.

Waldau was hired part-time by the Pentecostal congregation of Knutby in March 1992. Kim Wincent, whom she had met in bible school in 1985, was a pastor there. Waldau's position rapidly increased in power. There were claims of prophecies about a "disrespected servant of the Lord" who would be the cause of a "fire from Knutby." She traveled widely in Swedish Pentecostal communities, and induced many young people to move to Knutby. In 1997 she convinced [[Helge Fossmo]] and his wife Heléne to join the Knutby community as a pastor.

==Teachings==
The Philadelphia congregation in Knutby was established in 1921 during the Pentecostal revival in Sweden connected with [[Lewi Pethrus]]. Åsa Waldau was the granddaughter of Pethrus' successor Willis Säwe, but her mother did not raise her in the faith. She was [[Born again Christianity|born again]], and entered the Pentecostal tradition, but she also underwent influences from [[Ulf Ekman]] and his [[Livets Ord]] movement and from [[Word of Faith]].

In Waldau's preaching there is an emphasis on [[sanctification]] and on forgiveness of sins which is a base of Christian belief. She believes that believers can stop sinning in this life on earth. The cult of approximately 100 members has a very hierarchical internal organization. Reminiscent of a [[cell church]], the members are organized in teams, with a team leader they are supposed to ask for spiritual guidance. At the top of the hierarchy are six [[pastor]]s, but not all of them are employed full-time.

Waldau's [[Christian views of women|views of the role of women]] may seem contradictory. Within a marriage it is the husband who should lead his wife and take decisions. The wife is to obey her husband, and should ask her husband's permission, even for mundane things like shopping trips.

Waldau's distinguishing doctrine is that she rejects the identification of the [[Bride of Christ (theology)|biblical metaphor of the Bride of Christ]] with the Church. She teaches publicly that the Bride of Christ is an actual person, whom Christ will wed, while the guests at this wedding are identified as the believers. In private, she claims that she is the Bride of Christ herself, defectors have told.

The [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] is [[pretribulationist]]. Waldau expected that she would be taken away before the [[Rapture]], in a manner reminiscent of the [[dormition of the Virgin]] or the [[assumption of Mary]], to be united with her Bridegroom.

==Connection with the Knutby murder==
{{main|Knutby murder}}
In 2004 [[Helge Fossmo]]'s nanny Sara Svensson confessed to having killed Fossmo's second wife Alexandra (Åsa Waldau's sister), under the influence of Fossmo. Fossmo had claimed to get [[Text messaging|text messages]] from God on his cellphone, which told him Svensson would not get mercy from God if she did not kill Alexandra and their neighbour [[Daniel Linde]]. (Fossmo was having an affair with this neighbour's wife, Annette Linde, who was also Åsa Waldau's sister-in-law. At the same time Fossmo had an affair with Sara Svensson herself that he exploited to manipulate her into the deed.)

In 2004 Fossmo was arrested, prosecuted and sentenced to life in jail for conspiracy of murder and Svensson was sentenced to psychiatric care. Although Waldau was a close associate of Fossmo, there was no evidence that she had been involved in the murder plot and she was not prosecuted.

==Celebrity==
After the murders, Waldau continued to be very reclusive. She refused to be interviewed by newspapers and only appeared without speaking in the [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] documentary ''A Fall from Grace''. Her first appearance was at the trial in May 2004, speaking in court as a relative of her sister who had been murdered. She admitted that she had 'tested' whether she might be the Bride of Christ, an idea she attributed to Helge Fossmo.

In September 2004 Waldau was in a one-hour interview program on [[Sveriges Television]] by [[Stina Lundberg Dabrowski]]. The public's reaction was quite negative; Waldau came across as 'cold' and 'unfeeling'.

In March 2005 Waldau inspired the sect to open a spa. In November she released a music CD containing songs from the church of Knutby. In December she appeared on a discussion panel at the celebration of 175 year [[Aftonbladet]], introduced there by [[Jan Guillou]] as Sweden's most maligned person in modern times.

In June 2006 the talk-show host Lennart Persson invited Waldau to his last installment of ''Debatt'' on national television, where she got into exchanges with [[Janne Josefsson]] and with [[Bert Karlsson]]. Bert Karlsson later that year invited her to his own program on the cable channel [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]]. In October 2007 he published Waldau's autobiography, ''Kristi brud: vem kan man lita på?'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Bride of Christ: whom can one trust?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Bert | last = Karlsson | date= October 2007 | title = Kristi brud: vem kan man lita på?
