'''Alexander Mikhaylovich Butlerov''' (Алекса́ндр Миха́йлович Бу́тлеров; 15 September 1828 &amp;ndash; 17 August 1886) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[chemist]], one of the principal creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]] (1857&amp;ndash;1861), the first to incorporate [[double bond]]s into structural formulas, the discoverer of [[hexamine]] (1859), the discoverer of [[formaldehyde]] (1859) and the discoverer of the [[formose reaction]] (1861).

He first proposed the idea of possible tetrahedral arrangement of valence bonds in carbon compounds in 1862.

The crater [[Butlerov (crater)|Butlerov]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

Alexander Butlerov was born in [[Chistopol]] into a landowning family.

'''Beachrock''' is a [[friable]] to well-cemented [[sedimentary rock]] that consists of a variable mixture of  [[gravel]]-, [[sand]]-, and [[silt]]-sized [[sediment]] that is [[Cementation (geology)|cemented]] with [[Calcium carbonate|carbonate]] minerals and has formed along a shoreline. Depending on location, the sediment that is cemented to form beachrock can consist of a variable mixture of [[Seashell|shells]], coral fragments, rock fragments of different types, and other materials. It can contain scattered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], pieces of wood, and coconuts. Beachrock typically forms within the intertidal zone within tropical or semitropical regions. However, [[Quaternary]] beachrock is also found as far north and south as 60° latitude.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, J.A., eds.

== Overview ==
Beachrock units form under a thin cover of [[sediment]] and generally overlie unconsolidated sand. They typically consist of multiple units, representing multiple episodes of cementation and exposure. The mineralogy of beachrocks is mainly high-magnesium [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]]. The main processes involved in the cementation are : supersaturation with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through direct evaporation of seawater,&lt;ref&gt;Scoffin, T.P. &amp; Stoddart, D.R. 1983. Beachrock and intertidal sediments, Chemical Sediments and Geomorphology. Academic Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; groundwater CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degassing in the [[vadose zone]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanor, J.S. 1978.

Formation of beachrock at Eniwetok Atoll.&lt;/ref&gt; and precipitation of [[Micrite|micritic]] calcium carbonate as a byproduct of microbiological activity.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeier, U. 1998. The role of microbial activity in early cementation of beachrocks (intertidal sediments). PhD Thesis, University of Geneva. Terre et Environment (12).&lt;/ref&gt;

On retreating coasts, outcrops of beachrock may be evident offshore where they may act as a barrier against coastal erosion. Beachrock presence can also induce sediment deficiency in a beach and out-synch its wave regime. Because beachrock is lithified within the intertidal zone and because it commonly forms in a few years, its potential as an indicator of past sea level is important.

==Cementation and position of beachrock==
Beachrocks are located along the coastline in a parallel term and they are usually a few meters offshore. They are generally separated in several levels which may correspond to different generations of beachrock cementation. Thus, the older zones are located in the outer part of the formation when the younger ones are on the side of the beach, possibly under the unconsolidated sand. They also seem to have a general inclination to the sea (50 – 150). There are several appearances of beachrock formations which are characterized by multiple cracks and gaps. The result from this fact is an interruptible formation of separated blocks of beachrock, which may be of the same formation.

The length of beachrocks varies from meters to kilometers, its width can reach up to 300&amp;nbsp;meters and its height starts from 30&amp;nbsp;cm and reaches 3&amp;nbsp;meters.

Following the process of coastal erosion, beachrock formation may be uncovered. Coastal erosion may be the result of [[sea level rise]] or deficit in sedimentary equilibrium. One way or another, unconsolidated sand that covers the beachrock draws away and the formation is revealed. If the process of cementation continues, new beachrock would be formed in a new position in the intertidal zone. Successive phases of sea level change may result in sequential zones of beachrock.

'''Bennett Harrison''' (June 27, 1942 [[Jersey City]] – January 17, 1999, [[Brooklyn Heights]]) was a leading radical political economist, writer, musician, songwriter.   Among his academic appointments was professor of political economy at MIT, Boston.  Harrison held posts at Harvard University, New School for Social Research, and Carnegie Mellon University.  Harrison taught in universities in Italy and Japan.

Bennett published a book in 1994, ''Lean and Mean'', challenging a widely held belief that [[Small to medium enterprise|small and medium]] firms or businesses are responsible for the majority of economic innovation, growth and [[job creation]]. 

Economist [[Barry Bluestone]] joined him in writing this and other books in the 1980s and 1990s. The writers frequently wrote on deindustrialization, urban economic planning, racism, inequality and radical economic policies.

His father was Leo Harrison,while his sister is Deborah Harrison Kuperman. His great nephew is the world renowned Jacob Kuperman.

This can be used to demonstrate [[anatomy]], explain biological functions or interactions, direct surgical procedures, distinguish species, and other applications. The scope of biological illustration can range from the whole organism level to microscopic.

==History==
[[Image:Vesalius Fabrica p206.jpg|thumb|Image from [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s [[De humani corporis fabrica]] (1543), page 206]]Historically, biological [[illustration]]s have been in use since the beginning of man's exploration and attempts to understand the world around him. The [[paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]] were so detailed that we can even recognize species and breeds of many of the depicted animals today.&lt;ref name="AHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/prehistoricart/| last=Moffat|first=Charles| title=Prehistoric &amp; Ancient Art|year=2007|website=Arthistoryarchive.com|publisher=Lilith Gallery Network|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave]] (circa 30,000 BC), at least 13 different species have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/art-history/prehistoric-art/the-paleolithic-period/cave-paintings/|title=Cave Paintings|publisher=Boundless|website=Boundless.com|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one prehistoric cave (circa 15,000 BC), there is a drawing of a mammoth with a darkened area where the heart should be. If this is indeed the intention of the illustration, it would be the world's first anatomical illustration.&lt;ref name="Hajar2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajar|first1=Rachel|title=Medical illustration: Art in medical education|journal=Heart Views|volume=12|issue=2|year=2011|pages=83|issn=1995-705X|doi=10.4103/1995-705X.86023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Alexandrian era]] (356 – 323 BC), the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[physician]] [[Herophilus]], now known as the father of anatomy, performed public [[dissection]]s and recorded his findings.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263634/Herophilus |title=Herophilus|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2014|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] compiled the ''De Materia Medica'', a collection of medicinal information and recipes, containing illustrations of about 600 plants in all.

During the [[Renaissance]], artist and scientist [[Leonardo DaVinci]] [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Human anatomy|famously sketched]] his observations from human dissections, as well as his studies of [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Botany|plants]] and the [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|flight of birds]]. In the mid-16th century, the physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] compiled and published the ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', a collection of textbooks on human anatomy superior to any illustrations that had been produced until that point. In the early 1600s, the explorer [[Étienne de Flacourt]] documented his travels to [[Madagascar]], and illustrated the unique fauna there, setting a precedent for future explorers as world travel became a more feasible reality.

[[Image:Haeckel Actiniae.jpg|thumb|49th plate from Ernst Haeckel's [[Kunstformen der Natur]] of 1904, showing various sea anemones classified as [[Actiniae]].]]During his five-year voyage aboard {{HMS|Beagle}}, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote and illustrated ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', which was published in 1839. In the beginning of the 20th century, one of the most prolific biological illustrator, [[Ernst Haeckel]], discovered, described, and named thousands of new species, and his published work, ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'', contained hundreds of prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.

==Education and employment==
Biological illustrations can be found in use in [[History textbooks|history]] and [[anatomy]] textbooks, nature guides, [[natural history museums]], [[Science journalism|scientific magazines]] and [[scientific journal|journals]], [[botanical gardens]], [[zoos]] and [[aquariums]], surgical training manuals, and many more applications. Biological illustration can be pursued as a degree in the undergraduate, graduate, and technical college levels. Preparation for a biological illustration career can include a background of art or science, or a combination of both. Skills development in biological illustration can involve two-dimensional art, [[animation]], [[graphic design]], and [[sculpture]] (such as necessary in custom [[prosthetics]]).

It is possible to work in biological illustration without a specific degree, but a degree will significantly enhance an illustrator's employment opportunities. Job applications can be submitted to scientific researchers, publishers of scientific manuscripts, research institutions, museums, scientific foundations, commercial book publishers or university presses, individual authors, hospitals and medical training centers, local and state government offices, park services, environmental control offices, special government committees, printers and commercial publishing houses. Employment opportunities in the biological illustration profession are fairly limited, full-time jobs are not often available, and many experienced illustrators are [[self-employed]], on short-term contracts, or work in [[science communication]] careers with few illustration duties. Many illustrators prefer the flexibility of their own working arrangements, but this is only possible when they are well established in the field and capable of locating work when needed. Many [[freelance]] illustrators supplement their salary with [[commercial art|commercial illustration]] and graphic design projects, as is common in many art careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnsi.org/science-illustration/careers-ed|title= Careers and Education in Science Illustration | publisher=Guild of Natural Science Illustrators|website=GNSI.org|year=2010|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Biological illustration has traditionally employed the techniques of using [[carbon dust]], [[color pencil]], [[stipple]] pen and ink, [[lithography]], [[watercolor]] and [[gouache]], however [[digital illustration]] has recently become more important in the field. Every professional scientific illustration begins with multiple rough sketches. Many details must be discussed between the artist and scientist before a final drawing can be completed, and additional preliminary drawings must be prepared in order to work out aesthetic details.

Pen and ink (often a [[flex nibs|flex nib]] fountain pen) line illustrations are clean, crisp, clear, and inexpensive to produce, making them ideal for biological illustrations. Ink drawings are typically made on a heavy drawing paper, such as [[Bristol board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleobiology.si.edu/paleoart/prentice/pages/pen_and_ink.html|title= Drawing |website=Department of Paleobiology|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital illustration can be done using a monitor or [[drawing tablet]], computer software such as [[Adobe Illustrator]] or [[Photoshop]], or it can be used in [[post-production]] after the illustration has been drawn by hand.

In social sciences research on commercial R&amp;D laboratories, '''boundary spanning''' is a term to describe individuals within an [[innovation system]] who have, or adopt, the [[role]] of linking the organization's internal networks with external sources of information.&lt;ref name=tushman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael L|author-link=Michael L. Tushman|title=Special Boundary Roles in the Innovation Process|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|year=1977|volume=22|issue=4|pages=587–605|ISSN=0001-8392|doi=10.2307/2392402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term was coined by Tushman,&lt;ref name="tushman"/&gt; the concept was being developed by social scientists from the late 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organisations|year=1958|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|author=March, J|author2=Simon, H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=J D|title=Organizations in Action|year=1967|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=T J|author2=Cohen, S|title=Information flow in R&amp;D Labs|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|year=1969|volume=14|pages=12–19|doi=10.2307/2391357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early work was conducted in large American corporations with well established [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] laboratories. The term has since been used in relation to less well defined innovation networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergenholtz|first=C|title=Knowledge brokering: spanning technological and network boundaries|journal=European Journal of Innovation Management|year=2011|volume=14|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The post-WWII years saw the burgeoning of the American corporation and in particular major R&amp;D labs, for example, [[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman]] examined the "''communication activity of all the professionals (N=345) in the R&amp;D facility of large mid-Western U.S Corporation. The laboratory is isolated from the rest of the corporation and is divided into seven departments (divisional laboratories). The departments are, in turn, organized into separate project areas. The projects were stable over the course of the research and each respondent was a member of only one project''."&lt;ref name="tushman"/&gt;
With this increase in spending on R&amp;D, there was increased interest in the effectiveness of that spending and how to improve the efficiency of commercial research. Of course, all the academic research presented anonymous data from the firms with which they had been working so it is hard to know who the participating laboratories were.

==Academic adoption==
The concept of a boundary spanning role has been popular throughout academic research into innovation systems with over 48,000 peer-reviewed articles referencing the term since 1958. With the exception of [[Open and Closed Systems in Social Science|closed systems]], all systems have a transference across their boundaries and this process is facilitated by the boundary spanner. As models of innovation developed, the role of the boundary spanner remained key in seeking out and bringing new ideas into the system or sub-system. Research has also found that boundary spanners tend to be [[opinion leadership | opinion leaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matous|first=P.|author2=Wang, P.|title=External exposure, boundary-spanning, and opinion leadership in remote communities: A network experiment |journal=Social Networks|year=2019|volume=56|pages=10-22|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the role of the boundary spanner, is defined largely by where the boundary is drawn.

=== Internal boundary spanners ===
One challenge within the field of [[knowledge management]], is that the collection &amp; codification of explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge is frequently held in silos within the organisation. Boundary spanners are needed to move that knowledge around the organisation in a process sometimes referred to as socialisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nonaka|first=Ikujiro|title=The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509269-1|author2=Takeuchi, Hirotaka|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External boundary spanners===
Where the boundary of the innovation system of interest coincides with the boundary of the organisation, then the role takes on an extra dimension. Boundary spanning is a key element in the Acquisition capacity of a firm in Cohen's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=W|author2=Levinthal, D|title=Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|year=1990|volume=35|issue=1|pages=128–152.|issn=0001-8392|doi=10.2307/2393553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zahra|first=S|author2=George, G|title=Absorptive Capacity: A Review,Reconceptualization,and Extension|journal=Academy of Management Review|year=2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=185–203|issn=0363-7425|doi=10.5465/amr.2002.6587995}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory of [[absorptive capacity]].

===Individual boundary spanners===
At the individual level, this may be equated to the Resource Investigator role within [[Belbin Team Inventory|Belbin's Team Inventory]].

==Broader adoption==
The term '''boundary spanning''' is now widely used to describe any situation where an individual crosses the boundaries of a social group.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">In particle physics, the '''Breit frame''' (also known as '''infinite-momentum frame''' or '''IMF''') is a [[frame of reference]] used to describe [[scattering]] experiments of the form &lt;math&gt;A + B \rightarrow A + \sum C_i&lt;/math&gt;, that is experiments in which particle A scatters off particle B, possibly producing particles &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=David |authorlink=David J. Griffiths |year=1987 |title=Introduction to elementary particles |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-60386-3 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frame is defined so that the particle A has its momentum reversed in the scattering process.

Another way of understanding the Breit frame is to look at the elastic scattering &lt;math&gt;A+\gamma \rightarrow A'&lt;/math&gt;. The Breit frame is defined as the frame in which &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}_A+\vec{p}_{A'}=0&lt;/math&gt;. There are different occasions when Breit frame can be useful, e.g., in measuring the electromagnetic form factor of a hadron, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the scattered hadron; while for deep inelastic scattering process, the elastically scattered parton should be considered as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. It's only in the latter case the Breit frame gets related to infinite-momentum frame.

It is named after the American physicist [[Gregory Breit]].&lt;ref name="Breit 2001 p.

'''Defuzzification''' is the process of producing a quantifiable result in [[Crisp logic]], given fuzzy sets and corresponding membership degrees. It is the process that maps a fuzzy set to a crisp set. It is typically needed in [[fuzzy control]] systems. These will have a number of rules that transform a number of variables into a fuzzy result, that is, the result is described in terms of membership in [[fuzzy sets]]. For example, rules designed to decide how much pressure to apply might result in "Decrease Pressure (15%), Maintain Pressure (34%), Increase Pressure (72%)". Defuzzification is interpreting the membership degrees of the fuzzy sets into a specific decision or real value.
[[File:Fuzzy logic.png|thumb|Defuzzification]]

The simplest but least useful defuzzification method is to choose the set with the highest membership, in this case, "Increase Pressure" since it has a 72% membership, and ignore the others, and convert this 72% to some number. The problem with this approach is that it loses information. The rules that called for decreasing or maintaining pressure might as well have not been there in this case.

A common and useful defuzzification technique is ''center of gravity''. First, the results of the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a [[triangle]]. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a [[trapezoid]]. The first step of defuzzification typically "chops off" parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has "Decrease Pressure (15%)", then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single [[geometric shape]]. Then, the [[centroid]] of this shape, called the ''fuzzy centroid'', is calculated. The ''x'' coordinate of the centroid is the defuzzified value.

==Methods==
There are many different methods of defuzzification available, including the following:&lt;ref name=Leekwijck&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=van Leekwijck, W. |author2=Kerre, E.

A mental health drop-in center can provide a friendly environment for people who are struggling with mental health symptoms to recover. Also in another case, a drop-in center as opposed to a [[homeless shelter]] usually does not provide a temporary residence; rather, it aims to provide other services to endangered or disadvantaged groups in the community, including the homeless, people with [[addiction]]s, or teenagers. Drop-in centers are usually open during the daytime. Some regular drop-in centers double as [[warming center]]s or [[cooling center]]s in the winter or summer, and may provide overnight shelter during these months.

Many drop-in centers provide free services, and some offer services for a nominal fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sf311.org/homeless-resources-drop-centers|title=Homeless - Resources - Drop-in Centers|publisher=SF311|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 43''', also called as '''IMP-I''' and '''IMP 6''', was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[satellite]] launched as part of [[Explorers program]]. Explorer 43 as launched on March 13, 1971 on [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], with an [[Delta rocket]]. Explorer 43 was the sixth satellite of the [[Interplanetary Monitoring Platform]].&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

==Spacecraft and mission==
Explorer 43 continued the study, begun by earlier '''IMPs''', of the [[interplanetary space|interplanetary]] and outer [[magnetospheric]] regions by measuring energetic particles, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. 

A [[radioastronomy]] experiment was also included in the spacecraft payload. The 16-sided spacecraft was {{convert|182.12|cm}} high by {{convert|135.64|cm}} in diameter. The spacecraft spin axis was normal to the [[ecliptic plane]], and its spin rate was 5 [[rpm]], with propulsion '''Star-17A'''. The initial apogee point lay near the earth-sun line. The solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft carried 2 transmitters. One continuously transmitted PCM encoder data at a 1,600 [[Bits per second|bps]] information bit rate. 

The second transmitter was used for transmission of [[VLF]] data and for ranging information. Three orthogonal pairs of [[dipole]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s were used for the [[electric field]]s experiments, and one of these pairs was also used for the radioastronomy experiment. The members of the antenna pair along the spacecraft spin axis extended {{convert|2.9|m|abbr=on}}, the members of the pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy experiments extended {{convert|45.5|m|abbr=on}}, and the members of the third pair were slightly unbalanced, extending {{convert|24.4|x|27.6|m|abbr=on}}, respectively. All four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended {{convert|45.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. 

The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere October 2, 1974, after a highly successful mission.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/imp.htm|title=IMP|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|first=Mark|last=Wade|date=2011|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faster-than-light''' (also '''superluminal''' or '''FTL''') [[Superluminal communication|communication]] and [[interstellar travel|travel]] are the conjectural propagation of [[information]] or [[matter]] faster than the [[speed of light]].

The [[special theory of relativity]] implies that only particles with zero [[Mass in special relativity|rest mass]] may travel at the speed of light. [[Tachyon]]s, particles whose speed exceeds that of light, have been hypothesized, but their existence would violate [[Causality (physics)|causality]], and the consensus of physicists is that they cannot exist. On the other hand, what some physicists refer to as "apparent" or "effective" FTL&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; depends on the hypothesis that unusually distorted regions of [[spacetime]] might permit matter to reach distant locations in less time than light could in normal or undistorted spacetime.

According to the current scientific theories, matter is required to travel at '''slower-than-light''' (also '''subluminal''' or '''STL''') speed with respect to the locally distorted spacetime region. ''Apparent'' FTL is not excluded by [[general relativity]]; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the [[Alcubierre drive]] and the [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

== FTL travel of non-information ==
In the context of this article, FTL is the transmission of information or matter faster than ''c'', a constant equal to the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, which is 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s (by definition of the meter) or about 186,282.397 miles per second. This is not quite the same as traveling faster than light, since:
* Some processes propagate faster than ''c'', but cannot carry information (see examples in the sections immediately following).
* Light travels at speed ''c/n'' when not in a vacuum but [[time-of-flight|traveling]] through a medium with [[refractive index]] = ''n'' (causing [[refraction]]), and in some materials other particles can travel faster than ''c/n'' (but still slower than ''c''), leading to [[Cherenkov radiation]] (see phase velocity below).
Neither of these phenomena violates [[special relativity]] or creates problems with [[causality]], and thus neither qualifies as ''FTL'' as described here.

In the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.

=== Daily sky motion ===
For an earth-bound observer, objects in the sky complete one revolution around the Earth in one day. [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star outside the [[solar system]], is about four [[light-year]]s away.&lt;ref name="A2 Student Book"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this frame of reference, in which Proxima Centauri is perceived to be moving in a circular trajectory with a radius of four light years, it could be described as having a speed many times greater than ''c'' as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle is a product of the radius and angular speed.&lt;ref name="A2 Student Book" /&gt; It is also possible on a [[Geostatic orbit|geostatic]] view, for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies. Comets may have orbits which take them out to more than 1000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1000 AU is greater than one light day. In other words, a comet at such a distance is superluminal in a geostatic, and therefore non-inertial, frame.

=== Light spots and shadows ===
If a laser beam is swept across a distant object, the spot of laser light can easily be made to move across the object at a speed greater than ''c''.&lt;ref name="Gibbs" /&gt; Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move across the object faster than ''c''.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy can be made to pointing a water hose in one direction and then quickly moving the hose to point the stream of water in another direction. At no point does the water leaving the hose ever increase in velocity, but the endpoint of the stream can be moved faster than the water in the stream itself.

=== Apparent FTL propagation of static field effects ===
{{main|Static field}}

Since there is no "retardation" (or [[aberration of light|aberration]]) of the apparent position of the source of a [[gravitation]]al or [[electric]] [[static field]] when the source moves with constant velocity, the static field "effect" may seem at first glance to be "transmitted" faster than the speed of light. However, uniform motion of the static source may be removed with a change in reference frame, causing the direction of the static field to change immediately, at all distances. This is not a change of position which "propagates", and thus this change cannot be used to transmit information from the source. No information or matter can be FTL-transmitted or propagated from source to receiver/observer by an electromagnetic field.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Closing speeds ===
The rate at which two objects in motion in a single frame of reference get closer together is called the mutual or closing speed. This may approach twice the speed of light, as in the case of two particles travelling at close to the speed of light in opposite directions with respect to the reference frame.

Imagine two fast-moving particles approaching each other from opposite sides of a [[particle accelerator]] of the collider type. The closing speed would be the rate at which the distance between the two particles is decreasing. From the point of view of an observer standing at rest relative to the accelerator, this rate will be slightly less than twice the speed of light.

[[Special relativity]] does not prohibit this. It tells us that it is wrong to use [[Galilean relativity]] to compute the velocity of one of the particles, as would be measured by an observer traveling alongside the other particle. That is, special relativity gives the [[velocity-addition formula|right formula]] for computing such [[relative velocity]].

It is instructive to compute the relative velocity of particles moving at ''v'' and −''v'' in accelerator frame, which corresponds to the closing speed of 2''v''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''.  Expressing the speeds in units of ''c'', β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''v''/''c'':
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_\text{rel} = \frac{\beta + \beta}{1 + \beta ^2} = \frac{2\beta}{1 + \beta^2} \leq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proper speeds ===
If a spaceship travels to a planet one light-year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a [[proper velocity]]. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth at the same time as the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.

=== Possible distance away from Earth ===
{{main|Space travel using constant acceleration}}
Since one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then never be able to reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of [[time dilation]], the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1&amp;nbsp;g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the [[speed of light]] (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the [[Solar System]], but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed ''c'', their [[proper velocity|proper speed]] (distance as seen by Earth divided by their [[proper time]]) can be much greater than ''c''. This is seen in statistical studies of [[muon]]s traveling much further than ''c'' times their [[half-life]] (at rest), if traveling close to ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase velocities above ''c'' ===
The [[phase velocity]] of an [[electromagnetic wave]], when traveling through a medium, can routinely exceed ''c'', the vacuum velocity of light. For example, this occurs in most glasses at [[X-ray]] frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 |isbn=0-201-11609-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phase velocity of a wave corresponds to the propagation speed of a theoretical single-frequency (purely [[monochromatic]]) component of the wave at that frequency. Such a wave component must be infinite in extent and of constant amplitude (otherwise it is not truly monochromatic), and so cannot convey any information.&lt;ref&gt;

Thus a phase velocity above ''c'' does not imply the propagation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]] with a velocity above ''c''.&lt;ref name="phase"&gt;

=== Group velocities above ''c'' ===
The [[group velocity]] of a wave (e.g., a light beam) may also exceed ''c'' in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, which typically at the same time involve rapid attenuation of the intensity, the maximum of the envelope of a pulse may travel with a velocity above ''c''. However, even this situation does not imply the propagation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]] with a velocity above ''c'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though one may be tempted to associate pulse maxima with signals. The latter association has been shown to be misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information on the pulse does not come faster than ''c'' without this effect.&lt;ref&gt;

The expansion of the [[universe]] causes distant galaxies to recede from us faster than the speed of light, if [[comoving distance|proper distance]] and [[cosmological time]] are used to calculate the speeds of these galaxies. However, in [[general relativity]], velocity is a local notion, so velocity calculated using comoving coordinates does not have any simple relation to velocity calculated locally.&lt;ref&gt;

Rules that apply to relative velocities in special relativity, such as the rule that relative velocities cannot increase past the speed of light, do not apply to relative velocities in comoving coordinates, which are often described in terms of the "expansion of space" between galaxies. This expansion rate is thought to have been at its peak during the [[inflationary epoch]] thought to have occurred in a tiny fraction of the second after the [[Big Bang]] (models suggest the period would have been from around 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang to around 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), when the universe may have rapidly expanded by a factor of around 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

There are many galaxies visible in telescopes with [[red shift]] numbers of 1.4 or higher. All of these are currently traveling away from us at speeds greater than the speed of light. Because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can actually be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually.&lt;ref&gt;See the last two paragraphs in {{cite web

According to Tamara M. Davis, "Our effective particle horizon is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), at redshift z ∼ 1100, because we cannot see beyond the surface of last scattering. Although the last scattering surface is not at any fixed comoving coordinate, the current recession velocity of the points from which the CMB was emitted is 3.2c. At the time of emission their speed was 58.1c, assuming (ΩM,ΩΛ) = (0.3,0.7). Thus we routinely observe objects that are receding faster than the speed of light and the Hubble sphere is not a horizon."&lt;ref&gt;

However, because [[Accelerating universe|the expansion of the universe is accelerating]], it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological [[event horizon]] where any light they emit past that point will never be able to reach us at any time in the infinite future,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the light never reaches a point where its "peculiar velocity" towards us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance]]). The current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event was less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event was more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name="ly93" /&gt;

=== Astronomical observations ===
Apparent [[superluminal motion]] is observed in many [[Active galaxy|radio galaxies]], [[blazar]]s, [[quasar]]s and recently also in [[microquasar]]s. The effect was predicted before it was observed by [[Martin Rees]]{{clarify|Was it predicted by Rees or observed by Rees?|date=March 2012}} and can be explained as an [[optical illusion]] caused by the object partly moving in the direction of the observer,&lt;ref&gt;

Corrected calculations show these objects have velocities close to the speed of light (relative to our reference frame). They are the first examples of large amounts of mass moving at close to the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth-bound laboratories have only been able to accelerate small numbers of elementary particles to such speeds.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
Certain phenomena in [[quantum mechanics]], such as [[quantum entanglement]], might give the superficial impression of allowing communication of information faster than light. According to the [[no-communication theorem]] these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. [[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an [[epiphenomenon]] of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment. Since the underlying behavior does not violate local causality or allow FTL communication, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.

The [[uncertainty principle]] implies that individual photons may travel for short distances at speeds somewhat faster (or slower) than ''c'', even in a vacuum; this possibility must be taken into account when enumerating [[Feynman diagram]]s for a particle interaction.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In quantum mechanics, [[virtual particle]]s may travel faster than light, and this phenomenon is related to the fact that static field effects (which are mediated by virtual particles in quantum terms) may travel faster than light (see section on static fields above). However, macroscopically these fluctuations average out, so that photons do travel in straight lines over long (i.e., non-quantum) distances, and they do travel at the speed of light on average. Therefore, this does not imply the possibility of superluminal information transmission.

There have been various reports in the popular press of experiments on faster-than-light transmission in optics — most often in the context of a kind of [[quantum tunnelling]] phenomenon. Usually, such reports deal with a [[phase velocity]] or [[group velocity]] faster than the vacuum velocity of light.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, for instance, be the gap between two prisms. When the prisms are in contact, the light passes straight through, but when there is a gap, the light is refracted. There is a non-zero probability that the photon will tunnel across the gap rather than follow the refracted path. For large gaps between the prisms the tunnelling time approaches a constant and thus the photons appear to have crossed with a superluminal speed.&lt;ref name="nimtz1" /&gt;

However, an analysis by Herbert G. Winful from the University of Michigan suggests that the Hartman effect cannot actually be used to violate relativity by transmitting signals faster than ''c'', because the tunnelling time "should not be linked to a velocity since evanescent waves do not propagate".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evanescent waves in the Hartman effect are due to virtual particles and a non-propagating static field, as mentioned in the sections above for gravity and electromagnetism.

==== Casimir effect ====
{{Main|Casimir effect}}

In physics, the [[Casimir effect]] or Casimir-Polder force is a physical force exerted between separate objects due to resonance of [[vacuum energy]] in the intervening space between the objects. This is sometimes described in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, owing to the mathematical form of one possible way of calculating the strength of the effect. Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. Because the effect is due to virtual particles mediating a static field effect, it is subject to the comments about static fields discussed above.

==== EPR paradox ====
{{Main|EPR paradox}}

The EPR paradox refers to a famous [[thought experiment]] of Einstein, Podolski and Rosen that was realized experimentally for the first time by [[Alain Aspect]] in 1981 and 1982 in the [[Aspect experiment]]. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer to whether or not the measurement actually affects the other quantum system comes down to which [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one subscribes to.

An experiment performed in 1997 by Nicolas Gisin at the University of Geneva has demonstrated non-local quantum correlations between particles separated by over 10 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as noted earlier, the non-local correlations seen in entanglement cannot actually be used to transmit classical information faster than light, so that relativistic causality is preserved; see [[no-communication theorem]] for further information. A 2008 quantum physics experiment also performed by Nicolas Gisin and his colleagues in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] has determined that in any hypothetical [[Hidden variable theory#Non-local hidden-variable theory|non-local hidden-variables theory]] the speed of the quantum non-local connection (what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance") is at least 10,000 times the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Delayed choice quantum eraser ====
{{Main|Delayed choice quantum eraser}}

[[Delayed choice quantum eraser]] (an experiment of [[Marlan Scully]]) is a version of the EPR paradox in which the observation (or not) of interference after the passage of a photon through a [[double slit experiment]] depends on the conditions of observation of a second photon entangled with the first. The characteristic of this experiment is that the observation of the second photon can take place at a later time than the observation of the first photon,&lt;ref&gt;

== Superluminal communication ==
{{main|Superluminal communication}}
Faster-than-light communication is, by [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], equivalent to [[time travel]]. According to Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]], what we measure as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum (or near vacuum) is actually the fundamental physical constant ''c''. This means that all [[inertial]] observers, regardless of their relative [[velocity]], will always measure zero-mass particles such as [[photon]]s traveling at ''c'' in a vacuum. This result means that measurements of time and velocity in different frames are no longer related simply by constant shifts, but are instead related by [[Poincaré transformation]]s. These transformations have important implications:
* The relativistic momentum of a [[mass]]ive particle would increase with speed in such a way that at the speed of light an object would have infinite momentum.
* To accelerate an object of non-zero [[Mass in special relativity|rest mass]] to ''c'' would require infinite time with any finite acceleration, or infinite acceleration for a finite amount of time.
* Either way, such acceleration requires infinite energy.
* Some observers with sub-light relative motion will disagree about which occurs first of any two events that are separated by a [[Spacetime interval|space-like interval]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Relative permittivity or permeability less than 1 ===
The [[speed of light]]
:&lt;math&gt; c =\frac {1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}} \ &lt;/math&gt;
is related to the [[vacuum permittivity]] ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[vacuum permeability]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, not only the [[phase velocity]], [[group velocity]] and [[energy flow velocity]]  of electromagnetic waves but also the [[velocity]] of a [[photon]]  can be faster than ''c''   in a special material has the constant [[permittivity]] or [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] whose value is less than that in vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Z.Y.Wang|title=On Faster than Light Photons in Double-Positive Materials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2018|volume=13|doi=10.1007/s11468-018-0749-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casimir vacuum and quantum tunnelling ===
Einstein's equations of [[special relativity]] postulate that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant in [[inertial frames]]. That is, it will be the same from any frame of reference moving at a constant speed. The equations do not specify any particular value for the speed of the light, which is an experimentally determined quantity for a fixed unit of length. Since 1983, the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of length (the [[meter]]) has been defined using the [[speed of light]].

The experimental determination has been made in vacuum. However, the vacuum we know is not the only possible vacuum which can exist. The vacuum has energy associated with it, called simply the [[vacuum energy]], which could perhaps be altered in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the 'zero-point energy' (or 'vacuum energy') in quantum physics? Is it really possible that we could harness this energy? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=follow-up-what-is-the-zer |publisher=Scientific American |date=1997-08-18 |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When vacuum energy is lowered, light itself has been predicted to go faster than the standard value ''c''. This is known as the [[Scharnhorst effect]]. Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a [[Casimir effect#Vacuum energy|Casimir vacuum]]. Calculations imply that light will go faster in such a vacuum by a minuscule amount: a photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scharnhorst, Klaus |title=Secret of the vacuum: Speedier light |date=1990-05-12 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |url= http://www.nat.vu.nl/~scharnh/m16scine.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there has as yet been no experimental verification of the prediction.

However, with multiple pairs of plates in motion relative to one another the authors noted that they had no arguments that could "guarantee the total absence of causality violations", and invoked Hawking's speculative [[chronology protection conjecture]] which suggests that feedback loops of virtual particles would create "uncontrollable singularities in the renormalized quantum stress-energy" on the boundary of any potential time machine, and thus would require a theory of quantum gravity to fully analyze. Other authors argue that Scharnhorst's original analysis, which seemed to show the possibility of faster-than-''c'' signals, involved approximations which may be incorrect, so that it is not clear whether this effect could actually increase signal speed at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fearn, Heidi |doi=10.1134/S1054660X07050155 |journal=LaserPhys. |volume=17 |title=Can Light Signals Travel Faster than ''c'' in Nontrivial Vacuua in Flat space-time?

The physicists [[Günter Nimtz]] and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the [[University of Cologne]], claim to have violated relativity experimentally by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light.&lt;ref name="nimtz1"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0708.0681 |author1=Nimtz, Günter |author2=Stahlhofen, Alfons |title=Macroscopic violation of special relativity |class=quant-ph |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons — relatively low-energy packets of light — travelled "instantaneously" between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to {{convert|3|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart. Their experiment involved an optical phenomenon known as [[Evanescent wave|"evanescent modes"]], and they claim that since evanescent modes have an imaginary wave number, they represent a "mathematical analogy" to [[quantum tunnelling]].&lt;ref name="nimtz1" /&gt; Nimtz has also claimed that "evanescent modes are not fully describable by the [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]] and quantum mechanics have to be taken into consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nimtz |first=G |year=2001 |title=Superluminal Tunneling Devices |arxiv=physics/0204043 |doi=10.1142/9789812704634_0019 |journal=The Physics of Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists such as Herbert G. Winful and Robert Helling have argued that in fact there is nothing quantum-mechanical about Nimtz's experiments, and that the results can be fully predicted by the equations of [[classical electromagnetism]] (Maxwell's equations).&lt;ref name="winful"&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=Comment on "Macroscopic violation of special relativity" by Nimtz and Stahlhofen |eprint=0709.2736 |author=Winful, Herbert G. |date=2007-09-18 |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helling |first=R. |date=20 September 2005|title=Faster than light or not|url=https://atdotde.blogspot.ca/2005/09/faster-than-light-or-not.html|website=atdotde.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimtz told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine: "For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of." However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars from the tail at each station along the way, so that the center of the ever-shrinking main train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.&lt;ref name="nimtz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Light seems to defy its own speed limit |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |volume=195 |issue=2617 |page=10 |date=18–24 August 2007 |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/ns-lst081607.php |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert G. Winful argues that the train analogy is a variant of the "reshaping argument" for superluminal tunneling velocities, but he goes on to say that this argument is not actually supported by experiment or simulations, which actually show that the transmitted pulse has the same length and shape as the incident pulse.&lt;ref name="winful" /&gt; Instead, Winful argues that the [[Group velocity|group delay]] in tunneling is not actually the transit time for the pulse (whose spatial length must be greater than the barrier length in order for its spectrum to be narrow enough to allow tunneling), but is instead the lifetime of the energy stored in a [[standing wave]] which forms inside the barrier. Since the stored energy in the barrier is less than the energy stored in a barrier-free region of the same length due to destructive interference, the group delay for the energy to escape the barrier region is shorter than it would be in free space, which according to Winful is the explanation for apparently superluminal tunneling.&lt;ref name="WinfulHartman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winful |first=Herbert G. |title=Tunneling time, the Hartman effect, and superluminality: A proposed resolution of an old paradox |journal=Physics Reports |volume=436 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–69 |date=December 2006 |url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/herbert.winful/files/physics_reports_review_article__2006_.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2006.09.002 |bibcode=2006PhR...436....1W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WinfulArticle"&gt;For a summary of Herbert G.

A number of authors have published papers disputing Nimtz's claim that Einstein causality is violated by his experiments, and there are many other papers in the literature discussing why quantum tunneling is not thought to violate causality.&lt;ref&gt;A number of papers are listed at [http://www.aei.mpg.de/~mpoessel/Physik/FTL/tunnelingftl.html Literature on Faster-than-light tunneling experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later claimed by the Keller group in Switzerland that particle tunneling does indeed occur in zero real time. Their tests involved tunneling electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for tunneling time should be 500-600 attoseconds (an [[attosecond]] is one quintillionth (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;18&lt;/sup&gt;) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy.&lt;ref name="Eckle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eckle |first1=P. |last2=Pfeiffer |first2=A.

=== Give up (absolute) relativity ===
Because of the strong empirical support for [[special relativity]], any modifications to it must necessarily be quite subtle and difficult to measure. The best-known attempt is [[doubly special relativity]], which posits that the [[Planck length]] is also the same in all reference frames, and is associated with the work of [[Giovanni Amelino-Camelia]] and [[João Magueijo]].

There are speculative theories that claim inertia is produced by the combined mass of the universe (e.g., [[Mach's principle]]), which implies that the rest frame of the universe might be ''preferred'' by conventional measurements of natural law. If confirmed, this would imply [[special relativity]] is an approximation to a more general theory, but since the relevant comparison would (by definition) be outside the [[observable universe]], it is difficult to imagine (much less construct) experiments to test this hypothesis.

=== Spacetime distortion ===
Although the theory of [[special relativity]] forbids objects to have a relative velocity greater than light speed, and [[general relativity]] reduces to special relativity in a local sense (in small regions of spacetime where curvature is negligible), general relativity does allow the space between distant objects to expand in such a way that they have a "[[recession velocity]]" which exceeds the speed of light, and it is thought that galaxies which are at a distance of more than about 14 billion light-years from us today have a recession velocity which is faster than light.&lt;ref name="misconceptions"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lineweaver, Charles H. |author2=Davis, Tamara M. |title=Misconceptions about the Big Bang |publisher=Scientific American |date=March 2005 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=misconceptions-about-the-2005-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miguel Alcubierre]] [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0264-9381/11/5/001 theorized] that it would be possible to create an [[Alcubierre drive]], in which a ship would be enclosed in a "warp bubble" where the space at the front of the bubble is rapidly contracting and the space at the back is rapidly expanding, with the result that the bubble can reach a distant destination much faster than a light beam moving outside the bubble, but without objects inside the bubble locally traveling faster than light. However, [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|several objections]] raised against the Alcubierre drive appear to rule out the possibility of actually using it in any practical fashion. Another possibility predicted by general relativity is the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]], which could create a shortcut between arbitrarily distant points in space. As with the Alcubierre drive, travelers moving through the wormhole would not ''locally'' move faster than light travelling through the wormhole alongside them, but they would be able to reach their destination (and return to their starting location) faster than light traveling outside the wormhole.

Dr. Gerald Cleaver, associate professor of physics at [[Baylor University]], and Richard Obousy, a Baylor graduate student, theorized that manipulating the extra spatial dimensions of [[string theory]] around a spaceship with an extremely large amount of energy would create a "bubble" that could cause the ship to travel faster than the speed of light. To create this bubble, the physicists believe manipulating the 10th spatial dimension would alter the [[dark energy]] in three large spatial dimensions: height, width and length. Cleaver said positive dark energy is currently responsible for speeding up the expansion rate of our universe as time moves on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543391/ Traveling Faster Than the Speed of Light: A New Idea That Could Make It Happen] Newswise, retrieved on 24 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heim theory ===
In 1977, a paper on [[Heim theory]] theorized that it may be possible to travel faster than light by using magnetic fields to enter a higher-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heim, Burkhard |title=Vorschlag eines Weges einer einheitlichen Beschreibung der Elementarteilchen [Recommendation of a Way to a Unified Description of Elementary Particles] |journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung |year=1977 |volume=32a |pages=233–243 |bibcode=1977ZNatA..32..233H |doi = 10.1515/zna-1977-3-404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lorentz symmetry violation ===
{{Main|Modern searches for Lorentz violation|Standard-Model Extension}}

The possibility that Lorentz symmetry may be violated has been seriously considered in the last two decades, particularly after the development of a realistic effective field theory that describes this possible violation, the so-called [[Standard-Model Extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ph/9703464 |bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.6760C |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.6760 |title=CPT violation and the standard model |year=1997 |last1=Colladay |first1=Don |last2=Kostelecký |first2=V.

The breaking of rotation and boost invariance causes direction dependence in the theory as well as unconventional energy dependence that introduces novel effects, including [[Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillations]] and modifications to the dispersion relations of different particle species, which naturally could make particles move faster than light.

In some models of broken Lorentz symmetry, it is postulated that the symmetry is still built into the most fundamental laws of physics, but that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of Lorentz invariance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kostelecký |first1=V. A. |last2=Samuel |first2=S. |title=Spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry in string theory |journal=Physical Review D |date=15 January 1989 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=683–685 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.39.683|bibcode=1989PhRvD..39..683K }}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after the [[Big Bang]] could have left a "relic field" throughout the universe which causes particles to behave differently depending on their velocity relative to the field;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsweb.org/article/world/17/3/7 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405031103/http://physicsweb.org/article/world/17/3/7 |archivedate=2004-04-05 |title=PhysicsWeb - Breaking Lorentz symmetry |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-04-05 |accessdate=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there are also some models where Lorentz symmetry is broken in a more fundamental way. If Lorentz symmetry can cease to be a fundamental symmetry at Planck scale or at some other fundamental scale, it is conceivable that particles with a critical speed different from the speed of light be the ultimate constituents of matter.

In current models of Lorentz symmetry violation, the phenomenological parameters are expected to be energy-dependent. Therefore, as widely recognized,&lt;ref name="CERNCourrier"&gt;Mavromatos, Nick E.; ''Testing models for quantum gravity'', ''CERN Courier'', http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28696 (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Overbye, Dennis; [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/31/science/interpreting-the-cosmic-rays.html?n=Top/News/Science/Topics/Space ''Interpreting the Cosmic Rays''], The New York Times, 31 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; existing low-energy bounds cannot be applied to high-energy phenomena; however, many searches for Lorentz violation at high energies have been carried out using the [[Standard-Model Extension]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
Lorentz symmetry violation is expected to become stronger as one gets closer to the fundamental scale.

=== Superfluid theories of physical vacuum ===
{{main|Superfluid vacuum}}

In this approach the physical [[vacuum]] is viewed as the quantum [[superfluid]] which is essentially non-relativistic whereas the [[Lorentz symmetry]] is not an exact symmetry of nature but rather the approximate description valid only for the small fluctuations of the superfluid background.&lt;ref name="volovik03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Volovik |first1=G. E. |year=2003 |title=The Universe in a helium droplet |journal=International Series of Monographs on Physics |volume=117 |pages=1–507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the framework of the approach a theory was proposed in which the physical vacuum is conjectured to be the [[Bose–Einstein condensate|quantum Bose liquid]] whose ground-state [[Wave function|wavefunction]] is described by the [[logarithmic Schrödinger equation]]. It was shown that the [[General relativity|relativistic gravitational interaction]] arises as the small-amplitude [[collective excitation]] mode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spontaneous symmetry breaking and mass generation as built-in phenomena in logarithmic nonlinear quantum theory |last1=Zloshchastiev |first1=Konstantin G. |year=2009 |doi=10.5506/APhysPolB.42.261 |journal=Acta Physica Polonica B |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=261–292 |arxiv=0912.4139 |bibcode = 2011AcPPB..42..261Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas relativistic [[elementary particles]] can be described by the [[Quasiparticle|particle-like modes]] in the limit of low momenta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1108.0847 |bibcode=2011JPhB...44s5303A |doi=10.1088/0953-4075/44/19/195303 |title=Quantum Bose liquids with logarithmic nonlinearity: Self-sustainability and emergence of spatial extent |year=2011 |last1=Avdeenkov |first1=Alexander V. |last2=Zloshchastiev |first2=Konstantin G. |journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics |volume=44 |issue=19 |page=195303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The important fact is that at very high velocities the behavior of the particle-like modes becomes distinct from the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] one - they can reach the [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|speed of light limit]] at finite energy; also, faster-than-light propagation is possible without requiring moving objects to have [[imaginary mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0906.4282 |bibcode=2010AIPC.1206..112Z |doi=10.1063/1.3292518 |title=Logarithmic nonlinearity in theories of quantum gravity: Origin of time and observational consequences |series=AIP Conference Proceedings |year=2010 |last1=Zloshchastiev |first1=Konstantin G. |last2=Chakrabarti |first2=Sandip K. |last3=Zhuk |first3=Alexander I. |last4=Bisnovatyi-Kogan |first4=Gennady S. |page=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1003.0657 |bibcode=2011PhLA..375.2305Z |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2011.05.012 |title=Vacuum Cherenkov effect in logarithmic nonlinear quantum theory |year=2011 |last1=Zloshchastiev |first1=Konstantin G. |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=375 |issue=24 |pages=2305–2308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In special relativity, it is impossible to accelerate an object {{em|to}} the [[speed of light]], or for a massive object to move {{em|at}} the speed of light. However, it might be possible for an object to exist which {{em|always}} moves faster than light. The hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s with this property are called [[tachyon|tachyonic particles]]. Attempts to [[Tachyonic field|quantize]] them failed to produce faster-than-light particles, and instead illustrated that their presence leads to an instability.&lt;ref name="Randall"&gt;Randall, Lisa; ''Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions'', p. 286: "People initially thought of tachyons as particles travelling faster than the speed of light...But we now know that a tachyon indicates an instability in a theory that contains it. Regrettably for [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]], tachyons are not real physical particles that appear in nature."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. James |last=Gates |authorlink=S. James Gates |title=Superstring Theory: The DNA of Reality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theorists have suggested that the [[neutrino]] might have a [[tachyon]]ic nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chodos |first1=A. |last2=Hauser |first2=A.

== Exotic matter ==
{{main|Exotic matter|Negative mass}}
Mechanical equations to describe hypothetical [[exotic matter]] which possesses a [[negative mass]], [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] and [[negative kinetic energy]] are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Z.Y. |title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials |journal=Plasmonics |date=2016 |volume=11 |pages=503–508 |doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=-{m_0c^2\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;(E_0=-m_0c^2&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p= {m_0 v\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Considering &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;, the [[energy-momentum relation]] of the particle is corresponding to the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_p^2&lt;/math&gt;,    &lt;math&gt;(E_0=\hbar\omega_p=-m_0c^2&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

of a wave that can propagate in the [[negative index metamaterial]]. The pressure of [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[negative refraction]], [[inverse Doppler effect]] and [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] imply that the [[momentum]] is also negative. So the wave in a [[negative index metamaterial]] can be applied to test the theory of [[exotic matter]] and [[negative mass]]. For example, the velocity equals

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&lt;c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

That is to say, such a wave can break the [[Speed of light|light barrier]] under certain conditions.

== General relativity ==
[[General relativity]] was developed after [[special relativity]] to include concepts like [[gravity]]. It maintains the principle that no object can accelerate to the speed of light in the reference frame of any coincident observer.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{clarify|date=October 2009}} However, it permits distortions in [[spacetime]] that allow an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant observer.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}{{clarify|date=March 2012}} One such [[distortion]] is the [[Alcubierre drive]], which can be thought of as producing a [[wikt:ripple|ripple]] in [[spacetime]] that carries an object along with it. Another possible system is the [[wormhole]], which connects two distant locations as though by a shortcut. Both distortions would need to create a very strong curvature in a highly localized region of space-time and their gravity fields would be immense. To counteract the unstable nature, and prevent the distortions from collapsing under their own 'weight', one would need to introduce hypothetical [[exotic matter]] or negative energy.

General relativity also recognizes that any means of faster-than-light [[travel]] could also be used for [[time travel]]. This raises problems with [[causality]]. Many physicists believe that the above phenomena are impossible and that future theories of [[gravity]] will prohibit them. One theory states that stable wormholes are possible, but that any attempt to use a network of wormholes to violate causality would result in their decay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In [[string theory]], Eric G. Gimon and [[Petr Hořava (theorist)|Petr Hořava]] have argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-th/0405019 |title=Over-rotating black holes, Gödel holography and the hypertube |first=Eric G. |last=Gimon |author2=Hořava, Petr |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that in a [[supersymmetric]] five-dimensional [[Gödel metric|Gödel universe]], quantum corrections to general relativity effectively cut off regions of spacetime with causality-violating closed timelike curves. In particular, in the quantum theory a smeared supertube is present that cuts the spacetime in such a way that, although in the full spacetime a closed timelike curve passed through every point, no complete curves exist on the interior region bounded by the tube.

== Variable speed of light ==
{{Main|Variable speed of light}}

In [[physics]], the speed of light in a [[vacuum]] is assumed to be a constant. However, [[hypotheses]] exist that the [[speed of light]] is variable.

The speed of light is a dimensional quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by [[João Magueijo]], it cannot be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=João Magueijo |first=João |last=Magueijo |author2=Albrecht, Andreas |title=A time varying speed of light as a solution to cosmological puzzles |year=1999 |issue=4 |volume=59 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.59.043516 |journal=Physical Review D |arxiv=astro-ph/9811018 |bibcode=1999PhRvD..59d3516A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when the height of a mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional [[International System of Units|SI]] system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely [[distance]], [[mass]], time, [[electric current]], [[thermodynamic temperature]], [[amount of substance]], and [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |title=SI base units |website=The NIST Reference on Constants, Units and Uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[units of measurement|units]] are defined to be [[Independent variable|independent]] and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as [[Newton's constant]], the speed of light and [[Planck's constant]]; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Baez |date=22 April 2011 |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? }}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the [[Planck time]], [[Planck length]] and [[Planck energy]] which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as [[Planck units]].

Magueijo's proposal used a different set of [[units of measurement|units]], a choice which he justifies with the claim that some equations will be simpler in these new units. In the new units he fixes the [[fine structure constant]], a quantity which some people, using units in which the speed of light is fixed, have claimed is time-dependent. Thus in the system of units in which the fine structure constant is fixed, the observational claim is that the speed of light is time-dependent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Gender schema theory''' was formally introduced by [[Sandra Bem]] in 1981 as a cognitive theory to explain how individuals become gendered in society, and how sex-linked characteristics are maintained and transmitted to other members of a culture.&lt;ref name="bemsl"&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981). Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review, 88'', 354–364&lt;/ref&gt;
Gender-associated information is predominantly transmuted through society by way of [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]], or networks of information that allow for some information to be more easily assimilated than others. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] argues that there are individual differences in the degree to which people hold these gender schemata. These differences are manifested via the degree to which individuals are sex-typed.

==Sex-typing==
Core gender identity is tied up in the sex typing that an individual undergoes. This typing can be heavily influenced by child rearing, media, school, and other forms of cultural transmission. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] refers to four categories in which an individual may fall: sex-typed, cross-sex-typed, androgynous, and undifferentiated. Sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with their gender. Cross-sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with the opposite gender. Androgynous individuals process and integrate traits and information from both genders. Finally, undifferentiated individuals do not show efficient processing of sex-typed information.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Gender stereotypes==
{{see also|Sexism#Gender stereotypes|Gender role#Gender stereotypes|Implicit stereotype#Gender stereotype}}
Being that gender schema theory is a theory of process and not content, this theory can help explain some of the processes by which gender stereotypes become so psychologically ingrained in our society. Specifically, having strong gender schemata provides a filter through which we process incoming stimuli in the environment. This leads to an easier ability to assimilate information that is stereotype congruent, hence further solidifying the existence of gender stereotypes.  Within adolescent development, Bem hypothesizes that children must choose among a plethora of dimensions, but that gender schemas lead to the regulation of behaviors that conform to the cultural definition of what it means to be male or female.  Additionally, Bem asserts that there is also a [[heterosexuality]] subschema, which likely encouraged the development of gender schemas.  Most societies treat exclusive heterosexuality as the benchmark for proper masculinity and femininity—that is, heterosexuality is the norm.  Furthermore, the heterosexuality subschema asserts that men and women are supposed to be different from one another. It is hypothesized that this is why cross-sexed interactions are likely to be sexually coded.  Sex-typed individuals have a general readiness to invoke the heterosexuality subschema in social interactions, behaving differently towards individuals of the opposite sex that they find attractive v. unattractive.

==Evidence==
Some of the early tests of gender schema theory came in the form of memory and other cognitive tasks designed to assess facilitated processing of sex-typed information. Much of this early research found that participants who were sex-typed remembered more traits associated with their sex, as well as processed sex-type congruent information more efficiently, suggesting that the gender schemata possessed by sex-typed individuals help to assimilate sex-associated information into one’s self-concept (see Bem, 1981).&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;
[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] showed that when given the option of clustering words by either semantic meaning or gender, sex-typed individuals are more likely to use the gender clustering system, followed by undifferentiated individuals.  Cross-typed individuals had the lowest percentage of words clustered by gender.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Positive social change==
A strong source of sex-typing comes from the rearing practices of parents. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] offers strong suggestions for preventing the sex-typing of children, including the prevention of access to media that promotes sex-typing, altering media and stories to eliminate sex-typing information, and modeling equal roles for mothers and fathers in the household.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1983). Gender schema theory and its implications for child development: Raising gender-aschematic children in a gender-schematic society. ''Signs, 8,'' 598–616.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Bem edited the books that her children read to create a more androgynous view.  This included, for example, drawing long hair and feminine body characteristics on male figures.  Ultimately, however, this is somewhat limited because children will become exposed to some of this sex-typing information, particularly when they begin attending school. Therefore, [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] suggests teaching alternative schemata to children so that they are less likely to build and maintain a gender schema. Some examples include an individual differences schema, where children learn to process information on a person-by-person basis rather than make wide assumptions about groups based on information from individuals. Also, providing children with a sexism schema, where children learn to process sex-typed information through a filter that promotes moral outrage when sexist information is being promoted, can assist in providing children with the resources to not only keep from becoming sex-typed but also promote positive social change.

Bem wished to raise consciousness that the male/female dichotomy is used as an organizing framework, often unnecessarily, especially in the school curriculum. She stressed that the omnirelevance of gender has a negative impact on society, and that the gender schema should be more limited in scope.  Within the feminist lens, androgyny is not radical enough, because androgyny means that “masculine” and “feminine” still exist.  Rather, society should decrease the use of the gender dichotomy as a functional unit, and be aschematic.

==Legacy==
The legacy of gender schema theory has not been one of obvious lasting impact in the psychology of gender. [[Sandra Bem|Bem's]] theory was undoubtedly informed by the cognitive revolution of the 1970s and 1980s and was coming at a time when the psychology of gender was drastically picking up interest as more and more women were entering academic fields. While gender schema theory does provide a cognitive backbone for how gender stereotypes may continue to be maintained in current society, it lost wind as more broad sociological theories became the dominant force in the psychology of gender. A major limitation of gender schema theory has been that once research supported the nature of the process, there was little work that followed.

The longest-lasting contribution to the field has been the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]]. Originally developed as a tool to identify sex-typed individuals, many researchers use the measure to look at other components of gender, including endorsement of gender stereotypes and as a measure of masculinity/femininity. Caution should be employed when examining research that uses the Bem Sex-Role Inventory for measuring constructs that it was not created to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, R. M., &amp; Borders, L. D. A. (2001). Twenty-five years after the Bem Sex-Role Inventory: A reassessment and new issues regarding classification variability. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, 34,'' 39–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] herself admitted that she was ill-prepared to develop the Bem Sex-Role Inventory and never anticipated it being as widely used as it still is today.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (2001). ''An unconventional family.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gula''' is a [[impact crater|crater]] on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. It is a fresh crater with a distinctive central peak.  It is about 40&amp;nbsp;km (25 miles) in diameter.

A characteristic feature of both Gula and its southern neighbor Achelous, almost identical in size, is the "pedestal" − an outward-facing, relatively gently sloped scarp that terminates the continuous ejecta blanket. Similar features may be seen in ejecta blankets of Martian craters, suggesting impacts into a volatile (ice)-rich target material. Furthermore, both craters appear crisp and feature terraces. Gula has a prominent central peak; Achelous instead may show the remnant of a collapsed central peak or a central pit that is not fully formed. On lower-resolution images taken under higher sun illumination angle, both craters are shown to have extended bright rays, especially Achelous, which demonstrates that these two craters are younger than the respective surrounding landscape.

'''Heinrich Hlasiwetz''' (April 7, 1825 &amp;ndash; October 7, 1875) was an  [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[chemist]] born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]], [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/prac.18750120135 | title = Heinrich Hlasiwetz | year = 1875 | last1 = Habermann | journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 463}}[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90775n/f468.image.r=Journal%20f%C3%BCr%20Praktische%20Chemie.langDE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | first =L. | last = Barth |doi = 10.1002/cber.187600902266 | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | year = 1876 | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages= 1961–1992}}[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k906830/f931.image.r=chemische%20berichte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | doi = 10.1021/ed022p55| title = Heinrich Hlasiwetz (1825-1875) | first = Moritz | last = Kohn | journal =

Son of a [[pharmacist]], he studied at the [[University of Jena]], where his instructors included [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] (1780-1849), [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ferdinand Wackenroder]] (1798-1854) and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] (1804-1881). Later he studied under [[Josef Redtenbacher (chemist)|Josef Redtenbacher]] (1810–1870) in [[Prague]]. In 1848 he earned the diploma of ''Magister Pharmacia'', and during the following year received his doctorate in [[chemistry]].

In 1849 he began work as an assistant to [[Friedrich Rochleder]] (1819-1874), later becoming an associate professor of chemistry at the [[University of Innsbruck]] (1854). In 1867 he became a professor at the [[Vienna University of Technology]], where from 1869 he represented general and analytical chemistry.

During his career he largely worked with [[resins]], [[tannins]] and [[protein]] compounds. Hlasiwetz is remembered for his chemical analysis of [[quercitrin]], [[phloroglucinol]], [[resorcinol]] and [[creosote]].

'''[[Earth science]]''' (also known as '''geoscience''', '''the geosciences''' or '''the Earth Sciences'''), is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth science. There are four major [[discipline]]s in earth sciences, namely [[geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]] and [[geodesy]]. These major disciplines use [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or ''[[Earth's spheres|spheres]]'' of the Earth system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">'''Maurice Jean Auguste Girard''' (13 September 1822 – 8 September 1886) was a French [[entomologist]].

Girard was born in [[Givet]], [[Ardennes]], and entered [[École normale supérieure]] in 1844. In 1847 he taught [[physics]] in [[Périgueux]]. After having obtained his ''agrégation'', he left for [[Dijon]] where he taught from 1853 to 1873. during this time he obtained his “licence” and his “doctorat ès-sciences naturelles”  with a thesis entitled Étude sur la chaleur libre dégagée par les animaux invertébrés et spécialement les insectes.

He edited L'Insectologie agricole, journal traitant des insectes utiles... et des insectes nuisibles... from 1867 to 1870. He wrote more than 200 publications on insects and a book on [[François Péron]]-  François Péron, naturaliste voyageur aux australes (1800-1804) (J.-B. Baillière, Paris, 1856)

He was president of [[Société entomologique de France]] in 1867.  He died at [[Lion-sur-Mer]], aged 63.

'''John S. Sappington''' (1776-1856) was an American physician known for creating a [[quinine]] pill to treat [[malaria]] in the Missouri area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=catherineburr357&amp;id=I1111|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: My Ancestors:  HARRIS, WILLIAMS, BETTS, SAPPINGTON, MULLICAN, WILEY,  STOUT &amp; CROCKER &amp; other families|website=wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote "The Theory and Treatment of Fevers," the first medical [[treatise]] published west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
John Sappington was born in 1776 to Dr. Mark and Rebecca Sappington in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Dr-John-Sappington-dicovered-quinine/6000000002614287152|title=Dr. John Sappington, dicovered &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; quinine|website=geni_family_tree|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied under the guidance of his father, who taught medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and later moved to Tennessee to practice medicine independently. He married Jane Breathitt. The couple had nine children together, two boys and seven girls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/s/sappington/|title=John S.

In 1819, following the advice of Benton, Sappington and his family moved to [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], Missouri.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
John Sappington provided medical services, was a financial lender, and imported and exported goods to the Missouri area. He established two stores near Arrow Rock that sold goods, loaned money, processed salt, and milled lumber.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once he had achieved financial success, Sappington was able to be more experimental with his medical practice. He focused his energy on the bark of the [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], the substance used to create quinine. [[Malaria]], [[scarlet fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[influenza]], were prominent along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Sappington developed a preventative pill using quinine that was soon in demand across the country. It was marketed as an anti-fever pill, but Sappington also instructed some of his relatives to take the pills to prevent malaria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most physicians were still treating malaria by [[bloodletting]] the patient and administering [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sappington’s pill to prevent malaria—and also used to cure malaria—was controversial due to its novelty and unfamiliarity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Sappington Papers." Missouri History Museum. http://www.mohistory.org/files/archives_guides/SappingtonPapers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The pill remained in high demand, however, and many other physicians began to develop their own anti-malaria pills after Sappington published the formula in his medical treatise, “Theory and Treatment of Fevers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/westernamericana/2012/07/12/sappingtons-theory-treatment-of-fevers/|title=Sappington’s Theory &amp; Treatment of Fevers|date=2012-07-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often regarded as the first physician to successfully and effectively use quinine to treat malaria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21530">In [[optics]], [[polarized light]] can be described using the '''Jones calculus''', discovered by [[Robert Clark Jones|R. C. Jones]] in 1941. Polarized light is represented by a '''Jones vector''', and linear optical elements are represented by ''Jones [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]''. When light crosses an optical element the resulting polarization of the emerging light is found by taking the product of the Jones matrix of the optical element and the Jones vector of the incident light.
Note that Jones calculus is only applicable to light that is already fully polarized. Light which is randomly polarized, partially polarized, or incoherent must be treated using [[Mueller calculus]].

== The Jones vector ==
The Jones vector describes the polarization of light in free space or another [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] [[attenuation|non-attenuating]] medium, where the light can be properly described as [[transverse waves]]. Suppose that a monochromatic [[plane wave]] of light is travelling in the positive ''z''-direction, with angular frequency ''ω'' and [[Wave vector|wavevector]] '''k''' = (0,0,''k''), where the [[wavenumber]] ''k'' = ''ω''/''c''. Then the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''H''' are orthogonal to '''k''' at each point; they both lie in the plane "transverse" to the direction of motion. Furthermore, '''H''' is determined from '''E''' by 90-degree rotation and a fixed multiplier depending on the [[wave impedance]] of the medium. So the polarization of the light can be determined by studying '''E'''. The complex amplitude of '''E''' is written 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} E_x(t) \\ E_y(t) \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} E_{0x} e^{i(kz- \omega t+\phi_x)} \\ E_{0y} e^{i(kz- \omega t+\phi_y)} \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} E_{0x} e^{i\phi_x} \\ E_{0y} e^{i\phi_y} \\ 0\end{pmatrix}e^{i(kz- \omega t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the physical '''E''' field is the real part of this vector; the complex multiplier serves up the phase information. Here &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]] with &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;.

The Jones vector is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}  E_{0x} e^{i\phi_x} \\ E_{0y} e^{i\phi_y} \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Jones vector represents the amplitude and phase of the electric field in the ''x'' and ''y''  directions.

The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the two components of Jones vectors is proportional to the intensity of light.  It is common to normalize it to 1 at the starting point of calculation for simplification.  It is also common to constrain the first component of the Jones vectors to be a [[real number]]. This discards the overall phase information that would be needed for calculation of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] with other beams.

Note that all Jones vectors and matrices on this article employ the convention that the phase of the light wave is given by &lt;math&gt;\phi = kz - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;, a convention used by Hecht.  Under this convention, increase in &lt;math&gt;\phi_x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\phi_y&lt;/math&gt;) indicates retardation (delay) in phase, while decrease indicates advance in phase.  For example, a Jones vectors component of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;=e^{i\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt;) indicates retardation by &lt;math&gt; \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; (or 90 degree) compared to 1 (&lt;math&gt;=e^{0}&lt;/math&gt;).  Circular polarisation described under Jones' convention is called : "From the point of view of the receiver". Collett uses the opposite definition for the phase (&lt;math&gt;\phi = \omega t - kz&lt;/math&gt;). Circular polarisation described under Collett's convention is called : "From the point of view of the source".  The reader should be wary of the choice of convention when consulting references on the Jones calculus.

The following table gives the 6 common examples of normalized Jones vectors.

|}

A general vector that points to any place on the surface is written as a [[Bra-ket notation|ket]] &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. When employing the [[Poincaré sphere (optics)|Poincaré sphere]] (also known as the [[Bloch sphere]]), the basis kets (&lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) must be assigned to opposing ([[Antipodal points|antipodal]]) pairs of the kets listed above.  For example, one might assign &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  These assignments are arbitrary.  Opposing pairs are

* &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;|D\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|A\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The polarization of any point not equal to &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and not on the circle that passes through &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle, |D\rangle, |V\rangle, |A\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is known as [[elliptical polarization]].

== Jones matrices ==
The Jones matrices are operators that act on the Jones vectors defined above.  These matrices are implemented by various optical elements such as lenses, beam splitters, mirrors, etc.  Each matrix represents projection onto a one-dimensional complex subspace of the Jones vectors. The following table gives examples of Jones matrices for polarizers:

&lt;/math&gt;
|-

&lt;br /&gt;

== Phase retarders ==
Phase retarders introduce a phase shift between the vertical and horizontal component of the field and thus change the polarization of the beam. Phase retarders are usually made out of [[birefringent]] [[uniaxial crystal]]s such as [[calcite]], MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or [[quartz]]. Uniaxial crystals have one crystal axis that is different from the other two crystal axes (i.e., ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''). This unique axis is called the extraordinary axis and is also referred to as the [[optic axis of a crystal|optic axis]]. An optic axis can be the fast or the slow axis for the crystal depending on the crystal at hand. Light travels with a higher phase velocity along an axis that has the smallest [[refractive index]] and this axis is called the fast axis. Similarly, an axis which has the largest refractive index is called a slow axis since the [[phase velocity]] of light is the lowest along this axis. "Negative" uniaxial crystals (e.g., [[calcite]] CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[sapphire]] Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) have ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''n&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' so for these crystals, the extraordinary axis (optic axis) is the fast axis, whereas for "positive" uniaxial crystals (e.g., [[quartz]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[magnesium fluoride]] MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[rutile]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''n &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' and thus the extraordinary axis (optic axis) is the slow axis.

Any phase retarder with fast axis equal to the x- or y-axis has zero off-diagonal terms and thus can be conveniently expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  e^{i\phi_x} &amp; 0 \\
  0           &amp; e^{i\phi_y}
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_y&lt;/math&gt; are the phase offsets of the electric fields in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; directions respectively. In the phase convention &lt;math&gt;\phi = kz - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;, define the relative phase between the two waves as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \phi_y - \phi_x&lt;/math&gt;. Then a positive &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\phi_y&lt;/math&gt; &gt; &lt;math&gt;\phi_x&lt;/math&gt;) means that &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; doesn't attain the same value as &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; until a later time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; leads &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; leads &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if the fast axis of a quarter wave plate is horizontal, then the phase velocity along the horizontal direction is ahead of the vertical direction i.e., &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; leads &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\phi_x &lt; \phi_y&lt;/math&gt; which for a quarter wave plate yields &lt;math&gt;\phi_y = \phi_x + \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.

In the opposite convention &lt;math&gt;\phi = \omega t - kz&lt;/math&gt;, define the relative phase as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \phi_x - \phi_y&lt;/math&gt;. Then  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; doesn't attain the same value as &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; until a later time, i.e. &lt;math&gt; E_x&lt;/math&gt; leads &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

The special expressions for the phase retarders can be obtained by taking suitable parameter values in the general expression for a birefringent material. In the general expression:
*The relative phase retardation induced between the fast axis and the slow axis is given by &lt;math&gt; \eta = \phi_y - \phi_x &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the orientation of the fast axis with respect to the x-axis.
*&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the circularity.

Note that for linear retarders, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; = 0 and for circular retarders, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; = ± &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/2, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/4. In general for elliptical retarders, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; takes on values between - &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/2 and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/2.

== Axially rotated elements ==
Assume an optical element has its optic axis{{clarify|reason=Does this mean (1) the "optic axis" of a (presumably uniaxial) birefringent material, or (2) the "optic axis" (also known as optical axis) of a rotationally symmetric lens system?|date=May 2015}}  perpendicular to the surface vector for the [[plane of incidence]]{{clarify|reason=What is the "surface vector for the plane of incidence"? Is it the normal vector? This would then be tangent to the surface of the refracting material, right?|date=May 2015}} and is rotated about this surface vector by angle ''θ/2'' (i.e., the principal plane,{{clarify|reason="Principal plane" is not defined in this article nor in the article on polarized light. Is it defined for lens systems?|date=May 2015}} through which the optic axis passes,{{clarify|reason=What is the geometric relation between a vector and a plane expressed by "passes through"?|date=May 2015}} makes angle ''θ/2'' with respect to the plane of polarization of the electric field{{clarify|reason=What is "the plane of polarization" of the electric field? I thought polarization was expressed by a vector. Does it mean the plane orthogonal to the direction of propagation, in which E can take its values?|date=May 2015}} of the incident TE wave). Recall that a half-wave plate rotates polarization as ''twice'' the angle between incident polarization and optic axis (principal plane). Therefore, the Jones matrix for the rotated polarization state, M(''θ''), is 
:&lt;math&gt;M(\theta )=R(-\theta )\,M\,R(\theta ),&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;R(\theta ) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta \\
-\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This agrees with the expression for a half-wave plate in the table above. These rotations are identical to beam unitary splitter transformation in optical physics given by
:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta ) =
\begin{pmatrix}
r &amp; t'\\
t &amp; r'
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where the primed and unprimed coefficients represent beams incident from opposite sides of the beam splitter. The reflected and transmitted components acquire a phase ''θ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''θ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', respectively. The requirements for a valid representation of the element are &lt;ref name=hong-ou-mandel&gt;Am. J. Phys. 57 (1), 66 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_\text{t} - \theta_\text{r} + \theta_\text{t'} - \theta_\text{r'} = \pm \pi
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;r^*t' + t^*r' = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:Both of these representations are unitary matrices fitting these requirements; and as such, are both valid.

A '''lineage''' is an [[unilineal descent]] group that can demonstrate their common descent from a known [[Most recent common ancestor|apical ancestor]]. Unilineal lineages can be matrilineal or patrilineal, depending on whether they are traced through mothers or fathers, respectively. Whether matrilineal or patrilineal descent is considered most significant differs from culture to culture.

This is a list of case colors and styles that have been produced for the [[Nintendo DS]] line of handheld systems.

==Nintendo DS==

===Colors===
* Titanium
* Sky Blue
* Candy Pink
* Snow White
* Lava Red

===Retail bundles===
*The red Nintendo DS model, released in Japan on August 8, 2005, is part of a promotional offer that includes the game ''[[Jump Superstars]]''.
*In October 2005, Nintendo released two new colors to North America: Teal and Pearl Pink (not the same Candy Pink as was released in Europe and Japan, but a tint identical to that of the Mystic Pink model released in Australia). These systems are bundled with the game ''[[Nintendogs|Nintendogs Best Friends Version]]'', as well as a bone-shaped screen cleaner. These bundles were released in Europe on October 7, 2005. In Europe, the pink DS included the Dachshund and Friends version of ''Nintendogs'', and the teal DS included the Lab and Friends version of ''Nintendogs''. These were priced at the same price as a lone Nintendo DS (£99). On that same day, the Nintendo DS received a price cut to £89.
*The Electric Blue was released in North America, initially bundled with ''Super Mario 64 DS'', for the same price as a lone DS ($149.99) on June 30, 2005. One million copies were sold, making it the best-selling game during that time. As of February 27, 2006 ''Animal Crossing: Wild World'' is included with the Electric Blue system.
*The ''Mario Kart DS'' Pack was released in Europe on November 25, 2005, which contained a silver-colored DS and a copy of ''Mario Kart DS''. The same Pack was available in New Zealand and Australia
*The Red Hot Bundle was released in North America on November 29, 2005, including a red and silver Nintendo DS system ("Hot Rod Red"), optional racing decals, a normal Nintendo DS wrist strap/thumb pad, a bonus checkerboard wrist strap (strangely, with no thumb pad), a Mario Kart metal charm, and a copy of ''Mario Kart DS''. It also came with [[racecar]] [[decal]] [[stickers]] that could be placed on your DS. It is the same as the original red DS that debuted in Japan alongside ''[[Jump Superstars]]''; the only difference is that the underside of the Japanese model is black, while the underside of the American model is silver.
*The Titanium Nintendo DS was released with a demo of the game ''Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt'', on November 21, 2004, in North America and on March 11, 2005, in Europe. The bundle is no longer available in the vast majority of American and European stores.
*On June 22, 2008, a special edition Guitar Hero DS was released on online retailers to help launch the new game ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' that featured the Guitar Hero logo on the bottom right. It was available to anyone for a limited time for approx. US $179.99. This also includes the game. It can still be found at the Nintendo World Store, for approx. US $129.99, albeit in very limited copies.

===Loyalty, one-of-a-kind, charity and promotional units===
*Five variants of existing Nintendo DS colors were produced for the Japanese online Super Mario Club. Each color has a wireframe of a character's face imprinted on the front cover of the system. There were 200 made for each unit. The designs include:
**Titanium/[[Mario]]
**Graphite Black/[[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]]
**Gray/[[Wario]]
**Candy Pink/[[Princess Peach]]
**Turquoise Blue/[[Yoshi]].
*Nintendo auctioned off three custom Nintendo DS systems for charity at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]. The systems went to [[Jay Mohr]] for $10,000, [[Poppy Montgomery]] for $2,500, and [[Alan Cumming]] for $1,500. Nintendo added money to the final bids, and a portion of the funds went towards victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].
*Rapper [[50 Cent]] ordered a custom-made Nintendo DS from Nintendo, featuring a [[khaki]] [[camouflage]] design, and the [[G-Unit]] insignia on the front cover. 50 were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=1649 | title=Rapper Has A Custom Nintendo DS Made | author=Chris Playo |date=March 4, 2005 | work=NintendoDS Advanced | publisher=Advanced Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a special gift, 55 people who attended the May 9, 2006, VIP party at the Nintendo World Store were able to get a commemorative E3 engraving put on the cover of their Nintendo DS.
*The winner of the [[Pokémon]] Journey Across America, Minh Ba Le, won a [[diamond]]-encrusted DS.
*Shortly before the system's official launch in Europe, a bundle was available on the Nintendo VIP 24:7 scheme consisting of a European silver DS system, a demo of [[WarioWare: Touched!]], a copy of Super Mario 64 DS, and a T-shirt, in exchange for 1000 Stars and £129.99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://n-europe.com/news.php?nid=7389|title=Nintendo DS VIP Package|date=January 28, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-29|work=N-Europe|format=PHP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927072543/http://n-europe.com/news.php?nid=7389|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bundled with ''[[Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day!]]''.&lt;ref name="nintendo.com"&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-08-08 |title=New Nintendo DS Color Comes Bundled with Brain Age 2 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=p6YV_H74y2x8JQibfas6FxvBRZAW42VD |accessdate=2007-08-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929171725/http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=p6YV_H74y2x8JQibfas6FxvBRZAW42VD |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo confirmed this bundle after it was listed by Canadian retail outlet [[Future Shop]]. The listing was picked up and featured on many major online gaming websites such as [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-07-20 |title=Canadians To Get Crimson-Black DS Lite? With Brain Age 2 Combo Pack. |publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://gear.ign.com/articles/807/807141p1.html |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the same day, Nintendo also released a similar color scheme for the DS Lite, known as Cobalt/Onyx, and in certain regions was bundled the same as its Crimson/Onyx color variation. They both feature a glossy upper half of the DS Lite's lid, whereas the rest of the unit is matte black. This varied from earlier Onyx (Black) models as the exterior casings were not done in a matte coating; rather a glossy exterior prone to fingerprints and scratches.
*In September 2007, in North America Nintendo released a DS Lite to commemorate the launch of ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pokémon Pearl'' video games. The black Pokémon Nintendo DS Lite was bundled with a special Pokémon cartoon episode and a carrying case. The Pokémon Dialga and Palkia guarded the system's upper lid, etched in gold and silver respectively. The Nintendo DS Lite for a while after was still available in onyx black until supplies ran out; but its casing lacks the Pokémon design. A similar model was released in white around the debut of ''Pokémon Platinum'' Version featuring the Pokémon, Giratina, etched on the lid in grey.
*In April 2009, for the launch of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars]]'', Nintendo showcased 20 Nintendo DS Lite units, shown in dark navy blue and red with GTA logos on top, displayed at the Nintendo World Store.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">This is a '''list of biodiversity databases'''. Biodiversity databases store [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]]  information which provide information on the [[biodiversity]] of a particular area or group of living organisms. They may store specimen-level information, species-level information, information on nomenclature, or any combination of the above. Most are available online.

Specimen-focused databases contain data about individual specimens, as represented by vouchered museum specimens, collections of specimen photographs, data on field-based specimen observations and morphological or genetic data. Species-focused databases contain information summarised at the species-level. Some species-focused databases attempt to compile comprehensive data about particular species ([[FishBase]]), while others focus on particular species attributes, such as checklists of species in a given area (FEOW) or the conservation status of species ([[CITES]] or [[IUCN Red List]]). Nomenclators act as summaries of taxonomic revisions and set  a key between specimen-focused and species-focused databases. They do this because taxonomic revisions use specimen data to determine species limits.

BASICs with Bitwise Ops use -1 as true and the AND and OR operators perform a [[bitwise operation]] on the arguments.

&lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; skip means that body of the loop is skipped if the initial value of the loop times the sign of the step exceeds the final value times the sign of the step (such as &lt;code&gt;2 TO 1 STEP 1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1 TO 2 STEP -1&lt;/code&gt;).  The statements inside the &lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; loop will not be executed at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/229191 How does BASIC locate an out-of-order NEXT statement when the loop body is skipped]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/BASIC-80_MBASIC_Reference_Manual#page/n47/mode/2up|page=2&amp;ndash;30|title=basic-80 reference manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numeric support indicates if a BASIC supports Integers and/or Floating Point.

Variable Name Length is how many characters of a variable name are used to determine uniqueness.

Full tokenization means that all keywords are converted to tokens and all extra space characters are removed. Partial tokenization leaves extra space characters in the source. None means that no tokenization is done. How to test for full tokenization:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=purebasic&gt;
10 PRINT         "HELLO"
LIST
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If it is fully tokenized it should return 10 PRINT "HELLO" without all the extra spaces that were entered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5288">Much insight in [[quantum mechanics]] can be gained from understanding the [[closed-form solution]]s to the time-dependent non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]] in an appropriate [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. In vector Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, the equation takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
H \psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right) = \left(T + V\right) \, \psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right) =
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \right] \psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right) = i\hbar \frac{\partial\psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right)}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavefunction]] of the system, H is the [[Hamiltonian operator]], and T and V are the operators for the [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], respectively. (Common forms of these operators appear in the square brackets.) The quantity ''t'' is the time. [[Stationary state]]s of this equation are found by solving the [[eigenvalue]]-[[eigenfunction]] (time-independent) form of the Schrödinger equation,

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \right] \psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = E \psi \left(\mathbf{r}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

or any equivalent formulation of this equation in a different coordinate system other than Cartesian coordinates. For example, systems with spherical symmetry are simplified when expressed with [[spherical coordinates]]. Very often, only numerical solutions to the Schrödinger equation can be found for a given physical system and its associated potential energy. However, there exists a subset of physical systems for which the form of the eigenfunctions and their associated energies can be found. These quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions are listed below.

The '''Malayan water shrew''' (''Chimarrogale hantu''), also known as the '''hantu water shrew''', is a [[red-toothed shrew]] recorded only from the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Selangor]]. It was listed as a critically endangered, but is now considered near threatened.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

It gets its scientific name ''hantu'' from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for [[ghost]].

==Anatomy==
The Malayan water shrew has a white underside, a black coat along its top and sides and a fringe of bristles running along the surface of the tail and on the paws which act as swimming aids. The teeth have red tips. The Malayan water shrew can grow up to about 10&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

==Habitat==
The Malayan water shrew lives in the [[Tropical Rainforests]] of [[Peninsula Malaysia]]. It lives mainly by fresh water lakes and rivers surrounded by vegetation and spends much of its time underwater. Underwater this shrew likes to stay in leafy areas to avoid predators and surprise its prey, which include fish, frogs and plants.

===Claims of scientific misconduct===
On 7 October 2008, [[eTBLAST]], a text similarity search engine on [[MEDLINE]] database, noted that 85% of a paper published by Masoumeh Ebtekar came from several previously published articles. The paper, on cytokines and air pollution, was published in 2006 in the ''Iran Journal of Allergy Asthma Immunology'' (IJAAI) 5 47-56:2006.&lt;ref name="eTBLAST"&gt;[http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/duplicate/9866/] {{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple weeks after the eTBLAST report, [[Nature magazine]] covered the story, quoting one of the authors of original papers, ([[Ian Mudway]], a [[toxicologist]] at the [[King's College London]]) as saying, "the article is a veritable patchwork of other people's work, word for word, grammatical error for grammatical error." ''Nature'' also stated that Ebtekar had not replied to its emails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081022/full/4551019a.html Iranian paper sparks sense of deja vu], Nature.com, 23 October 2008, Vol 455,&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the editor-in-chief of the IJAAI issued a statement saying: "We regret for this duplication that appeared in the journal. We are working with the editors of the JACI journal [the ''[[Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology]]'', a scholarly periodical that published three of the papers from which Ebtekar had copied] to find the best solution in this regard." In December 2008 Ebtekar's article was retracted.&lt;ref name="eTBLAST"/&gt;

The issue received some political and public attention in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alef.ir/content/view/32958/ |title=Alef.ir |publisher=Alef.ir |date= |accessdate=2008-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031101013/http://alef.ir/content/view/32958/ |archive-date=2008-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebtekar issued a statement admitting she had made a mistake and apologizing for it, but including a list of complaints such as eTBLAST's failure to inform her of their finding in advance, the fact that the article was a review article she was invited to write for the Journal, and that more than 76 references were given in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenebtekar.persianblog.ir/post/232/|title=ابتكار سبز &gt;&gt; بازگشت از بارسلون و پاسخ به یک ادعا|publisher=Greenebtekar.persianblog.ir|date=|accessdate=2008-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205095706/http://greenebtekar.persianblog.ir/post/232|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 Ebtekar was elected as the President of the 12th International Congress of Immunology. The Congress was held on April 29, 2014. Ebtekar spoke in the opening ceremony and introduced [[Rolf M. Zinkernagel|Rolf Zinkernagel]], the Nobel Laureate for Medicine, as the guest of honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icia.ir|title=کنگره بین المللی ایمونولوژی و آلرژی ایران|website=Icia.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and Governmental career==
In 1981, Ebtekar became the editor-in-chief of the English daily newspaper ''[[Kayhan International]]'', selected by Khatami who was then the representative of Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] in [[Kayhan Institute]]. She served in the newspaper until 1983. In 1991 she co-founded the Institute for Women's Studies and Research. Since 1992, she has been the license holder and managing director of the journal ''Farzaneh Journal for Women's Studies and Research''. Ebtekar was appointed as the Head of Women's NGO Coordinating Office and Vice Head of the National Committee to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Later, she was elected as the President of the Network of Women's NGOs in Iran.

===Early activism and role in the Hostage Crisis===

Ebtekar served as spokesperson for the students in the [[Iran hostage crisis]] of 1979, where [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]] occupied the US Embassy and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Selected because of her good command of English, she made regular appearances on American television as translator and spokesperson for the students, where she presented the official positions of the students. She was referred to as "Mary" by foreign press, and "Tiger Lily" by the hostages, a play on the translation of "Niloufar".&lt;ref name=Sciolino117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Iran |last=Daniel |first=Elton L. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=248 |isbn=0313375100 |edition=2 |year=2012 |series=The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebtekar wrote an account of the embassy takeover with [[Fred A. Reed]] entitled ''Takeover in Tehran: The Inside Story of the 1979 U.S. Embassy Capture''.&lt;ref&gt;Ebtekar, Masoumeh; Reed, Fred A. (2000). ''Takeover in Tehran: The Inside Story of the 1979 U.S. Embassy Capture''. [[Talonbooks]]; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. {{ISBN|0-88922-443-9}}. The [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of this book was published in Tehran by Etellaat Newspaper Publications the same year and the Arabic translation was published in Beirut by Al Hadi Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Western media have systematically depicted Ebtekar's involvement in a negative manner, as Reed describes: "For twenty years the prevailing "globalized" version of the embassy capture has cast the students at best as well-intentioned but naive young people manipulated ...and at worst as irresponsible extremists."&lt;ref&gt;''Takeover in Tehran'', 2001 , Talon Books, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elaine Sciolino]] wrote about Ebtekar's own viewpoint: "Asked by an ''[[ABC News]]'' correspondent one day whether she could see herself picking up a gun and killing the hostages, she replied: 'yes. When I've seen an American gun being lifted up and killing my brothers and sisters in the streets, of course.'"&lt;ref name=Sciolino117&gt;Sciolino,  ''Persian Mirrors'', (2005), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;
She is said to be remembered by many Americans (hostages such as David Roeder, Barbara Timm, the mother of hostage Kevin Hermening and those who watched her on television) with a great lack of fondness, in part because "her familiarity with America added profound emphasis to her rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark, Guests of the Ayatollah , Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006, pp. 162–3&lt;/ref&gt;
When asked by an American interviewer (Elaine Sciolino) in the late 1990s about her past as spokesperson for the hostage-takers, why it did not appear on her resume, and why she had changed her name from Niloufar to Masoumeh, Ebtekar "had no apology and made no excuses" about her role,&lt;ref&gt;"Top Woman in Iran's Government Once Spoke for Hostage-Takers", ''New York Times'', January 28, 1998, p. A6&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hostage taking as "the best direction that could have been taken" by Iran at the time, but surprised the interviewer with her "[[chutzpah]]", insisting that the interviewer "not write much about these things."&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, ''Persian Mirrors'' (2005), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Sciolino published this article in the ''New York Times'' unaware of the fact that Ebtekar's book (Takeover in Tehran) was in print and would be published in 2001.

She held office as the duputy to [[Shahla Habibi]], head of the 'Bureau of Women's Affairs' under administration [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] in the 1990s, and was reportedly the "main driving-force" behind the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=From Postrevolution to the Reforms|title=Veiled Employment: Islamism and the Political Economy of Women's Employment in Iran|series=Contemporary Issues in the Middle East|editors=Roksana Bahramitash, Hadi Salehi Esfahani|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780815651192|pages=113–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 film ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', Ebtekar was portrayed by [[Nikka Far]] and called only "Tehran Mary" in the credits.

===Vice presidency first term (1997–2005)===
[[File:Masoumeh Ebtekar Sebastian Kurz September 2016 (29028967794).jpg|thumb|Ebtekar with Austrian foreign minister [[Sebastian Kurz]] in 2016]]
Ebtekar was the first woman to serve as Vice-President of Iran when the reformists came to power. Along with [[Zahra Shojaei]], she participated in the first cabinet since the Islamic Revolution to include women. She has been described as a leftist in [[Mohammad Khatami]]'s alliance.&lt;ref name=Sciolino116/&gt; Ebtekar headed the Department of Environment for eight years, introducing major structural, organizational and directional changes enabling a re-engineering of the government body. During her tenure environmental awareness and support for civil society activism in this area was enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409402046|title=Women, Power and Politics in 21st Century Iran|date=28 April 2012|work=Routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebtekar's appointment led to the revelation of her past, and in the US questions were raised about whether President Khatami was aware of "how deeply" the hostage-taking and holding, and anger towards its foremost public defender, "affected both the American government and the American people."&lt;ref&gt;"Top Woman in Iran's Government Once Spoke for Hostage-Takers," ''New York Times'', January 28, 1998, p. A6&lt;/ref&gt; Many academics and literary critiques have written and expressed their views on her published memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2419961|title=Takeover in Tehran (Book Review): 675|date=14 July 2018|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=55|issue=3|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, "some ambassadors" in Tehran reportedly stated they would no "longer meet with her" and would "discourage official contract with her office."&lt;ref&gt;"Haven't I seen you somewhere before?", ''New York Times'', Feb. 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs published as the "Grapes of Shahrivar", Ebtekar repeatedly refers to her cordial and official contacts with not only Western Ambassadors, but also many European Ministers and Presidents as well. (chapters 8-16-23-26-30-32-33)

On [[International Women's Day]] in 1998, as vice-president of environmental affairs, she made a speech condemning the [[Taliban treatment of women|oppression of women by the Taliban Movement]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Her performance caused comment by members of the Western [[news media]] in attendance as she herself was wearing a [[chador]], a reminder of compulsory hijab in Iran which many in the West view as a violation of women's rights.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In May 1999, the ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' claimed that she and President [[Mohammad Khatami]] had been in the guest list of the 1999 [[Bilderberg conference]] held in [[Sintra, Portugal]] on June 3–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.wnd.com/1999/05/3702/#zY6vvRJ0AFTtOE3q.99|title=Clinton, pope join Bilderbergers: Secret meeting of global movers, shakers in Portugal|work=[[WorldNetDaily]]|date=26 May 1999|access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allegation was repeatedly denied by Ebtekar citing the fact that President Khatami had taken part in memorial ceremonies for Imam Khomeini on those days (3–6 of June)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/hamnews/1378/780316/siasi.htm#siasi5|title=HAMSHAHRI (Internet Version of Tehran's Persian Daily)|website=Hamshahrionline.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on World Environment Day June 6 he had inaugurated the Provincial Center for Environment Research in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/hamnews/1378/780317/Index.htm|title=HAMSHAHRI (Internet Version of Tehran's Persian Daily)|website=Hamshahrionline.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, Ebtekar was a keynote speaker at the Meeting of Women Leaders on the Environment in [[Helsinki]], sponsored by the Finnish [[Ministry of the Environment (Finland)|Ministry of the Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130217114824/http://valtioneuvosto.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/tiedote/fi.jsp?oid=111872]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2002/03/environment-women-environment-leaders-grapple-with-globalisation/|title=Environment: Women Environment Leaders Grapple with Globalisation|website=Ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2002, Ebtekar participated in the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/documents/summit_docs/aconf199_17_add1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222040255/http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/documents/summit_docs/aconf199_17_add1.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, she chaired the International Conference on Environment, Peace, and the Dialogue Among Civilizations and Cultures, held in Tehran. This event was organized by Ebtekar's Department of the Environment and also by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/download/pdf/sd/ymbvol108num1e.pdf |title=Data |website=Iisd.ca |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice presidency second term (2013–2017)===
Ebtekar served as Vice President and Head of the [[Department of Environment]] during the first term of [[President Rouhani]], 2013-2017.&lt;ref name="انتخاب 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=انتخاب | first=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی | title=شمخانی دبیر شورای عالی امنیت ملی شد، ابتکار رییس سازمان محیط زیست | website=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی انتخاب &amp;#124; Entekhab.ir | date=2013-09-10 | url=http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/128365 | language=fa | access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in spite of immense challenges facing Iran's environment, and irrespective of the fierce opposition of rival political and special interests groups, great strides were taken to enhance environmental governance and stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82453374|title=President Rouhani urges protecting environment|website=Irna.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve environmental bills, a strong chapter in the sixth National Development Plan and numerous directives and guidelines were implemented during this period, while national plans to enhance air quality were promoted through strong cross-sectoral, management leading to better air quality trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lobelog.com/irans-struggle-with-air-pollution/|title=Iran’s Struggle with Air Pollution|date=7 March 2016|website=Lobelog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national Low Carbon Economy Strategy was adopted; the Cabinet adopted its INDC and the Paris Agreement, which the Parliament also adopted. This led to important strides in renewable energy including more than 500 mw of new solar plants and much more underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/iran-submits-its-climate-action-plan-ahead-of-2015-paris-agreement/|title=UNFCCC|website=Newsroom.unfccc.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration of wetlands according to ecosystem management schemes and local community participation was undertaken leading to revival of Houralazim wetland, designation of Hamoun as a Biosphere reserve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/300238/UNESCO-registers-Lake-Hamoun-as-biosphere-reserve|title=UNESCO registers Lake Hamoun as biosphere reserve|date=3 April 2016|website=Tehrantimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improvement of conditions in Urmia Lake and many other wetlands across Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hamounbiospherereserve.ir/en/news.php?rid=56 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502114151/http://hamounbiospherereserve.ir/en/news.php?rid=56 |archive-date=2017-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major campaign to enhance environment education, inclusion of 56 cases of environment related text and publication of the first textbook "Humans and the Environment" are some of the steps taken in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.ir/news/92100804365/%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%DB%8C%D8%B7-%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%88-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88-%D8%A8%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C|title=ورود "حقوق شهروندی"، "محیط زیست" و "نانو" به کتب درسی|date=29 December 2013|website=Isna.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post vice presidential activism===
Ebtekar co-founded the Center for Peace and Environment in 2005, a non-governmental organization devoted to the promotion of just and sustainable peace and the protection of the environment. More than 120 experts and academicians are currently members of the Center.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Ebtekar served as a moderator in June 2008 at the International "Women, Equality and Peace" Conference held in Oslo, Norway. The conference was sponsored by the Foundation for [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]], [[Club de Madrid]] and [[the Oslo Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.farzanehjournal.com/index.php/articles/no-14/19-no-14-2-report-of-the-international-workshop-on-sharing-experiences-women-equality-and-peace|title=HugeDomains.com - FarZaneHJournal.COM is for sale (Far Zane H Journal)|website=En.farzanehjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebtekar considered for running in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] after [[Guardian Council]] indicated that there is no "legal restraint" against women doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=192200 Ebtekar does not rule out presidential candidacy. ''tehran times'', April 14, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she withdrew a few weeks before the election.

Ebtekar published her memoir as the first female Vice President of Iran, entitled the ''Grapes of Shahrivar'' on May 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=greenebtekar291&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebtekar |first=Masoumeh |date=May 3, 2009 |url=http://greenebtekar.persianblog.ir/post/291 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602024151/http://greenebtekar.persianblog.ir/post/291 |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |title=Memoirs |work=Green Ebtekar}} Published by Etelleat Newspaper Publishing House, the memoirs refer to the events of the reforms period in Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also published a collection of her essays and speeches on the environment and sustainable development, called ''Natural Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;published in 2005 by the Iranian Department of Environment. These speeches include titles such as Human Rights and Challenges of the Century, Perspectives on Sustainable Development and the Role of the Woman in Iranian Society, etc. She also had two articles from ''Natural Peace'' published in [http://www.ourplanet.com/imgversn/154/ebtekar.html ''Our Planet''], the Magazine of the United Nations Environment Program (in 2005), and ''Market Messengers'' (in 2006). www.unep.org&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving her government position in 2005, Ebtekar has spoken as inaugural or keynote speaker at many international events.

===Membership in Tehran City Council===
Ebtekar ran for and was elected to the [[City Council of Tehran|city council of Tehran]] for the term beginning in 2007, coming in 9th out of 21 candidates, just after [[Parvin Ahmadinejad]], the sister of the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061218/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iran_elections|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227004151/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061218/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iran_elections|title=Local vote embarrassing Iran president|archivedate=27 December 2006|website=Web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She established and heads the Tehran City Council Environment Committee and currently runs 20 working groups on environmental issues.

After election to the City Council of Tehran in early 2007, Ebtekar began a weblog in Persian entitled "''EbtekareSabz''" under the free blog service Persianblog. In her blog she wrote 430 posts in environmental, political, social and women's issues, posted over 10,000 comments, the blog had one million viewers in 3.5 years. ''EbtekareSabz'', which criticized the policies of the government and supported the reformist movement in Iran, was filtered by the Government once in early 2010 and again in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcaa6n6u49nw61.k5k4.html|title=وبلاگ معصومه ابتکار فیلتر شد|website=Aftabnews.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally obstructed with a judicial verdict in August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mardomak.org/n.ews/masoome_ebtekar_has_been_filtered] {{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the "right to freedom of expression in our constitution" as her incentive, she continued blogging by setting up a new blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenebtekar2.blogspot.com|title=ابتکار سبز|website=Greenebtekar2.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' described her as "informally represent[ing] the views of many of the former hostage-takers", supporting "engagement with the West" and a renewal of the "original ideals of the revolution, including justice and freedom," which many of her peers believe have been abandoned by the current regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/middleeast/04hostages.html|title=In Iran, From Heroes to State Enemies|date=4 November 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Ebtekar signed up as a candidate for Tehran in the [[Iranian local elections, 2013|2013 local elections]], along with hundreds of reformist candidates. During the vetting process that is conducted by government and Majlis representatives, the majority of candidates, including Ebtekar were disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/iran-city-council-elections.html|title=Why Iran's City Council Elections Matter|work=Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebtekar mentioned her harsh criticism of government policies leading to air pollution and the deterioration of environmental standards as the main reason for her disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/273251|title=معصومه ابتکار: به خاطر پارازیت و آلودگی هوا ردصلاحیت شدم|first=عصر|last=ايران|website=عصر ايران}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates who have objected to their disqualification will be considered for a final round in the Supreme Council for Election Regulation. She was also one of Reformists' candidates as [[Mayor of Tehran]]. However, [[Mohsen Hashemi]] becomes the final's nominate.

===Reappointment as Vice President===
After [[Hassan Rouhani]] [[Iranian presidential election, 2013|elected]] as [[President of Iran]], Ebtekar who supported Rouhani openly, was one of the candidates for the [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Science]]. However, she was appointed as Head of Environmental Protection Organization on 10 September 2013, a position she had formerly served for eight years under [[Mohammad Khatami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/344270/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%AA%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A6%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B8%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AD%DB%8C%D8%B7-%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D8%AF|title="معصومه ابتکار" رئیس سازمان حفاظت محیط زیست شد|website=Tabnak.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2017, Ebtekar announced that she will be leave her current position after the end of the [[Government of Hassan Rouhani (2013–present)|first Rouhani government]]. She is set to appoint as Women Affairs's Vice President.

==Books==
In 2010 Ebtekar contributed to ''Moral Ground'' a testimony of over eighty visionaries—theologians and religious leaders, scientists, elected officials, business leaders, naturalists, activists, and writers—to present a diverse and compelling call to honor our individual and collective moral responsibility to our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moralground.com/about/|title=Book – Moral Ground|website=Moralground.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay entitled "Peace and Sustainability Depend on the Spiritual and the Feminine" Ebtekar provides her views on the interrelated nature of peace and sustainable development. She also took part in a project to develop a book entitled ''Women, Power and Politics in 21st Century Iran''. The book, published in 2012 by Ashgate, provides an objective perspective on the conditions of women in Iran. Chapter 10 titled "Women and the Environment" has been authored by Massoumeh Ebtekar. In 2011 Ebtekar also co-authored a chapter in the book ''Stem Cells and Cancer Stem Cells'' published by Springer. Chapter 3 "Characteristics of Cord Blood Cells" is a review performed by a team of researchers in Iran.

[[File:Maximlian de Chaudoir.jpg|thumb|Maximilien, baron de Chaudoir (1816–1881)]]
'''Maximilien Chaudoir''', or '''Maximilien, baron de Chaudoir''', (12 September 1816, [[Ivnitsa]], near [[Zhitomir]] – 6 May 1881, [[Amélie-les-Bains]]) was a [[Russia|Russian]] [[entomology|entomologist]]. He was a specialist in [[Beetle|Coleoptera]] and in particular the [[Ground beetle|Carabidae]]. His [[Cicindelidae]] are conserved by the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]] in Paris. His Carabidae were acquired by [[Charles Oberthür]] (1845-1924), then given to the same museum. He wrote ''Mémoire sur la famille des Carabiques'', 6 volumes commencing 1848.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">The '''Mierscheid law''' is {{Citation needed span|text=a satirical forecast|date=September 2011}} [[hypothesis]], published in the German magazine ''[[Vorwärts]]'' on 14 July 1983 and attributed to the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]]. It forecasts the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD)'s share of the [[Direct election|popular vote]] based on the size of crude steel production in Western Germany:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |title=19 Jahre Mierscheid-Gesetz – ein ungerades Jubiläum und die Aussichten der SPD bei der Bundestagswahl (19 Years of the Mierscheid Law   an odd numbered anniversary and the chances of the SPD in the national parliamentary elections) |accessdate=2007-05-26 |author=Jakob Mierscheid, Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages |authorlink=Jakob Maria Mierscheid |date=2002-03-20 |format=pdf |publisher=German Parliament,  Platz der Republik, 11011 Berlin |language=German |quote=Die Formulierung des Mierscheid-Gesetzes selber lautet: "Der Stimmenanteil der SPD richtet sich nach dem Index der deutschen Rohstahlproduktion – gemessen in Mio. Tonnen – im jeweiligen Jahr der Bundestagswahl." (The formulation of the Mierscheid Law is as follows: The proportion of votes for the SPD depends on the index of German crude steel production measured in millions of metric tons in the corresponding year.) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707200224/http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Vote share of the SPD equals the Index of the crude steel production in the western federal states – measured in millions of tonnes – in the year of the federal election.}}

There is a special rule for early elections. One then has to take the arithmetic mean of the regular and early year of election.

The last corroboration of the law was in the 2002 election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,362874,00.html | title = Warum die SPD die Wahl gewinnt (Why the SPD will win the election) | accessdate = 2007-01-11
| author = Yassin Musharbash| date = 2005-06-29| work = Spiegel Online| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the West German crude steel production was 38.6 million tonnes, and the vote share of the SPD 38.5%. For the early election in 2005 the vote share was 38.4%, with a mean crude steel value of 40.0 million tonnes.  Over the last ten elections, the two values were within two units nine times, and within one unit seven times.

==Possible refutation of the hypothesis in 2005==

In the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal elections]] of 18 September 2005 (which were originally due to be held in 2006), the law appeared not to hold, since the SPD obtained 34.3% of the relevant votes while the crude steel production of the "old" ''Länder'' (i.e. those states that belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification) in the previous year was 39.9 million [[tonnes]].

However, an article attributed to Jakob Mierscheid, published on the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament's]] website provided a correction to the hypothesis, to take account of the special situation. Since the elections had been brought forward, it was argued that the last months of the year should be discounted, yielding a steel production figure of 33.5 million tonnes. The graph included in the article showed a good match, thus supporting the (corrected) hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| title = Vorläufige Hypothese zum Mierscheid-Gesetz (Preliminary hypothesis on the Mierscheid Law)| accessdate = 2007-01-11| author = The legendary Jakob Mierscheid, MdB| authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid| date = 2005-12-13| format = pdf| work = | publisher = Official Web site of the German Bundestag| language = German| quote = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012233/http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| archivedate = 2008-09-11| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis alteration might be considered an example of the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]].

Following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 elections]], an article was published by the statistical office of the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] attempting to further refine the model in the form of the Mierscheid-Walla law. This article also mentions promising but inconclusive attempts to replace steel production with other measures that exhibited a degree of apparent [[correlation]], such as the export value of automobiles, employment levels in the field of legal advice, the price of coffee, and the number of accidents on town roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | title = Das Mierscheid-Walla-Gesetz (The Mierscheid-Walla Law) | accessdate = 2007-01-11 | author = Jakob Maria Mierscheid (the legend) | authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid | author2 = Wolfgang Walla | date = March 2006 | format = pdf | work = Statistisches Monatsheft Baden-Württemberg 3/2006 | publisher = Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (Statistical offices of the German federal government and the states) | language = German | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012231/http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miraculin''' is a [[:Category:Taste modifiers|taste modifier]], a [[glycoprotein]] extracted from the fruit of ''[[Synsepalum dulcificum]]''.&lt;ref name="jbc-263-23-11536"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theerasilp S, Kurihara Y | title = Complete purification and characterization of the taste-modifying protein, miraculin, from miracle fruit | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 263 | issue = 23 | pages = 11536–9 | date = August 1988 | pmid = 3403544 | doi =  | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/263/23/11536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The berry, also known as the miracle fruit, was documented by explorer [[Chevalier des Marchais]], who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa.

Miraculin itself is not [[sweet]]. After the taste buds are exposed to miraculin (which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue), acidic foods that are ordinarily sour (such as [[citrus]]) are perceived as sweet.&lt;ref name=jbc-263-23-11536/&gt;&lt;ref name="acid"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanematsu K, Kitagawa M, Yoshida R, Nirasawa S, Shigemura N, Ninomiya Y | title = Intracellular acidification is required for full activation of the sweet taste receptor by miraculin | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 22807 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26960429 | pmc = 4785348 | doi = 10.1038/srep22807 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...622807S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect lasts up to about an hour.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;&lt;ref name="SwamyHadi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swamy KB, Hadi SA, Sekaran M, Pichika MR | title = The clinical effects of Synsepalum dulcificum: a review | journal = Journal of Medicinal Food | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 1165–9 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25314134 | doi = 10.1089/jmf.2013.3084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The active substance was named miraculin after its [[extract|extraction]] was published in 1968.&lt;ref name="pmid5673432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurihara K, Beidler LM | title = Taste-modifying protein from miracle fruit | journal = Science | volume = 161 | issue = 3847 | pages = 1241–3 | date = September 1968 | pmid = 5673432 | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3847.1241 | bibcode = 1968Sci...161.1241K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glycoprotein structure ==

Miraculin was first sequenced in 1989 and was found to be a [[glycoprotein]] consisting of 191 [[amino acid]]s and some [[carbohydrate]] chains.&lt;ref name="pmid2708331"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theerasilp S, Hitotsuya H, Nakajo S, Nakaya K, Nakamura Y, Kurihara Y | title = Complete amino acid sequence and structure characterization of the taste-modifying protein, miraculin | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 12 | pages = 6655–9 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2708331 | doi =  | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/264/12/6655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miraculin occurs as a [[tetramer]] (98.4 kDa), a combination of 4 [[monomer]]s group by dimer. Within each dimer 2 miraculin glycoproteins are linked by a [[disulfide]] bridge.&lt;ref name="crfsn-32-231"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurihara Y | title = Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–52 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1418601 | doi = 10.1080/10408399209527598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The molecular weight of the glycoprotein is 24.6 kDa including 3.4 kDa (13.9% of the weight) of sugar constituted (on molar ratio) of [[glucosamine]] (31%), [[mannose]] (30%), [[fucose]] (22%), [[xylose]] (10%) and [[galactose]] (7%).&lt;ref name="jbc-263-23-11536"/&gt;

The taste-modifying protein, miraculin, has seven cystein residues in a molecule composed of 191 amino acid residues.  Both tetramer miraculin and native dimer miraculin in its crude state have the taste-modifying activity of turning sour tastes into sweet tastes.&lt;ref name="pmid1911854"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Igeta H, Tamura Y, Nakaya K, Nakamura Y, Kurihara Y | title = Determination of disulfide array and subunit structure of taste-modifying protein, miraculin | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1079 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–7 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1911854 | doi = 10.1016/0167-4838(91)90073-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweetness properties ==

Miraculin, unlike [[curculin]] (another taste-modifying agent),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurimoto E, Suzuki M, Amemiya E, Yamaguchi Y, Nirasawa S, Shimba N, Xu N, Kashiwagi T, Kawai M, Suzuki E, Kato K | title = Curculin exhibits sweet-tasting and taste-modifying activities through its distinct molecular surfaces | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 46 | pages = 33252–6 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17895249 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C700174200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is not sweet by itself, but it can change the perception of sourness to sweetness, even for a long period after consumption.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koizumi A, Tsuchiya A, Nakajima K, Ito K, Terada T, Shimizu-Ibuka A, Briand L, Asakura T, Misaka T, Abe K | title = Human sweet taste receptor mediates acid-induced sweetness of miraculin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 40 | pages = 16819–24 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21949380 | pmc = 3189030 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1016644108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10816819K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration and intensity of the sweetness-modifying effect depends on various factors, such as miraculin concentration, duration of contact of the miraculin with the tongue, and acid concentration.&lt;ref name=acid/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; Maximum sweet-induced response has been shown to be equivalent to the sweetness of 17% sucrose solution.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Glycoprotein]] is also sensitive to heat. When heated over 100&amp;nbsp;°C, miraculin loses its taste-modifying property. Miraculin activity is inactivated at pH below 3 and pH above 12 at room temperature.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;

Although the detailed mechanism of the taste-inducing behavior is unknown, it appears the sweet receptors are activated by acids which are related to sourness, an effect remaining until the [[taste bud]]s perceive a neutral pH.&lt;ref name=acid/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; Sweeteners are perceived by the human sweet taste receptor, hT1R2-hT1R3, which belongs to [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s,&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; modified by the two [[histidine]] residues (i.e. His30 and His60) which participate in the taste-modifying behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid17592723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ito K, Asakura T, Morita Y, Nakajima K, Koizumi A, Shimizu-Ibuka A, Masuda K, Ishiguro M, Terada T, Maruyama J, Kitamoto K, Misaka T, Abe K | title = Microbial production of sensory-active miraculin | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 360 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–11 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17592723 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One site maintains the attachment of the protein to the membranes while the other (with attached [[xylose]] or [[arabinose]]) activates the sweet receptor membrane in acid solutions.&lt;ref name="crfsn-32-231"/&gt;

== As a sweetener ==

As miraculin is a readily soluble protein and relatively heat stable, it is a potential [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]] in acidic food (e.g. soft drinks). While attempts to express it in [[yeast]] and [[tobacco plant]]s have failed, researchers have succeeded in preparing [[genetically modified]] ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria,&lt;ref name="pmid19122203"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuyama T, Satoh M, Nakata R, Aoyama T, Inoue H | title = Functional expression of miraculin, a taste-modifying protein in Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 445–50 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19122203 | doi = 10.1093/jb/mvn184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lettuce]]&lt;ref name="pmid16406368"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun HJ, Cui ML, Ma B, Ezura H | title = Functional expression of the taste-modifying protein, miraculin, in transgenic lettuce | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 580 | issue = 2 | pages = 620–6 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16406368 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2005.12.080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tomato]]es&lt;ref name="jf101874b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kato K, Yoshida R, Kikuzaki A, Hirai T, Kuroda H, Hiwasa-Tanase K, Takane K, Ezura H, Mizoguchi T | title = Molecular breeding of tomato lines for mass production of miraculin in a plant factory | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = 17 | pages = 9505–10 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20695489 | doi = 10.1021/jf101874b }}&lt;/ref&gt; that express miraculin. The scientists' crops resulted in 40 [[microgram]]s of miraculin per [[gram]] of lettuce leaves, with two grams of lettuce leaves producing roughly the same amount of miraculin as in one miracle fruit berry.&lt;ref name=wallstreetlemons&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna

The use of miraculin as a food additive was forbidden in 1974 by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], in circumstances that have been interpreted as suggesting influence by competing commercial interests.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gollner&gt;{{cite book | first = Adam Leith | last = Gollner | title = The Fruit Hunters: A Story of Nature, Adventure, Commerce and Obsession | isbn = 978-0385662680 | publisher = [[Anchor Canada]] | date = 31 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, The FDA has imposed a ban on importing ''Synsepalum dulcificum'' (specifying 'miraculin') from its origin in [[Taiwan]], declaring it as an "illegal undeclared sweetener".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Synsepalum dulcificum'' Import Alert 45-07; Taiwan|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_120.html|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=9 February 2018|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this ban does not apply to fresh and freeze-dried miracle fruit, the fresh or normally-frozen berry deteriorates rapidly.

[[File:Ocreae of a Persicaria maculosa 2006-aug-10 Gothenburg Sweden.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ochrea on a [[Persicaria maculosa|redshank]] stem]]

An '''ochrea''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''ocrea'', [[greave]] or protective legging), also spelled '''ocrea''', is a plant structure formed of [[stipule]]s fused into a sheath surrounding the stem, and is typically found in the [[Polygonaceae]]. 

In [[Arecaceae|palms]] it denotes an extension of the leaf sheath beyond the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] insertion.

In [[observational astronomy]] an '''On-The-Fly Calibration''' (OTFC) system calibrates data when a user's request for the data is processed so that users can obtain data that are calibrated with up-to-date calibration files, parameters, and software. 

==History of OTFC==
The OTFC processing system was developed at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) and the [[Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility]]  (ST-ECF) and is implemented at both sites and at [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI). The OTFC system currently provides data calibration for the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] (WFPC2) and [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS). In the future, the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] (ACS) and possibly the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) will be supported.

==Goals of the system==
The main goals behind the implementation of the OTFC system are to take advantage of better calibration files and the much smaller storage area required if only raw files are kept in the archives. The system can also offer more calibration steps than were available when the data was first released and can implement improved pipeline software. 

Currently, for example, HST data are calibrated as they are received at the STScI. Raw and calibrated data are stored in the HST archive (DADS). Frequently, users must recalibrate the data at their home sites to take advantage of better calibration files or software. A large fraction (over 90%) of the calibrated data in the HST archive could be improved by recalibration, although the improvements are not always significant. In the past, instruments that undergo evolution of calibration files or calibration software often required users to carry out their own recalibrations at their home sites. With OTFC, the HST data archives carry out the recalibration.

'''PERDaix (Proton Electron Radiation Detector Aix-la-Chapelle)''' is a novel, small and light weight [[magnetic spectrometer]] to measure the charge and mass dependent solar modulation periodically for deeper understanding of [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srl.utu.fi/AuxDOC/kocharov/ICRC2009/pdf/icrc1025.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
For a better understanding of sources and acceleration of cosmic particles direct measurements of cosmic rays are necessary. Also for a better understanding of the solar modulation which is expected to follow the 22-year [[solar cycle]], time dependent measurements are needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srl.utu.fi/AuxDOC/kocharov/ICRC2009/pdf/icrc0338.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
PERDaix is a newly designed detector which is constructed by the Department of Physics 1b, [[RWTH Aachen University]]. Being proposed to the [[German Space Agency]] in November 2009 for a participation in the [[Rexus and Bexus|BEXUS]] Program (Rocket and Balloon Experiments for University Students) after a first canceled flight attempt in October 2010 the actual flight took place as a post-BEXUS-campaign flight opportunity in November 2010.

The detector is able to measure charged particles in the energy range of 0.5 [[GeV]] to 5 GeV. PERDaix uses a time of flight system, a scintillating fiber tracker with [[silicon photomultiplier]]  (SiPM) readout, and a [[transition radiation detector]] in combination with a [[permanent magnet]] to measure particle fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srl.utu.fi/AuxDOC/kocharov/ICRC2009/pdf/icrc0459.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The BEXUS [[High altitude balloon|balloons]] are launched at [[Esrange|Esrange Space Center]] near [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. In November 2010 PERDaix reached a top altitude of 33.3 km at which it kept floating for 1.5 hours.

== Sub-detectors ==
=== Time of flight system ===
The [[Time-of-flight|time of flight system]] (TOF) is the upper- and lowermost layer of the detector. It consists of [[scintillator]]s with an SiPM  readout. It is used as a trigger signal and to discriminate against particles entering the detector from below. With a design time resolution of approximately 300 [[picosecond]]s (ps) it can be used to distinguish between [[positron]]s and [[electron]]s in the momentum range below 1 GeV. [[Proton]]s can be distinguished from positrons for momenta below 1 GeV if their velocity is lower than β = 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srl.utu.fi/AuxDOC/kocharov/ICRC2009/pdf/icrc1099.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracker ===
Perdaix will make use of a [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillating]] fiber tracking detector made up from 250&amp;nbsp;µm thin scintillating polystyrene fibers that emit light when traversed by a charged particle. The scintillating fibers are read out by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays which are structured semi-conductor photon detectors that offer high photon efficiencies of 50%, a high gain of 10^6 electrons / photon and that are very compact in size. One silicon photomultiplier array is 1.1mm by 8.0mm in size and has 32 channels. Twenty 32mm wide and 300mm long fiber modules are arranged in four layers around a hollow cylindrical permanent magnet array.
=== Magnet ===
The permanent magnet array is constructed as a [[Halbach array|Halbach-Ring]] and weighs 8&amp;nbsp;kg and produces a very high magnetic field of ~0.26 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] (T) inside an 80mm high and 213mm diameter magnet cylinder while producing only a negligible magnetic field outside the cylinder.

=== Transition radiation detector ===
Underneath the lowest tracker layer a [[transition radiation]] detector (TRD) is installed. The TRD detects transition radiation of [[relativistic particle]]s with a [[Lorentz factor]] γ exceeding ≈ 1000.
Particles crossing the interface of two media with different [[dielectric constant]] produce transition radiation. The energy loss at a boundary is proportional to the relativistic [[gamma factor]]. A significant amount of TR is produced for a gamma greater than 1000. The gamma factor of protons is, up to a momentum of 5GeV, still in the order of 10, whereas the positron's gamma is greater than 1000, starting at 0.5GeV momentum.

The detector is made up of 256 6mm thick straw tubes out of a 72&amp;nbsp;um thin multilayer [[aluminium]]-[[kapton]] foil, filled with an 80/20 mixture of [[xenon]] (Xe) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2). It is used to measure the x-ray transition radiation produced by electrons in eight 20mm thick layers of an irregular fleece radiator. This leads to more than 100 material interfaces per radiator layer.

== Launch in November 2010 ==
Due to strong winds the launch campaign in October 2010 had to be canceled without a BEXUS-11 flight at first. Thanks to the support of German Space Agency ([[German_Aerospace_Center|DLR]]) and [[Esrange]] a second flight opportunity was provided in late November 2010. On 23 November a 100 000 m³ helium balloon was launched from Esrange carrying a payload of 334 kg containing the BEXUS student experiments including the PERDaix detector.

'''Personality''' is defined as the characteristic set of [[behavior]]s, [[cognition]]s, and [[emotion]]al patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corr|first1=Philip J.|last2=Matthews|first2=Gerald|title=The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=978-0-521-86218-9|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadock|first1=Benjamin|last2=Sadock|first2=Virginia|last3=Ruiz|first3=Pedro|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9781451100471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by [[Raymond Cattell]] define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally based approaches define personality through learning and habits.  Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The study of the psychology of personality, called [[personality psychology]], attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior.  Many approaches have been taken on to study personality, including biological, cognitive, learning and trait based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches.  Personality psychology is divided among the first theorists, with a few influential theories being posited by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Gordon Allport]], [[Hans Eysenck]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]].

==Measuring==
Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. However, dimensions of personality and scales of personality tests vary and often are poorly defined. Examples of such tests are the: [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Inventory]] (BFI), [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI-2), [[Rorschach test|Rorschach Inkblot test]], [[Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span lang="PL"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.archivespp.pl/uploads/images/2009_11_1/21_p_Archives_1_09.pdf|vauthors=Aleksandrowicz JW, Klasa K, Sobański JA, Stolarska D|title=KON-2006 Neurotic Personality Questionnaire|journal=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy|year=2009|volume=1|pages=21–2}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]] test, or [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck's]] Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R).

==Five-factor model==
Personality is often broken into statistically-identified factors called the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]], which are [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]] (or emotional stability). These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Briley2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Briley, D. A., Tucker-Drob, E. M.|year=2014|title= Genetic and environmental continuity in personality development: A meta-analysis|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1303–31|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263324524_Genetic_and_Environmental_Continuity_in_Personality_Development_A_Meta-Analysis|doi=10.1037/a0037091|pmid=24956122|pmc=4152379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion seen in adults can also be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality.&lt;ref name="Holder &amp; Klassen"&gt;Holder &amp; Klassen 2010, p. 419–439.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas McCrae and Costa's Big Five model assesses personality traits in adults, the EAS (emotionality, activity, and sociability) model is used to assess temperament in children. This model measures levels of emotionality, activity, sociability, and shyness in children. The personality theorists consider temperament EAS model similar to the Big Five model in adults; however, this might be due to a conflation of concepts of personality and temperament as described above. Findings show that high degrees of sociability and low degrees of shyness are equivalent to adult extraversion, and correlate with higher levels of [[life satisfaction]] in children.

Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan"&gt;Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan, p. 290-303.&lt;/ref&gt; This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts' experience of positive affect increased&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt; whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. [[Ego depletion]], or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt;

One question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"&gt;Lucas &amp; Baird 2004, p. 473-485.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extraverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird" /&gt; found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect. 	

Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators. Self-efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al"&gt;Strobel, Tumasjan, &amp; Sporrle, p. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; However, the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness is only partially mediated by self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. Another such factor may be self-esteem. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion.&lt;ref&gt;Joshanloo &amp; Afshari 2009, p. 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood maintenance, the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation (meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals), has been found to be a stronger force in extraverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid"&gt;Lischetzke &amp; Eid 2006, p. 1127-1162.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. Another implication of this finding is that extraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid" /&gt;

==Developmental biological model==

Modern conceptions of personality, such as the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]] have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning.  The four temperaments, ''harm avoidance'', ''reward dependence'', ''novelty seeking'' and ''persistence'' are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories.  While factor based approaches to personality have yielded models that account for significant variance, the developmental biological model has been argued to better reflect underlying biological processes.  Distinct genetic, neurochemical and neuroanatomical correlates responsible for each temperamental trait have been observed, unlike with five factor models.

The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations.  Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity.  Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum, and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain.  Reward dependence has been linked with the [[oxytocin]] system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin related regions of the [[hypothalamus]].  Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-[[mPFC]] connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B|first1=Sadock|last2=V|first2=Sadock|last3=P|first3=Ruiz|editor1-last=Cloninger|editor1-first=R|editor2-last=Svrakic|editor2-first=D|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolter Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|chapter=Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental influences ==
It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed.&lt;ref name="Briley2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jeronimus, B. F., Riese, H., Sanderman, R., Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/107/4/751|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;

One study that has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's [[Strange situation|Strange Situation]] experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labelled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and Their Development|last=Kail|first=Robert|last2=Barnfield|first2=Anne|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=9780205993024|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Rich Harris]]'s group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental style or home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Judith Rich|date=1995|title=Where is the child's environment? A group socialization theory of development.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.102.3.458|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=3|pages=458–489|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.458|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessuya Kawamoto's ''Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security'' talked about laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality on and life experiences. The assessments suggested that "the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security".&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto, Tetsuya. "Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security." Japanese Psychological Research, vol. 58, no. 2, Apr. 2016, pp. 218-231. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/jpr.12110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural studies==
There has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross-culture study. On the other hand, others believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of "the Big Five".&lt;ref&gt;[[David C. Funder|Funder, D.C.]], (2001). Personality. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2001. 52:197–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological bases of human personality.&lt;ref&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Allik, I. U. (2002). The five-factor model of personality across cultures. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; If personality traits are unique to individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa Jr, P. T. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American psychologist, 52(5), 509.&lt;/ref&gt; When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"&gt;Schmitt, D. P., Allik, J., McCrae, R. R., &amp; Benet-Martínez, V. (2007). The geographic distribution of Big Five personality traits: Patterns and profiles of human self-description across 56 nations. Journal of cross-cultural psychology, 38(2), 173-212.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt; For example, the term "feeling blue" is used to describe sadness in more Westernized cultures, but does not translate to other languages.  Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"/&gt;  Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"&gt;Church, A. T. (2000). Culture and personality: Toward an integrated cultural trait psychology. Journal of Personality, 68(4), 651-703.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"/&gt; Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

==Historical development of concept==
The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the [[Renaissance]], an essential element in [[modernity]]. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of [[self]] was linked to a network of social roles: "the [[Medieval household|household]], the [[Kinship|kinship network]], the [[guild]], the [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporation]] – these were the building blocks of personhood", [[Stephen Greenblatt]] observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of [[Lucretius]]' poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'': "at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:3, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; "Dependent on the [[family]], the individual alone was nothing," Jacques Gélis observes.&lt;ref&gt;Gélis, "The Child: from anonymity to individuality", in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, ''A History of Private Life III: Passions of the Renaissance'' 1989:309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperament and philosophy==
[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|William James (1842-1910)]]
[[William James]] (1842-1910) argued that '''temperament''' explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers. Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether a philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and Other Essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental make-up ===
James argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia,  but focused on philosophy in his 1907 lectures on ''[[Pragmatism]]''. In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and may be possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp.  The "mental make-up" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as "tender-minded" and "going by "principles," and that of empiricist philosophers is described as "tough-minded" and "going by "facts." James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James' purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy, and is not exhaustive.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt;
		
===Empiricists and rationalists===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|John Locke (1632–1704)]]
According to James, the ''temperament'' of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers differed fundamentally from the ''temperament'' of [[empiricism|empiricist]] philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward ''refinement'' and ''superficiality'' never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of ''closed systems'', and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationalism is regarded as ''pretension'', and a temperament most inclined to ''abstraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperament of rationalists, according to James, led to sticking with logic.

[[empiricism|Empiricists]], on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist [[John Locke|John Locke's]]  (1632–1704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person, is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it "always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains constant in different places at different times. Thus his explanation of personal identity is in terms of experience as James indeed maintained is the case for most empiricists.
[[File:Benedictus (Baruch) Spinoza (anoniem schilderij, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag), Bestanddeelnr 935-0843.jpg|thumb|Benedictus Spinoza (1632–1677)]]
Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, [[Rene Descartes]]  (1596–1650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person "for fear of making brutes thinking things too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor [[David Hume]]  (1711–1776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt; However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus [[David Hume|An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding]] because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding|date=1955|publisher=Liberal Arts Press Inc|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]] himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Descartes|first1=Rene|title=Meditations on the First Philosophy|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalist philosopher [[Spinoza|Benedictus Spinoza]] (1632–1677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the "ideas of the modifications of body," in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=241|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=253|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza equates the will with the understanding, and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as error which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=256|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

The [[biological basis of personality]] is the theory that anatomical structures located in the [[brain]] contribute to personality traits. This stems from [[neuropsychology]], which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in [[human|human beings]], the [[frontal lobe]]s are responsible for foresight and anticipation, and the [[occipital lobe]]s are responsible for processing visual information. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality. For example, the [[hormone]] [[testosterone]] is important for sociability, affectivity, [[aggression|aggressiveness]], and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Funder|first=David|title=PERSONALITY|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=February 2001|volume=52|issue=1|pages=197–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeYoung|first=Colin G.|title=Testing Predictions From Personality Neuroscience: Brain Structures and the Big Five|journal=Psychological Science|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=6|pages=820–828|doi=10.1177/0956797610370159|pmid=20435951|pmc=3049165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a confusion among some psychologists who conflate personality with temperament. Temperament traits that are based on weak neurochemical imbalances within neurotransmitter systems are much more stable, consistent in behavior and show up in early childhood; they can't be changed easily but can be compensated for in behavior. In contrast to that, personality traits and features are the product of the socio-cultural development of humans and can be learned and/or changed.

== Personology ==
Personology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. From a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but in the same time through all its components, levels and spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.A. (1938). Explorations in Personality. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strack, S. (2005). Handbook of Personology and Psychopathology. Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychiatry==
High neuroticism is an independent prospective predictor for the development of the common mental disorders.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormel2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ormel J.|author2=Jeronimus, B.F.|author3=Kotov, M.|author4=Riese, H.|author5=Bos, E.H.|author6=Hankin, B. | year = 2013 | title = Neuroticism and common mental disorders: Meaning and utility of a complex relationship | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–697 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735813000664 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.003 | pmid=23702592 | pmc=4382368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">'''Primary consciousness''' is a term the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] coined to describe the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of [[consciousness]] is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[secondary consciousness|higher order consciousness]] can be described as being "conscious of being conscious"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future.

Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal [[awareness]] and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of [[attention]], whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.&lt;ref name = Johanson&gt;Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., &amp; Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsy &amp; Behavior'', 4(3), 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
One prominent [[theory]] for the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions:
# The laws of [[physics]] apply to [[consciousness]], which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely [[physiology|physiological]] model of consciousness.
# Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] perspective.
# There is no such thing as a "[[qualia]]-free" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness.&lt;ref name = Edelmantheory/&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during [[evolution]] helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt; This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's ''current'' perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of ''conceptual'' memory to a set of ''ongoing'' perceptual categorizations—a "remembered present".&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

==Neurophysiological basis==
Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:&lt;ref name = SethND&gt;Seth, A. K., &amp; Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 14(1), 140–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Waking consciousness is associated with low [[amplitude]], irregular [[EEG]] activity in the 20–70&amp;nbsp;Hz range.
#* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, [[coma]], [[general anesthesia]], and [[epilepsy|epileptic states]] of absence show a predominance of low [[frequency]], high-[[amplitude]] and more regular [[voltage]]s at less than 4Hz.
#Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists.
#* Damage to the [[brainstem]] or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as [[color vision]], visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like.
#Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content.
#*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the [[sensory cortex]] to [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[temporal lobe|medial-temporal]] cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

==Measurement==
To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 15(2), 358–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures&gt;Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 17(3), 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain defining theories are included below:

'''Worldly discrimination theory''' asserts that any mental state that is manifested in [[behavior]] is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior.
'''Signal detection theory''' quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli.
'''Integration theories''' focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many [[cognitive]] and/or neural processes.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2&gt;Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., &amp; Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 12(8), 314–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into [[behavioral]] measures and [[physiological]] measures.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt;

===Behavioral measures===

Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2 /&gt; "Strategic control measures" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt; Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;

===Physiological measures===

[[event-related potential|Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs)]] have been used to assess whether a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is consciously perceived or not. These [[EEG]] measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.&lt;ref name = Sethcomputation&gt;Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. ''Cognitive Computation'', 1(1), 50–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness.

The '''dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)''' proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity '''neural complexity (CN).''' ''CN'' is an information-theoretic measure; the ''CN'' value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;
The '''information integration theory of consciousness (IITC)''' shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity ''phi'' is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational "weakest link" of a system. Importantly, ''phi'' is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas ''CN'' is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, '''causal density ''(CD)''''', measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

===Challenges in measuring===

It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). An|metacognitive]] conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed.&lt;ref name= Morin/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in [[risk aversion]] may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology.&lt;ref name= Sethmeasures2/&gt;

Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.&lt;ref name= Edelmansky/&gt;&lt;ref name = Edelman&gt;Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 929, 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous studies==

===In lucid dreams===

Hobson asserts that the existence of [[lucid dreaming]] means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of [[secondary consciousness]] in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt; Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective [[awareness]] that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

Dreaming is thus a [[virtual reality]] experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

===In epileptic seizures===

Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even [[secondary consciousness]] during [[complex partial seizure|complex partial epileptic seizures]]. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures.&lt;ref name = Johanson/&gt; This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability.&lt;ref name= Johanson/&gt;

===In thirst===

In one study, 10 adult males underwent [[positron emission tomography]] scans in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 96(9), 5304.&lt;/ref&gt;
# During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of [[intravenous]] [[hypertonic]] saline 0.51 M
# After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness
# 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst

The data suggest that the anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]] as well as the anterior wall of the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]], are major elements of a circuit including [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Denton/&gt;
This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed.&lt;ref name= Denton/&gt;

=== In meditation ===

In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.&lt;/ref&gt; This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, F. &amp; Pearsoon. C. (2000) Pure Consciousness: Distinct phenomenological and physiological correlates of "consciousness itself", ''International Journal of Neuroscience'', 100 pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated by [[Political science|political scientist]] Samuel Krislov, '''representative bureaucracy''' is a notion that “broad [[social group]]s should have spokesman and officeholders in administrative as well as [[Politics|political]] positions”. With this notion, representative [[bureaucracy]] is a form of representation that captures most or all aspects of a society’s [[population]] in the governing body of the state.  (Krislov, Samuel. (2012). Representative Bureaucracy. Quid Pro Books)

== History ==
The term representative bureaucracy is generally attributed to [[J. Donald Kingsley]]’s book titled ''Representative Bureaucracy'' that was published in 1944. In his book, Kingsley calls for a “ liberalization of [[social class]] selection for the English bureaucracy," due to the "Dominance of [[social]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Economics|economic]] elites within the British bureaucracy" which he claimed resulted in programs and political policy that did not meet the needs or interests of all [[social class]]e&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Public Personnel Administration|last = Denhardt|first = R.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1994|isbn = 9780824792312|location = |pages = |last2 = DeLeon|first2 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this issue, Kingsley states that “representative bureaucracy is necessary because there must be at least some [[Administrator of the Government|administrator]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s sympathetic to the programmatic concerns of the dominant [[political party]]”. Despite criticism at the time of publication, years later, political [[scientist]] [[Samuel Krislov]] echoed Kingsley's sentiments in his book also called ''Representative Bureaucracy'' and this has been expanded upon since then by a number of scholars all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Representative Bureaucracy in the Public Service?

In [[Samuel Krislov]]’s book, he states that in much, if not all, of bureaucracy’s history, the perception of bureaucracy has had the identification of being entities covered in [[red tape]] and having an antagonistic approach to the [[public]]. Also with the association of these ideals heavily ingrained into the public, it is hard to think of the positive aspects of such representation. ( Krislov, Samuel. (2012). Representative Bureaucracy. Quid Pro Books)

There is some degree of disagreement over what constitutes representative bureaucracy as there is a lot of literature that exists on the subject as it has a long history. Scholars Groeneveld and Walle state that there are three dimensions of representative bureaucracy, the first  is a historical one, the second is from the perspective of [[public administration]], and the third is in literature on [[Diversity (business)|diversity management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A contingency approach to representative bureaucracy: power, equal opportunities and diversity|last = Groeneveld|first = S.|date = 2010|journal = International Review of Administrative Sciences|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Walle|first2 = S.V.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. levels of government ==

=== Local ===
At the local level  different studies and surveys have been conducted to evaluate the theory of representative bureaucracy studies and surveys have been done to evaluate whether or not the employees who worked for these government [[List of federal agencies in the United States|agencies]] share values with each other across [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sex]], [[gender]], age, [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]], as well as whether or not these employees share values with the [[Citizenship|citizenry]] across the same variables.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Representative Bureaucracy: Exploring The Potential For Active Representation in Local Government|last = Bradbury|first = Mark D.|date = October 1, 2008|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research &amp; Theory|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Kellough|first2 = J. Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies were done to see if these bureaucracies are truly representative of the social groups that make up their citizenry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to one survey there are great differences in the way black and white administrators and citizens view different issues. The survey found that race plays a huge role in how administrators and citizens view certain issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are drastic differences between white and black administrators views and the views of black and white citizens. The study claims black administrators are more similar to their citizen counterparts, white administrators tended to be out of touch with the views of their citizen counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study found that [[passivity (behavior)|passive]] representation can lead to active representation as more individuals of diverse backgrounds work for these local agencies and represent the [[Minority group|minorities]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bureaucracy as a representative institution: Toward a reconciliation of bureaucratic government and democratic theory.|last = Brudney|first = Jeffrey L.|date = 1998|journal = American Journal of Political Science|doi = 10.2307/2991727|pmid = |last2 = Kellough|first2 = J. Edward|last3 = Selden|first3 = Sally Coleman|volume=42|page=717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Mark Bradbury and J. Edward Kellough found that black administrators are more likely than white administrators to take on the role as a representative of the [[Minority group|minority]] black community, although they concede that this was for one local government and it is unclear whether or not this translates across racial lines to other [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and racial groups, on top of the fact that historical, cultural, and [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors were not accounted for.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== State ===
Studies of state run government agencies were performed to see whether passive representation of nonwhites and women is linked to active representation, meaning whether or not having a diverse group of people working and running the agencies means that the interests of those peoples' larger group (women, nonwhites) will translate into policy outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From Organizational Values to Organizational Roles: Examining Bureaucracy in State Administration|last = Brudney|first = Jeffrey L.|date = 2000|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the studies suggests that to a large degree, the heads of the agencies are responsible for setting the tone for their [[organization]], influencing the [[culture]] and agendas of the institutions, establishing the agencies’ mission and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As they have so much influence on what the agency does, studies were done to see how different groups (race/ethnicity, sex) place importance on values or an agenda compared to others. The values that the agency heads hold regarding organizational objectives and goals are integral for them defining their jobs as state executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding and Managing Public Organizations|last = Rainey|first = Hal G.|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = San Francisco|pages = 268–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = City Executives: Leadership Roles, Work Characteristics, and Time Management|last = Ammons|first = David N.|publisher = Albany: State University of New York Press|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Newell|first2 = Charldean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Politics of State and City Administration|last = Abney|first = Glen|publisher = Albany: State University of New York Press|year = 1986|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Lauth|first2 = Thomas P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effective Local Government Manager|last = Anderson|first = Wayne F.|publisher = International City Management Association|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = |last2 = Newland|first2 = Chester A.|last3 = Stillman|first3 = Richard J. II}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies of 93 different state agencies found that there are differences between the attitudes and values of different ethnic groups, men, and women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each group places different emphasis of importance on series of different characteristics of the organization. According to the studies, as a group, nonwhites placed more of an emphasis on goals of growing the organization and budget stability, and women placed greater emphasis on values pertaining to organizational proficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The people with the power to appoint agency heads and senior administrative positions can have a direct effect on the direction an agency is taken in under its head.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Federal ===
The [[United States federal civil service|United States federal bureaucracy]] is broadly representative of the American people in terms of age, income, education, and the income of the father (used as a variable because it is a good predictor of where one will end up in life).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bureaucracy and Constitutionalism|last = Long|first = Norton|date = 1952|journal = American Political Science Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at the [[civil service]] from a view of positions held, the bureaucracy becomes less representative. Most decisions are made at the senior and upper levels, so the unrepresentative nature of the [[elite]]s of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] could be grounds to dismiss the idea that the U.S. federal bureaucracy is representative.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Representative Bureaucracy: An Empirical Analysis|last = Meier|first = Kenneth John|date = 1975|journal = American Political Science Association|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one moves through the ranks of the federal bureaucracy one finds that it becomes less and less representative as the positions get higher. From the positions of [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|GS1-GS4]] the bureaucracy is fairly representative however from the positions of [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|GS5 - GS14]] and above the bureaucracy is significantly unrepresentative.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The percentage of nonwhites decreases as one ascends the bureaucratic hierarchy, the same can be said for women. 40% of the American civil service are women and 75% of lower level positions are filled by women, with only 3% of women holding high civil service jobs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Compared to the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Turkey]], and [[India]], the U.S. is the most representative overall and is the best at representing the middle status occupations of countries surveyed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Bureaucracy and Constitutionalism by [[Norton E. Long|Norton Long]], he contends that the American civil service is representative enough to make up for the fact that the political branches of government are not representative.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A study by [[Kenneth J. Meier|Kenneth Meier]] agrees that the civil service is the most representative branch of the U.S. government followed by the military, political executives, and lastly the foreign service. Meier indicates that Long's proposal is only weakly supported, as the bureaucracies are not representative at the decision making level. Meier states this is far from a conclusive study.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Bureaucratic representation ==
Bureaucratic representation is when it is expected that [[public administrator]] and [[Official|government officials]] in a [[bureaucracy]] represent and conduct duties that are of concern for the interest of the individuals and groups the represent and serve. Studies have shown that there are an endless list of variable linking active and passive representation such as class, race, [[gender]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], as well as cultural traits such as [[language]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Symbolic Representation in Police Traffic Stops|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15377938.2012.642730|journal = Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1537-7938|pages = 41–70|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/15377938.2012.642730|first = Matt|last = Beverlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated a possible linkage between active and passive representation. Active representation is a process while passive representation is a characteristic. The possible linkage between active and passive is one that is complex and perplexing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Representative Bureaucracy: Rethinking Substantive Effects and Active Representation|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00572.x/abstract|journal = Public Administration Review|date = 2006-03-01|issn = 1540-6210|pages = 193–204|volume = 66|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00572.x|first = Hong-Hai|last = Lim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Active ===
Active representation is a function that concludes represented groups benefit from representative bureaucracies. Most active representation is concerned with how representation influence [[Politician|policymaker]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and implementation and assumes that [[bureaucrat]]s will act purposely on behalf of their counterparts in the general population. An example being, women and men working beside one another within a bureaucracy, women are more likely to actively promote issues and agendas that benefit women in the general population.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Potential barriers to active representation are peer pressures that appear within work environments as well as social ones. The pressures placed on bureaucratic of a primary group to conform are notorious within any environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Passive ===
Representative bureaucracy in the passive sense is the degree to which the social characteristics of the bureaucracy reflect the social characteristics of the populations the bureaucracy serves. Studies of passive representation examine whether the composition of bureaucracies mirror the [[Demography|demographic]] composition of the general population. Passive representation exists when bureaucracy's demographic characteristics demonstrate the demographic characteristics of the population.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Effects on society ==

=== Positive ===
* Representative bureaucracy has been proven to help build relationships between employees and their respectable employers. Studies show that people tend to relate more to those who share similar characteristics with. These characteristics include but are not limited to: [[Demography|demographic]], age, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], and [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Public administration and conflict management in plural societies: the case for representative bureaucracy|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-162X(199910)19:43.0.CO;2-B/abstract|journal = Public Administration and Development|date = 1999-10-01|issn = 1099-162X|pages = 353–366|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/(sici)1099-162x(199910)19:4&lt;353::aid-pad86&gt;3.3.co;2-2|language = en|first = Milton J.|last = Esman}}&lt;/ref&gt; When representative bureaucracy is utilized, this enables relationships to flourish due to the attempt of even representation of all the previously listed characteristics. In government programs, [[official]]s are thought to favor those they can relate to and [[Discrimination|discriminate]] others. This can discourage certain ethnicity from applying or receiving benefits. Representative bureaucracy helps to prevent this by providing [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]] that prevent the favoritism. Representative bureaucracy helps to prevent the bias that is associated with benefits/programming. Although laws do not allow for discrimination, people often subconsciously favor people that resemble them.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptions of Discrimination|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1995.tb00525.x/abstract|journal = Policy Studies Journal|date = 1995-09-01|issn = 1541-0072|pages = 483–498|volume = 23|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1541-0072.1995.tb00525.x|language = en|first = Katherine C.|last = Naff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative ===
Some criticisms that are associated with representative bureaucracy are:
* Representative bureaucracy may be too focused on representation instead of [[productivity]]. A focus on if everyone is equally represented could lead to a lack of quality out of fear of not being able to achieve [[representation (politics)|equal representation]]. 
* Scholars believe that focusing solely on representation of all people could lead to an easier platform for [[racism]]. This focus has a potential to create more [[Hatred|hate]] between [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Law enforcement ===
* [[Gender]] representation in [[Police|police departments]] can influence an individual's ability to determine an agency's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Representative Bureaucracy in Policing: Does It Increase Perceived Legitimacy?|url = http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/537|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|date = 2014-07-01|issn = 1053-1858|pages = 537–551|volume = 24|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/jopart/muu006|language = en|first = Norma M.|last = Riccucci|first2 = Gregg G. Van|last2 = Ryzin|first3 = Cecilia F.|last3 = Lavena}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted at [[Rutgers University]] determined that the active representation of female officers positively influenced agency performance, [[job performance]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trustworthiness]], and fairness of the agency. [[Citizenship|Citizen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are thus able to be more likely to be cooperative in the conduction of public safety outcomes. Within the [[domestic violence]] unit (DVU), a significant change in citizen behavior was seen towards the agency ability to execute and deliver [[Public safety organizations|public safety]] measures. Although there is no difference for male and female agents in filing reports and pursuing suspects, the “...character of the bureaucrat may nonetheless change encourage the client to actively solicit his or her services..” in a more effective manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender, Representative Bureaucracy, and Law Enforcement: The Case of Sexual Assault|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00653.x/abstract|journal = Public Administration Review|date = 2006-11-01|issn = 1540-6210|pages = 850–860|volume = 66|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00653.x|language = en|first = Kenneth J.|last = Meier|first2 = Jill|last2 = Nicholson-Crotty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women play an integral role with discretion, [[Strategic planning|implementation]], and the enforcement of policies specifically in regards to sexual assault policies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As [[law enforcement]] agents are considered [[Street-level bureaucracy|street-level]] bureaucrats, their need to “...exercise discretion, their attitudes, values, and predispositions…” make  policy implementation an integral process. The representation of women and [[Minority group|minorities]] within bureaucratic agencies, specifically law enforcement, make immediate positive changes in regards to their targeted demographic groups. 
* Studies have shown that [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] representation has little effect with [[Street-level bureaucracy|street level bureaucra]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ts.

=== Education ===
* Research conducted at the [[University of Kansas]] investigated the “...impact of minority bureaucratic and political representation on the distribution of disciplinary measures in [[State school|public schools]]…” as compared to students within [[List of gifted and talented programmes|gifted and talented program]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Influences Principals&amp;#x27; Perceptions of Academic Climate? A Nationally Representative Study of the Direct Effects of Perception on Climate - Academic Commons|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8FT8JS9|doi = 10.7916/d8ft8js9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Types of educational institutions|Educational institutions]] are inherently bureaucratic in function and deal with issues regarding a discrepancy in [[Discipline|disciplinary]] action and gifted and talented placement with [[Minority group|minorities]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
* There is a noticeable difference within gifted and talented school programs about the lack of student representation. Oftentimes educators look over minorities or [[Income|low-income]] students and request gifted and talented testing for [[White people|Caucasian]] and [[Asian American|Asian]] students. Selection for this program is not contingent upon one teacher, but rather higher up [[Head teacher|school administrators]]. In this case, a call for minority administrator representation within educational institutions would be more effective than minority teacher placement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
* Representative bureaucracy within [[education]] also focuses on teacher representation. Studies show that having “...a greater presence of black teachers does yield more beneficial outcomes for minority students…” due to the fact that teaching consists of two distinct roles. The first being an allotment of education and second being the execution of discipline.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In [[mycology]], a '''sanctioned name''' is a [[scientific name|name]] that was adopted (but not necessarily coined) in certain works of [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] or [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which are considered major points in [[fungal]] taxonomy.

==Definition and effects==
Sanctioned names are those, regardless of their authorship, that were used by Persoon in his ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]'' (1801) for [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], [[smut (fungus)|smuts]] and [[gasteromycetes]], and in Fries's ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'' (three volumes, published 1821–32) and ''[[Elenchus fungorum]]'' for all other fungi.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;

A sanctioned name, as defined under article 15 of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (previously, the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'') is automatically treated as if conserved against all earlier [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s or [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

==History==
Because of the imprecision associated with assigning starting dates for fungi sanctioned in Fries' three ''Systema'' volumes, the [[Stockholm]] 1950 [[International Botanical Congress]] defined arbitrary or actual publication dates for the starting points to improve the stability of nomenclature. These dates were 1 May 1753 for ''Species Plantarum'' (vascular plants), 31 December 1801 for ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum'', 31 December 1820 for ''Flora der Vorweldt'' (fossil plants), and 1 Jan 1821 for the first volume of ''Systema''. Because fungi defined in the second and third volumes lacked a starting-point book for reference, the Congress declared that these species, in addition to species defined in Fries' 1828 ''Elenchus Fungorum'' (a two-volume supplement to his ''System''), had "privileged status". According to Korf,&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt; the term "sanctioned" was first used to indicate these privileged names by the Dutch mycologist [[Marinus Anton Donk]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Donk1961/&gt;

In 1982, changes in the ''International Code for Botanical Nomenclature'' (the Sydney Code) restored Linnaeus' 1753 ''Species Plantarum'' as the starting point for fungal nomenclature; however, protected status was given to all names adopted by Persoon in his 1801 ''Synopsis'', and by Fries in both the ''Systema'' and the ''Elenchus''.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Demoulin1981/&gt; Soon after, in 1983, [[Richard P. Korf]] proposed the now widely accepted "colon-author indication", whereby sanctioned names are indicated by including ": Pers." or ": Fr." when fully citing the species author.&lt;ref name=Kuyper1998/&gt;
&lt;!--There are explanation in Hawksworth, I believe, about how the harsher starting date rule made validation of pre-Persoon/Fries name that they did not cover a conundrum, hence the restoration of the Linnean starting date and creation of the sanctioned status.--&gt;

The '''Soyuz-FG''' [[launch vehicle]] is an improved version of the [[Soyuz-U]] from the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 family]] of rockets, designed and constructed by [[TsSKB-Progress]] in [[Samara, Russia]]. It made its maiden flight on 20 May 2001, carrying a [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] cargo spacecraft to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

Since 30 October 2002, Soyuz-FG has been the only vehicle used by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] to launch [[Soyuz-TMA]] and [[Soyuz-MS]] manned spacecraft to the ISS. The Soyuz-FG performed 64 successful launches until its first failure on 11 October 2018 with the [[Soyuz MS-10]] mission.

Soyuz-FG can optionally fly with a [[Fregat]] [[upper stage]], developed and produced by [[Lavochkin]] Association in [[Khimki]]. Launches of the Soyuz-FG/Fregat configuration are marketed by a European-Russian company called [[Starsem]]. Its [[maiden flight]] occurred on 2 June 2003. As of December 2014, there have been 10 launches of Soyuz-FG/Fregat with commercial [[payload]]s.&lt;ref name=gunter-soyuz-fg-fregat /&gt;

The analog control system significantly limits the capabilities of this launcher, and it will eventually be replaced by [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zak |first=Anatoly |title=Soyuz-FG's long road to retirement |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-fg.html |website=Russian Space Web |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soyuz-FG is launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]], from [[Gagarin's Start]] (pad LC-1/5) for manned missions, and from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 31|LC-31/6]] for satellite launches with the Fregat variant.

On 1 November 2018, Russian scientists released a video recording of the [[Soyuz MS-10]] manned spaceflight involving a Soyuz-FG rocket after launch on 11 October 2018 that, due to a faulty sensor, resulted in the destruction of the rocket. The crew, NASA astronaut [[Nick Hague]] and Russian cosmonaut [[Aleksey Ovchinin]]. escaped safely and successfully.&lt;ref name="AT-20181101"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |title=Dramatic footage of Soyuz accident shows rocket booster collision - For the second human launch in a row, there's a likely quality control issue. |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/dramatic-footage-of-soyuz-accident-shows-rocket-booster-collision/ |date=1 November 2018 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=1 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], the '''theory of planned behavior''' (abbreviated '''TPB''') is a theory that links one's beliefs and [[behavior]].

The theory states that attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, together shape an individual's behavioral intentions and behaviors.

The concept was proposed by [[Icek Ajzen]] to improve on the predictive power of the [[theory of reasoned action]] by including perceived behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ajzen|first=Icek|title=The theory of planned behavior|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|date=1991|volume=50|issue=2|pages=179–211|doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been applied to studies of the relations among [[beliefs]], attitudes, [[Theory of planned behavior#Concepts of key variables|behavioral intentions]] and behaviors in various fields such as [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[advertising campaign]]s, [[healthcare]], sport management and sustainability.

==History==

===Extension from the theory of reasoned action===
The theory of planned behavior was proposed by Icek Ajzen in 1985 through his article "From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. (1985). From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior. In J. Kuhl &amp; J. Beckmann (Eds.), ''Action control: From cognition to behavior''. Berlin, Heidelber, New York: Springer-Verlag. (pp. 11-39).&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from the [[theory of reasoned action]], which was proposed by [[Martin Fishbein]] together with Icek Ajzen in 1980. The theory of reasoned action was in turn grounded in various theories of attitude such as [[learning theories]], [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-value theories]], consistency theories (such as Heider's [[balance theory]], Osgood and Tannenbaum's congruity theory, and Festinger's [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance theory]]) and [[attribution theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M. &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of reasoned action, if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive (attitude), and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior (subjective norm), this results in a higher intention (motivations) and they are more likely to do so. A high correlation of attitudes and subjective norms to behavioral intention, and subsequently to behavior, has been confirmed in many studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppard | first1 = B.H. | last2 = Hartwick | first2 = J. | last3 = Warshaw | first3 = P.R. | year = 1988 | title = The theory of reasoned action: A meta-analysis of past research with recommendations for modifications and future research | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–343 | doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter-argument against the high relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior has also been proposed, as the results of some studies show that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norberg | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Horne | first2 = D. R. | last3 = Horne | first3 = D. A. | year = 2007 | title = The privacy paradox: Personal information disclosure intentions versus behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Affairs | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 100–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00070.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of circumstantial limitations, behavioral intention does not always lead to actual behavior. Namely, since behavioral intention cannot be the exclusive determinant of behavior where an individual's control over the behavior is incomplete, Ajzen introduced the theory of planned behavior by adding a new component, "perceived behavioral control". By this, he extended the theory of reasoned action to cover non-volitional behaviors for predicting behavioral intention and actual behavior.

The most recent addition of a third factor, perceived behavioral control, refers to the degree to which a person believes that they control any given behavior (class notes). The theory of planned behavior suggests that people are much more likely to intend to enact certain behaviors when they feel that they can enact them successfully.  Increased perceived behavioral control is a mix of two dimensions: self-efficacy and controllability (170). Self-efficacy refers to the level of difficulty that is required to perform the behavior, or one's belief in their own ability to succeed in performing the behavior. Controllability refers to the outside factors, and one's belief that they personally have control over the performance of the behavior, or if it is controlled by externally, uncontrollable factors. If a person has high perceived behavioral control, then they have an increased confidence that they are capable of performing the specific behavior successfully.

The theory has since been improved and renamed the [[reasoned action approach]] by Azjen and his colleague Martin Fishbein.

===Extension of self-efficacy===
In addition to attitudes and subjective norms (which make the theory of reasoned action), the theory of planned behavior adds the concept of ''perceived behavioral control'', which originates from [[self-efficacy]] theory (SET). Self-efficacy was proposed by Bandura in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bandura|first1 = A.|journal = Psychological Review|date = 1977|volume = 84|issue = 2|page = 191|title = Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came from [[social cognitive theory]]. According to Bandura, expectations such as motivation, performance, and feelings of frustration associated with repeated failures determine effect and behavioral reactions. Bandura separated expectations into two distinct types: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined self-efficacy as the conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes. The ''outcome expectancy'' refers to a person's estimation that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. He states that self-efficacy is the most important precondition for behavioral change, since it determines the initiation of coping behavior.
Previous investigations have shown that peoples' behavior is strongly influenced by their confidence in their ability to perform that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A. | last2 = Adams | first2 = N. E. | last3 = Hardy | first3 = A. B. | last4 = Howells | first4 = G.

J. (2005). Correlations of Depression and Total Mood Disturbance with Physical Activity and Self-Concept in Preadolescents Enrolled in an After-School Exercise Program 1. Psychological Reports, 96(3c), 891-898.&lt;/ref&gt; and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gyurcsik | first1 = N. C. | last2 = Brawley | first2 = L.

==Concepts of key variables==

===Normative beliefs and subjective norms===
* '''Normative belief''': an individual's perception of social [[normative]] pressures, or relevant others' beliefs that he or she should or should not perform such behavior.
* '''Subjective norm''': an individual's perception about the particular behavior, which is influenced by the judgment of significant others (e.g., parents, spouse, friends, teachers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amjad | first1 = N. | last2 = Wood | first2 = A.M. | year = 2009 | title = Identifying and changing the normative beliefs about aggression which lead young Muslim adults to join extremist anti-Semitic groups in Pakistan | url = http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/amjadwood.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 514–519 | doi=10.1002/ab.20325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control beliefs and perceived behavioral control===
* '''Control beliefs''': an individual's beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or hinder performance of the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 2001 | title = Nature and operation of attitudes | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 27–58 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of perceived behavioral control is conceptually related to self-efficacy.
* '''Perceived behavioral control''': an individual's perceived ease or [[Difficulty of engagement|difficulty of performing]] the particular behavior.&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"/&gt; It is assumed that perceived behavioral control is determined by the total set of accessible control beliefs.

===Behavioral intention and behavior===
* '''Behavioral intention''': an indication of an individual's readiness to perform a given behavior. It is assumed to be an immediate antecedent of behavior.&lt;ref name=Ajzen02&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 2002 | title = Perceived Behavioral Control, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and the Theory of Planned Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 665–683 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, with each predictor weighted for its importance in relation to the behavior and population of interest.
* '''Behavior''': an individual's observable response in a given situation with respect to a given target. Ajzen said a behavior is a function of compatible intentions and perceptions of behavioral control in that perceived behavioral control is expected to moderate the effect of intention on behavior, such that a favorable intention produces the behavior only when perceived behavioral control is strong.

===Conceptual / operational comparison===

====Perceived behavioral control vs. self-efficacy====
As Ajzen (1991) stated in the theory of planned behavior, knowledge of the role of perceived behavioral control came from Bandura's concept of self-efficacy. More recently, Fishbein and Cappella stated&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Cappella, J. N. (2006). The role of theory in developing effective health communications. Journal of Communication, 56(s1), S1-S17.&lt;/ref&gt; that self-efficacy is the same as perceived behavioral control in his integrative model, which is also measured by items of self-efficacy in a previous study.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. (2002). Residual effects of past on later behavior: Habituation and reasoned action perspectives. Personality and social psychology review, 6(2), 107-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous studies, the construction and the number of item inventory of perceived behavioral control have depended on each particular health topic. For example, for smoking topics, it is usually measured by items such as "I don't think I am addicted because I can really just not smoke and not crave for it," and "It would be really easy for me to quit."

The concept of self-efficacy is rooted in Bandura's social cognitive theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]'' (see article). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcome. The concept of self-efficacy is used as perceived behavioral control, which means the perception of the ease or difficulty of the particular behavior. It is linked to control beliefs, which refers to beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of the behavior.

It is usually measured with items which begins with the stem, "I am sure I can ... (e.g., exercise, quit smoking, etc.)" through a self-report instrument in their questionnaires. Namely, it tries to measure the confidence toward the probability, feasibility, or likelihood of executing given behavior.

====Attitude toward behavior vs. outcome expectancy====
The theory of planned behavior specifies the nature of relationships between beliefs and attitudes. According to these models, people's evaluations of, or attitudes toward behavior are determined by their accessible beliefs about the behavior, where a belief is defined as the subjective probability that the behavior will produce a certain outcome. Specifically, the evaluation of each outcome contributes to the attitude in direct proportion to the person's subjective possibility that the behavior produces the outcome in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I. | last2 = Fishbein | first2 = M. | year = 1975 | title = A Bayesian analysis of attribution processes | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 82 | issue = 2| page = 261 | doi=10.1037/h0076477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outcome expectancy was originated from the expectancy-value model. It is a variable-linking belief, attitude, opinion and expectation. The theory of planned behavior's positive evaluation of self-performance of the particular behavior is similar to the concept to perceived benefits, which refers to beliefs regarding the effectiveness of the proposed preventive behavior in reducing the vulnerability to the negative outcomes, whereas their negative evaluation of self-performance is similar to perceived barriers, which refers to evaluation of potential negative consequences that might result from the enactment of the espoused health behavior.

====Social influence====
The concept of social influence has been assessed by social norm and normative belief in both the theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior. Individuals' elaborative thoughts on subjective norms are perceptions on whether they are expected by their friends, family and the society to perform the recommended behavior. Social influence is measured by evaluation of various social groups. For example, in the case of smoking:
# Subjective norms from the peer group include thoughts such as, "Most of my friends smoke," or "I feel ashamed of smoking in front of a group of friends who don't smoke";
# Subjective norms from the family include thoughts such as, "All of my family smokes, and it seems natural to start smoking," or "My parents were really mad at me when I started smoking"; and
# Subjective norms from society or culture include thoughts such as, "Everyone is against smoking," and "We just assume everyone is a nonsmoker."

While most models are conceptualized within individual cognitive space, the theory of planned behavior considers social influence such as social norm and normative belief, based on collectivistic culture-related variables. Given that an individual's behavior (e.g., health-related decision-making such as diet, condom use, quitting smoking and drinking, etc.) might very well be located in and dependent on the social networks and organization (e.g., peer group, family, school and workplace), social influence has been a welcomed addition.

==Model==
Human behavior is guided by three kinds of consideration, "behavioral beliefs," "normative beliefs," and "control beliefs." In their respective aggregates, "behavioral beliefs" produce a favorable or unfavorable "attitude toward the behavior"; "normative beliefs" result in "subjective norm"; and "control beliefs" gives rise to "perceived behavioral control."

In combination, "attitude toward the behavior," "subjective norm," and "perceived behavioral control" lead to the formation of a "behavioral intention".&lt;ref name=Ajzen02 /&gt; In particular, "perceived behavioral control" is presumed to not only affect actual behavior directly, but also affect it indirectly through behavioral intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noar | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = R. S. | year = 2005 | title = Health Behavior Theory and cumulative knowledge regarding health behaviors: are we moving in the right direction? | url = | journal = Health education research | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 275–290 | doi=10.1093/her/cyg113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, the more favorable the attitude toward behavior and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived behavioral control, the stronger the person's intention to perform the behavior in question should be. Finally, given a sufficient degree of actual control over the behavior, people are expected to carry out their intentions when the opportunity arises.&lt;ref name=Ajzen02 /&gt;

==Formula==
In a simple form, behavioral intention for the theory of planned behavior can be expressed as the following mathematical function:
:&lt;math&gt;BI = w_A A + w_{SN} SN + w_{PBC} PBC&lt;/math&gt;
The three factors being proportional to their underlying beliefs&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"/&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n b_i e_i \\
SN &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n n_i m_i \\
PBC &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n c_i p_i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Evaluation of the theory==

===Strengths===
The theory of planned behavior can cover people's non-volitional behavior which cannot be explained by the theory of reasoned action.

An individual's behavioral intention cannot be the exclusive determinant of behavior where an individual's control over the behavior is incomplete. By adding "perceived behavioral control," the theory of planned behavior can explain the relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior.

Several studies found that the TPB would help better predict health-related behavioral intention than the theory of reasoned action.&lt;ref name=Ajzen89&gt;Ajzen, I. (1989). Attitude structure and behavior. Attitude structure and function, 241-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The TPB has improved the predictability of intention in various health-related fields such as condom use, leisure, exercise, diet, etc.

In addition, the theory of planned behavior as well as the theory of reasoned action can explain the individual's social behavior by considering "social norm" as an important variable.

===Limitations===
Some scholars claim that the theory of planned behavior is based on cognitive processing, and they have criticised the theory on those grounds. More recently, some scholars criticize the theory because it ignores one's needs prior to engaging in a certain action, needs that would affect behaviour regardless of expressed attitudes. For example, one might have a very positive attitude towards beefsteak and yet not order a beefsteak because he is not hungry. Or, one might have a very negative attitude towards drinking and little intention to drink and yet engage in drinking as he's seeking group membership.

Also, one's emotions at the interviewing or decision-making time are ignored despite being relevant to the model as emotions can influence beliefs and other constructs of the model.  Still, poor predictability for health-related behavior in previous health research seems to be attributed to poor application of the model, associated methods and measures. Most of the research is correlational, and more evidence based on experimental studies is welcome although experiments, by nature, lack external validity because they prioritize internal validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sniehotta | first1 = F.F. | year = 2009 | title = An experimental test of the Theory of Planned Behavior | url = | journal = Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 257–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1758-0854.2009.01013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of the theory==
So far, the theory of planned behavior has more than 1200 research bibliographies in academic databases such as ''Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete'', ''Academic Search Premier'', ''PsycARTICLES'', ''Business Source Premier'', ''PsycINFO'', and ''PsycCRITIQUES''.

In particular, recently, several studies found that the TPB would better help to predict health-related behavioral intention than the theory of reasoned action (TRA)&lt;ref name=Ajzen89 /&gt; given that the TPB has improved the predictability of intention in various health-related fields such as condom use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = B.

H. | year = 2003 | title = Environmental influences: factors influencing a woman's decision to use dietary supplements | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 6| pages = 1978S–1982S | doi=10.1093/jn/133.6.1978s}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the attitudes and intentions to behave in a certain way are mediated by goals rather than needs. For example, the goal to lose 10&amp;nbsp;kg in weight by the end of March, therefore a positive attitude and intention towards dieting. However, if a need is taken in calculation (health related or partner finding) the TPB fails. Assuming that one's need is to find a partner, if the partner is found and she like him overweight, or does not mind one's weight, then despite his positive attitude towards losing weight, he won't engage in a such behaviour as he might lose his partner, the main reason for engaging in dieting in first place.

The TPB also shows good applicability in regards to antisocial behaviours, such as using deception in the online environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the TPB relies on self-reports, there is evidence to suggest the vulnerability of such data to self-presentational biases. To a great extent, this has been ignored in the literature pertaining to the TRA/TPB, in spite of the threat to the validity and reliability of the models. More closely related to the concerns of the present study, Hessing, ElVers, and Weigel (1988) examined the TRA in relation to tax evasion and contrasted self-reports with official documentation. Findings indicated that while attitudes and subjective norms correlate with self-reported behaviour, it does not correlate with documentary evidence, in spite of considerable effort to maintain the anonymity of respondents. The implication was that self-reports of behaviour were unreliable, compared with more objective behaviour measures (see also Armitage &amp; Conner, 1999a, 1999b; Norwich &amp; Rovoli, 1993; Pellino, 1997).

Another application of the theory of planned behavior is in the field of '''''[[environmental psychology]]'''''. Generally speaking, actions that are environmentally friendly carry a positive normative belief. That is to say, sustainable behaviors are widely promoted as positive behaviors. However, although there may be a behavioral intention to practice such behaviors, perceived behavioral control can be hindered by constraints such as a belief that one's behavior will not have any impact.&lt;ref&gt;Koger, S. &amp; Winter, D. N. N. (2010). ''The Psychology of Environmental Problems''. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = P. C. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding individuals' environmentally significant behavior | url = | journal = Environmental Law Reporter: News and Analysis | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 10785–10790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one intends to behave in an environmentally responsible way but there is a lack of accessible recycling infrastructure, perceived behavioral control is low, and constraints are high, so the behavior may not occur. Applying the theory of planned behavior in these situations helps explain contradictions between sustainable attitudes and unsustainable behavior.

The theory of planned behavior model is thus a very powerful and predictive model for explaining human behavior. That is why the health and nutrition fields have been using this model often in their research studies. In one study, utilizing the theory of planned behavior, the researchers determine obesity factors in overweight Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liou | first1 = D. | last2 = Bauer | first2 = K. D. | year = 2007 | title = Exploratory investigation of obesity risk and prevention in Chinese Americans | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 134–141 | doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2006.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intention to prevent becoming overweight was the key construct in the research process. It is important that nutrition educators provide the proper public policies in order to provide good tasting, low-cost, healthful food.

The theory of planned behavior can also be applied in area of '''''applied nutrition intervention'''''. In a recent study by Sweitzer,&lt;ref&gt;Sweitzer, S.J. et al.  (2011) Psychosocial Outcomes of "Lunch is in the Bag", a Parent Program for Packing Healthful Lunches for Preschool children.  J Nutr Ed Behav. 43:536-542.&lt;/ref&gt; TPB (in conjunction with SCT) was utilized to encourage parents to pack more fruits, vegetables and whole grains (FVWG) in sack lunches of preschool children. Behavioral constructs of TPD were used to develop intervention strategies. Knowledge/behavioral control, Self-efficacy/perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and intentions were measured to see effects on behavior. The results found a significant increase in vegetables and whole grains packed in lunches when interventions were planned using the TPB constructs. Psychosocial variables were useful predictors of lunch packing behaviors of parents and this study provided a divergent application of model-exploration of an area of parental behavior as a role in the development of young children's dietary behaviors. In a study by McConnon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McConnon | first1 = A. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to weight control in an overweight cohort. Results from a pan-European dietary intervention trial (DiOGenes) | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 313–318 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2011.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the application of the TPB was used to prevent weight regain in an overweight cohort who recently experienced a significant weight loss.  Using the constructs of TPB, it was found that perceived need to control weight is the most positive predictor of behavior for weight maintenance. The TPB model can be used to predict weight gain prevention expectation in an overweight cohort. The TPB can also be utilized to measure behavioral intention of practitioners in promoting specific health behaviors. In this study by Chase,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, K., Reicks, M., &amp; Jones, J. (2003). Applying the theory of planned behavior to promotion of whole-grain foods by dietitians. J Am Diet Assoc. 103:1639-1642.&lt;/ref&gt; dietitians' intentions to promote whole grain foods was studied.  It was found that the strongest indicator of intention of dietitians to promote whole grain foods was the construct of normative beliefs with 97% of dietitians indicating that health professionals should promote whole grains and 89% wanted to comply with this belief. However, knowledge and self-efficacy of instituting this belief was faulted with only 60% of dietitians being able to correctly identify a whole grain product from a food label, 21% correctly identifying current recommendations and 42% of dietitians did not know there was a recommendation for whole grain consumption. Although the response rate to complete mailed surveys for this study was low (39%), the results provided preliminary data on the strong effect of normative beliefs on dietitian intentions to promote whole grain and the need for nutrition need for additional education for practicing dietitians focusing on increase knowledge and self-efficacy for promoting whole grains.

===Important steps===

When applying the TPB as a theoretical framework, certain steps should be followed to promote increased validity of results. First, target behavior should be specified in terms of action, target, context, and time. For example, the goal might be to "consume at least one serving of whole grains during breakfast each day in the forthcoming month". In this statement, "consuming" is the action, "one serving of whole grains" is the target, "during breakfast each day" is the context, and "in the forthcoming month" is the time.  Once a goal is specified, an elicitation phase can be used to identify salient issues. The pertinent and central beliefs for a certain behavior may be very different for different populations. Therefore, conducting open-ended elicitation interviews is one of the most crucial steps in applying the TPB. Elicitation interviews help to identify relevant behavioral outcomes, referents, cultural factors, facilitators, and barriers for each particular behavior and target population under investigation.&lt;ref name=Glanz36&gt;Glanz K, Rimer BK, &amp; Viswanath K; Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice, 5th Edition, Jossey-Bass, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are sample questions that may be used during an elicitation interview:&lt;ref name=Glanz36 /&gt;

* What do you like/ dislike about behavior X?
* What are some disadvantages of doing behavior X?
* Who would be against your doing behavior X?
* Who can you think of that would do behavior X?
* What things make it hard for you to do behavior X?
* If you want to do behavior X, how certain are you that you can?

However, the action, target, context and time construct shows little applicability when one engages in consuming luxury or fashion goods, especially as one's need is not present. For example, the goal might be to "buy three pairs of luxury high heels in the forthcoming month". In this statement, "buying" is the action, "three pairs of high heels" is the target, "luxury goods" is the context, and "in the forthcoming month" is the time.  In normal circumstances, once the goal is specified, the elicitation phase can be used to identify salient issues but not in this case as the need behind buying the shoes (wedding, sport, to show off, to feel good, to match with an existing outfit) primes in the decision making and therefore in the resulted behaviour.

Also, while the pertinent and central beliefs for a certain behavior may be very different for different populations, the questionnaire can then be designed, based on results from the elicitation interview, to measure model constructs with attention to cultural issues. After implementation of the questionnaire, thorough analysis should be conducted to assess whether the intervention influenced model constructs associated with intention and behavior.&lt;ref name="Glanz36" /&gt; Results and findings from the analysis can be used to develop effective interventions for eliciting behavioral change, especially within nutrition and health but not for luxury or fashion goods where one's need behind his purchase intentions (behavior) are in most social context cases to associate, dissociate or show status.

'''Utpala''' or '''{{IAST|Bhaṭṭotpala}}''' (''{{IAST|[[Bhaṭṭa]]-utpala}}'') is the name of a 10th-century Indian commentator of [[Vārāha Mihira]]'s ''[[Brihat Samhitā]]''. ''Brihat Samhitā'' is a Samhitā text of {{IAST|[[Jyotiṣa]]}} (Indian astrology and astronomy) . Samhitā is one of three branches of {{IAST|Jyotiṣa}} (Samhitā has many other meanings outside {{IAST|Jyotiṣa}}).

He is known for quoting six verses from ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' which are not found in its extant version. These six verses can be found in the 'Introduction' by S.Jain to the translation of Surya Siddhānta made by E. Burgess.&lt;ref&gt;Many publishers have published this translation of ''Surya Siddhānta'' by Burgess which was originally published in 1858.

In Sanskrit, the neuter noun ''utpala'' has two meanings, both given by ''[[Amarakosha|{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}]]'' (a lexicon of circa. 400 AD). The first meaning is ''white lotus'' also known as ''kuvalaya'' in Sanskrit, according to  {{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}'' 1.10.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For electronic edition of Amarakoṣa definition see: [http://www.ms.uky.edu/~sohum/amar/amar1.itx].&lt;/ref&gt; The second meaning of ''utpala'' is a variety of medicinal plant known as '{{IAST|kooṭh}}' in Hindi and '{{IAST|kusṭham}}, vyādhi, paribhavyam or pāribhavyam, vāpyam, pākalam' according to {{IAST|Amarkośa}}.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}'' 2.4.126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For electronic edition of Amarakoṣa definition see: [http://www.ms.uky.edu/~sohum/amar/amar2.itx].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1978">The "'''Watch Valley'''" covers all the Swiss Jura Arc, from [[Geneva]] to [[Basel]], and is the primary location of the Swiss [[watch]]-making industry. 

Beginning initially in 15th century Geneva, the cradle of the European time keeping industry, and spreading north east through the [[Jura Mountains]], the great majority of the companies related to the Swiss watch-making industry were first established. Continuing to the present day, centuries of tradition, rigor, and the know-how of skilled artisans, has forged the world recognized reputation of the great Swiss watch houses.

Some of the famous watchmakers currently producing in the Watch Valley include [[Breitling SA|Breitling]], [[Corum (watchmakers)|Corum]], [[Gallet &amp; Co.|Gallet]], [[Girard-Perregaux]], [[Movado]], [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.|Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex]], [[TAG Heuer]], [[Tissot]], [[Ulysse Nardin]], [[Chopard]] and others.

The distance across the watch Valley, traveling from Geneva to Basel, is approximately {{convert|200|km|mi|sp=us}}.
