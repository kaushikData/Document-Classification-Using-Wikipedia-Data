{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ad hoc'' hypothesis}}
[[File:Leprechaun ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|200px|If someone wants to believe in [[leprechaun]]s, they can avoid ever being proven wrong by using ''ad hoc'' hypotheses (e.g., by adding "they are invisible", then "their motives are complex", and so on).&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). How to Think Straight About Psychology. Boston: Pearson Education. Pages 19-33&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[science]] and [[philosophy]], an '''''ad hoc'' hypothesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] added to a [[theory]] in order to save it from being [[falsified]]. Often, ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing is employed to compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form.

==In the scientific community==
Scientists are often [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] of theories that rely on frequent, unsupported adjustments to sustain them. This is because, if a theorist so chooses, there is no limit to the number of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses that they could add. Thus the theory becomes more and more complex, but is never falsified. This is often at a cost to the theory's [[predictive power]], however.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"/&gt; ''Ad hoc'' hypotheses are often characteristic of [[pseudoscientific]] subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis." ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''. 22 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
====Embryos of falsifiable hypotheses and theories====
An ''ad hoc'' hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect; in some cases, a minor change to a theory was all that was necessary. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s addition of the [[cosmological constant]] to [[general relativity]] in order to allow a [[static universe]] was ''ad hoc''. Although he later referred to it as his "greatest blunder", it may correspond to theories of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M University. "Einstein's Biggest Blunder? Dark Energy May Be Consistent With Cosmological Constant." ''ScienceDaily'' 28 November 2007. 22 June 2008 &lt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071127142128.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mislabelling criticism of methodology as ad hoc====
The assumption that people are prone to make up ad hoc hypotheses to defend their world views is criticized by a number of [[history of science|historians of science]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] as it can lead to allegations of any valid criticism being an attempt to justify a specific theory that is not there. Such allegations can stand in the way of important criticism of flawed methodologies, thus causing the flawed methods to remain in continued use, by allegations that anyone who point out flaws in the methods doing it to defend a purported worldview. The allegations are made [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and unable to self-correct by explaining away any criticism of the allegations as [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] or [[self-deception]]. The problem includes [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] that claim that there is a face-off between two world views, missing the point that any number of hypotheses and theories make some predictions that incidentally happen to overlap with predictions made by other hypotheses or theories while also making some unique predictions (e.g. a partial incidental overlap but also key differences of predictions between the obsolete [[luminiferous aether]] theory and the modern [[vacuum energy]] theory that make the evidence that falsify the former fall outside the predictions made by the latter) which is often confused by "ad hoc" allegers with one hypothesis being a "justification" for another hypothesis with different predictions. False dichotomies cause not only allegations against hypotheses and theories but also against general remarks of flawed methodologies that suggest no specific hypotheses or theories that can dismiss remarks of technical errors in the equipment, remarks of statistical [[confirmation bias]]es that are due to institutional [[publication bias]] between "ordinary claims" and "extraordinary claims" rather than individual brains, remarks of biased searching for other explanations in some cases but not others that lead to false appearances of a phenomenon "really" existing in one group but not in another, and other types of methodological errors. By arguing that a diversity of hypotheses and theories until falsification enhances the possibility of one correct one being among them and surviving future falsification attempts, the distinction between "claimant" individuals and "non-claimant" institutions that is implicit in the concept of [[burden of proof (philosophy)|burden of proof]] is criticized for not being evidence-based and that the same empirical data can falsify many hypotheses and theories with overlapping predictions without the expensive separate testing of each hypothesis that is alleged when claiming that "most hypotheses must be ignored to save money".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Agassi, Abraham Meidan (2016) "Beg to Differ: The Logic of Disputes and Argumentation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Home (2013) "Science under Scrutiny: The Place of History and Philosophy of Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaps in knowledge and unclear observations===
Naturally, some gaps in knowledge, and even some observations that contradict a theory, must be temporarily tolerated while research continues. To temper ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing in science, common practice includes [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsificationism]] (somewhat in the philosophy of [[Occam's razor]]). Falsificationism means scientists become more likely to reject a theory as it becomes increasingly burdened by ignored contradicting observations, and by ''ad hoc'' hypotheses.

[[File:Human billboards Stockholm 2008-07-16 cropped.jpg|thumb|Advertising refers to any paid form of communication designed to create interest in or stimulate sales of products or services. Companies are constantly searching for novel media, such as these human billboards, to get their message out to potential consumers]]

'''Advertising management''' is a planned managerial process designed to oversee and control the various advertising activities involved in a program to communicate with a firm's target market and which is ultimately designed to influence the consumer's purchase decisions. Advertising is just one element in a company's [[promotional mix]] and as such, must be integrated with the overall marketing communications program. Advertising is, however, the most expensive of all the promotional elements and therefore must be managed with care and accountability.

[[Marketing|Marketers]] use different types of advertising. Brand advertising is defined as a non-personal communication message placed in a paid, mass medium designed to persuade target consumers of a product or service benefits in an effort to induce them to make a purchase. Corporate advertising refers to paid messages designed to that communicate the corporation's values in an effort to influence public opinion. Yet other types of  advertising such as not-for-profit advertising and political advertising present special challenges that require different strategies and approaches.
   
Advertising management is a complex process that involves making many layered decisions including the developing advertising strategies, setting an advertising budget, setting advertising objectives, determining the [[target market]], [[media strategy]] (which involves [[media planning]]), developing the message strategy and evaluating the overall effectiveness of the advertising effort.) Advertising management may also involve [[media buying]].

Advertising management is a complex process. However, at its simplest level, advertising management can be reduced to four key decision areas:

::'''Target audience definition''': Who do we want to talk to?

::'''Message (or creative) strategy''': What do we want to say to them?

::'''Media strategy''': How will we reach them?

::'''Measuring advertising effectiveness''': How do we know our messages were received in the form intended and with the desired outcomes?

== Advertising and advertising management: definitions==

Consumers tend to think that all forms of commercial promotion constitute advertising. However, in marketing and advertising, the term "advertising" has a very special meaning that reflects its status as a distinct type of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richards,J.I. and Curran, C.M., "Oracles on 'Advertising': Searching for a Definition," ''Journal of Advertising'', vol. 31. no. 2, 2002, pp 63-77, Online:http://120.114.52.240/~T093000279/repository/fetch/advertisig%20English%20-%20class%20material%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 newsstand Boston Massachusetts USA 3776403818.jpg|thumb|A key characteristic of advertising is that it utilises mass media channels such as newspapers, magazines, radio or TV to reach potential customers]]

The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. The [[American Marketing Association]] (AMA) defines advertising as "the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas".&lt;ref&gt;American Marketing Association (AMA), Online: https://www.ama.org/resources/Pages/Dictionary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' defines advertising as "the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media".&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary, 5th ed., 2015, Online: https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=advertising&lt;/ref&gt; Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: "any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail".&lt;ref&gt;Czinkota, M.R. et al. (2000), ''Marketing: Best Practices'', Orlando, FL: The Dryden Press&lt;/ref&gt; and "the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Bearden, W. O., Ingram, T.N. and LaForge, R.W., ''Marketing: Principles &amp; Perspectives'', 2d ed. New York: Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is "a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade".&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T. C., Allen, C.T. and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising'', 2d ed., Cincinnati, Ohio, South-Western College Publishing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:&lt;ref&gt;Tyagi,C.L. and Kumar, A.M, ''Advertising Management'', New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
:: * Firstly, advertising is a  ''paid '' form of communication and is therefore commercial in nature. 
:: * Secondly, advertising employs  ''non-personal channels '' (i.e. commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. 
:: * Thirdly, advertising has an  ''identified sponsor ''. 
In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. Advertising  is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different to personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue.
 
While [[advertising]] refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with [[market research]] continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Definitions, http://marketinginformationcentre.ca/marketing_definitions_%28a-b%29.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising and organisational responsibilities==

[[File:CalvinKleinFairviewMall.JPG|thumb|Calvin Klein is one of a growing number of companies that uses an in-house agency for its advertising and promotion]]

In commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an ''in-house agency''.  By definition, an in-house agency is a "an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves".&lt;ref&gt;Silk, A.J. and Stiglin, M.M., "Build It, Buy It Or Both? Rethinking the Sourcing of Advertising Services," Working Paper no. 15-093, Harvard Business School&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company’s business and marketing objectives. Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, W., "In-House Agencies Have An In," ''Forbes'', 30 March 2013, Online: https://www.forbes.com/sites/willburns/2013/03/30/in-house-agencies-have-an-in/#7379e02267eb&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Klein,&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, S., "The Media Business: Advertising-Leaving Calvin Klein For a Job at Limited," ''New York Times'',29 July 1998, Online: https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-leaving-calvin-klein-for-a-job-at-limited.html&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, B., "In-House Agencies Grow in Importance',  30 August, Association of National Advertisers, 2013 Online: https://www.ana.net/blogs/show/id/26944&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in-house agencies and outsourcing models have their own advantages and disadvantages. Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems.&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, R., "Thinking of Pulling a CareerBuilder? Pros and Cons of Bringing an Account In-house", ''AdAge'', 18 May 2009.http://adage.com/article/agency-news/pros-cons-house-careerbuilder/136701/&lt;/ref&gt; In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Gianatasioh, D., "What house agency boom means to SMOs and Outside Shops," ''AdWeek,'' 3 December 2015, Online:  http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-house-agency-boom-means-cmos-and-outside-shops-168593&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson-Taylor, A., "The Rise Of The In-House Agency", ''CMO'', 17 April 2015, Online: http://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/4/17/the-rise-of-the-inhouse-agency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The BOSS Group, Cella Consulting, In-House Creative Services Industry Report,LLC and InSource, April 2015, Online: http://www.creativeindustryreport.com/2015-IHCSIR-Report-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans,  brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems.

==Advertising's role in the promotional mix==
[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customers rely on different types of marketing communications at different stages of their purchase decision]]
The [[promotional mix]] refers to the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/promotion-mix.html&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is best treated as a ''multiplier'' that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''How Advertising Works: The Role of Research, Thousand Oaks, CA,1998, pp 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program.

The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:

[[File:Sales promotion 3x1 Tigros.JPG|thumb|Sales promotion includes a variety of activities such as special price offers designed to stimulate sales]]

:: '''[[Advertising]]''': messages paid for by those who send them and intended to inform or influence people who receive them&lt;ref&gt;Advertising Association of United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Branded content|Branded entertainment]]''': the dedicated production of content designed to display corporate or branded messages in an entertaining format&lt;ref&gt;Lehu, J-M, ''Branded Entertainment: Product Placement &amp; Brand Strategy in the Entertainment Business,'' Kogan Page, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Public relations]] (PR)''': the practice of maintaining goodwill between an organisation and its publics&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/public-relations.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Personal selling]]''': face-to-face selling in which a seller attempts to persuade a buyer to make a purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/personal-selling.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
:: '''[[Direct marketing]]''': contacting and influencing carefully chosen prospects with means such as telemarketing and direct mail&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/direct-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
::'''[[Sponsorship]]''': the act of providing money for a television or radio program, website, sports event, or other activity usually in exchange for advertising or other form of promotion&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Dictionary, http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/sponsorship&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''[[Product placement]]''':  the practice of supplying a product or service for display in feature films or television programs&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online:http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-placement.html&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''[[Sales promotion]]''' / merchandising: activities designed to stimulate sales normally at the point-of-sale; includes retail displays, product sampling, special price offers, shelf talkers, contests, give-aways, promotional items, competitions and other methods&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/merchandising.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Event-driven marketing|Event marketing]]''': a planned activity of designing or developing a themed activity, occasion, display, or exhibit (such as a sporting event, music festival, fair, or concert) to promote a product, cause, or organization.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/event-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Exhibition]]s/trade shows''': events or shows (e.g. fashion shows, agricultural shows) where companies can display their wares or services&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trade-fair.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VogueThomso02.jpg|thumb|The Vogue Fashion Show is a special event designed to promote top designers' seasonal collections]]

Advertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real.  Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as ''[[integrated marketing communications]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated Marketing communications perspective,'' 6th ed., New York, McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2004. Note that Belch and Belch's definition is based on that provided by the Association of National Advertisers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 HKTDC Food Expo.jpg|thumb|Mounting a display at a trade-fair or exhibition, such as the Hong Kong Food Show, is part of a company's total promotional mix]]

Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. The "right" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson,E. and Moore, J., ''Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasive Voices,'' New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.

In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) ''Image integration'' refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) ''Functional integration'' refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) ''Coordinated integration'' refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) ''Stakeholder integration'' refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) ''Relationship integration'' refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," African Journal of Marketing Management, Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of National Advertisers (US), "ANA Survey Reveals Most Integrated Marketing Communications Programs Need Improvement,"  14 June 2006 Online: http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/402&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, integrating communications messages across a broad range of promotional formats and media channels is very difficult to achieve.

== Theories of advertising effects==

[[File:Piccadilly Circus, London - at night - Lyca Mobile and Hyundai (6438384381).jpg|thumb|Advertising messages are all around us, yet the mechanism which leads from exposure to brand advertising through to sales is not entirely clear]]

Studies have repeatedly demonstrated a clear association between advertising and sales response.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the exact process that leads from the consumer of being exposed to an advertising message through to a purchase or behavioral response is not entirely clear. Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, "Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the market place."&lt;ref&gt;Corkindale, D., "Setting objectives for advertising ", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 10, No. 3, 1976 pp.109–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. They identified four broad classes of model: ''cognitive information models'', ''pure affect models'', ''hierarchy of effect models'', ''integrative models'' and ''hierarchy-free models''.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratsas, D. and Ambler, T., "How advertising works: What do we really know?"

=== Cognitive information models ===

[[File:Auckland Yellow pages.jpg|thumb|A directory such as ''Yellow Pages'' can eliminate the need for extensive store visits and the need to recall brand names]]
Advertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), pp 7-20, Stable URL: 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers and that advertising provides consumers with information [[utility]] by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand.  For example, an advertisement in the ''Yellow Pages'' or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. Cognitive information models are also known as the ''central route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T. and Petty, R.E., "The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Volume 11, eds. Thomas C. Kinnear (ed), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, pp 673-675, http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6329/volumes/v11/NA-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), p. 7, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, S.B. and Lutz, R.J., "An Empirical Examination of the Structural Antecedents of Attitude toward the Ad in an Advertising Pretesting Context," ''Journal of Marketing'' Vol. 53, No. 2, 1989, pp. 48-65&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Ad cognition→ [[Attitude-toward-the-ad models|Attitude to ad]] (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) → Brand cognition → Attitude to brand(A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) →Purchase Intention (PI)

Theoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products).&lt;ref&gt;Bharadwaj, S.G., Varadarajan, P.R. and Fahy,J., "Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: a conceptual model and research propositions," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 57, no. 3, 1993, pp 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R. E, Cacioppo, J. T., and Schumann, D., "Central and Peripheral Routes to Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Role of Involvement," ''Journal of Consumer Research'', vol 10, 1983, 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure affect models ===

Pure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C.E., ''The Handbook of Communication and Corporate Reputation'', Chichester, Sussex, Wiley, 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. These models suggest that simple exposure is to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;)without any further cognitive processing. Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, M., ''Brand Strength: Building and Testing Models Based on Experiential Information,'' Springer, 2004, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:

::::Attitude to Ad (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) →   Attitude to Brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) → Purchase Intention (PI).&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J.F., Woo, C.M., Geason, J.A. and Kim, J.Y., "The Power of Affect: Predicting Intention," ''Journal of Advertising'', May–June, 2002, pp 7-17&lt;/ref&gt;

This path is also known as the ''peripheral route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Chuan-Feng, K. and Rodriguez, R. "Central and peripheral routes to persuasion: An individual difference perspective," ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', Vol 51, No. 5, 1986, pp 1032-1043. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.1032&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising).&lt;ref&gt;I. López, S. Ruiz, "Explaining website effectiveness: The hedonic–utilitarian dual-mediation hypothesis," ''Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,'' vol. 10, 2011, pp 49–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchy of effects models===

{{see also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|AIDA (marketing)|l2=AIDA}}
[[File:Generalised hierarcy of effects sequence.jpg|thumb|Generalised hierarchy of effects sequence (after Lavidge)]]
Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, [[DAGMAR marketing|DAGMAR]] and [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] and other variants. Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory,&lt;ref&gt;O’Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., "The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad," in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from [[brand awareness]] through to action (purchase and consumption).
 
:: '''Awareness''' –  The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising)
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Interest'''  –  The consumer becomes interested by considering the brand's fit with the consumer's lifestyle
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Desire'''     –  The consumer develops a favorable (or unfavorable) disposition towards the brand
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Action''' –  The consumer forms a purchase intention or actually makes a purchase
                                                                                                        
As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. Thus the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J.A. ''Marketing Management,'' Homewood, Ill. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:

: Cognition (Awareness/learning) → Affect (Feeling/ interest/ desire)→ Behavior (Action e.g. purchase/ consumption/ usage/ sharing information)&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. A. in: P. E. Earl and S. Kemp (eds.), ''The Elgar Companion to Consumer Research and Economic Psychology,'' Cheltenham 1999, pp 310-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, T.E., "The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective," '' Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising'' vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251–295&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits.

[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]

All hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as ''conversion.'' While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 363-364&lt;/ref&gt; Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.

In order to penetrate markets, it is essential that high levels of awareness are created as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitty, W., Baker, N. and Shimp, T.A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications'', Pacific Rim ed., Thomson, 2005, pp 13-17&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market as quickly as practical. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the promotional effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]]. Early in the campaign, the marketers should attempt to reach as many potential buyers as possible with high impact messages. Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotional activities such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments more likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.

===Integrative models===

Integrative models assume that consumers process advertising information via two paths – both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously. These models seek to combine the type of purchase with the consumer's dominant mode of processing.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon,K., Laczniak, R.N., Muehling, D.D. and Reece, B.B., "A Revised Model of Advertising Processing: Extending the Dual Mediation Hypothesis," ''Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising,'' Vol. 17, no. 2, 1995, pp 53-67&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative models are based on research findings indicating that congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed. That is, aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. In a recent experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five personality traits) were constructed for a single product. Findings suggest that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they aligned with participants' motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirsh | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Kang | first2 = S. K. | last3 = Bodenhausen | first3 = G.

There are many integrative frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Maclnnis, D.J. and Jaworski, B.J. "Information Processing from Advertisements: Toward an integrative framework," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 53, October, 1989 pp 1 -23&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the more widely used models are the grids developed by Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) (see below) and another devised by Rossiter and Percy, and which is an extension of the FCB approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T. and Vakratsas, D., "The Pursuit of Advertising Theory," ''Business Strategy Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J.,  "A Better Advertising Planning Grid," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21&lt;/ref&gt; These planning grids are very popular with advertising practitioners because of their ease of application.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, K. E.; Roy, D. P.; and L. B. Hershey (2002), "A Comparison of the Incidence of Advertising Strategies in Business-related Magazines: Service Versus Goods," ''Service Marketing Quarterly,'' Vol. 23, No. 4, 65-80; Wang L. and Praet C., "Message Strategy Typologies: A Review, Integration, and Empirical Validation in China," In: Verlegh P., Voorveld H., Eisend M. (eds), ''Advances in Advertising Research,'' Vol. VI, European Advertising Academy. Springer Gabler, Wiesbaden, 2016,, pp 201-213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid====

The FCB planning grid was developed by Richard Vaughan, who was the Senior Vice President at advertising agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, in the 1980s. The planning grid has two dimensions, involvement and information processing. Each dimension has two values, representing extremes of a continuum, specifically involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). These form a 2 X 2 matrix with four cells representing the different types of advertising effects.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: a Planning Model," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 20 no. 5, pp 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: A Planning Model Revisited," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 26 (January/February), 1986, pp 27-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coupé Jaguar XKR (X150) ventral.jpg|thumb|An expensive car is a high-involvement/ rational purchase (i.e., FCB Quadarant 1)]]

''Quadrant 1: ''High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.

''Quadrant 2'': High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. For example, magazines such as ''Vogue'' can help to create an up-market image.

[[File:Butterfly on cupcake at the 2009 Yelp Cupcake Crawl.jpg|thumb|Impulse purchases are low-involvement/ emotional purchase items that make consumers feel good (i.e., FCB Quadrant 4)]]

''Quadrant 3'': Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion.

''Quadrant 4'': Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should "congratulate" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. Examples of this approach include "McDonald's – You Deserve a Break Today" and "L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It".

===Hierarchy-free models===

Many authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, A., ''Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2011, pp 26-38&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and [[consumer neuroscience]] which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality.  Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model).&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T., ''Intermediate Advertising Effects: The MAC Model'', Working Paper No 96-906, Centre for Marketing, London Business School, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "What Can A Service Logic Offer Marketing Theory?" in Lusch, R.F. and Vargo, S.L., ''The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialogue, Debate and Directions'', New York, M E Sharpe, 2006, pp 354-364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising planning ==

Advertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives.  Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate  and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., Elliott, R.H. and Rosenbaum-Elliott, R., ''Strategic Advertising Management'', 5th ed., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Review the marketing plan ===

A review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process or it can involve a formal review, known as an ''audit''. The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.

The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, product(s) offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs.  All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. Each [[advertising campaign]] is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement.

====Overall communications objectives ====

Communications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to  trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort.&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T., Allen,C., and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion,'' Mason, Ohio, South-Western Cengage, 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shanklin, John K. Ryans ''Essentials of Marketing High Technology,'' Lexington Books, 1987 p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications objectives might include such things as to:
* increase purchase
* encourage trial
* encourage loyalty 
* position or re-position a brand 
* educate customers

These will need to be translated into advertising objectives.

==== Target market and target audience ====

[[File:Target Audience and Target market.jpg|thumb|Relationship between target market and target audience]]

The review should take note of the overall target market. However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the ''target audience'' for an advertising message and the ''target market'' for a product or brand.&lt;ref&gt;Copulsky, J.R. and  Wolf,M.J. "Relationship Marketing: Positioning for the Future", ''Journal of Business Strategy'', Vol. 11 no. 4, 1990, pp 16 – 20&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the target audience is  the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing: An Introduction|last=Kotler|first=Philip|last2=Armstrong|first2=Gary|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. Thus the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives.

====Push vs pull strategy ====

The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Varey,E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devising advertising objectives ===
{{See also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|SMART criteria}}

Setting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan.  Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. Advertising objectives should be '''S'''pecific, '''M'''easurable, '''A'''chievable and '''T'''ime-dependent (SMART).&lt;ref&gt;Koekemoer,L. and Bird, S.,''Marketing Communications,'' Lansdowne, South Africa, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks – that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, M., ''Advertising Management: Concepts and Cases'', New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach ('''D'''efining '''A'''dvertising '''G'''oals for '''M'''easured '''A'''dvertising '''R'''esults) developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, R.H., ''Defining Advertising Goals,'' New York, American Association of National Advertisers (AANA), 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects.&lt;ref&gt;Batra, R., Myers, J.G and Aaker, D.A., ''Advertising Management,'' 5th ed., India, Kindersley, pp 144-146&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 103-120&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''1. Category Need:''' The consumer's acceptance that the category (the product or service) is necessary to satisfy some need
: '''2. Brand awareness (brand recognition and brand recall):'''  The consumer's ability to recognise a brand or to recall a brand name from memory
: '''3. Brand preference (or brand attitude):'''  The extent to which a consumer will choose one brand over other competing brands in the category
: '''4. Brand action intention (purchase intent):'''  The consumer's self instruction to purchase a given brand
: '''5. Purchase facilitation:'''  The extent to which the consumer knows how and where to purchase the brand

|}

For many purchases, category need and purchase facilitation will be present in the customer's mind and can be omitted from the advertising objectives. However, for some purchases, the customer may not be aware of the product category or may not know how to access it, in which case these objectives will need to be addressed in the communications objectives. Brand awareness, brand preference and purchase intention are almost always included as advertising objectives.

===Setting advertising budgets ===

A firm's advertising budget is a sub-set of its overall budget. For many firms, the cost of advertising is one of the largest expenses, second only to wages and salaries.  Advertising expenditure varies enormously according to firm size, market coverage, managerial expectations and even managerial style. Procter and Gamble, the top US advertiser, spent US$4.3 billion in 2015 on national media&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B., "How Nation's Top 200 Marketers Are Honing Digital Strategies," Adage, 27 June 2016, &lt;Online:http://adage.com/article/advertising/top-200-u-s-advertisers-spend-smarter/304625&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusive of agency fees and production costs) while a small local advertiser might spend just a few thousand dollars in the same period.

The size of the budget has implications for the promotional mix, the media mix and market coverage. As a generalisation, very large budgets are required to sustain national television campaigns. Advertisers with tight budgets may forced to use less effective media alternatives. However, even advertisers with small budgets may be able to incorporate expensive main media, by focusing on narrow geographic markets, buying spots in non-peak time periods and carefully managing advertising schedules.&lt;ref&gt;George, L. J., ''The Blessings of Paid Advertising: DISCOVER The Industry Expert Tips For Maximizing ROI On A Tight Advertising Budget,'' Lasgeorges Books, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different methods are used to develop the advertising (and/or marketing communications) budget. The most commonly used methods are: percentage-of-sales, objective and task, competitive parity method, market share method, unit sales method, all available funds method and the affordable method.&lt;ref&gt;Shim, J.K. and Siegel, J.G. ''Marketing: Budgeting for Sales, Advertising, and Distribution,'' Wiley, 2015, DOI: 10.1002/9781118106754.ch1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Percentage-of-sales method====

Using the percentage-of-sales method, the advertiser allocates a fixed percentage (say 5% or 10%) of forecast sales value to  the advertising budget. This method is predicated on the assumption that advertising causes future sales volume.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary Online, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/percentage-of-sales-method.html&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of sales method is the easiest method to use and for this reason remains one of the most widely used methods for setting budgets.

A major problem with the %-of-sales method is that there is no consensus about the percentage value to apply. Some companies use industry averages as a guide to set their marcomms budget. The following table, based on industry averages, shows that the % value can vary from around 20% of sales to less than 1 percent.

====Objective and task method====

The objective and task method is the most rational and defensible of all budgeting methods. In this method, the advertiser determines the advertising objectives and then defines specific, measurable communication tasks that will need to be undertaken to achieve the desired objectives. Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T., ''Advertising, Promotion, and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications'', 7th ed., Mason, OH, Thomson South-Western, 2007 pp 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; This method is time-consuming and complex, and as a consequence has  been less widely used in practice, however, recent research suggests that more marketers are taking up this approach.&lt;ref&gt;West, D. and Prendergast, G.P., "Advertising and promotions budgeting and the role of risk", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 43, no. 11/12, 2009, pp.1457 – 1476&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competitive parity method====

The competitive parity method allocates the advertising or promotional budget based on competitive spending for comparable activities. This approach is a defensive strategy used to protect a brand market position.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'', Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/competitive-parity.html&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that rival firms have similar objectives and is widely used in highly competitive markets.  The main criticism of this method is that it assumes competitors know what they are doing in relation to advertising expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Parente, D. and Strausbaugh-Hutchinson, K., ''Advertising Campaign Strategy: A Guide to Marketing Communication Plans,'' 5th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2015
p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several approaches to using the competitive parity method:&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Tyagi, Arun Kumar ''Advertising Management'' New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, pp 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

: a) Allocate the same budget on advertising as a key rival;
: b) Allocate the budget based on the industry average expenditure levels;
: c) Allocate a similar percentage-of-sales as a key competitor;
: d) Allocate the same percentage-of-sales on advertising as the industry average;
: e) Use competitive activity as a benchmark to which sums are added or subtracted based on managerial judgement.

Competitive parity requires a detailed understanding of competitor's expenditure in key areas. Market intelligence used to inform this approach can be obtained by consulting company annual reports and also from commercial research service providers such as Nielsen's AdEx.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Advertising Expenditure, Online: http://www.nielsen.com/my/en/solutions/measurement/advertising-expenditure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the ''market share method'', ''unit sales method'', ''all available funds method'', ''affordable method'', ''marginal analysis'' and others. Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, P.W. and West, D.C., "A Fresh View of the Advertising Budget Process," Chapter 20 in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J. Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), Sage, 2007, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781848607897.n20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devising the creative strategy===

The creative strategy is also known as the ''message strategy.'' The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/creative-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the ''creative concept'' that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;du Plessis, D.F., ''Introduction to Public Relations and Advertising,'' p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey et al. developed a typology of nine creative strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, K.S., "From Producers to Consumers: Engagement through User-generated Advertising Contests", ''Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Consumption,'' Easton, M. S., Daugherty, T. and Burns, N.M., (eds), IGI Global, Information Science Reference, pp 631- 649&lt;/ref&gt; Initially  devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A., "Creative Strategy and Magazine Advertising Readership: A Pilot Study, " in ''Developments in Marketing Science,'' 2014, pp 236-237 Date: 08 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Coursaris, C, van Osch, and Brooks, B., "Social Media Marketing on Twitter: An Investigation of the Involvement-Messaging Engagement Link," in ''HCI in Business: First International Conference'', Fui-Hoon Nah, F. (ed), Springer, 2014, pp 155-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Laskey, H. A., Day, E. and Crask, M.R., "Typology of Main Message Strategies," ''Journal of Advertising,'' vol. 18, no. 1, 1989, pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

: * Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits
: * Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle

Informational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Chernev, A., ''Strategic Brand Management,'' USA, Cerebellum Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional appeals are often known as a ''soft-sell'' approach. Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Copley, P. ''Marketing Communications Management: Analysis, Planning, Implementation,'' Sage, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|}

In addition to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser also needs to consider the creative execution – which refers to the way that the message is presented.  Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear appeals, sex appeals, humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson, R, and Pickton, D,. ''Marketing: An Introduction'' Thousand Oaks, California, McGraw-Hill, 2010 pp 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media planning===
{{see also|Mass media|New media}}

[[File:Imaginative advertising on Brockenhurst Station - geograph.org.uk - 170785.jpg|thumb|Integrating the creative and the media can result in imaginative and powerful messages that grab attention and are noticed]]

Strategic media planning consists of four key decision areas:&lt;ref&gt;Dutka, S., ''Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising Results,'' 2nd ed, NTC Business Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

: 1) Setting media objectives (with reference to both marketing and advertising objectives);

: 2) Developing a media channel strategy for implementing media objectives – the broad vision of when and how to reach target audiences;

: 3) Designing media tactics – specific instructions about media vehicles, placement, preferred position;

: 4) Devising procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the media plan.

The traditional approach to media strategy was primarily concerned with setting objectives for message reach, weight and frequency. The contemporary approach, however, often treats the media strategy as an extension of the creative strategy.&lt;ref&gt;O’Guinn, T.C., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Management,'' 4th ed., 2006, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, L'Oreal Men's Expert promoted its skincare range on dry-cleaner hangers. When customers picked up their shirt, they found a $2 coupon and a message, "Your shirt doesn't come with wrinkles, why should your face?" This novel execution shows how media and creative can be integrated to generate powerful advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Drewniany, B.L. and Jewler, A.J., ''Creative Strategy in Advertising'' 10th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2011, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Setting media objectives ====

{{see also|Reach (advertising)|Media planning|Effective frequency}}

In terms of setting media objectives, the planner needs to address several key decisions:

* Who do we want to talk to? [Target market/ audience definition]
* How often does an audience member need to hear our message before it is noticed or achieves the desired consumer response? [Effective frequency]
* When do audiences cease to notice the ad, or become tired of seeing the ad? [Advertising wear-out]

A number of key definitions are essential for media planning purposes:&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Hall, ''Media Math,'' NTC Business Books, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Reach'' is defined as the number of households (or people) exposed to an advertising message in a given time period. 
: ''Frequency'' is defined as the average number of times a household (or person) is exposed to an advertising message in a given time period.
: ''Effective frequency'' refers to the minimum number of media exposures in order to achieve a specified communication goal
: ''Effective reach'' refers to the reach (% of households or people) at the effective frequency level.
: ''Gross Ratings Points (GRPs)''  is defined as reach multiplied by frequency and is a measure of overall campaign weight or intensity

With respect to reach objectives, planners must decide what proportion of the target market need to be exposed to the advertising message. It is not always be necessary to reach 100% of the target market. For new brands or brands with very low levels of awareness, it may be desirable to reach every member of the target market. However, for reminder type campaigns lower levels of reach may be all that is required.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, B., "The Expanded ARF Model: Bridge to the Advertising Accountability Future," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', March/April, 1997, 11-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Reach objectives are normally framed in terms of a percentage of market. For example, a reach objective might read; ''To reach 50% of women aged 18-25 years.''

With respect to frequency objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency in order to achieve the desired communications objective.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. P., "What Does Effective Frequency Mean in 1997?" (Part 1 of 2), ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 37, no. 4, 1997, pp 14-17&lt;/ref&gt; Media planners often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information.&lt;ref&gt;Naples, M.J., ''Effective Frequency: The relationship between Frequency and Advertising Awareness,'' Association of National Advertisers, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes known as the ''3+ Rule''. To this basic benchmark of three exposures, media planners recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, J.W., "Setting Frequency Levels: An Art or a Science?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 24, no. 4, 1984, I-9 to I-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Planners also need to consider the combined effects of reach and frequency (GRPs).  In an intensive campaign, the schedule will utilise both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). The overall campaign weight has implications for budgets and for media selection. In an intensive campaign (heavy weight campaign), the media strategy is normally skewed towards main media, which remains the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create stable brand awareness levels.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media channel strategy====

{{see also|Advertising media selection|Media buying}}

The first channel decision that needs to be made is whether to use a ''concentrated'' channel strategy or a ''dispersion'' channel strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''What's in a Brand?: Building Brand Equity Through Advertising,'' McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

; Concentrated channel strategy
: In a concentrated approach the planner invests most of the media expenditure in a single medium or a narrow range or media. 
; Dispersion channel strategy
: In a dispersion approach, the planner spends across a broad range of [[advertising media]].  The main advantage of a concentrated channel strategy is that the advertiser has the opportunity to achieve a high share-of- voice and can become the dominant advertiser in the selected channels. A dispersion approach allows the advertiser to reach a broader cross-section of the defined target market.

With reach and frequency objectives firmly in place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles to carry the message.  The media planner must determine the way that the advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home).  To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media audience research====

{{See also|Audience measurement|List of magazines by circulation|l2=Magazine circulation|Newspaper circulation|Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen Audio|National Readership Survey}}

Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. The  main purpose  of media research  is  "to  eliminate  waste  in  advertising by objectively  analysing the  media available for  promoting products  and  services".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the ''industry currency'' in audience measurement. Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency.

Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where  and  when  media is  used  and  the cost of data collection. All these methods involve [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] – that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process.

Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates.

Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Media Research, &lt;Online: www.nielsenmedia.co.nz/en/pdf/mri/28/mediaterms.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print Media'''
:* ''Circulation:'' the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)

:* ''Readership:'' the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)
 
:* ''Readership profiles:'' Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)

'''Broadcast Media'''
: * ''Average audience:'' The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage. Also known as a ''Rating'' or T.A.R.P  (Total Audience Rating Point).

: * ''Audience share:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) for a given channel over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the total audience potential for the total market. (The audience share is normally calculated by dividing a given channel’s average audience by the average audience of all channels).

: * '' Audience potential:'' The total number of people in a given geographical area who conform to a specific definition, such as the number of people with a television (or radio) set or the total number of people aged 6–12 years. Population potentials are normally derived from the census figures and are used to estimate the potential market reach.

: * ''Audience movement by session:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) who switch channels during a given time period.

: * ''Audience profile:'' Analysis of audience by selected demographic, psychographic or behavioural variables.

: * ''Cumulative audience (CUME):'' The number of ''different'' listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as ''reach''.

: * ''People Using Television (PUT)'': The number of people (or households) tuned to any channel during a given time period.

'''Out-of-home media'''

: * ''Opportunities to see (OTS)'' – a crude measure of the number of people who were exposed to the medium, For example, the number of cars that drive past an outdoor billboard in a given time period

'''Internet and digital media'''&lt;ref&gt;Bermejo, F., ''The Internet Audience: Constitution &amp; Measurement,'' New York, Peter Lang, 2007, pp 75-101&lt;/ref&gt;

: * ''Site traffic'':  The number of visitors to a website within a given time period (e.g. a month)

==== Media buying====
{{main article|Media buying}}

While it is certainly possible for advertisers to purchase advertising spots by dealing directly with media owners (e.g. newspapers, magazines or broadcast networks), in practice most media buying is purchased as part of broader negotiations. Prices depend on the advertiser's prior relationship with the network, the volume of inventory being purchased, the timing of the booking and whether the advertiser is using cross-media promotions such as product placements. Advertising spots purchased closer to air-time tend to be more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, B., "Sunday Night Football' Remains Costliest TV Show: Prices Overall See Decline," ''AdAge,'' 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisers opt to centralise their media buying through large media agencies such as Zenith or Optimedia. These large media agencies are able to exert market power through volume purchasing by buying up space for an entire year. Media agencies benefit advertisers by providing advertising units at lower rates and also through the provision of added value services such as media planning services.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Buying advertising spots on national TV is very expensive. Given that most media outlets use dynamic pricing, rates vary from day to day, creating difficulties locating indicative rates. However, from time to time, trade magazines publish adrates which may be used as a general guide. The following table provides indicative advertising rates for selected popular programs on American national television networks, broadcast during prime time viewing hours.

====Pulling it all together: Media tactics and the media schedule====

[[File:Sample Media Schedule.jpg|thumb|The media schedule includes specific detail such as dates, media, position, placement]]

A media schedule is a program or plan that "identifies the media channels used in an advertising campaign, and specifies insertion or broadcast dates, positions, and duration of the messages".&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media-schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:&lt;ref&gt;Pickton, D. and Broderick, A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Prentice-Hall,2001. p. 671&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broad Approaches to Scheduling-1.jpg|thumb|Blitzing,continuity, flighting and pulsing are the main schedule patterns]]

: ''Blitzing'': one concentrated burst of intense levels of advertising, normally during the initial period of the planning horizon
: ''Continuity'': a pattern of relatively constant levels throughout a given time period or campaign (i.e. a relatively expensive spending pattern)
: ''Flighting'': an intermittent pattern of bursts of advertising followed by no advertising (i.e. a moderate spending pattern)
: ''Pulsing'':  a combination of both continuity and pulsing; low levels of continuous advertising followed by bursts of more intense levels of advertising; (i.e. alternates between a high spending pattern and a low spending pattern)

Empirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratas, D. and Naik, P. "Essentials of Media Planning Schedules", in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), London, Sage, 2007, pp 333-348&lt;/ref&gt; With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, K. A. "If not effective frequency, then what?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', July-Aug. 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R and Danaher, P.J., ''Advanced Media Planning'', Volume 1, Kluwer Academic, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping.

==Measuring advertising effectiveness==

{{see also|Advertising research}}

Advertising is a major expense for most firms. Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects.  The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, G. R., ''Marketing Calculator: Measuring and Managing Return on Marketing Investment,'' Hoboken, NJ, Wiley, 2008, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing:&lt;ref&gt;Australian Graduate School of Management, ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness: Copy Testing (pre-testing) Ads and Tracking (post-testing) the Campaign,'' [Working Paper Series], Vol. 92, Issue 20, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, M.A., Haley, E.E., Sheehan, K.B. and Taylor, R.E., ''Using Qualitative Research in Advertising: Strategies, Techniques, and Applications,'' 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects.

:* ''Pre-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses

:* ''Post-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives.

=== Pre-testing ===
Sound pre-testing exhibits the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Pechmann, C. and Andrews, C., "Copy Test Methods to Pretest Advertisements," in ''Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing'', Jagdish N. Sheth and Naresh K. Malhotra, (eds), Part 4, Advertising and Integrated Communication, Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

:(i) relevant to the communications objectives;
: (ii) agree on how results are to be used;
: (iii) use multiple measures;
: (iv) be theoretically grounded – i.e. based on a model of human response (e.g. hierarchy of effects); 
: (v) consider multiple exposures;
: (vi) test comparably finished executions;
: (vii) control the exposure context; 
: (viii) define the relevant sample; 
: (ix) demonstrate reliability and validity; 
: (x) take baseline (i.e., pre-exposure) measurements and/or use control groups

Specific types of pre-testing include copy tests, projective techniques and increasingly, a diverse range of physiological and/or biometric testing methods.

====Copy testing====

[[Copy testing]] is testing that evaluates advertising copy and creative executions.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-copy-testing&lt;/ref&gt; In this section, the principal methods of copy testing are briefly discussed.

=====Mock-ups=====
{{see also|Storyboard}}

[[File:Storyboard template example.svg|thumb|right|upright|A template used for storyboards]]

Researchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign. 

Types of advertising mock-ups that are used in copy testing, both print and broadcast advertising, include:&lt;ref&gt;Shah,K. and D'Souza, A.,''Advertising and Promotion: An IMC Perspective,'' New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2009, p. 873&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auditorio Fundacion.JPG|thumb|To pre-test advertisements, researchers might use face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests for larger audiences]]

: ''Rough art'':  very rough drawings of the creative concept

: ''Comps'': (abbreviation of "composition art") refers to rough art included along with copy, slogans and campaign strategy

: ''Rip-o-matics'': very rough versions of a TV commercial that include stock images and film footage designed to emulate the look and feel of the final creative execution; ripomatics are often called "mood" or "concept" videos.&lt;ref&gt;Siltanenm R., "The Real Story Behind Apple's 'Think Different' Campaign," ''Forbes,'' 14 December 2011, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/12/14/the-real-story-behind-apples-think-different-campaign/4/#52c1daf57eac Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Photo-matics'': include photographs along with the intended audio

: ''Storyboards'': a sequence of drawings or photographs accompanied by relevant copy and designed to resemble the final creative execution of a film or digital TV commercial.

: ''Animatics'': a more elaborate version of a storyboard that includes dialogue, sound tracks and voice overs that are intended to represent a more polished version of the final creative execution.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, ''Encyclopedia'', https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-storyboard&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Projective techniques=====
{{see also|Projective test|l1=Projective techniques}}

In projective techniques, the respondent is invited to project themselves into the advertisement. There are many projective techniques including word association, sentence completion and story completion. These techniques assume that when exposed to incomplete stimuli,  respondents use underlying attitudes or motivations to complete the storyline, thereby revealing their fears and aspirations that may not surface under more direct questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Soley, L., "Projective Techniques for Advertising and Consumer Research," ''American Academy of Advertising Newsletter,'' Vol, 6, No. 2, 2010, pp 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;
Projective techniques have been found to be very useful for evaluating concepts and generating new concepts.

====Physiological measures====

For decades, researchers have been using physiological measures to study such responses to advertising. These measures include such things as pupil response, electrode mal response (GSR) and heart rate. These measures have been shown to be effective measures of attention and the strength of emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, M. A., Holgerson, B.E., Belch, G.E&gt; and Koppman, J., "Psychophysiological and Cognitive Responses to Sex in Advertising", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Volume 09, Andrew Mitchell (ed.), Ann Abor, MI: Association for Consumer Research, pp 424-427.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of consumer neuroscience, researchers have begun to use a much wider range of measures to investigate cognitive responses as well as emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M.R., Cornell, L.D. and Nizan, A., ''Launch! Advertising and Promotion in Real Time,'' NY, Flat World Knowledge, n.d., p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the techniques used to measure consumer responses to advertising stimuli include:

=====Pupil dilation=====
The amount of pupil dilation (also known as ''pupillometry'') is believed to provide a relatively precise measure of the amount of mental effort associated with a task. Pupil dilation tests became a staple of advertising copy testing during the 1970s as a way to test consumers' responses to television commercials.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, J., "The Meaning of Pupil Dilation," ''The Scientist,'' 6 December 2012 &lt;Online: http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33563/title/The-Meaning-of-Pupil-Dilation/&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilation suggests a stronger interest in the stimuli and can be associated with arousal and action. Pupil dilation is not only used to study advertising, but also used to investigate product and package design.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel,M. and Pieters, R., ''Eye Tracking for Visual Marketing,'' [Foundations and Trends in Marketing Series], Hanover, MA, Now Publishers, 2010,  p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye tracking=====

{{see also|Eye tracking|AttentionTracking}}

While viewing an advertisement, a sensor aims a beam of infrared light at the eye and follows the movement to show the spot on which the viewer is focusing. This shows the length of time the viewer focuses on each element of the image and the general sequence used to interpret the image. Eye tracking is often used to fine tune advertising executions.  Research studies suggest that eye tracking is associated with brand recognition, but less useful for brand recall.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, W.D., ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness,'' Psychology Press, 2014, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Galvanic skin response (GSR)=====
{{see also|Electrodermal activity|l1=Galvanic skin response}}

Galvanic skin response uses a device, called a galvanometer, which is very similar to a lie detector, designed to measure minute amounts of skin perspiration and electrical activity in the skin. Changes in skin response are associated with arousal and are an indicator of the advertisement's ability to capture attention.&lt;ref&gt;Govoni, N.A., ''Dictionary of Marketing Communications,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage,
p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Electroencephelograph (EEG)=====

[[File:EEG recording.jpg|thumb|EEG testing is more invasive]]

An [[Electroencephalography|electroencephelograph]] (EEG) is a device that measures changes in brain-wave activity. EEG testing can detect emotional arousal which is difficult to detect using alternative testing methods. Arousal is an indicator of the advertisement's ability to grab attention and engage the consumer in the message. EEG testing is a cumbersome and invasive testing method which militates against routine use in advertising testing.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrzyniak,A and Wąsikowska, B., "The Study of Advertising Content with Application of EEG," [Chapter 21] in ''Selected Issues in Experimental Economics'' [Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics], Kesra Nermend, Małgorzata Łatuszyńska (eds), 2016, pp 333-353, {{ISBN|978-3-319-28419-4}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FmRI)=====
{{see also|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

FmRI is a technique that enables researchers to monitor activity in specific areas of the brain. This technique has been used to identify specific brain networks associated with pleasure and arousal associated with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Bolls, P.D., Wise, K. and Bradley, S.D., "Embodied Motivation Cognition: A Theoretical Framework for Understanding Cognitive Processes Underlying Advertising Exposure," in ''Advertising Theory,'' Shelly Rodgers and Esther Thorson (eds), NY, Routledge, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-testing===

The aim of post-testing is to provide indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, J., ''Developing Advertising with Qualitative Market Research,'' London, Sage, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, day-after recall tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures.

====Starch scores====

Starch scores were developed by [[Daniel Starch]] in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements, and are still in use today. A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:&lt;ref&gt;''AdAge'', Encyclopedia, http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/testing-methods/98903/&lt;/ref&gt;
: (1) ''Noted'' – the percentage of readers who recognize the advertisement as one they previously saw in the magazine issue (designed to capture the advertisement's ability to grab attention)
: (2) ''Associated'' – the percentage of readers who saw or read any part of the advertisement that clearly indicated the brand advertised (designed to indicate the level of brand processing)
: (3) ''Read most'' – the percentage of readers who read half or more of the ad's written material (an indicator of reader involvement or engagement)

====Day-after-recall tests (DARs)====

Day-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, S.J. and Bird, R., "The Day-after Recall Test of Advertising Effectiveness: A Discussion of the Issues",  ''Current Issues and Research in Advertising,'' volume 5, no. 1, 1982, pp 59-68 Published online: 18 May 2012, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01633392.1982.10505321&lt;/ref&gt;

: (a) ''Unaided recall'' – when respondents remember any commercials for the product category in question
: (b) ''Aided recall'' – when respondents remember seeing a commercial for Brand X 
: (c) ''Copy points'' – when respondents can recall what the brand showed, looked like and the main points of the commercial

====Tracking====
{{see also|Ad tracking}}

Ad tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the "in-market performance" of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-advertising-tracking-research&lt;/ref&gt; Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising ''wear-out''. When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use ''repetition with variation'' – that is, the use of different executions of the same message. Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Bushman, B., ''Social Psychology and Human Nature'', Belmont, CA, Thomson, 2008, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising return on investment (ROI)====

Advertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, "Maximize the Return on your Advertising Spend," 1 December 2009, &lt;Online: http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2009/maximize-the-return-on-your-advertising-spend.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers ==

Advertising management is a career path in the [[advertising]] or marketing industries. Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a [[public relations]] firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as ''account managers'' and their role involves working closely with client firms.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty,S., Mitchell, N.D., Wells, W.D., Crawford, R., Brennan,l. and Spence-Stone, R., ''Advertising: Principles and Practice,'' Melbourne, Australia, Pearson, 2012. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns.

A commonly expressed belief&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Robert (February 8, 2013). Trained in the US army. [http://www.factcheck.org/2013/02/rand-pauls-bin-laden-claim-is-urban-myth/ "Rand Paul’s Bin Laden Claim Is 'Urban Myth'"]. [[FactCheck.org]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter (May 6, 2011).

''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had ties with [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]] and its "[[Afghan Arab]]" fighters when it armed [[Mujahideen]] groups to fight the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].

In mid-1979, about the same time as the "Soviet deployment" into Afghanistan, the United States began giving several hundred million dollars a year in aid to the [[Afghan mujahideen#Afghanistan|Afghan Mujahideen]] insurgents fighting the Afghan Marxist government and [[Soviet–Afghan War|the Soviet Army]] in [[Operation Cyclone]]. Along with native Afghan mujahideen were Muslim volunteers from other countries, popularly known as "[[Afghan Arabs]]". The most famous of the Afghan Arabs was [[Osama bin Laden]], known at the time as a wealthy and pious Saudi who provided his own money and helped raise millions from other wealthy Gulf Arabs.

As the war neared its end, bin Laden organized the [[al-Qaeda]] organization to carry on armed [[jihad]] in other venues, primarily against the [[United States]]—the country that had helped fund the mujahideen against the Soviets.

A number of commentators have described Al-Qaeda attacks as "[[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]" or an [[unintended consequence]] of American aid to the mujahideen. In response, the American government, American and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani intelligence]] officials involved in the operation, and at least one journalist (Peter Bergen) have denied this theory. They maintain the aid was given out by the [[Pakistan]] government, that it went to Afghan not foreign mujahideen, and that there was no contact between the Afghan Arabs (foreign mujahideen) and the CIA or other American officials, let alone arming, training, coaching or indoctrination.

==Allegations==
The Central Intelligence Agency helped Osama bin Laden build an underground camp at [[Khost]], which bin Laden used to train Mujahideen soldiers.&lt;ref name="Guardian CIA camp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Bin Laden: the question facing the next US president|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/13/worlddispatch.lukeharding|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=12 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States would later attack this camp when bin Laden was held responsible for the United States embassy bombings in Africa.

In a 2004  article entitled "Al-Qaeda's origins and links", the [[BBC]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the anti-Soviet war Bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding. Some analysts believe Bin Laden himself had security training from the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm "Al-Qaeda's origins and links"]. [[BBC News]]. July 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robin Cook]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in the UK from 1997–2001, believed the CIA had provided arms to the Arab mujahideen, including Osama bin Laden, writing, "Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the '80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage war against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html|title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|author=Cook, Robin|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=2005-07-08 | location=London | date=2005-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conversation with former British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Michael Portillo]], two-time Prime Minister of Pakistan [[Benazir Bhutto]] said Osama bin Laden was initially pro-American.&lt;ref&gt;Benazir Bhutto, "[[Michael Portillo|Dinner with Portillo (2003-03-20)]]", BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt; Prince [[Bandar bin Sultan]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], has also stated that bin Laden once expressed appreciation for the United States' help in Afghanistan. On CNN's [[Larry King]] program he said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/01/lkl.00.html America's New War: Responding to Terrorism] CNN ''[[Larry King Live]]''. October 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bandar bin Sultan: This is ironic. In the mid-'80s, if you remember, we and the United - Saudi Arabia and the United States were supporting the Mujahideen to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets. He [Osama bin Laden] came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists. Isn't it ironic?

Larry King: How ironic. In other words, he came to thank you for helping bring America to help him.

Bandar bin Sultan: Right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bin Laden comes home to roost|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3340101/t/bin-laden-comes-home-roost/#.V4mTgFe-67U|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposing view==
[[File:Bergen, Peter (2007) crop.jpg|thumb|Peter Bergen]]
U.S. government officials and a number of other parties maintain that the U.S. supported only the indigenous Afghan mujahideen. They deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them. Many American scholars and reporters have called the idea of a CIA-backed Al Qaeda "nonsense",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Olivier |title=Globalized Islam: The Search for a New Ummah |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-231-13498-3 |pages=291–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9eFGcsWnwEC&amp;pg=PA291}}&lt;/ref&gt; "sheer fantasy",&lt;ref name="Sageman, p.57-58"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sageman |first=Marc |title=Understanding Terror Networks |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8122-3808-7 |pages=57–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAQ8Oa6zWF4C&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "simply a folk myth."&lt;ref name=BERGEN-BIN-LADEN-CIA-LINKS-HOGWASH/&gt;

They argue that:
*With a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land.
*With several hundred million dollars a year in funding from non-American, Muslim sources, Arab Afghans themselves would have no need for American funds.
*Americans could not train mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of U.S. agents to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jouvenal quoted in {{cite book |last=Bergen |first=Peter |title=Holy War Inc. |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-3467-7 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRhZDrJb0zgC&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Afghan Arabs were militant Islamists, reflexively hostile to Westerners, and prone to threaten or attack Westerners even though they knew the Westerners were helping the mujahideen.
*The US government greatly feared arming or training Arabs would lead to attacks on Israel with those arms or training.

Al-Qaeda leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] says much the same thing in his book ''Knights Under the Prophet's Banner''.&lt;ref name=DID-THE-US-CREATE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the U.S. "Create" Osama bin Laden? |date=2005-01-14 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |archivedate=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden himself once said "The collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role," but "collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages to the World'', 2006, p.50. (March 1997 interview with Peter Arnett&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ghost Wars]]'' (2004), [[Steve Coll]] recounted: "Bin Laden moved within Saudi intelligence's compartmented operations, outside of CIA eyesight. CIA archives contain no record of any direct contact between a CIA officer and bin Laden during the 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Steve Coll|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=[[Ghost Wars]]: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2004|isbn=9781594200076|pp=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, "Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently."&lt;ref name=BERGEN-BIN-LADEN-CIA-LINKS-HOGWASH&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash|date=2006-08-15|work=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen quotes Pakistani Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, who ran the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Afghan operation between 1983 and 1987:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was always galling to the Americans, and I can understand their point of view, that although they paid the piper they could not call the tune. The CIA supported the mujahideen by spending the taxpayers' money, billions of dollars of it over the years, on buying arms, ammunition, and equipment. It was their secret arms procurement branch that was kept busy. It was, however, a cardinal rule of Pakistan's policy that no Americans ever become involved with the distribution of funds or arms once they arrived in the country. No Americans ever trained or had direct contact with the mujahideen, and no American official ever went inside Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Holy War Inc. p.66" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marc Sageman]], a Foreign Service Officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987–1989, and worked closely with Afghanistan's Mujahideen, states that no American money went to the foreign volunteers.

Sageman also says:&lt;ref name="Sageman, p.57-58" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; Contemporaneous accounts of the war do not even mention [the Afghan Arabs]. Many were not serious about the war. ... Very few were involved in actual fighting. For most of the war, they were scattered among the Afghan groups associated with the four Afghan fundamentalist parties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No U.S. official ever came in contact with the foreign volunteers. They simply traveled in different circles and never crossed U.S. radar screens. They had their own sources of money and their own contacts with the Pakistanis, official Saudis, and other Muslim supporters, and they made their own deals with the various Afghan resistance leaders."&lt;ref name="Sageman, p.57-58" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vincent Cannistraro, who led the Reagan administration's Afghan Working Group from 1985 to 1987, puts it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The CIA was very reluctant to be involved at all. They thought it would end up with them being blamed, like in Guatemala." So the Agency tried to avoid direct involvement in the war, ... the skittish CIA, Cannistraro estimates, had less than ten operatives acting as America's eyes and ears in the region. Milton Bearden, the Agency's chief field operative in the war effort, has insisted that "[T]he CIA had nothing to do with" bin Laden. Cannistraro says that when he coordinated Afghan policy from Washington, he never once heard bin Laden's name.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Republic]]'', "TRB FROM WASHINGTON,  Back to Front" by Peter Beinart, Post date 09.26.01 | Issue date 10.08.01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Fox News]] reporter [[Richard Miniter]] wrote that in interviews with the two men who "oversaw the disbursement for all American funds to the anti-Soviet resistance, Bill Peikney—CIA station chief in Islamabad from 1984 to 1986—and Milt Bearden—CIA station chief from 1986 to 1989—he found,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both flatly denied that any CIA funds ever went to bin Laden. They felt so strongly about this point that they agreed to go on the record, an unusual move by normally reticent intelligence officers. Mr. Peikney added in an e-mail to me: “I don’t even recall UBL [bin Laden] coming across my screen when I was there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,98115,00.html|accessdate=2009-10-06|title=Dispelling the CIA-Bin Laden Myth|department=International|work=[[Fox News]]|first=Richard|last=Miniter|date=2003-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other reasons advanced for a lack of a CIA-Afghan Arab connection of "pivotal importance," (or even any connection at all), was that the Afghan Arabs themselves were not important in the war but were a "curious sideshow to the real fighting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |title=Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=2006 |isbn=0-375-41486-X |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8dCnb4uR63EC&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One estimate of the number of combatants in the war is that 250,000 Afghans fought 125,000 Soviet troops, but only 2000 Arab Afghans fought "at any one time".&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Arab Afghan fighter Abdullah Anas and Afghan CIA station chief Milt Berden. {{cite book |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |title=Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=2006 |isbn=0-375-41486-X |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8dCnb4uR63EC&amp;pg=PA105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Milton Bearden]] the CIA did not recruit Arabs because there were hundreds of thousands of Afghans all too willing to fight. The Arab Afghans were not only superfluous but "disruptive," angering local Afghans with their more-Muslim-than-thou attitude, according to Peter Jouvenal.&lt;ref name="Holy War Inc. p.66"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergen |first=Peter |title=Holy War Inc. |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-3467-7 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRhZDrJb0zgC&amp;pg=PA66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran Afghan cameraman Peter Jouvenal quotes an Afghan mujahideen as saying "whenever we had a problem with one of them [foreign mujahideen], we just shot them. They thought they were kings."

Many who traveled in Afghanistan, including Olivier Roy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Olivier |title=Globalized Islam : the Search for a New Ummah |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-231-13498-3 |page=293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9eFGcsWnwEC&amp;pg=PA293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter Jouvenal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergen |first=Peter |title=Holy War Inc. |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-3467-7 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRhZDrJb0zgC&amp;pg=PA65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported of the Arab Afghans' visceral hostility to Westerners in Afghanistan to aid Afghans or report on their plight. BBC reporter [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] tells the story of running into Osama bin Laden in 1989, and with neither knowing who the other was, bin Laden attempting to bribe Simpson's Afghan driver $500—a large sum in a poor country—to kill the infidel Simpson. When the driver declined, Bin Laden retired to his "camp bed" and wept "in frustration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=John |title=A Mad World, My Masters: Tales from a Traveller's Life |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=2000 |isbn=0-333-72420-8 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FNLhCMdIBoC&amp;pg=PA83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==

Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] who were key allies of Bin Laden over many years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dvtQI1aANTIC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=jalaluddin,+bin+laden&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EVOP5nZNmO&amp;sig=g-kAywYMn8w6RTgcuxUqBesl7pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK5Y-FqurRAhXhjlQKHXORDVgQ6AEIODAH#v=onepage&amp;q=jalaluddin%2C%20cia%2C%20bin%20laden&amp;f=false Anand Gopal, et al, "Taliban in North Waziristan" in ''Talibanistan: Negotiating the Borders Between Terror, Politics, and Religion'', Peter Bergen, Katherine Tiedemann eds, p.132-142]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB389/ "The Haqqani History: Bin Ladin's Advocate Inside the Taliban" National Security Archive, September 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Haqqani—one of Bin Laden's closest associates in the 1980s—received direct cash payments from CIA agents, without the mediation of the ISI ([[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] described Haqqani as "goodness personified").

The '''Arafundi languages''' are a small [[language family|family]] of clearly related languages, namely 
:[[Andai language|Andai]] (Meakambut), [[Nanubae language|Nanubae]], [[Tapei language|Tapei]] and [[Karamba language|Karamba]] (Kansomai)
''Alfendio'' is an old synonym for ''Arafundi'', from when it was still considered a single language.

[[Donald Laycock|Laycock]] (1973) grouped the Arafundi languages with the [[Ramu languages]], although (according to his comments in the introduction) this grouping was apparently impressionistic and not based on either reconstructive work or lexicostatistics. Ross (2005) retains Laycock's grouping without comment. However, [[William A. Foley|Foley]] (2005) does not include Arafundi within Ramu, and ''Ethnologue'' (2009) shows them as an independent family. Foley has suggested instead that the Arafundi and [[Piawi languages]] may be related (Comrie 1992), a position confirmed by Timothy Usher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/arafundi-and-upper-yuat-rivers NewGuineaWorld Arafundi and Upper Yuat Rivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulatory speech recognition''' means the recovery of speech (in forms of phonemes, syllables or words) from acoustic signals with the help of articulatory modeling or an extra input of articulatory movement data.&lt;ref&gt;J. Frankel and S. King, "ASR&amp;nbsp;– articulatory speech recognition" In Proc. Eurospeech, pp. 599–602, Aalborg, Denmark, Sep. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech recognition]] (or automatic speech recognition, acoustic speech recognition) means the recovery of speech from acoustics (sound wave) only.  Articulatory information is extremely helpful when the acoustic input is in low quality, perhaps because of noise or missing data.

'''Bariba''', also known as '''Baatonum''' (also Baatombu, Baatonu, Barba, Barganchi, Bargawa, Bargu, Baruba, Berba, Bogung, and Burgu), is the language of the [[Bariba people]] of [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]] and was the language of the state of [[Borgu]]. It is not closely related to neighbouring languages as a member of the [[Savanna languages|Savannas]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]].

Bariba is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language.&lt;ref&gt;N.L. Haddock (1959) The tones of Bariba ''Phonetica'' 3:90-94&lt;/ref&gt; Tonal patterns in Bariba have been claimed to present a challenge to the Two-Feature Model of tonal phonology.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Michaud, and Patin, Do we need tone features?

'''[http://www.dblab.upatras.gr/balkanet/ The] Bulgarian WordNet''' ('''BulNet''') is a lexical semantic network of Bulgarian following the Princeton [[WordNet]] (PWN) framework which implements the traditional semantic networks whose structure consists of nodes and relations between the nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, S., G. Totkov and A. Genov. Towards Bulgarian WordNet. Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology, Vol. 7, No. 1-2, 45-61, 2004. {{ISSN|1453-8245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, S. Bulgarian WordNet – development and perspectives. In International Conference Cognitive Modeling in Linguistics, Varna, 2005, 270-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, S. Bulgarian Wordnet - current state, applications and prospects. In Bulgarian-American Dialogues, Prof. M. Drinov Academic Publishing House, Sofia, 2010, 120-132. {{ISBN|978-954-322-383-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== General information ==
BulNet was started within the EU-funded project [[BalkaNet]] - a Multilingual Semantic Network of the Balkan Languages directed to the construction of synchronized semantic databases for the following Balkan languages - Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Turkish and the expansion of the Czech lexical-semantic network. After BalkaNet's completion the development of the Bulgarian WordNet has continued within the nationally-funded projects BulNet - a Lexical-semantic Network of Bulgarian (2005-2010) and Language E-resources and Processing Tools (2011-2013); the latter is co-funded under the project CESAR: Central and South-East European Resources (Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme Call: CIP ICT-PSP-2010-4).

== Contents of BulNet ==

===Categories===
Currently the Bulgarian WordNet comprises more than 80,000 (as of April 15, 2015) synonym sets distributed into nine parts of speech - nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, particles and interjections. The words included in the Bulgarian WordNet have been selected according to different criteria, the main ones being frequency analysis of the word occurrences in large text corpora (taking account of the number of occurrences of citation forms and not of wordforms), as well as the inclusion of synsets already featuring in the wordnets of other languages and synsets that correspond to high-frequency word senses found in parallel corpora.

===Synsets===
Each synonym set - SYNSET encodes the relation of equivalence between a number of lexical items - LITERALS (at least one should be explicitly represented in the SYNSET), each of them having a unique meaning (specified by the value of SENSE) - which pertain to one and the same part of speech (specified as the value of POS) and represent one and the same lexical meaning (specified as the value of DEF). Each synset is linked to its counterpart in PWN 3.0 by means of a unique identification number - ID. The common synsets in the Balkan languages are marked as common concepts subsets - BCS. In a monolingual database a synset should be linked to at least one other synset through an intralingual relation. Non-obligatory information may also be encoded such as examples of usage, stylistic peculiarities, morphological or syntactic properties, author and last edit details.

===Semantic relations===
The large number of relations encoded in the Bulgarian wordnet effectively illustrates the language's semantic and derivational richness that offers diverse opportunities for numerous applications of the multilingual database. The Bulgarian electronic semantic database offers linguistic solutions at the semantic level such as options for synonym selection, queries for semantic relations of a word in the language's lexical system (antonymy, holonymy, etc.), explanatory definition queries and translation equivalents for a lexical item. The Bulgarian wordnet is an electronic multilingual dictionary of synonym sets along with their explanatory definitions and sets of semantic relations with other words in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, S. Derivational and morphosemantic relations in Bulgarian Wordnet. In Intelligent Information Systems, XVI, Warsaw, Academic Publishing House, 2008, 359—389. {{ISBN|978-83-60434-44-4}}. {{cite web |url=http://dcl.bas.bg/PDF/BWN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122159/http://dcl.bas.bg/PDF/BWN.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsvetana Dimitrova, Ekaterina Tarpomanova and Borislav Rizov.

==Hydra==

Hydra is an OS-independent system designed for wordnet development, validation and exploration. The program enables users to browse and edit any number of monolingual wordnets at a time. The individual wordnets are synchronised, so that equivalent synonym sets, or synsets, may be viewed and explored in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Borislav Rizov. Hydra: A Software System for Wordnet.

'''Chava Rosenfarb''' (9 February 1923 – 30 January 2011) ({{lang-pl|Chawa Rosenfarb}}, {{lang-yi|חוה ראָזענפֿאַרב }}) was a [[Holocaust]] survivor and [[Jewish-Canadian]] author of [[Yiddish]] poetry and novels, a major contributor to post-World War II [[Yiddish Literature]]. Rosenfarb  began writing poetry at the age of eight.

After surviving the [[Łódź Ghetto]] during the [[occupation of Poland]] by Nazi Germany, Rosenfarb was deported to [[Auschwitz]], and then sent with other women to a work camp at Sasel (subcamp of [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]), where she built houses for the bombed out Germans of Hamburg. Towards the end of war she was sent to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], where she fell ill with nearly-fatal [[Typhus|typhus fever]] in April 1945. After the end of the war, while still in Europe, Rosenfarb married the future nationally-famous Canadian abortion activist Dr. [[Henry Morgentaler]] (the two divorced in 1975). In 1950, she and Morgentaler emigrated to Canada. Morgentaler and Rosenfarb, pregnant with Goldie, their daughter, emigrated from Europe to Canada, landing in [[Montreal|Montréal]] in the winter of 1950, to a reception of Yiddish writers at [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]].&lt;ref name=abley&gt;[[Mark Abley]], ''Spoken Here: travels among threatened languages'' (Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003), pp. 209-212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rosenfarb continued to write in Yiddish. She published three volumes of poetry between 1947 and 1965. In 1972, she published what is considered to be her masterpiece, ''Der boim fun lebn'' (דער בוים פֿון לעבן), a [[three-volume novel]] detailing her experiences in the [[Łódź Ghetto]], which appeared in English translation as ''The Tree of Life''.&lt;ref name=abley/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldie&gt;[[Goldie Morgentaler]], [http://chavarosenfarb.com/biography Chava Rosenfarb Biography] at chavarosenfarb.com, accessed 25 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Her other novels are ''Botshani'' (באָטשאַני), a prequel to ''The Tree of Life'', which was issued in English as two volumes, ''Bociany'' (meaning [[Stork]]s in the Polish language) and ''Of Lodz and Love''; and ''Briv tsu Abrashen'' (בריוו צו אבראשען), or Letters to Abrasha (not yet translated).

Rosenfarb's readership decreased as the secular Yiddish culture in the Americas began to erode and assimilate, so she turned to translation. She was a regular contributor to the Yiddish literary journal ''Di Goldene Keyt'' (די גאָלדענע קייט)&amp;nbsp;– meaning, roughly translated, "The Golden Chain (of Generations)"&amp;nbsp;– edited in [[Tel Aviv]] by the poet and [[Vilna Ghetto]] survivor [[Abraham Sutzkever]], until it closed.&lt;ref&gt;Abley (2003), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of her stories in English translation, ''Survivors: Seven Short Stories'', was published in 2004. A play, ''The Bird of the Ghetto'', was performed in Hebrew translation in Israel by Israel's nation theatre, the Habimah, in 1966 and in English translation in Toronto by Theshold Theatre in 2012. A selection of her poetry was published in English in 2013 as ''Exile at Last''. Most of the poems were translated by Rosenfarb herself.

==Death==
She died on 30 January 2011 in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=goldie/&gt; Her daughter, [[Goldie Morgentaler]], is a professor of English literature at the University of Lethbridge as well as a prominent literary translator into English of her mother's work. Her son Abraham is a doctor in Boston and the author of several books on urology and men's health.

==Honours and awards==
Rosenfarb was the recipient of numerous international literary prizes, including the Manger Prize, Israel's highest award for Yiddish literature, as well as a [[Canadian Jewish Book Award]] and the [[John Glassco Prize]] for Literary Translation. She was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 2006.

[[File:Wiki-dthroat.png|thumb|Illustration of a woman deep-throating a man]]

'''Deep-throating''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] in which a person takes a partner's entire erect [[Human penis|penis]] deep into the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and throat. The practice is a type of [[fellatio]] where the receptive partner (the one whose mouth receives the penis) is in control, while deep throat penetration by an actively thrusting partner is called [[irrumatio]]; both are a form of [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZxVCHdCqOKYC&amp;pg=PA161 | title=Grandma's Sex Handbook | publisher=Intimate Press, USA | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Wright, Anne | year=2009 | pages=161 | isbn=978-0-578-02075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 | title=Leonardo da Vinci: A PSYCHOSEXUAL STUDY OF AN INFANTILE REMINISCENCE | publisher=MOFFAT YARD &amp; COMPANY | author=Freud, Sigmund | year=1916 | location=New York | pages=39 | quote=The situation contained in the phantasy, that a vulture opened the mouth of the child and forcefully belabored it with its tail, corresponds to the idea of fellatio, a sexual act in which the member is placed into the mouth of the woman. | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deep-throating, the penis has to be long enough so that it can reach the back of the recipient's throat.&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"/&gt;

The technique and term were popularized by the 1972 [[pornographic]] film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']].

Deep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] triggered when the [[soft palate]] is touched.&lt;ref name="urlMedical Neurosciences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|title=Medical Neurosciences|last=McDougal|first=David|last2=Van Lieshout|first2=Dave|date=|website=|publisher=UW-Madison Medical school.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024508/http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|archive-date=March 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|last3=Harting|first3=John|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ | title=About WordNet - WordNet - About WordNet | publisher=Princeton University. | date=2010 | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, and with practice, some people learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular [[fellatio]]: the tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible;&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8qtd61hoB8C&amp;pg=PA260 | title=The Bedside Orgasm Book: 365 Days of Sexual Ecstasy | publisher=Fair Winds Press | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Gentry, Cynthia W. | year=2005 | location=Gloucester, Massachusetts USA | pages=260 | isbn=1-59233-101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[glans penis]] can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the [[pharynx]].

== Sex positions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are several [[Sex positions|positions]] that are well suited for performing deep throat. Relaxation of the throat muscles is the most important aspect of positioning. 

One common position is to align the mouth and throat into a straight line (like a [[sword swallower]]), but many different positions are possible. 

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the receptive partner lies back and hangs his or her head off the edge of a bed or similar piece of furniture, and the insertive partner stands or kneels in front of the face, lining up his penis at mouth level. 

Another common position used for deep-throating involves the insertive partner sitting on the receptive partner's chest, with his penis in front of the face.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33058">'''Electrical transcriptions''' are special [[Phonograph record|phonograph recordings]] made exclusively for radio broadcasting&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;Browne, Ray B. and Browne, Pat, Eds. (2001). ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture''. The University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-87972-821-3}}. P. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;, which were widely used during the "[[Golden Age of Radio]]". They provided material—from station-identification [[jingles]] and commercials to full-length programs—for use by local stations, which were affiliates of one of the radio networks.

Physically, electrical transcriptions look much like [[LP record|long-playing records]] that were popular for decades. They differ from consumer-oriented recordings, however, in that they were "distributed to [[radio broadcasting|radio stations]] for the purpose of broadcast, and not for sale to the public.... The ET had higher quality audio than was available on consumer records"&lt;ref name="musicbiz"&gt;Hull, Geoffrey P. (2011). ''The Music and Recording Business: Delivering Music in the 21st Century''. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-87560-8}}. P. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; largely because they had less surface noise than commercial recordings.&lt;ref name=beaupre&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beaupre|first1=Walter J.|title=Music Electrically Transcribed!|url=http://www.otrsite.com/articles/artwb006.html|website=The Vintage Radio Place|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of electrical transcriptions==
Electrical transcriptions were made practical by the development of [[Sound recording and reproduction#Electrical recording|electrical recording]], which superseded [[Thomas Edison]]'s original purely mechanical recording method in the mid-1920s. [[Orlando R. Marsh|Marsh Laboratories]] in Chicago began issuing electrical recordings on its obscure [[Autograph Records|Autograph]] label in 1924,&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;Holmes, Thom, Ed. (2006). ''The Routledge Guide to Music Technology''. Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-97323-6}}. P. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was [[Western Electric]]'s superior technology, adopted by the leading labels [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] and [[Columbia Phonograph Company|Columbia]] in 1925, which launched the then-new microphone-based method into general use in the recording industry.&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;Smith, William Ander (1990). ''The Mystery of Leopold Stokowski''. Associated University Presses, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8386-3362-5}}. P. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] are credited with being the first to produce electrical transcriptions. In 1928, they began distributing their ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' program to stations other than their 'home' station, [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] in Chicago,&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;Baker, Joan (2005). ''Secrets of Voice-over Success: Top Voice-over Artists Reveal How They Did It''. First Sentient Publications. {{ISBN|1-59181-033-7}}. P. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; by using 12-inch 78 RPM discs that provided two five-minute segments with a commercial break between.&lt;ref name="america"&gt;Millard, Andre (2005). ''America on Record: A History of Recorded Sound''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-83515-1}}. P. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

One audio historian wrote: "new methods of electronic reproduction and improved record material that produced very little background noise were developed … by the end of the decade, the use of old phonograph music had largely been replaced by the new electrical transcription ... with the fidelity available, it was difficult to tell a transcription from the original artist."&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Henry B.D. (1983). ''Electrical and Electronic Technologies: A Chronology of Events and Inventors from 1900 to 1940.'' Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-1590-2}}. Pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1948 ad for a disc manufacturer touted the use of transcriptions on the [[Voice of America]], saying; "a substantial part of these daily programs is recorded and, due to the excellent quality of these transcriptions, such recorded portions cannot be distinguished from the ''live'' transmissions."&lt;ref name=bc041948&gt;{{cite news|title=(Audio Devices, Inc. ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-04-19-BC.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=April 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical transcriptions were often used for recording programs in old-time radio. Using a recording speed of [[LP record|33]]{{frac|1|3}} revolutions per minute (in contrast to the 78 RPM speed that was then standard for records for home use),&lt;ref name=mrm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fybush|first1=Scott|title=Electrical Transcriptions (ET's)|url=http://www.modestoradiomuseum.org/et.html|website=Modesto Radio Museum|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 minutes of material could be stored on one side of a typical 16-inch diameter transcription.&lt;ref name="recorded"&gt;Kenney, William Howland (1999). ''Recorded Music in American Life: The Phonograph and Popular Memory, 1890-1945''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-510046-8}}. P. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, commercially available 78 RPM records lasted for only 3–4 minutes per side and "had very poor frequency response."&lt;ref name="stay"&gt;Sterling, Christopher H. and Kittross, John Michael (2002). ''Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-2624-6}}. P. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in New York City was one of the first radio stations to broadcast transcriptions, starting in 1929. Other stations followed, until more than 100 were doing so, largely because "this new kind of recording made [[Radio programming|programming]] more flexible and improved sound."&lt;ref name=stay/&gt; [[John R. Brinkley|Dr. John R. Brinkley]] is generally credited with being the first performer to provide electrical transcriptions to radio stations.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Kingsbury, Paul; McCall, Michael; and Rumble, John W. (2012). ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-539563-1}}. P. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="louisiana"&gt;Laird, Tracey E. (2005). ''Louisiana Hayride: Radio and Roots Music Along the Red River''. {{ISBN|0-19-516751-1}}. P. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkley's use of the then-new technology arose out of necessity when agencies of the federal government prevented him from crossing from Mexico into the United States to use telephone lines to connect to U.S. stations remotely. "Brinkley began recording ... onto electrical transcription discs and sending them across the border for later broadcast."&lt;ref name=louisiana/&gt;

WOR used transcriptions for repeat broadcasts of programs. In 1940, for example, the station repeated episodes of Glenn Miller's and Kay Kyser's orchestras, ''The Goldbergs'' and ''Sherlock Holmes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chesterfield Repeating Glenn Miller Over WOR|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1940/Billboard-1939-02-10.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016|work=Billboard|date=February 10, 1940|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Electrical transcriptions were indispensable from the mid '30s to the late '40s," wrote Dr. Walter J. Beaupre, who worked in radio before moving into academia.&lt;ref name=beaupre/&gt;

==Transcription services==
As radio stations' demand for transcriptions grew, companies specializing in transcriptions grew to meet those demands. In October 1933, 33 companies competed in producing transcriptions.&lt;ref name="points"&gt;Russo, Alexander (2010).''Points on the Dial: Golden Age Radio beyond the Networks''. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|978-0822345329}}. P. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Such companies included [[Langlois &amp; Wentworth, Inc.]], [[RCA Thesaurus]], [[SESAC]], [[World Broadcasting System]] and [[Ziv Company]]. Associated Broadcasting Company transcription service, a former division of the [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak Corporation]] (Muzak sold its Manhattan studios, but not transcription service, to [[RCA Victor]] in 1951)&lt;ref name="Billboard 1951"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cEUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 "Muzak Studios In NY Bought by RCA Victor",] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', September 1, 1951, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribing to a major transcription service meant a station received an initial group of transcriptions plus periodically issued new discs and a license, which allowed use of the material on-air. Typically, a station did not own the discs; "they were leased for as long as [the] station paid the necessary fees."&lt;ref name=beaupre/&gt; Those fees typically ranged from $40 to $150 per week for eight 15-minute programs.&lt;ref name="amerpop"&gt;Sanjek, Russell (1988). ''American Popular Music and Its Business: The First Four Hundred Years -- Volume III, from 1900 to 1984''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-504311-1}}. P. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers for transcriptions were primarily smaller stations. Brewster and Broughton, in their book ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life,'' wrote; (transcriptions) "lessened the reliance on the announcer/disc jockey and, because [a transcription] was made specifically for broadcast, it avoided record company litigation." They quoted Ben Selvin, who worked for a transcription company, as saying, "Most stations could not afford the orchestras and productions that went into the network radio shows, and so we supplied nearly 300 stations with transcriptions that frequently -— but not always — featured the most popular bands and vocalists."&lt;ref name=brewster/&gt; A slogan used in an advertisement for one transcription service might well have been applied to the industry as a whole, "TRANSCRIBED .. so that advertisers everywhere may have 'radio at its commercial best.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Commodore Productions ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-17-BC.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=May 17, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1948 ad for the transcription service World Broadcasting System contained a letter which praised the company. S.A. Vetter, assistant to the owner of WWPB, AM and FM stations in Miami, Florida. wrote; "you will be interested in knowing that I consider the purchase of the World Feature Library as the best 'buy' I have made in my twenty-one years in Miami radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(World Broadcasting System ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=May 3, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of at least one library was indicated in another 1948 ad. One for Standard Radio Transcription Services, Inc. ad boasted of its Standard Program Library as; "now serving over 700 stations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Standard Radio Transcription Services ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-17-BC.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=May 17, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, an ad for another transcription service, World Broadcasting System, said, "over 640 stations now use this great world library."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(World Broadcasting System ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-04-19-BC.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=April 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another supply company, Associated Program Service, advertised its transcription library as being "not the usual one-shot recording date … not the routine disc or two … but real continuity of performance … a dependable, steady supply of fresh music … great depth of titles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Associated Program Services ad)|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele42unse#page/n141/mode/1up|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=Broadcasting|date=January 14, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the companies providing transcription services were radio networks. [[NBC]] began its electrical transcription service in 1934. Lloyd C. Egner, manager of electrical transcriptions at NBC wrote that with the NBC Syndicated Recorded Program Service (later named the RCA/NBC Thesaurus Library&lt;ref name=america/&gt;) the company sought "to make available to stations associated with NBC our extensive programming resources to help in the sale of their facilities to local advertisers."&lt;ref name=nbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egner|first1=Lloyd C.|title=NBC Disk Service Purpose Explained|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/34-OCR/1934-07-15-BC-OCR-Page-5.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=July 15, 1934}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "each program series … will be as completely programmed as if it were to be for a network client. In other words they will be designed to sell a sponsor's product or service."&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; A 1948 ad for NBC's service touted; "now 25 better shows tailored for better programming at lower cost," adding that the company's material was "programmed and proven over 1000 radio stations."&lt;ref name=nbcad&gt;{{cite news|title=(NBC Recorded Program ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-08-23-BC.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=Broadcasting|date=August 23, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] also had a transcription division, Columbia Recording Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schudt Returns to CBS June 8|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1942/1942-06-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capitol Records]], better known for its popular recordings, also had a transcription service. An ad in the trade publication ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting]]'' asked in a headline if the reader was "finding it tough to sell time?" The ad's text promoted 3,000 selections – with more added monthly – from [[Peggy Lee]], [[Jan Garber]], [[Johnny Mercer]] and other "top stars," adding, "more than 300 stations already use it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Capitol transcriptions ad)|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-04-19-BC.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=April 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source estimated; "by the end of the 1930s, [transcription] services had built up a market of $10 million."&lt;ref name=america/&gt;

Transcription services' programming was not limited to music. Mystery, drama and other genres of programming were distributed via transcription. At least two transcribed dramas, ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'' and ''[[Bold Venture]]'', were distributed to more than 500 stations each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What types of transcribed shows are most popular?|journal=Sponsor|date=July 14, 1952|volume=6|issue=14|page=78|url=https://archive.org/stream/sponsor52sponno2#page/n83/mode/1up|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC's transcription offerings included ''[[Aunt Mary (radio)|Aunt Mary]]'' (a soap opera), ''The Haunting Hour'' (a psychological mystery), ''The Playhouse of Favorites'' (a drama) and ''Modern Romances''.&lt;ref name=nbcad/&gt;

==Use by advertisers==
Advertisers found electrical transcriptions useful for distributing their messages to local stations. [[Radio advertisement|Spot advertising]] is said to have begun in the 1930s. "The spot announcements were easily produced and distributed throughout the country via electrical transcription" as an alternative to network advertising.&lt;ref name="histdict"&gt;Godfrey, Donald G. and Leigh, Frederic A., Eds. (1998). ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio''. Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-29636-7}}. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the spot [[jingle]] segment of transcriptions was estimated to have an annual value of $10 million.&lt;ref name=mj&gt;{{cite news|title=More About Those Golden Jingles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19440220&amp;id=lhwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DyMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4392,1572542|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=Milwaukee Journal|date=February 20, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits for performers==
Transcriptions proved advantageous for performers, especially musicians in the [[Big band|Big-Band Era]]. Using transcriptions helped them reach one audience via radio while making personal appearances in front of other audiences.&lt;ref name=louisiana/&gt; Additionally, if more stations used their transcriptions, that increased the audience for their music even more.&lt;ref name="southern"&gt;Malone, Bill C. and Stricklin, David (1979). ''Southern Music/American Music''. The University Press of Kentucky. {{ISBN|0-8131-9055-X}}. P. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; An item in a 1946 issue of ''[[Macfadden Communications Group|Radio Mirror]]'' magazine noted: "[[Bing Crosby]]'s transcription deal with Philco has started a rush of other sought-after radio performers for deals of a similar nature. Their advantages from such a setup include more free time and corporate setups to relieve their tax costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=(untitled brief)|journal=Radio Mirror|date=November 1946|volume=26|issue=6|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording commercial jingles for spot announcements was a source of income for performers and writers. In 1944, [[Cliff Edwards]] received $1,500 for recording a 30-second gum jingle.&lt;ref name=mj/&gt;

==Government use of transcriptions==
[[World War II]] brought a new use for electrical transcriptions—storage of audio material for broadcasting to people in the military. The [[Armed Forces Radio Service|American Forces Network]] began using ETs during that war and continued using them through 1998. More than 300,000 AFRTS electrical transcription discs are stored in a collection at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recorded Sound Section--Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awrs9/afrts.html|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcriptions "were often used for ... government-issued programs which were sent to the individual stations for broadcast on designated dates. Recruiting shows for the branches of military service arrived on such discs ... the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] shipped many programs during wartime as transcriptions."&lt;ref name=beaupre/&gt;

During the war, the federal government, in conjunction with the [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]], provided "approximately eight 15-minute transcribed programs every week to each of ... 35 college stations."&lt;ref name="ibs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Intercollegiate Broadcasting System|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-Radio-IDX/IDX/40s/Radio-1942-06a-OCR-Page-0064.pdf#search=%22transcription%22|accessdate=8 November 2014|agency=Radio|issue=No. 269|date=June 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of War]], [[United States Department of the Navy]], [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and United States Office of Education contributed to production of programs related to the war effort, such as ''The Treasury Star Parade'' and ''You Can't Do Business with Hitler''.&lt;ref name=ibs/&gt;

The [[Voice of America]] also used transcriptions, with one disc manufacturer noting in an ad, "A substantial part of these daily programs is recorded ..."&lt;ref name=bc041948/&gt;

==Other notable uses==
The network ban on prerecorded material was temporarily lifted on the occasion of the crash of the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in Lakehurst, New Jersey on 6 May 1937. A recording of the crash made for [[Chicago]] radio station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] by announcer [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|Herbert Morrison]] was allowed to be broadcast over the network by [[NBC]]. This is the well-known "oh, the humanity!" recording, usually heard only as a brief excerpt and reproduced at a speed which differs significantly from the original recording speed, causing Morrison's voice to sound unnaturally high-pitched and excessively frantic. When heard in its entirety and at the correct speed, the report is still powerful.

Transcription recordings from major American radio networks became commonplace during [[World War II]] as pressed vinyl copies of them were distributed worldwide by the U.S. Armed Forces Radio Service for rebroadcast to troops in the field. Disc-to-disc editing procedures were used to delete the commercials included in the original broadcasts, and when a sponsor's name was attached to the name of the program, it was removed as well—''Lux Radio Theater'', for example, became ''Your Radio Theater''. Although the discs were government property and were supposed to be destroyed after they had served their purpose, some were saved as souvenirs and countless thousands of them were simply dumped rather than actually destroyed. Many of the dumped discs ended up in the hands of scavengers and collectors. Often, these discs are the only form in which the broadcasts on them have survived, and they are one of the reasons why recordings of entertainment broadcasts from the 1940s still exist in abundance.

Well-known live broadcasts which were preserved on lacquer transcription discs include ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' dramatized as breaking news by the [[Orson Welles]] anthology program ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', heard over the [[CBS]] radio network on 30 October 1938.

Before [[magnetic tape]] recorders became available in the U.S., [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] concert broadcasts were preserved on transcription discs. After its conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] retired, he transferred many of these recordings to tape, with the assistance of his son Walter, and most were eventually released on LP or CD.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Sachs, ''Toscanini'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, NBC Radio continued to use the 16-inch disc format for archiving purposes into the early 1970s.

==Transcription discs==
A '''transcription disc''' is a special phonograph record intended for, or recorded from, a radio broadcast. Sometimes called a '''broadcast transcription''' or '''radio transcription''' or nicknamed a '''platter''', it is also sometimes just referred to as an '''electrical transcription''', usually abbreviated to '''E.T.''' among radio professionals.

Transcription discs are most commonly 16 inches (40 cm) in diameter and recorded at 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. That format was standard from approximately 1930 to 1960 and physically distinguishes most transcriptions from records intended for home use, which were rarely more than 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter and until 1948 were nearly all recorded at approximately 78 rpm. However, some very early (circa 1928-1931) radio programs were on sets of 12 inch or even 10 inch (25 cm) 78 rpm discs, and some later (circa 1960-1990) syndicated radio programs were distributed on 12 inch 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 rpm microgroove vinyl discs visually indistinguishable from ordinary records except by their label information.

Some unusual records which are not broadcast-related are sometimes mistakenly described as "transcription discs" because they were recorded on the so-called [[acetate disc|acetate]] recording blanks used for broadcast transcriptions or share some other physical characteristic with them. Transcription discs should not be confused with the 16-inch 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 rpm shellac [[Vitaphone|soundtrack discs]] used from 1926 into the early 1930s to provide the audio for some motion picture sound systems. Also a potential source of confusion are [[RCA Victor]]'s "Program Transcription" discs, 10 or 12 inch 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 rpm records pressed in [[shellac]] and "Victrolac" [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] in the early 1930s. Despite their suggestive name, they were not recorded from broadcasts or intended for broadcast use, but were an early and unsuccessful attempt to introduce longer-playing records at the 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 rpm speed for home use.

===Disc types===
Transcription discs are of two basic types: pressings and instantaneous discs.

Pressings were created in the same way as ordinary records. A master recording was cut into a blank wax or [[acetate disc]].&lt;ref&gt; Although the word "acetate" has long been standard in the broadcast industry and has come into general use, that term was and is abhorred as technically incorrect by engineers in the record industry, who refer to the discs as "lacquers", because the lacquer coating on them is actually [[cellulose nitrate]], not [[cellulose acetate]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was electroplated to produce a metal stamper from which a number of identical discs were pressed in shellac or vinyl in a record press. Although the earliest transcription discs were pressed in [[shellac]], in the mid-1930s quieter [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] compounds were substituted. These discs were used to distribute syndicated programming to individual radio stations. Their use for this purpose persisted long after the advent of magnetic tape recording because it was cheaper to cut and plate a master disc and press 100 identical high-quality discs than to make 100 equally high-quality tape dubs.

Instantaneous discs are so called because they can be played immediately after recording without any further processing, unlike the delicate wax master discs which had to be plated and replicated as pressings before they could be played non-destructively. By late 1929, instantaneous recordings were being made by indenting, as opposed to engraving, a groove into the surface of a bare [[aluminum disc]]. The sound quality of these discs was inadequate for broadcast purposes, but they were made for sponsors and performers who wanted to have recordings of their broadcasts, a luxury which was impractically expensive to provide by the wax mastering, plating and pressing procedure. Only a very few pre-1930 live broadcasts were deemed important enough to preserve as pressings, and many of the bare aluminum discs perished in the scrap metal drives of World War II, so that these early years of radio are mostly known today by the syndicated programs on pressed discs, typically recorded in a small studio without an audience, rather than by recordings of live network and local broadcasts.

In late 1934, a new type of instantaneous disc was commercially introduced. It consisted of an aluminum core disc coated with black [[cellulose nitrate]] lacquer, although for reasons which are unclear it soon came to be called an "acetate" disc by radio professionals. Later, during World War II, when aluminum was a critical war material, glass core discs were used. A recording lathe and chisel-like cutting stylus like those used to record in wax would be used to engrave the groove into this lacquer surface instead. Given a top-quality blank disc, cutting stylus, lathe, electronics and recording engineer, the result was a virtually noiseless broadcast-quality recording which could be played several times before the effects of wear started to become apparent. The new medium was soon applied to a number of purposes by local stations, but not by the networks, which had a policy against broadcasting prerecorded material and mainly used the discs for archiving "reference recordings" of their broadcasts.

Standard 16-inch transcription discs of the 1930s and 1940s usually held about 15 minutes of audio on each side, but this was occasionally pushed to as much as 20 minutes. Unlike ordinary records, some were recorded inside out, with the start of the recording near the label and the end near the edge of the disc. The label usually noted whether the disc was "outside start" or "inside start". If there was no such notation, an outside start was assumed. Beginning in the mid-1950s, some transcription discs started employing the "microgroove" groove dimensions used by the 12 and 10 inch 33 1/3 rpm vinyl [[LP record]]s introduced for home use in 1948. This allowed 30 minutes to fit comfortably on each side of a 16-inch disc. These later discs can be played with an ordinary modern stylus or a vintage "LP" stylus. The earlier discs used a larger groove, nearer in size to the groove of a typical 78 rpm shellac record. Using a "78" stylus to play these "standard groove" discs usually produces much better results, and also insures against the groove damage that can be caused by the point of a too-small stylus skating around in the groove and scoring its surface. Some specialist audio transfer engineers keep a series of custom-ground styli of intermediate sizes and briefly test-play the disc with each in order to find the one that produces the best possible results.

==The demise of transcriptions==
Beginning in the 1940s, two factors caused radio stations' use of transcriptions to diminish. After [[World War II]], use of transcriptions diminished as [[disc jockey]]s became more popular.&lt;ref name="brewster"&gt;Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (2014). ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey''. Grove Press. {{ISBN|978-0802146106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That increased popularity meant that stations began to use commercial recordings more than they had in the past. The trade magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported in a November 22, 1952, article, "Transcription libraries have come upon rough times, owing to the fact that records have largely taken the place of the old-fashioned E.T.'s."&lt;ref name=bb110252&gt;{{cite news|title=Seeks New Terms With ET Companies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XB8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Standard+Radio+Transcription+Services&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Se5BkBS07o&amp;sig=hReMrgqA8NYt0XF2uvKGGBzN80Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rMCDVN3uG4eYyATjroHABQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Standard%20Radio%20Transcription%20Services&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2014|agency=Billboard|date=November 22, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, decreased demand caused transcription services to reduce the royalty they paid copyright owners from $15 per tune per year to $10 per tune per year. By 1952, still less demand resulted in negotiations for a percentage of gross sales to replace the flat fee.&lt;ref name=bb110252/&gt;

By late 1959, at least two transcription service companies had gone out of business, selling their libraries to a company that provided recorded background music on tapes and discs. The purchaser acquired a total of approximately 12,000 selections from the two companies.&lt;ref name=bb110959&gt;{{cite news|title=Conley Adds More Top Background Tape Fare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Standard+Radio+Transcription+Services&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GvxHUywat0&amp;sig=NPwFECd6gojgfKjXN65xqYT-LkM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcKDVLjBJMyRyASEq4HADA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Standard%20Radio%20Transcription%20Services&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=Billboard|date=November 9, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetic tape]] and tape recorders became popular at radio stations after World War II, taking over the functions that in-house transcription disc recording had served. Tape's advantages included lower cost, higher fidelity, more recording time, possibility of re-use after erasing, and ease of editing.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Factory seconds''', also known as '''factory rejects''' or simply '''seconds''', are [[retail]] items which, through minor fault of manufacture, are sold to the public for a reduced rate, rather than being discarded. Such goods are often resold at this lower rate after failing the factory's quality inspection, being returned to the [[manufacturer]]'s factory by the original retailer, or (less frequently) being returned to the retailer or wholesaler by the [[customer]].&lt;ref name="WAFS"&gt;"[http://www.factoryseconds.org.uk/guides/what-are-factory-seconds/ What are factory seconds?]", ''factoryseconds.org.uk'' Retrieved 24 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of damage or fault in the manufacture which may constitute an item being resold as a second varies widely; in clothing, for example, it may simply refer to a single pulled thread or mis-sewn seam, whereas in a set of items (such as crockery) it may mean there is one piece missing from the set. Generally, an item listed as a factory second will have failed quality inspection for cosmetic, rather than functional, reasons. Such items are often heavily discounted, but may not have as all-encompassing a warranty or guarantee as a full-quality item (for example, the product may be non-returnable).&lt;ref name="WAFS"/&gt;

[[Discount store]]s often rely on the sale of factory seconds as a major part of their trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6768">'''Government and binding''' ('''GB''', '''GBT''') is a theory of [[syntax]] and a [[phrase structure grammar]] in the tradition of [[transformational grammar]] developed principally by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = LGB&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures]]|origyear=1981|year=1993|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|author=Chomsky, Noam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Some Concepts and Consequences of the Theory of Government and Binding|author=Chomsky, Noam|publisher=Linguistic Inquiry Monograph 6. MIT Press|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barriers|author=Chomsky, Noam|year=1986|publisher=Linguistic Inquiry Monograph 13. MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is a radical revision of his earlier theories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Syntactic Structures]] (Second Edition)|author=Chomsky, Noam|origyear=1957|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]|year=1965|publisher=MIT Press|author=Chomsky, Noam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1970). Remarks on Nominalization. In ''Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar'' (1972). The Hague: Mouton. Pages 11–61.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later revised in ''[[The Minimalist Program]]'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Minimalist Program]]|author=Chomsky, Noam|publisher=MIT Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several subsequent papers, the latest being ''Three Factors in Language Design'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chomsky, Noam|title=Three Factors in Language Design|year=2005|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|issue=36|pages=1–22|doi=10.1162/0024389052993655|volume=36|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/linguistic_inquiry/v036/36.1chomsky.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a large literature on government and binding theory which is not written by Chomsky, Chomsky's papers have been foundational in setting the research agenda.

The name refers to two central subtheories of the theory: ''[[government (linguistics)|government]]'', which is an abstract syntactic relation applicable, among other things, to the assignment of [[grammatical case|case]]; and ''[[binding (linguistics)|binding]]'', which deals chiefly with the relationships between [[pronouns]] and the expressions with which they are [[co-referential]]. GB was the first theory to be based on the [[principles and parameters]] model of language, which also underlies the later developments of the minimalist program.

==Government==
The main application of the ''[[government (linguistics)|government]]'' relation concerns the assignment of [[Grammatical case|case]]. Government is defined as follows:

A '''governs''' B if and only if
* A is a '''governor''' and
* A '''[[m-command]]s''' B and
* no '''barrier''' intervenes between A and B.

'''Governors''' are heads of the [[lexical category|lexical categories]] (V, N, A, P) and [[tensed I]] (T). A [[m-command]]s B if A does not [[dominance (linguistics)|dominate]] B and B does not dominate A and the first '''maximal projection''' of A dominates B, where the maximal projection of a head X is XP. This means that for example in a structure like the following, A [[m-command]]s B, but B does not [[m-command]] A:

[[Image:ApBp.png]]

In addition, '''barrier''' is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;see "Minimality" in Haegeman 1994:163f.&lt;/ref&gt; A barrier is any node Z such that
* Z is a potential governor for B and
* Z [[c-command]]s B and
* Z does not [[c-command]] A

The government relation makes case assignment unambiguous. The tree diagram below illustrates how DPs are governed and assigned case by their governing heads:

[[Image:HeSmashedTheVase1.png]]

Another important application of the government relation constrains the occurrence and identity of [[Trace (linguistics)|traces]] as the [[Empty category principle|Empty Category Principle]] requires them to be properly governed.

==Binding==
[[Binding (linguistics)|Binding]] can be defined as follows:

* An element α binds an element β if and only if α [[c-command]]s β, and α and β corefer.

Consider the sentence "John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; mother", which is diagrammed below using simple [[phrase structure rules|phrase structure trees]].

[[Image:Government and Binding Theory basic tree.png]]

The NP "John" c-commands "his" because the first parent of the NP, S, contains "his".  "John" and "his" are also coreferential (they refer to the same person), therefore "John" binds "his".

On the other hand, in the ungrammatical sentence "*The mother of John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; likes himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;", "John" does not c-command "himself", so they have no binding relationship despite the fact that they corefer.

[[Image:the mother of John.png]]

The importance of binding is shown in the grammaticality or ungrammaticality of the following sentences:

# &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
# John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
# &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. 
# &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

Binding is used, along with particular binding principles, to explain the ungrammaticality of statements 1, 3, and 4. The applicable rules are called Binding Principle A, Binding Principle B, and Binding Principle C.

*'''Principle A:''' an anaphor (reflexive or reciprocal, such as "each other") must be bound in its governing category (roughly, the clause).
Since "himself" is not c-commanded by "John" in sentence [3], Principle A is violated.

*'''Principle B:'''  a pronoun must be free (i.e., not bound) within its governing category (roughly, the clause).
In sentence [1], "him" is bound by "John", violating Principle B.

*'''Principle C:''' an [[R-expression]] must be free (i.e., not bound). R-expressions (e.g. "the dog" or "John") are referential expressions: unlike pronouns and anaphora, they independently refer, i.e., pick out entities in the world.
In sentence [4], the first instance of "John" binds the second, violating Principle C.

Note that Principles A and B refer to "governing categories"—domains which limit the scope of binding. The definition of a governing category laid out in ''Lectures on Government and Binding''&lt;ref name = LGB/&gt; is complex, but in most cases the governing category is essentially the minimal clause or complex NP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">A '''graduate assistant''' is a person who serves in a support role (assistantship) at a university, usually while completing [[graduate school|post-graduate education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grads.vt.edu/financial/assistantships/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529220920/http://www.grads.vt.edu/financial/assistantships/index.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual typically assists [[professors]] with instructional responsibilities as [[teaching assistants]] or with [[academia|academic]] [[research]] responsibilities as [[research assistants]], aids coaches with an athletic team, or is employed by other university departments (such as housing or academic advising). 

Rather than receive hourly wages, GAs are often remunerated in the form of a [[stipend]]. Assistantships provide experience for graduate students, increasing their future employment options {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. 

Graduate assistantships are beneficial to the employing university as well because graduate assistants fill positions that would cost the university significantly more to fill with traditional employees.

A stipend is a fixed sum of money paid periodically for services or to defray expenses. That remuneration is termed a "fee" or "stipend" rather than salary or wages is immaterial. The stipend allows for the graduate student to focus on their studies instead of a full-time job, but pays a significant portion of the income of a full-time job. A PhD graduate stipend is considered income in the United States.

The term '''graduate placement''' is a statistic used by colleges, universities, and other schools to statistically report the successfulness of their graduated students to find a job in the student's chosen field of study.

It is generally used to indicate the [[efficacy]] of the teaching methods and educational opportunities for prospective students looking for a good school to spend their tuition money.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20168">[[Scottish Gaelic]] ({{lang|gd|Gàidhlig}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkaːlɪkʲ||Gaidhlig.ogg}}), is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] native to [[Scotland]]. A member of the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], developed out of [[Middle Irish]]. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames.&lt;ref name="Withers" /&gt;

==Origins to zenith==

It is commonly accepted by scholars that Gaelic was brought to Scotland, probably in the 4th–5th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of {{lang|gd|[[Dál Riata]]}} on Scotland's west coast in present-day [[Argyll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Charles |title=The Edinburgh history of the Scots language |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1997 |page=551 |isbn=978-0-7486-0754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nora Kershaw Chadwick |first=Myles Dyllon |title=The Celtic Realms |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1972 |page=66 |isbn=978-0-7607-4284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologist [[Ewan Campbell|Dr Ewan Campbell]] has argued that there is no archaeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover. &lt;ref name=ewancampbell&gt;Campbell, Ewan. "[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/scotsirish.htm Were the Scots Irish?]" in ''Antiquity'' No. 75 (2001). pp. 285–292.&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the medieval accounts is shared by other archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt;

Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to {{lang|gd|Dál Riata}} until the 8th century, when it began expanding into [[Picts|Pictish]] areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. This was spurred by the intermarriage of Gaelic and Pictish aristocratic families, the [[origins of the Kingdom of Alba|political merger of the two kingdoms]] in the early 9th century, and the common threat of attack by Norse invaders. By 900, [[Pictish language|Pictish]] appears to have become extinct, completely replaced by Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, pp. 238–244&lt;/ref&gt; An exception might be made for the [[Northern Isles]], however, where Pictish was more likely supplanted by Norse rather than by Gaelic. During the reign of {{lang|gd|[[Constantine II of Scotland|Caustantín mac Áeda]]}} (900–943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts, but we do not know whether this was because a new kingdom was established or because "Alba" was simply a closer approximation of the Pictish name for the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of [[Gaelicisation]] (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of {{lang|gd|Caustantín}} and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Broun, "Dunkeld", Broun, "National Identity", Forsyth, "Scotland to 1100", pp. 28–32, Woolf, "Constantine II"; cf. Bannerman, "Scottish Takeover", passim, representing the "traditional" view.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 10th century, Gaelic had become the dominant language throughout northern and western Scotland, the Gaelo-Pictic [[Kingdom of Alba]]. Its spread to southern Scotland was less even and less complete. Place name analysis suggests dense usage of Gaelic in [[Galloway]] and adjoining areas to the north and west, as well as in [[West Lothian]] and parts of western [[Midlothian]]. Less dense usage is suggested for north [[Ayrshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], the [[Clyde Valley]] and eastern [[Dumfriesshire]]. This latter region is roughly the area of the old [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which was annexed by the Kingdom of Alba in the early 11th century, but its inhabitants may have continued to speak Cumbric as late as the 12th century. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken: the area shifted from Cumbric to [[Old English]] during its long incorporation into the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Northumbria]]. After the Lothians were conquered by [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] at the [[Battle of Carham]] in 1018, the elites spoke Gaelic and continued to do so until about 1200. However commoners retained Old English.&lt;ref name="Withers"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Withers |first1=Charles W. J. |title=Gaelic in Scotland, 1698–1981 |date=1984 |publisher=John Donald Publishers Ltd |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0859760979 |pages=16–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the incorporation of Strathclyde and the Lothians, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith in Scotland. The language in Scotland had been developing independently of the language in Ireland at least as early as its crossing the {{lang|gd|Druim Alban}} ("Spine" or "ridge of Britain", its location is not known) into Pictland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/shr.2013.0178|title=Druim Alban, Dorsum Britanniae – ‘the Spine of Britain’|first=Philip M.|last=Dunshea|date=25 September 2013|publisher=|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|volume=92|issue=2|pages=275–289|via=Edinburgh University Press Journals|doi=10.3366/shr.2013.0178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire country was for the first time being referred to in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Scotia}}'', and Gaelic was recognised as the ''{{lang|la|lingua Scotia}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colm Ó Baoill, "The Scots–Gaelic interface", in Charles Jones, ed., The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of Gaelic in Scotland==
[[File:Alexander III and Ollamh Rígh.JPG|thumb|Coronation of [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] on [[Moot Hill]], [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1249. He is being greeted by the ''{{lang|gd|ollamh rìgh}}'', the royal poet, who is addressing him with the proclamation "Benach De Re Albanne" (= ''{{lang|gd|Beannachd do Rìgh Albann}}'', "God's Blessing on the King of Scotland"); the poet goes on to recite Alexander's genealogy.]]

Many historians mark the reign of King Malcolm Canmore ([[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]]) as the beginning of Gaelic's decline in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Withers, p. 19"&gt;Withers, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In either 1068 or 1070, the king married the exiled Princess Margaret of [[House of Wessex|Wessex]]. This future [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]] was a member of the royal House of Wessex, which had occupied the English throne from its founding until the Norman Conquest. Margaret was thoroughly Anglo-Saxon, and is often credited (or blamed) for taking the first significant steps in anglicising the Scottish court. She spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland. Her family also served as a conduit for the entry of English nobles into Scotland.&lt;ref name="Withers, p. 19"/&gt; When both Malcolm and Margaret died just days apart in 1093, the Gaelic aristocracy rejected their anglicised sons and instead backed Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] as the next King of Scots. Known as Donald {{lang|gd|Bàn}} ("the Fair"), the new king had lived 17 years in Ireland as a young man, and his power base as an adult was in the thoroughly Gaelic west of Scotland. Upon Donald's accession to the throne, in the words of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', "the Scots drove out all the English who had been with King Malcolm".&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm's sons fled to the English court, but in 1097 returned with an Anglo-Norman army backing them. Donald was overthrown, blinded, and imprisoned for the remaining two years of his life.  Because of the strong English ties of Malcolm's sons Edgar, Alexander, and David – each of whom became king in turn – Donald {{lang|gd|Bàn}} is sometimes called the "last Celtic King of Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, Margaret (1874). History of Scotland. New York: Henry Holt and Company. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last Scottish monarch to be buried on [[Iona]], the one-time centre of the Scottish Gaelic Church and the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of {{lang|gd|Dàl Riada}} and the Kingdom of Alba.

During the reigns of the sons of Malcolm Canmore (1097–1153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth–Clyde line and along the north-eastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French became dominant among the new feudal aristocracy, especially in southern Scotland, and completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under [[David I of Scotland|David I]], attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking "Inglis", the language of the merchant class. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Withers, pp. 19-23"&gt;Withers, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt;  The country underwent significant population growth in the 12th and 13th centuries in the expanding burghs and their nearby agricultural districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whyte |first1=Ian D. |title=Scotland before the Industrial Revolution |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |page=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These economic developments surely helped spread English as well.

Gaelic still retained some of its old prestige in medieval Scotland. At the coronation of King Alexander III in 1249, a traditional ''{{lang|gd|[[seanchaí|seanchaidh]]}}'' or story-teller recited the king's full genealogy in Gaelic all the way back to {{lang|gd|[[Fergus Mòr]]}}, the mythical progenitor of the Scots in {{lang|gd|Dál Riata}}, "in accordance with the custom which had grown up in the kingdom from antiquity right up to that time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Bower |chapter=The Stone of Scone and the Making of a King, 1249 |title=Scotichronicon |url=http://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1249.html |editor1=S. Taylor |editor2=D. E. R. Watt |editor3=B. Scott |location=Aberdeen |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland had remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Baoill, p. 553–6&lt;/ref&gt;

That being said, it seems clear that Gaelic had ceased to be the language of all of Scotland by 1400 at the latest. It disappeared from the central Lowlands by {{circa|lk=no|1350}} and from the eastern coastal lowlands north of the [[Mounth]] not long afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} By the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called [[Scots language|Scots]] (at that time termed [[Early Scots|Inglis]]) emerged as the official language of government and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles W. J. |last=Withers |chapter=The Geographical History of Gaelic in Scotland |editor=Colin H. Williams |title=Language in Geographic Context |year=1988 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] was organised using Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's ''[[The Brus]]'' (1375) and Blind Harry's ''[[The Wallace (poem)|The Wallace]]'' (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. It was around this time that the very name of Gaelic began to change. Until the 14th century, Gaelic was referred to in English as "Scottis", i.e. the language of the Scots. By the end of the 15th century, however, the Scottish dialect of Northern English had absorbed that designation. English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish.&lt;ref name="Withers, pp. 19-23"/&gt; King [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] (d. 1513) thought Gaelic important enough to learn and speak. However, he was the last Scottish monarch to do so.

==Modern era==

Scottish Gaelic has a rich oral (''{{lang|gd|[[wikt:beul-aithris|beul-aithris]]}}'') and [[Classical Gaelic|written]] tradition, having been the language of the [[bard]]ic culture of the Highland [[Scottish clan|clan]]s for many years. The language preserves knowledge of and adherence to pre-feudal 'tribal' laws and customs (as represented, for example, by the expressions ''{{lang|gd|tuatha}}'' and ''{{lang|gd|dùthchas}}''). These attitudes were still evident in the complaints and claims of the [[Highland Land League]] of the late 19th century,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} which elected MPs to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Hunter1976"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=James |year=1976 |title=The Making of the Crofting Community |pages=178–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the language suffered under centralisation efforts by the Scottish and later British states, especially after the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, during the [[Highland Clearances]], and by the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1872|exclusion of Scottish Gaelic from the educational system]].

According to Yale University music professor Willie Ruff, the singing of psalms in Scottish Gaelic by Presbyterians of the [[Scottish Hebrides]] evolved from "lining out" – where one person sings a solo before others follow – into the [[call and response]] of [[gospel music]] of the southern USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Charles Mackintosh's waterproof to Dolly the sheep: 43 innovations Scotland has given the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html|publisher=The independent|date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Irish translation of the [[Bible]] dating from the [[Elizabethan era]] was in use until the Bible was translated into Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mackenzie |first=Donald W. |year=1990–92 |title=The Worthy Translator: How the Scottish Gaels got the Scriptures in their own Tongue |journal=Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness |volume=57 |pages=168–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author David Ross notes in his 2002 history of Scotland that a Scottish Gaelic version of the Bible was published in London in 1690 by the Rev. Robert Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle; however it was not widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=David |title=Scotland: History of a Nation |publisher=Geddes &amp; Grosset |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first well-known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible. The lack of a well-known translation until the late 18th century may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie1992"/&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Scottish Gaelic literature]] has seen development within the area of prose fiction publication, as well as challenges due to the continuing decline of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, John (2011) "Contemporary Gaelic fiction: development, challenge and opportunity" ''Lainnir a’ Bhùirn' – The Gleaming Water: Essays on Modern Gaelic Literature'', edited by Emma Dymock &amp; Wilson McLeod, Dunedin Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{see below|short=y}}

All surviving dialects are Highland and/or Hebridean dialects. Dialects of '''Lowland Gaelic''' have become defunct since the demise of [[Galwegian Gaelic]], originally spoken in [[Galloway]], which seems to have been the last [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland]] dialect and which survived into the [[Modern Period]]. By the 18th century Lowland Gaelic had been largely replaced by [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} across much of Lowland Scotland. According to a reference in ''The Carrick Covenanters '' by James Crichton,&lt;ref&gt;Printed at the Office of Messrs. Arthur Guthrie and Sons Ltd., 49 Ayr Road, Cumnock&lt;/ref&gt; the last place in the Lowlands where Scottish Gaelic was still spoken was the village of [[Barr, Ayrshire|Barr]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]: only a few miles inland to the east of [[Girvan]], but at one time very isolated. Crichton gives neither date nor details.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion on the subject of Gaelic in the South of Scotland, see articles ''{{lang|gd|Gàidhlig Ghallghallaibh agus Alba-a-Deas}}'' ("Gaelic of Galloway and Southern Scotland") and ''{{lang|gd|Gàidhlig ann an Siorramachd Inbhir-Àir}}'' ("Gaelic in Ayrshire") by Garbhan MacAoidh, published in ''GAIRM'' Numbers 101 and 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence from place names of significant linguistic differences between, for example, [[Argyll]] and [[Galloway]]. Dialects on both sides of the [[Straits of Moyle]] (the [[North Channel (British Isles)|North Channel]]) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the [[Mull of Kintyre]], [[Rathlin]] and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary.

What is known as Scottish Gaelic is essentially the Gaelic spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} although there is still regional variation. For example, the slender 'r' is pronounced {{IPA|[ð]}} in Lewis, where the Gaelic is thought to have been influenced by [[Old Norse|Norse]], and had a [[pitch accent]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Oftedal, Magne ''The Gaelic of Leurbost, Isle of Lewis'' 1956 Norsk Tidsskrift for Sprogvidenskap&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaelic in Eastern and Southern Scotland is now largely defunct, although the dialects which were spoken in the east tended to preserve a more archaic tone, which had been lost further west.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} For example, Gaelic speakers in East Sutherland preferred to say ''{{lang|gd|Cà 'd robh tu m' oidhche a-raoir?}}'' ("Where were you about last night?"), rather than the more common ''{{lang|gd|càit an robh thu (oidhche) a-raoir?}}''. Such dialects, along with Manx and Irish, also retain the Classical Gaelic values of the stops, while most dialects underwent devoicing and [[preaspiration]].

A certain number of these dialects, which are now defunct in Scotland, have been preserved, and indeed re-established, in the Nova Scotia Gaelic community. Those of particular note are the Morar and Lochaber dialects, the latter of which pronounces the broad or [[velarised]] l ({{IPA|l̪ˠ}}) as [{{IPA|w}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy |first1=Michael |title=Gaelic in Nova Scotia: An Economic, Cultural and Social Impact Study |date=2002 |publisher=Province of Nova Scotia |page=131 |url=https://gaelic.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/files/Gaelic-Report.pdf |accessdate=5 January 2016 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionarypar|holograph}}
A '''holograph''' is a document written entirely in the handwriting of the person whose [[signature]] it bears. Some countries (e.g., France) or local jurisdictions within certain countries (e.g., some U.S. states) give legal standing to specific types of holographic documents, generally waiving requirements that they be witnessed. One of the most important types of such documents are holographic [[Will (law)|last wills]].

== Holographic instrument ==
The expansion of the concept of ''holographic'' or [[Handwriting|handwritten]] documents must include a discussion of the effectiveness of a document in accomplishing its intended purpose. Print media came into being as a solution to the problem of the sluggish and ponderous task of [[transcribing]] written materials by hand. Printing enabled rapid construction, compilation and production of written material and provided a means for the revolutionary concept of dissemination of copies of written material.

The intrinsic value of employing the handwritten word in creating a document is that the authorship of handwritten documents is able to be authenticated by handwriting comparison with samples of the author's other writings or by recognition by [[witnesses]] familiar with the handwriting style and characteristics of the author. This valuable quality of proof of [[authorship]] maintains to this day the primacy of the hand-written document where it was required, by law or by necessity, to have authenticity and verifiable provenance or origin of the document.

=== The last will ===
{{main|Holographic will}}
Of particular importance to [[law]] and [[society]] was to have the ultimate document requiring authenticity—a last will and [[will (law)|testament]]—retain its authenticity, thereby accomplishing its author's intended purpose: that of making a valid, indisputable disposition of the author's [[real property]], personal assets and wishes or declarations, at the time of his or her death.

The rule for creating a minimally acceptable "holographic" will has been agreed upon:  to be indisputably without edit or revision by an outsider (other than the author), absolutely no mechanically printed material must be contained in the document.  It must not be typeset, typewritten, mechanically printed or scribed by any means other than by the hand of the original author.  This rule does not, however, apply to non-material terms of the will.  As a result, so-called "form wills" purchased at stationery stores can constitute legally valid holographic wills provided that their material terms are completed solely in the testator's handwriting.

The will must be dated at the time of its writing, so that it can be compared (visually, [[Forensics|forensically]]) with documents originating from the same author at other times, such as an earlier will (which might be intended by its author to be withdrawn or revoked by a later written will).

To be effective as a testamentary document, a "holographic" will must be signed by its author. Unlike a typewritten or word-processed "formal" will, where usually two disinterested witnesses are required to attest to the author's signing or "execution" of the document, a holographic will does not require any witnessing or [[Notary public|notarization]] (an accepted form of witnessed certification of authenticity) in order to be a proper and valid testamentary [[Legal instrument|instrument]] (document) having full legal force and effect.

==Music==
In music, a holograph is a manuscript entirely in the composer's hand, while an [[autograph]] is merely in a known hand, not necessarily the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Holograph|author=Stanley Boorman|access-date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such autographs by non-composers are common, as not only was copying music by hand a common way to study it, but the children or students of major composers were also usually [[copyist]]s for instrumental parts.

An '''Iron man''' is an athlete of unusual physical endurance.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iron%20man|title=Iron Man - Definition of Iron man by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/IRON+MAN|title=Iron-man - Define Iron-man at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This durability is generally measured by an athlete's ability to play without missing a game and/or start for an extended period of time, sometimes, even for an entire career.&lt;ref name="Iron Man Competition: Brett Favre vs. Cal Ripken Jr. vs. A.C.

==Background==
The term "iron man" as it pertains to sports longevity has origins from major league baseball pitcher [[Joe McGinnity]], who was known for pitching in back to back [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] and leading his league in innings pitched four times in five seasons from 1900 to 1904. He also played professionally until age 54. His nickname was "Iron Man" although he said the name came from his off season work for his family's [[foundry]] business.&lt;ref name="Joe McGinnity"&gt;[http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f75cf09d Joe McGinnity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, endurance by an athlete was recognized as an "iron man" by the [[Boston Post|press]] when [[Lou Gehrig]] had a streak of 2,130 consecutive games end when he had asked the manager to take him out of the line up due to his fading abilities. Gehrig had been a consistent performer on the field having attained a batting average of at least .300 throughout his career until the previous season when he had fallen to .295.&lt;ref name="LOU GEHRIG’S CONSECUTIVE GAME STREAK ENDS AT 2,130"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitchellarchives.com/lou-gehrigs-consecutive-game-streak-ends-at-2130.htm|title=LOU GEHRIG’S CONSECUTIVE GAME STREAK ENDS AT 2,130|publisher=|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common characteristic of an iron man is the ability to play through injury. Gehrig displayed this trait in 1934 when his streak was in jeopardy of being snapped at 1,427 games. He had been injured during a game and was pulled from the lineup. The next day, after receiving heat treatments and massages for a stiff back, he was able to get a hit before leaving the contest.&lt;ref name="Lou Gehrig’s Streak Should Have Ended at Navin Field — Not Briggs Stadium"&gt;[http://blog.detroitathletic.com/2011/08/21/lou-gehrig%E2%80%99s-streak-should-have-ended-at-navin-field-not-briggs-stadium/ Lou Gehrig’s Streak Should Have Ended at Navin Field — Not Briggs Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Original Iron Man"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/1998/yankees/flashbacks/fall95.html The Original Iron Man]&lt;/ref&gt; Gehrig's record stood for 62 years until surpassed by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995.&lt;ref name="Lou Gehrig breaks record by playing in his 1,308th straight game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyorb.com/date/1933/august/17|title=Today in History for 17th August 1933|work=OnThisDay.com|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ripken breaks record for consecutive games played"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ripken-breaks-record-for-consecutive-games-played|title=Ripken breaks record for consecutive games played|work=HISTORY.com|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ripken's record-breaking streak garnered attention from the media,&lt;ref name="Cal Ripken's 2131 night- A Record That Saved Baseball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/29461-cal-ripkens-2131-night-a-record-that-saved-baseball|title=Cal Ripken's 2131 night-  A Record That Saved Baseball|author=Lawrence  Barreca|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NBA's A.C. Green received attention for his own streak of consecutive games played in 1997 as he was approaching [[Randy Smith (basketball)|Randy Smith's]] record.&lt;ref name="Move over Cal Ripken. A.C. Green of the Mavericks"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011420/index.htm Move over Cal Ripken. A.C. Green of the Mavericks]&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1999, Brett Favre set the record for [[List of most consecutive starts by a National Football League quarterback|consecutive starts by a quarterback]] when he started his 117th consecutive game surpassing the mark established by [[Ron Jaworski]].&lt;ref name="History Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1345|title=Iron Man|publisher=|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Favre would surpass [[Jim Marshall (gridiron football)|Jim Marshall's]] [[List of most consecutive starts and games played by National Football League players#Consecutive games started|starts streak at any position]] with his 271st consecutive start.&lt;ref name="Favre runs iron-man streak to 271, breaks Marshall's record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/12236552|title=Columns|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An iron man streak can also be ended due to disciplinary reasons.  In 2015, [[Matt Kenseth]] was suspended after he caused a crash that ended [[Joey Logano]]'s race. [[NASCAR]] issued a two-race suspension, effectively ending his streak at 571&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASCAR suspends Matt Kenseth for two races {{!}} NASCAR.com|url = http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/11/3/matt-kenseth-penalty-following-wreck-joey-logano-martinsville-speedway.html|website = www.nascar.com|accessdate = November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving him ineligible for pursuing [[Jeff Gordon]]'s 797-race streak. 

In international cricket, players can be taken out of the squad due to injuries, discipline, poor form, or illegal bowling action or unfavourable conditions against certain bowlers, or simply as a healthy scratch when they are rested during long tours or in a calendar year with hectic schedules. In 2016, [[Brendon McCullum]] would finish his international career, having started all 101 tests, which is remarkable not only because he has never been dropped due to poor form or poor health (though he has given up [[Wicket-keeper|wicketkeeping]] due to back and knee issues), but because [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] has a far leaner schedule compared to [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], even though he is nowhere near [[Allan Border]]'s actual record of 153, it wasn't throughout his own career.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = McCullum's most satisfying ton|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/76793923/tonup-brendon-mccullum-on-the-secret-to-his-test-longevity-not-sure|website = Stuff|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since Test and limited-overs cricket would also feature different players, the consecutive starts streak would be counted separately. Brendon McCullum also started 122 consecutive One-Day Internationals from 2004-2010, the same as [[Mahela Jayawardene]] of [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] with 122 each, but the record is held by [[Sachin Tendulkar]], when his streak was snapped due to injury.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Records {{!}} One-Day Internationals {{!}} Individual records (captains, players, umpires) {{!}} Most consecutive matches for a team {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/wi/content/records/128609.html|website = Cricinfo|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Eli Manning]] was benched in favor of Geno Smith after the Giants, snapping his active starts streak at 210, which was the longest streak amongst active players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80cef164|title=NFL Football Highlights, Clips &amp; Analysis {{!}} NFL.com|website=www.nfl.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Rivers]] of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] now has the longest active streak.

The website [[Ludum Dare]] hosted a 48-hour contest, wherein game developers had to develop a video game in that span of time with the theme "It's Dangerous To Go Alone! Take This!". The contest had 352 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ludum Dare 20: It’s Dangerous To Go Alone! |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/06/29/ludum-dare-20-its-dangerous-to-go-alone/ |work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |last=Smee |first=Andrew |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fan-made documentary was to be made with the title "It's dangerous to go alone!"; its [[Kickstarter]] campaign, however, was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='The Legend of Zelda' documentary seeks Kickstarter funding |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a475455/the-legend-of-zelda-documentary-seeks-kickstarter-funding.html#~oDbXH9J43uNB9H |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Martin |first=Liam |date=2013-04-23 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!!]]'' featured the character [[Jake the Dog]] saying to fellow protagonist [[Finn the Human]], "Hey, man! It's dangerous to go alone!" The game was developed in part as an homage to ''The Legend of Zelda'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adventure Time 3DS: Zelda II in the Land of Ooo |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/28/adventure-time-3ds-zelda-ii-in-the-land-of-ooo |work=[[IGN]] |last=Drake |first=Audrey |date=2012-08-28 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khalilullah Khalili (1956).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Khalili (c. 1956)]]
'''Khalilullah Khalili''' (1907 – 1987; {{lang-fa|خلیل‌الله خلیلی}} - ''Ḫalīlallāḥ Ḫalīlī''; alternative spellings: ''Khalilollah'', ''Khalil Ullah'') was [[Afghanistan]]'s foremost 20th century [[poet]] as well as a noted historian, university professor, diplomat and royal confidant. 
He was the last of the great classical [[List of Persian poets and authors|Persian poets]] and among the first to introduce modern [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and [[Nima Yushij|Nimai]] style to Afghanistan. He had also expertise in ''Khorasani'' style and was a follower of [[Farrukhi Sistani]]. Almost alone among Afghanistan's poets, he enjoyed a following in [[Iran]] where his selected poems have been published. His works have been praised by renowned Iranian literary figures and intellectuals. Many see him as the greatest contemporary poet of the [[Persian language]] in Afghanistan. He is also known for his major work ''"Hero of Khorasan"'', a controversial [[biography]] of [[Habibullah Kalakani|Habībullāh Kalakānī]], [[Emir]] of Afghanistan in 1929.

==Life==
Khalili was born in [[Kabul Province]],&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;L.R. Reddy, ''Inside Afghanistan: End of Taliban Era'', APH Publishing Corporation, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NubtDf2T3cAC&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74]&lt;/ref&gt; and came from the same village as Habibullah Kalakani.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Edwards, ''Before Taliban'', University of California Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDJsgX6j2BkC&amp;pg=PA312 p. 312]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote exclusively in [[Persian language|Persian]] and is sometimes associated with [[Tājik people|Tajik]] nationalist ideology. He belonged to the Pashtun Safi tribe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghanrelief.org/pdf/Lynch2003.pdf Lynch, Stephen (2003) "Tulips in a Minefield" ''Afghan Relief'' p.3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724225131/http://www.afghanrelief.org/pdf/Lynch2003.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}, originally published, on 12 October 2003 in ''The Orange County Register'', last accessed 17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of Kohistan (modern [[Parwan]]). His father, Mirzā Muhammad Hussein Khān, was [[Habibullah Khan|King Habibullah Khan]]'s finance minister and owned mansions in [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]], but was later dismissed and hanged by Habibullah Khan's son and successor, [[Amanullah Khan]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; His mother was the daughter of Abdul Qādir Khān, a regional Safi tribal leader. She died when Khalili was seven.

Khalili lived and attended school in Kabul until he was 11, when [[Habibullah Khan|Shāh Habibullāh Khān]], king of Afghanistan, was assassinated, purportedly at the behest of his [[reformist]] son [[Amanullah Khan|Amānullāh Khān]], who quickly arrested and executed Khalili's father among others associated with the previous regime. Orphaned and unwanted in Kabul, he spent the turbulent years of Amānullāh's reign in the ''Shamālī Plain'' north of Kabul where he studied classical literature and other traditional sciences with leading scholars and began writing poetry. In 1929, when Habībullāh Kalakānī – a local Tajik from [[Kalakan District|Kalakan]] – deposed Amānullāh Khān, Khalili joined his uncle Abdul Rahim Khan Safi, the new governor of [[Herat]], where he remained for more than 10 years.

In the early 1940s, he followed his uncle Abdul Rahim Khan Safi, who had been appointed a deputy prime minister, to Kabul. His stay in Kabul was cut short when, in 1945, some elders of the Safi-Clan rebelled and both uncle and nephew were imprisoned. After a year in prison, Khalili was released and exiled to [[Kandahar]] where he flourished as a poet and writer.

In the 1950s, Khalili was allowed to return to Kabul where he was appointed as minister of culture and information and began teaching at [[Kabul University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF113CF937A25756C0A961948260 "Khalilullah Khalili Dies at 79; Afghan Poet and Ex-Official" ''New York Times'' 14 May 1987], accessed 17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He became a confidant to King [[Zahir Shah]] whom he often joined on hunting expeditions.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Khalili, who was fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], served as Afghanistan's ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iraq]]. He was a member of the ''1964 Constitutional Assembly'' and a representative from Jabal al-Siraj.

Following the April 1978 [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Communist coup]], Khalili sought asylum first in [[Germany]] and then in the [[United States]] where he wrote much of his most powerful poetry about the war in his native land. In the late 1980s, he moved to [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]], where he spent his final years. He was buried in Peshawar next to the tomb of the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] poet [[Rahman Baba]].
HIs remains were moved to Afghanistan in 2016.  
Burial:
Kabul University mausoleum 
Kabul
Kabul, Afghanistan 


==Works==
Khalili was a prolific writer, producing over the course of his career an eclectic repertoire ranging from poetry to fiction to history to biography. He published 35 volumes of poetry, including his celebrated works ''"Aškhā wa Ḫūnhā"'' ("Tears And Blood"), composed during the Soviet occupation, and ''"Ayyār-e az Ḫorāsān"'' (''"Hero of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]"''). With the exception of a selection of his quatrains&lt;ref&gt;Khalīlī, Khalīl Allāh (1981). ''Quatrains of Khalilullah Khalili'', [[Octagon Press Ltd]], London, {{ISBN|0-86304-042-X}}, {{OCLC|11289418}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent ''An Assembly of Moths'',&lt;ref&gt;Khalīlī, Khalīl Allāh (2004). ''An Assembly of Moths: Selected Poems of Khalilullah Khalili'', Jayyad Pr., Delhi, {{OCLC|283802813}}&lt;/ref&gt; his poetry remains largely unknown to [[English language|English-speaking]] readers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32016">The '''frequency of letters''' in text has been studied for use in [[cryptanalysis]], and [[frequency analysis]] in particular, dating back to the Iraqi mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] (c. 801–873 AD), who formally developed the method (the ciphers breakable by this technique go back at least to the [[Caesar cipher]] invented by [[Julius Caesar]], so this method could have been explored in classical times). [[File:CaliforniaJobCaseLayout.png|[[California Job Case]]|thumb]] Letter frequency analysis gained additional importance in Europe with the development of [[movable type]] in 1450 AD, where one must estimate the amount of type required for each letterform, as evidenced by the variations in letter compartment size in typographer's type cases.

Linguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for [[language identification]], where it's particularly effective as an indication of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic.  For example, the Japanese [[Hiragana]] syllabary contains 46 distinct characters, which is more than most phonetic alphabets; by contrast, the [[English language|English]] and [[Hawaiian alphabet]]s have only 26 and 13 letters, respectively.

No exact letter frequency distribution underlies a given language, since all writers write slightly differently. However, most languages have a characteristic distribution which is strongly apparent in longer texts. Even language changes as extreme as from old English to modern English (regarded as mutually unintelligible) show strong trends in related letter frequencies: over a small sample of Biblical passages, from most frequent to least frequent, '''enaid sorhm tgþlwu (æ)cfy ðbpxz''' of old English compares to '''eotha sinrd luymw fgcbp kvjqxz''' of modern English, with the most extreme differences concerning letterforms not shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/MarshaMoreno/TimeComparisonFrequency.pdf|title=Frequency Analysis in Light of Language Innovation|last1=Moreno |first1=Marsha Lynn |date=Spring 2005 |website=Math UCSD |publisher= |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linotype machine]]s for the English language assumed the letter order, from most to least common, to be '''[[etaoin shrdlu]] cmfwyp vbgkjq xz''' based on the experience and custom of manual compositors.  The equivalent for the French language was '''elaoin sdrétu cmfhyp vbgwqj xz'''.

[[Morse code|Modern International Morse code]] (generally believed to have been developed by [[Alfred Vail]] based on English-language letter frequencies of the 1830s) encodes the most frequent letters with the shortest symbols; arranging the Morse alphabet into groups of letters that require equal amounts of time to transmit, and then sorting these groups in increasing order, yields '''e it san hurdm wgvlfbk opxcz jyq'''. Similar ideas are used in modern [[data compression|data-compression]] techniques such as [[Huffman coding]].

Letter frequency was used by other telegraph systems, such as the [[Murray Code]].

==Introduction==
Letter frequencies, like [[word frequencies]], tend to vary, both by writer and by subject. One cannot write an essay about x-rays without using frequent Xs, and the essay will have an idiosyncratic letter frequency if the essay is about the frequent use of x-rays to treat zebras in Qatar. Different authors have habits which can be reflected in their use of letters. [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s writing style, for example, is visibly different from  [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s. Letter, [[bigram]], [[trigram]], word frequencies, word length, and sentence length can be calculated for specific authors, and used to prove or disprove authorship of texts, even for authors whose styles are not so divergent.

Accurate average letter frequencies can only be gleaned by analyzing a large amount of representative text. With the availability of modern computing and collections of large [[corpus linguistics|text corpora]], such calculations are easily made. Examples can be drawn from a variety of sources (press reporting, religious texts, scientific texts and general fiction) and there are differences especially for general fiction with the position of 'h' and 'i', with H becoming more common.

[[Herbert Zim|Herbert S. Zim]], in his classic introductory cryptography text "Codes and Secret Writing", gives the English letter frequency sequence as "ETAON RISHD LFCMU GYPWB VKJXQ Z", the most common letter pairs as "TH HE AN RE ER IN ON AT ND ST ES EN OF TE ED OR TI HI AS TO", and the most common doubled letters as "LL EE SS OO TT FF RR NN PP CC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zim |first=Herbert Spencer. |title=Codes &amp; Secret Writing: Authorized Abridgement |publisher=Scholastic Book Services |year=1961 |oclc=317853773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, to note that different dialects of a language will also affect a letter's frequency. For example, an author in the United States would produce something in which the letter 'z' is more common than an author in the United Kingdom writing on the same topic: words like "analyze", "apologize", and "recognize" contain the letter in American English, whereas the same words are spelled "analyse", "apologise", and "recognise" in British English.  This would highly affect the frequency of the letter 'z' as it is a rarely used letter elsewhere in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/british-and-american-spelling|title=British and American spelling - Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "top twelve" letters constitute about 80% of the total usage. The "top eight" letters constitute about 65% of the total usage. Letter frequency as a function of rank can be fitted well by several rank functions, with the two-parameter [[Beta function|Cocho/Beta rank function]] being the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li, Wentian |author2=Miramontes, Pedro |title=Fitting ranked English and Spanish letter frequency distribution in US and Mexican presidential speeches |journal= Journal of Quantitative Linguistics |volume= 18 |issue=4 |year=2011 |doi= 10.1080/09296174.2011.608606 |url= |pages=359|arxiv=1103.2950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rank function with no adjustable free parameter also fits the letter frequency distribution reasonably well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gusein-Zade, S.M.|authorlink=Sabir Gusein-Zade|title=Frequency distribution of letters in the Russian language |journal=Probl. Peredachi Inf. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=102–7 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the same function has been used to fit the amino acid frequency in protein sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gamow, George |author2=Ycas, Martynas |title=  Statistical correlation of protein and ribonucleic acid composition |journal= Proc.

The use of letter frequencies and [[frequency analysis]] plays a fundamental role in [[cryptograms]] and several word puzzle games, including [[hangman (game)|Hangman]], [[Scrabble]] and the television game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. One of the earliest descriptions in classical literature of applying the knowledge of English letter frequency to solving a cryptogram is found in [[Poe|E.A. Poe]]'s famous story ''[[The Gold-Bug]]'', where the method is successfully applied to decipher a message instructing on the whereabouts of a treasure hidden by [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Poe, Edgar Allan |title=The works of Edgar Allan Poe in five volumes |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1977099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letter frequencies had a strong effect on the design of some [[keyboard layout]]s. The most frequent letters are on the bottom row of the [[Blickensderfer typewriter]], and the [[home row]] of the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]].

==Relative frequencies of letters in the English language==
There are three ways to count letter frequency that result in very different charts for common letters. The first method, used in the chart below, is to count letter frequency in root words of a dictionary. The second is to include all word variants when counting, such as "abstracts", "abstracted" and "abstracting" and not just the root word of "abstract". This system results in letters like "s" appearing much more frequently, such as when counting letters from lists of the most used English words on the Internet. A final variant is to count letters based on their frequency of use in actual texts, resulting in certain letter combinations like "th" becoming more common due to the frequent use of common words like "the". Absolute usage frequency measures like this are used when creating keyboard layouts or letter frequencies in old fashioned printing presses.

An analysis of entries in the Concise Oxford dictionary, ignoring frequency of word use, gives an order of "EARIOTNSLCUDPMHGBFYWKVXZJQ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the frequency of the letters of the alphabet in English? |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-frequency-of-the-letters-of-the-alphabet-in-english |work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lewand, arranged from most to least common in appearance, the letters are: '''etaoinshrdlcumwfgypbvkjxqz.''' Lewand's ordering differs slightly from others, such as Cornell University Math Explorer's Project, which produced a table after measuring 40,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html|title=Frequency Table|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the space is slightly more frequent than the top letter (e)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data-compression.com/english.html|title=Statistical Distributions of English Text|work=data-compression.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918020907/http://www.data-compression.com/english.html|archive-date=2017-09-18|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the non-alphabetic characters (digits, punctuation, etc.) collectively occupy the fourth position (having already included the space) between ''t'' and ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=E. Stewart |title=Essays about Computer Security |date= |work= |publisher=University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/lee-essays.pdf |format=PDF |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative frequencies of the first letters of a word in the English language==

The frequency of the first letters of words or names is helpful in pre-assigning space in physical files and indexes.&lt;ref name="ohlman"&gt;
[[Herbert Marvin Ohlman]].
"Subject-Word Letter Frequencies with Applications to [[superimposed code|Superimposed Coding]]".
[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10866&amp;page=903]
Proceedings of the International Conference on Scientific Information (1959).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Given 26 [[filing cabinet]] drawers, rather than a 1:1 assignment of one drawer to one letter of the alphabet,
it is often useful to use a more equal-frequency-letter code by assigning several low-frequency letters to the 
same drawer (often one drawer is labeled VWXYZ), and to split up the most-frequent initial letters — S, A, and C - 
into several drawers (often 6 drawers Aa-An, Ao-Az, Ca-Cj, Ck-Cz, Sa-Si, Sj-Sz). The same system is used in 
some multi-volume works such as some [[encyclopedia]]s. [[Cutter number]]s, another mapping of names to a 
more equal-frequency code, are used in some libraries.

Both the overall letter distribution and the word-initial letter distribution approximately match the [[Zipf distribution]] and even more closely match the [[Yule distribution]].&lt;ref name="pande"&gt;
Hemlata Pande and H. S. Dhami.
[http://www.skase.sk/Volumes/JTL16/pdf_doc/02.pdf "Mathematical Modelling of Occurrence of Letters and Word’s Initials in Texts of Hindi Language"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the frequency distribution of the first digit in each datum is significantly different from the overall frequency of all the digits in a set of numeric data—see [[Benford's law]] for details.

An analysis by [[Peter Norvig]] on Google Books data determined, among other things, the frequency of first letters of English words:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norvig.com/mayzner.html|title=English Letter Frequency Counts: Mayzner Revisited or ETAOIN SRHLDCU|author=|date=|website=norvig.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xesús Lorenzo Varela Vázquez''' ([[Havana]], August 10, 1917 &amp;ndash; [[Madrid]], November 25, 1978) was a [[Galician people|Galician]] [[poet]].

==Life==
Varela was born in a boat, while his parents, emigrants from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], were going to Havana, Cuba. Some people consider it to be a kind of prophecy, as Varela lived in exile for most of his life.

Varela returned to Galicia and grew up in [[Lugo]]. He was an active member of the [[Federación de Mocedades Galeguistas]] (Federation of Galician Youth).

In 1934 Varela moved to [[Madrid]], where he contacted with the group PAN (Poetas Andantes y Navegantes, literally Walking and Sailing Poets &amp;mdash; note that the abbreviation makes reference to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], a [[Greek mythology|Greek god]], and is also the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] word for [[bread]]) and with Misións Pedagóxicas (Pedagogic Missions). He also joined the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (Partido Comunista de España or PCE).

After the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936&amp;ndash;1939), Varela left Spain, exiling himself first in [[France]] and then, in May 1939, in [[Mexico]]. He moved to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1941, where he made contact with other exiled Galicians and emigrants from Galicia. He would publish most of his poetry, in the Galician language, while in [[Argentina]].

In May 1976, after the death of [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]], Varela decided to return to Spain. He finally settled in Madrid, where he lived until his death two years later.

The ''[[Día das Letras Galegas]]'' ("Galician Literature Day") was dedicated to him in 2005.

'''László József Bíró''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈlaːsloː ˈjoːʒɛf ˈbiːroː}}) or '''Ladislao José Biro''' (born as '''László József Schweiger''', 29 September 1899 – 24 October 1985) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[inventor]], who [[patent|patented]] the first commercially successful modern [[ballpoint pen]]. The first ball point pen was invented roughly fifty years earlier by [[John J. Loud]] but it did not attain commercial success.

==Early life==
Bíró was born to a [[Hungarian Jewish]] family in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name=Patent/&gt; in 1899 to Mózes Mátyás Schweiger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3-B%C3%ADr%C3%B3/6000000037993001509|title=László Bíró|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Janka née Ullmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Janka-Ulmann/6000000037993408035|title=Janka Ulmann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, György Bíró.  After leaving school, he began work as a journalist in Hungary.

==His invention==
While working as a journalist Biró noticed that the ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge-free. He tried using the same ink in a [[fountain pen]] but found that it would not flow into the tip, as it was too viscous.

He presented the first production of the ballpoint pen at the Budapest International Fair in 1931.&lt;ref name=Patent&gt;{{cite web|title=Golyó a tollban – megemlékezés Bíró László Józsefről|language=Hungarian|url=http://www.mszh.hu/kiadv/ipsz/199608/biro.html|work=Hungarian Patent Office|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with his brother György,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|src=uspto|392046|392,046 Pen Oct 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoyles |first=Pennie |title=The A to Z of Inventions and Inventors |author2=Peter Pentland | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9FZuxigkTkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=hu#PPT21,M1|pages=18|isbn=1-58340-790-1|year=2006|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[chemistry|chemist]], he developed a new tip consisting of a ball that was free to turn in a socket, and as it turned it would pick up ink from a cartridge and then roll to deposit it on the paper. Bíró patented the invention in Paris in 1938.

During [[World War II]], Bíró fled the Nazis with his brother, moving to [[Argentina]] in 1943. On 10 June, they filed another patent, issued in the US as {{US Patent |src=uspto|2390636|2,390,636 Writing Instrument}},&lt;ref name="US Patent 2390636"&gt;{{cite web|title=US2390636 "Writing Instrument"|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US2390636.pdf|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and formed ''Biro Pens of Argentina'' (in Argentina the ballpoint pen is known as ''birome'').

[[File:Bolígrafo marca birome I.jpg|thumb|right|Birome's advertising in Argentine magazine ''Leoplán'', 1945]]
In 1945, [[Marcel Bich]] bought the patent from Bíró for the pen, which soon became the main product of his [[Société Bic|BIC]] company, which has sold more than 100 billion ballpoint pens worldwide. In November of that same year, promoter [[Milton Reynolds]] introduced a gravity-fed pen to the U.S. market, to try and get around Biro's patent, which was based on [[capillary action]], where fresh ink is drawn out of the reservoir of the pen as ink is deposited on the paper. Because the Reynolds workaround depended on a gravity feed, it did not infringe, but required thinner ink and a larger barrel.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Robert Leonard (1971).

PhD Thesis. University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reynolds Pen was a sensation for a few years, until its reputation for leaking and competition from established pen manufacturers overtook it.

==Death and Legacy==
László Bíró died in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 1985.

Argentina's [[Inventors' Day]] is celebrated on Bíró's birthday, 29 September. 

A ballpoint pen is widely referred to as a "'''biro'''" in many countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |title=Dictionary of Trade Name Origins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qdw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=hu#PPA41,M1 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |year=1983 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-7102-0174-5 |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biro nell’Enciclopedia Treccani|language=Italian|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/biro/|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word is a [[registered trademark]], in some countries it has become [[generic trademark|genericised]].  On 29 September 2016, the 117th anniversary of his birth, [[Google]] commemorated Bíró with a [[Google Doodle]] for "his relentless, forward-thinking spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/ladislao-jose-biros-117th-birthday|title=Ladislao José Biro's 117th birthday|publisher=Google.com|date=|accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">'''Medieval etymology''' is the study of the history of words as conducted by scholars in the European [[Middle Ages]].

[[Etymology]] is the study of the origins of words.  Before the beginnings of large-scale modern [[lexicography]] in the 16th century and the development of the [[comparative method]] in the 18th, a scientific etymology as modern linguistics understand it was not possible.  However, grammarians had always speculated about the origins of words.  There are many examples of etymology in the Bible, for example, and in the works of classical writers.  In cases where the history of the words was simple, such speculations have sometimes proved correct in the light of modern scholarship, but generally they were based on superficial similarities.

Like classical etymology, Medieval Christian etymology drew tenuous connections between superficially similar words, but exegetical etymology was radically new in what it then did with the connections.  The purpose of etymology was to elucidate the spiritual background to a concept, drawing out aspects of semantics in a similar manner to the symbolic interpretation of the natural world.

An example: [[Hugh of St Victor]] derived the Latin word ''mors'' ('death') from ''morsus'' ('bite'): ''a morsu primi hominis qui vetitae arboris pomum mordens mortem incurrit'' ('from the bite of the first man, who, biting the apple of the forbidden tree, incurs death').&lt;ref&gt;PL 177, 134C.&lt;/ref&gt;  The etymology was thus crafted to teach a spiritual truth.  The fact that the same author knew other, alternative and logically incompatible etymologies for the same word (''mors'' comes also from ''amarus'', 'bitter', or from the name of the god of war Mars) did not devalue the lesson, since it was the spiritual meaning and not the philological accuracy which stood in the foreground.

As yet there is still no satisfactory history of Christian etymology, but a very useful discussion of it is that of [[Friedrich Ohly]] in his essay "On the spiritual sense of the word in the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Ohly, "On the spiritual sense of the word in the Middle Ages", in Ohly ''Sensus Spiritualis: Studies in Medieval Significs and the Philology of Culture'', translated from German by Kenneth Northcott, University of Chicago Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ohly writes:

:It would be foolish to deride such an etymology as unscientific if it helped the people of its time to arrive at a deeper signification of the meaning of the word, since it was precisely the task of etymology at that time to illuminate the spiritual meaning of the word.  Our modern etymology would have appeared questionable to the Middle Ages, because it is bogged down in the literal meaning of the word and does not give any explanation of the meaning of the world or of life.  The spiritual meaning of the word with its universe of signification, and its scope of signification, contains an interpretation of meaning that derives from the Christian spirit and is thus a guide to life...&lt;ref&gt;Ohly, "Spiritual meaning", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narsinh Mehta''', also known as '''Narsi Mehta''' or '''Narsi Bhagat''' &lt;!---(1414–1481)---&gt;, was a 15th-century poet-[[Saint#Hinduism|saint]] of [[Gujarat]], [[India]], notable as a [[Bhakti|bhakta]], an exponent of [[Vaishnava]] poetry. He is especially revered in [[Gujarati literature]], where he is acclaimed as its ''Adi Kavi'' ([[Sanskrit]] for "first among poets"). His bhajan ''[[Vaishnav Jan To]]'' was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s favourite and has become synonymous to him.&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramanuj |first=Jagruti |last2=Ramanuj |first2=Vi |year=2012 |title=Atmagnyani Bhaktakavi Narsinh Mehta (Biography of Narsinh Mehta)  |url= |location=Ahmedabad |publisher=Navsarjan Publication |page= |isbn=978-93-81443-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography per traditional sources==
Narsinh Mehta was born in a [[Nagar Brahmin]] family at [[Talaja]] and later moved to [[Junagadh]] in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] peninsula of modern-day Gujarat. His father held an administrative post in a royal court. He lost his parents when he was five years old. He could not speak until the age of eight. He was raised by his grandmother Jaygauri.&lt;ref name="iss"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvJa5nTi3VsC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Shodash+Granth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CGtEUcHQE4iyrAe014CAAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vallabhacharya&amp;f=false | title=Indian Saints &amp; Sages | publisher=Pustak Mahal | author=Prasoon, Shrikant | year=2009 | page=169 | isbn=9788122310627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He married Manekbai probably in the year 1429. Mehta and his wife stayed at his brother Bansidhar's house in Junagadh. However, Bansidhar's wife (Sister-in-law or ''bhabhi'') did not welcome Narsinh very well. She was an ill-tempered woman, always taunting and insulting Narsinh Mehta for his devotion (Bhakti). One day, when Narasinh Mehta had enough of these taunts and insults, he left the house and went to a nearby forest in search of some peace, where he fasted and meditated for seven days by a secluded [[Shiva lingam]] until [[Shiva]] appeared before him in person. On the poet's request, the Lord took him to [[Vrindavan]] and showed him the eternal ''[[Rasa lila|raas leela]]'' of [[Krishna]] and the [[Gopis]]. A legend has it that the poet, transfixed by the spectacle, burnt his hand with the torch he was holding, but he was so engrossed in the ecstatic vision that he was oblivious to the pain. Mehta, as the popular account goes, at Krishna's command, decided to sing His praises and the nectarous experience of the ''rasa'' in this mortal world. He resolved to compose around 22,000 [[kirtan]]s or compositions.&lt;ref name="nm"/&gt;

After this divine experience, the transformed Mehta returned to his village, touched his sister-in-law's feet as reverence, and thanked her for insulting him for had she not made him upset, the above episode would not have occurred.

In [[Junagadh]], Mehta lived in poverty with his wife and two children, a son named Shamaldas, and a daughter for whom he had special affection, Kunwarbai. He revelled in devotion to his heart's content along with sadhus, saints, and all those people who were Lord Hari's subjects&amp;nbsp;– Harijans&amp;nbsp;– irrespective of their caste, class or sex. It also seems that he must have fallen into a somewhat ill repute amongst the Nagars following incidents like accepting invitation to sing glories of Lord Krishna in association of devotees belonging to lower social strata. The [[Nagar Brahmins|Nagars]] of Junagadh despised him and spared no opportunity to scorn and insult him {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. By this time, Mehta had already sung about the [[rasa lila|rasaleela]] of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. The compositions are collected under the category of [[Sringara|shringar]] compositions. They are full of intense lyricism, based upon pastimes of conjugal love between the Supreme Lord and His most intimate devotees - the Gopis and are not without allegorical dimensions.&lt;ref name="nm"/&gt;

Soon after his daughter, Kunwarbai's marriage (around 1447) to Shrirang Mehta of [[Una, Gujarat|Una]]'s son, Kunwarbai conceived and it had been a custom for the girl's parents to give gifts and presents to all the in-laws during the seventh month of pregnancy. This custom, known as Mameru, was simply out of the reach of materialistically poor Narsinh who had hardly anything except intransient faith in his Lord. How Krishna helped his beloved devotee is a legend depicted in 'Mameru Na Pada'. This episode is preserved vividly in the memory of [[Gujarati people]] by compositions by later poets and films. Other famous legends include: '[[Hundi]] (Bond)' episode and 'Har Mala (Garland)' episode.  The episode in which none other than Shamalsha Seth cleared a bond written by poverty-stricken beloved, is famous not only in Gujarat but in other parts of India as well. The Har Mala episode deals with the challenge given to Mehta by [[Mandalika III|Ra Mandalika]] (1451–1472), a [[Chudasama]] king, to prove his innocence in the charges of immoral behaviour by making the Lord Himself garland Narsinh. Mehta depicts this episode. How Sri Krishna, in the guise of a wealthy merchant, helped Mehta in getting his son married is sung by the poet in ''Putra Vivah Na Pada''. He went to [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] where, at the age of 79, he is believed to have died. The crematorium at Mangrol is called 'Narsinh Nu Samshan' where one of the sons of Gujarat and more importantly a great Vaishnav was cremated. He will forever be remembered for his poetic works and devotion to Lord Krishna. He is known as the first poet of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] Adi Kavi.&lt;ref name="nm"/&gt;

== Study of biography ==
Darshana Dholakiya had studied the development of biography of Narsinh Mehta. She has divided the development in three stages; biography from his poetry which is autobiographical in nature, biography emerging from poetry of poets born between Krishnadas and [[Premanand Bhatt|Premanand]], biography written by poets after Premanand. She considers second stage very important because an image of Narsinh Mehta's personality was established during this period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Narsinh Mehta|last=Dholakiya|first=Darshana|publisher=Sardar Patel University|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vallabh Vidyanagar|pages=8-20|language=gu|oclc=32204298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---
=== Biography===
Narsinh Mehta was native of [[Junagadh]]. He was Vadnagara Nagar by caste. He is also mentioned as Vadnagara [[Nagar Brahmin]]. He was householder Brahmin. His family was a [[Shaivism|follower of Shiva]] and he had adopted [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] tradition later after grace of Shiva.He had lost his parents when he was young and he was raised by his brother and sister-in-law. He had not gained knowledge as per his caste and had to left home due to his sister-in-law. It does not seem that he had adopted any profession after being involved in [[Bhakti]] (devotion). No other family members are mentioned and he may have lost contact with his brother and sister-in-law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Manekbai was Narsinh Mehta's wife. When Narsinh left home, he went to forest where he worshiped a [[Shivalinga]]. [[Shiva]] emerged and saw him the [[Rasa lila|rasaleela of Braj]] as he was granted boon to see the favorite thing of Shiva. Thus he was introduced to Vaishnava tradition. He returned home and decided to spent his life in devotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He had a son, Shamal and a daughter, Kunvarbai. He had his children married. Shamal had married a daughter of Madan Mehta, a divan of [[Vadnagar]]. Shamal died soon after and his wife continued to stay at Narsinh's house and spent rest of her life in devotion too. After his son, Manekbai died too.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kunvarbai married and Narsinh Mehta was invited by his co-father-in-law when she conceived. It had been a custom, known as ''Mameru'', for the girl's parents to give gifts and presents to all the in-laws during the seventh month of pregnancy. Narsinh being poor, he went only with a Shankh, plate and few leaves of Tulsi. But the episode ends with the miraculous help of god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once few pilgrims, going to [[Dwarka]], were directed to Narsinh by some Nagars to write bond. Narsinh wrote bond to them in name of Shamalsha Sheth in Dwarka. When pilgrims reached Dwarka, nobody accepted their bond and they were told that no person named Shamalsha lives in Dwarka. The confused pilgrims roamed in Dwarka and finally Krishna fulfilled their bond in disguise of Shamlasha Sheth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Few people told Mandalika, the Chudasama king of Junagadh, to test his faith. He was seated and locked in the assembly hall and was told to bring the garland in the neck of god in the temple to his neck. Narsinh prays whole night and the garland appears in his neck the next morning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This four events from his life are found in his compositions of older traditions. All these events are more about his faith in god instead of miracles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other events of later tradition include: the god appearing as a lady to quench thirst of Narsinh as well as fulfilling his hunger when he was meditating. Another event include a [[Śrāddha]] (tradition of venerating ancestors by feeding people) of his father. When he was denied leaving home to worship god, he was seen by others in his home even though he was out for worship. Another event mentions that the community meal being bad, when Narsinh was not invited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
---&gt;
===Time===
No year is mentioned in his compositions. So there is difference of opinions among scholars about his time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The mention of Junagadh king Mandalika is considered to establish his date. No independent poem of the event of garland is found in the biographical poems of the poets of second period like Krishnadas, Vishnudas, Govind, Vishwanath Jani or Premanand but the event of garland is mentioned in some poems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A poem on the event of garland is independently found in the autobiographical poems said to be composed by Narsinh. The oldest manuscript dated [[Samvat]] 1675 has seven poems (''pada'') which also mentions Mandalika. So it can be said that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh was established by Samvat 1675. One poem on the event of garland even mentions Samvat 1512 as the date of event but the authenticity is not established. So it is known that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh is popular in old as well as new traditions. One question emerge from that why did Mandalika tested him even though he was mentioned as a religious Vaishnava in other sources. This Mandalika must have been [[Mandalika III]] ({{reign|1451|1472 CE}} or Samvat 1506–1527) and was defeated by [[Mahmud Begada]]. His defeat is connected to the test of Narsinh. Other reasons for his defeat mentioned are the curse of [[Charan]] lady Nagbai and his relation with wife of his minister Vishal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Clan and pedigree===
In older traditions, there is no mention of his clan. Names of his parents or brother is not mentioned either.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan'' (written after Samvat 1705) mentions one Parvat Mehta but he was not related to Narsinh Mehta and he is just mentioned as a devotee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vallabhdas' ''Shamaldasno Vivah'' gives information about his clan and ancestry. Purushottam is mentioned as his grandfather. His ''[[gotra]]'' is Kashyap. His Veda division and his family deities (''Kuladevta'' and ''Kuladevi'') is also mentioned. The following family tree is mentioned in it:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Purushottam
**Parvatdas
***Narbat
***Haridas
***Ram
**Krishnadas
***Narsinh
***Jivan
***Narbheram

''Draupadi Pattavidhan'' composed by Rangildas, son of Trikamdas, mentions that Trikamdas was mentioned in Narsinh's clan. But it can be taken as the common Nagar clan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several pedigrees are recorded later but they differ from each other. One pedigree even mentions Narsinh as an uncle of Parvatdas though Parvatdas is commonly mentioned as an uncle of Narsinh. So authenticity of these pedigrees are questionable. Vallabhdas' ''Shamaldas no Vivah'' has years of Narsinh arranged so it seems that he had tried to establish his biography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

So Dholakiya opines that the authentic pedigree of Narsinh Mehta has not survived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Place of worshiped Shivalinga===
The exact location of the non-reverend Shivalinga worshiped by Narsinh is not mentioned in old as well as new traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Shamaldas No Vivah'', purportedly composed by Narsinh himself, mentions the place as Gopinath. Later work ''Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan'' mentions it as Gopeshwar. Some scholars mentions [[Gopnath]] near [[Talaja]] as the place but it is dubious because Narsinh had worshiped it in forest while the Gopnath is on the seashore. It must have been near Junagadh because mention of forest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Family tradition===
As he worshiped Shiva after leaving home, it can be said that his family tradition was [[Shaivism]]. He became [[Vaishnava]] due to Shiva. It is mentioned that other Nagars opposed him due to his Vaishnava tradition. Vishwanath Jani's ''Mosalacharitra'' mentions that a Nagar opposed him saying that he is not ''vipra'' (Brahmin) because he is Vaishnava. So Dholakiya opines that the event of Shiva may have originated to make his Vaishnava devotion acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Harivallabh Bhayani]] opines that the Vaishnava devotion was prevalent in Narshin's time and it is not unusual that he was devotee of Vaishnava. He also mentions the ''Vaishnava'' surname among Nagars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Education and profession===
No education or profession other than religious devotion is mentioned in his poetry. It is said that he became poet due to grace of god but Bhayani opines that, if we consider ''Chaturi'' as his full or partial composition, its language, style and emotion establishes Narsinh's knowledge of literary traditions and creativity. Narsinh must have known ''[[Geet Govind]]'', [[Vedant]] etc. It works seem influenced by Marathi poets like [[Namdev]]. So he must have studied according to his Nagar family tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Society and Narsinh===
Narsinh was opposed in his Nagar society but the opposition was not strong as much seen in other saint-poets like [[Meera]] and [[Kabir]] of that era.
The reasons behind opposition seem his acceptance of Vaishnava tradition even though his family tradition was Shaiva, his attitude towards society and poor and his friendly devotion to god in view of orthodox society. His life events matches events of several popular saint-poets like [[Surdas]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Meera]], [[Kabir]], [[Namdev]] and Sundarar. While several saint-poets are not involved in household, Narsinh was involved in household even after his commitment to devotion. He lived with his family and he did not had any followers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{wikisource|gu:નરસિંહ મહેતા|Narsinh Mehta}}
Mehta is a pioneer poet of [[Gujarati literature]]. He is known for his literary forms called "pada (verse)", "[[Akhyana]]" and "[[Prabhatiya]]" (morning devotional songs).
One of the most important features of Mehta's works is that they are not available in the language in which Narsinh had composed them. They have been largely preserved orally. The oldest available manuscript of his work is dated around 1612, and was found by the noted scholar [[Keshavram Kashiram Shastri]] from [[Gujarat Vidhya Sabha]]. Because of the immense popularity of his works, their language has undergone modifications with changing times. Mehta wrote many bhajans and Aartis for lord Krishna, and they are published in many books. The biography of Mehta is also available at [[Geeta Press]].

For the sake of convenience, the works of Mehta are divided into three categories:
# Autobiographical compositions: ''Putra Vivah/Shamaldas no Vivah'', ''Mameru/Kunvarbai nu Mameru'', ''Hundi'', ''Har Mala'', ''Jhari Na Pada'', and compositions depicting acceptance of [[Harijan]]s. These works deal with the incidents from the poet’s life and reveal how he encountered the divine in various guises. They consist of 'miracles' showing how god helped his devotee Narsinh in the time of crises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Miscellaneous Narratives: ''Chaturis'', ''Sudama Charit'', ''Dana Leela'', and episodes based on Srimad Bhagwatam. These are the earliest examples of akhyana or narrative type of compositions found in Gujarati. These include:
## ''Chaturis'', 52 compositions resembling Jaydeva’s masterpiece Geeta Govinda dealing with various erotic exploits of Radha and Krishna.
## ''Dana Leela'' poems dealing with the episodes of Krishna collecting his dues (dana is toll, tax or dues) from [[Gopi]]s who were going to sell buttermilk etc. to Mathura.
## ''Sudama Charit'' is a narrative describing the well-known story of Krishna and [[Sudama]].
## ''Govinda Gamana'' or the "Departure of Govind" relates the episode of [[Akrura]] taking away Krishna from Gokul.
## ''Surata Sangrama'', The Battle of Love, depicts in terms of a battle the amorous play between Radha and her girl friends on the one side and Krishna and his friends on the other.
## Miscellaneous episodes from Bhagwatam like the birth of Krishna, his childhood pranks and adventures.
# ''Songs of Sringar''. These are hundreds of padas dealing with the erotic adventures and the amorous exploits of Radha and Krishna like Ras Leela. Various clusters of padas like Rasasahasrapadi and Sringar Mala fall under this head. Their dominant note is erotic (Sringar). They deal with stock erotic situations like the ossified Nayaka-Nayika Bheda of classical Sanskrit [[Kavya]] poetics.&lt;ref name="nm"/&gt;

See: ''[[Vaishnav jan to]]'', his popular composition.

==In popular culture==
The first [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati talkie film]], ''[[Narsinh Mehta (1932 film)|Narsinh Mehta]]'' (1932) directed by Nanubhai Vakil was based on Narsinh Mehta's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/comment-gujarati-cinema-a-battle-for-relevance-1777960|title=Gujarati cinema: A battle for relevance|date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was devoid of any miracles due to Gandhian influence. The bilingual film ''Narsi Bhagat'' in Hindi ''Narsi Mehta'' in Gujarati (1940) directed by Vijay Bhatt included miracles and had paralleled Mehta with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. ''Narsaiyo'' (1991) was a Gujarati television series telecast by the [[Ahmedabad]] centre of [[Doordarshan]] starring [[Darshan Jariwala]] in lead role. This 27-episode successful series was produced by Nandubhai Shah and directed by Mulraj Rajda.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199976416.001.0001/acprof-9780199976416|title=Narasinha Mehta of Gujarat : A Legacy of Bhakti in Songs and Stories|last=Shukla-Bhatt|first=Neelima|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199976416|location=New York|pages=105-109, 213, 220|oclc=872139390|via=Oxford Scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a new printing is from the original medium it is classed as a ''[[Postage stamp reprint|reprint]]'', but where the original medium is no longer available, perhaps because the original printing plates have been destroyed, it is classed as a ''new print'' or ''afterprint''.

For instance, the 1856 10 kopek stamp from Finland was reprinted in 1862 by the same method as the original (typography) and from the original steel die. In 1892 the Russian Director of Posts and Telegraphs ordered the stamp to be printed again, however, the original die was not available and the stamp was therefore reproduced using lithography, making it a ''new print''.&lt;ref name=stone/&gt; Had the later stamp not been officially authorised it would be classed as a forgery.

{{Numeral systems}}
A '''numeral system''' (or '''system of numeration''') is a [[writing system]] for expressing numbers; that is, a [[mathematical notation]] for representing [[number]]s of a given set, using [[Numerical digit|digits]] or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems. For example, "11" represents the number ''three'' in the [[binary numeral system]] (used in [[computer]]s) and the number ''eleven'' in the [[decimal numeral system]] (used in common life).

The number the numeral represents is called its value.

Ideally, a numeral system will:
*Represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all [[integer]]s, or [[rational number]]s)
*Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least a standard representation)
*Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers.

For example, the usual [[decimal]] representation of whole numbers gives every nonzero whole number a unique representation as a [[finite set|finite]] [[sequence]] of [[numerical digit|digits]], beginning with a non-zero digit. However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers in general have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.

Numeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.

==Main numeral systems==
{{main|List of numeral systems}}
The most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wEw6AAAAMAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Indian mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Aryabhata]] of [[Patna|Kusumapura]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding countries due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Arabs adopted and modified it. Even today, the Arabs call the numerals which they use "Rakam Al-Hind" or the Hindu numeral system. The Arabs translated Hindu texts on numerology and spread them to the western world due to their trade links with them. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit–Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.

The simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by &lt;tt&gt;///////&lt;/tt&gt;. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.

The unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, − for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as &lt;tt&gt;+++ ////&lt;/tt&gt; and the number 123 as &lt;tt&gt;+ − − ///&lt;/tt&gt; without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.

More useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for "one occurrence", B "two occurrences", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type ("three hundred [and] four"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 × 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 × 20 − 1}}). In English, one could say "four score less one", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing "87 years ago" as "four score and seven years ago".

More elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&amp;nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&amp;nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3×100 + 0×10 + 4×1}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 4×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note that zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to "skip" a power. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&amp;nbsp;10 system.

Arithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&amp;nbsp;10).

The positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&amp;nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.

In [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&amp;nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].

The numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.

In certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&amp;nbsp;1 is the same as unary.

==Positional systems in detail==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]--&gt;
{{See also|Positional notation}}
In a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.

For example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''3'''×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''2'''×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''7'''×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, noting that {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}.

In general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' − 1}}, inclusive.

If a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&amp;nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.

By using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&amp;nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1×2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×2&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×2&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 2.75}}.

In general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
(a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\cdots)_b =
\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_kb^{-k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is &lt;math&gt;k = \log_{b} w = \log_{b} b^k&lt;/math&gt;. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.

The number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only &lt;math&gt;k + 1 = \log_{b} w + 1&lt;/math&gt;, for ''k'' ≥ 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1&lt;/math&gt;. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is &lt;math&gt;\log_b k + 1 = \log_b \log_b w + 1&lt;/math&gt; (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).

Note that a number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.0100110011001...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&amp;nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|π]] {{=}} 3.1415926...&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Putting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''ṅ'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:
:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.

If ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].

==Generalized variable-length integers==
More general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like &lt;math&gt;a_0 a_1 a_2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

This is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of "digits" from a collection of 36: a–z and 0–9, representing 0–25 and 26–35 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b–9 (1–35), therefore the weight ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 × 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:

a (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.

Unlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed – the a would terminate the number.

The flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.

The case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.

'''Peter III of [[Raqqa]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2006), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]]: Petrus Callinicus; ''Peter of Callinicum''), was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 581 until his death in 591.

==Biography==
Peter, son of a certain Paul, was born in the 6th century in the city of Callinicum (modern [[Raqqa]]), where he became fluent in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and studied philosophy and theology.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"&gt;Barsoum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The late 6th century was a period of controversy within the church as dispute existed between two factions, the Paulites, supporters of [[Paul II the Black of Alexandria|Paul II]], who had been deposed in 575, and Jacobites, who opposed Paul II. [[Pope Damian of Alexandria]], an opponent of Paul II, consecrated Peter as patriarch at the [[Mor Hananyo Monastery|Monastery of St Ananias]] in 581 and Paul died soon after.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

Afterwards, Peter, with Probus and [[archimandrite]] John Barbur travelled to [[Hauran]] and [[Alexandria]] to promote religious ties with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], another [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]] church.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt; Whilst in Alexandria, upon hearing the preaching of [[Stephanus of Alexandria]], Probus and John Barbur adopted [[monophysitism]] and were subsequently excommunicated and expelled. Probus and John Barbur returned to Syria to promulgate monophysitism. Akin to earlier patriarchs, Peter took residence outside of Antioch as Syriac Orthodox patriarchs were barred from Antioch and resided at the Monastery of Gubba Baraya near [[Manbij|Mabbogh]] where he formulated refutations against monophysitism. In 584/585 or 585/586, Peter held a synod at the monastery and condemned Probus and John Barbur.

In c. 585, Pope Damian published a treatise condemning [[tritheism]], a heretical doctrine popular amongst monophysites, however, Peter considered it [[Sabellianism|sabellian]] and published ''Against Damian'', a three volume treatise refuting Damian, in 588/589. A certain Jafna, a [[Ghassanid]] tribal leader, attempted to reconcile Damian and Peter and organised a meeting at the Church of St. Sergius in [[Jabiyah]], but was unsuccessful and the two churches were in schism until 616 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Khalek (2011), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''Adversus Tritheistas'' or ''Many-lined Letter'', a short treatise refuting tritheism, which may have formed part of ''Against Damian''. Peter administered the Syriac Orthodox Church until his death at the Monastery of Gubba Barraya on 22 April 591 AD.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

'''Kari Peter Conrad von Bagh''' (29 August 1943 – 17 September 2014) was a Finnish film historian and director. Von Bagh worked as the head of the [[Finnish Film Archive]]. He was the editor-in-chief of ''[[Filmihullu]]'' magazine and co-founder and director of the [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jorn Rossing Jensen|title=Finnish filmmaker Peter von Bagh dies|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/finnish-filmmaker-peter-von-bagh-dies/5077850.article|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Screen Daily|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, he had been the artistic director of the film festival [[Il Cinema Ritrovato]] in [[Bologna]]. Von Bagh was a member of the jury in the competition category of [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].

Films directed by Peter von Bagh are screened at prestigious international forums, including an extensive retrospective of his works at the [[Rotterdam]] International Film Festival and Festival Internacional de Cine Independente in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2012, and at the [[Tromsø]] International Film Festival in 2013.

Principal works of Peter von Bagh's production of approximately 40 non-fiction books, mostly on cinema, and some 60 films for both the cinemas and television include his internationally successful films ''Helsinki, Forever'' (2008) and ''Sodankylä, Forever'' (2010–2011, a documentary series of the first twenty-five years of the [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]]), ''Song of Finland'' ("The Story of Art in Finland During the Era of Independence", a twelve-episode television series, YLE 2003–04, and a book published by WSOY 2007), ''Elokuvan historia'' ("History of Cinema", a 52-episode radio series, YLE and a book published by W&amp;G 1975, Otava 1998, 2004) and ''Tähtien kirja'' ("The Book of Stars", Otava, 2006). The book ''Aki Kaurismäki'' has been translated into several languages. He died in 2014 at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/midnight_sun_film_festival_director_peter_von_bagh_passes/7485125 Midnight Sun film festival director Peter von Bagh passes], YLE News, 22 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
Born to a [[Germans in Russia|German Russian]] psychiatrist father,&lt;ref&gt;Tervo, Jukka: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyo_DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT78&amp;dq=peter%20von%20Bagh%20konrad&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PT78#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20von%20Bagh%20konrad&amp;f=false Ketä rakastamme kun rakastamme Elvistä] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirjastolinkit.ouka.fi/kaleva/maalis14/konrad.htm Konradin kovan kuoren alle] {{fi icon}} Kaleva&lt;/ref&gt; Von Bagh graduated from the [[Oulun Lyseon Lukio|Oulun lyseo]] Upper Secondary School in 1961. He took his Master of Arts degree at [[University of Helsinki]] in 1970 with a combination of subjects consisting of Theoretical Philosophy, [[Sociology]], [[Aesthetics]], and Literature. His dissertation ''Elokuvalliset keinot ja niiden käyttö: Alfred Hitchcockin Vertigo'' was later published as a book (Helsingin yliopisto, 1979). Von Bagh took his degree of Doctor of Social Sciences in 2002. His doctoral thesis ''Peili jolla oli muisti – elokuvallinen kollaasi kadonneen ajan merkityksien hahmottajana'' (1895–1970), (SKS 2002) examines the fundamental units of cinematic expression, montage and collage.

Von Bagh has taught and lectured at several schools and universities, e.g. as Professor of Film History at [[Aalto University]] since 2001. He has also compiled a textbook on cinema, ''Salainen muisti'' (Sanoma Pro, 2009), to be used in schools.

== Films ==
The connecting thought in Peter von Bagh's production is the history of everyday Finnish life: images of details conveying something of what the life of the Finns has been like. The films ''Vuosi 1952'' ("The Year 1952", 1980), ''Viimeinen kesä 1944'' ("The Last Summer 1944", 1992), ''Helsinki, Forever'' (2008) and ''Splinters – A Century Of An Artistic Family'' (2011) provide a magnifying glass for peeking at history, defined by a certain moment in time, location, or an artistic family.

In a Letter to the Director published in the [[Pordenone Silent Film Festival]] catalogue 2008, [[Chris Marker]] wrote about von Bagh's film ''Helsinki, Forever'': "'Few movies may boast a stronger opening sequence, and few movies offer such an extraordinary finale. And in-between I guess what I admire most is the fluidity of the editing, your way to play with time in a manner that comes at once as always surprising and perfectly natural. HELSINKI deserves its rank among the great "city-poems", and I'd rate it above Ruttmann, for instance, for one reason: if I read in his BERLIN the social commitment and the aesthetic maestria, I don't feel the personal acquaintance with the city, its history, its ghosts, that I found in yours. Also something that many have a tendency to underestimate but which for me is crucial: the music. The Zeppelin sequence by itself carries a haunting beauty, akin to Fellini's liner, but I don't think it would attain this climax of emotion if at that moment the music didn't bring the perfect tune of melancholia. So with the choice of incredible documents and the unfailing mixture of both musical items, editing and score, you made an unforgettable film."

Von Bagh made dozens of films for television, including portraits of prominent Finns from different fields (Tapio Rautavaara in ''Tapsa – Slashes from a Rover's Life'', 1980; ''Paavo Nurmi'', 1978; Otto Ville Kuusinen in ''Mies varjossa'', 1994), musicians (''Olavi Virta'', 1972; ''Suomi Pop'', 1984), actors (''Tauno Palo'', 1981) and film directors (Edvin Laine, 2006; Mikko Niskanen, 2010).

Von Bagh's fiction films are often documentary in their own way: the main character of ''The Count'' (1971) is Pertti Ylermi Lindgren, a con man elevated to nobility by the tabloid papers. ''Pockpicket'' (1968) is a variation on [[Robert Bresson]]'s ''[[Pickpocket (film)|Pickpocket]]'' (1959). In it, an estranged young man attempts to instil tension into his life by slipping banknotes into the wallets of the city-dwellers.

As a scriptwriter, Von Bagh has participated in the making of Risto Jarva's ''Time of Roses'' (1969), ''Rally'' (1970) and ''When the Heavens Fall..'' (1972).

== Literary production ==
Von Bagh's literary production includes almost 40 books of non-fiction. In 2007, von Bagh received the Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland's State Award for Public Information for a Lifetime Achievement. The same year his book ''Song of Finland'' was awarded The Finlandia Literary Prize for Non-Fiction. He has received the State Award for Public Information twice, in 1986 for ''Iskelmän kultainen kirja'' ("Golden Book of Finnish Pop Songs" co-author Ilpo Hakasalo) and in 1975 for ''Elokuvan historia'' ("History of Cinema". In 1992 The Finnish Literature Society SKS presented him with the SKS Elias Lönnroth Award for ''Suomalaisen elokuvan kultainen kirja'' (Golden Book of Finnish Cinema").

Von Bagh's essays and articles have been published in several film books and magazines both in Finland and abroad. The most famous of these are the French [[L'Écran]], [[Cahiers du cinéma]], [[Trafic]] and [[Cinema 02]], the Italian Cinegrafie, the Spanish Nosferatu, the Swedish Chaplin, the British Movie, etc.

Up until his death Peter von Bagh worked as the editor-in-chief of Filmihullu, the magazine he founded in 1968.

Abroad, von Bagh worked as a cinema expert for the French non-fiction publishing house [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] in 2009, and as a permanent contributing editor of the Italian Einaudi publishing company.

=== Love kirjat ===
Peter von Bagh was also active promoter of literature in his native country, working as an editor and preface writer for the Love kirjat publishing company during 1977–1996. The titles published by Love kirjat, more than one hundred, include translations of world literature classics from [[Aiskhylos]] (''Oresteia'', Love 1991) to [[Balzac]] (''Lost Illusions'', Love 1983, ''The Splendors and Miseries of Courtesans''', Love 1991), from [[Jack London]] (''The Iron Heel'', Love 1977) to [[August Strindberg]] (''Pieni katekismus'', Love 1981), to poetry (e.g. Matti Rossi), essayism (e.g. Raoul Palmgren) and detective stories ([[James M. Cain|James Cain]]: ''Double Indemnity'', Love 1982), literature research ([[György Lukács]] ''Balzac ja ranskalainen realismi'', Love 1978), not forgetting economics, military history, and [[Sigmund Freud]] ''The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious'', Love 1983).

Love kirjat has also brought several fundamental works of film literature to the Finnish readers, e.g. [[André Bazin]]'s essays (Love 1981, 1990), [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''Film Form: Essays in Film Theory'' (Love, 1978); Federico Fellini's ''Fellini on Fellini'' (Love, 1980) and ''Giulietta'' (Love, 1990); Jean Renoir's ''My Life And My Films'' (Love, 1980), for which Peter von Bagh has written a preface. Other important Love translations are ''Elokuva Godardin mukaan'', a collection of film criticism by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], translated into Finnish by [[Sakari Toiviainen]] (Love, 1984), and [[François Truffaut]]'s ''The Films in My Life'' (Love, 1982).

Besides film literature, Love also published elemental work of other art forms, e.g. Meyerhold's ''A Revolution in Theatre'' (Love, 1981) and Hanns Eisler's essays on music (Love, 1980).

== Festival directorships ==
The [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]] was founded in 1986 on the initiative of Anssi Mänttäri. In addition to Mänttäri, the Festival policy and guidelines were created by Kaurismäki brothers, Mika and [[Aki Kaurismäki]] and Peter von Bagh.

The key elements of this festival of the midnight sun are the magical light of the North, and the film screenings. Contrary to the glittering award forums, the Midnight Sun Film Festival does not look for glamour. Instead, the main role is given to the films. The programming includes both classics and forward-looking works from the world over. They are presented in their original format, the silent films accompanied by live music.

The two-hour morning discussions, hosted by Peter von Bagh throughout the Festival's history, are internationally unique items. From discussions with hundreds of guests, Peter von Bagh has selected the best elements for his book ''Sodankylä, Forever'' (WSOY, 2010) and a four-part documentary series of the same name. The series has garnered extensive praise at the world's film forums, e.g. at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York in August 2011 when Nico Baumbach wrote in Film Comment (Sept/Oct 2011):

""Von Bagh's four-part series is a wise and generous act of preservation. Assembled largely from interviews with directors conducted over a 25-year period at the Midnight Sun Film Festival he runs in the tiny Finnish municipality of Sodankylä, the film does a double duty as a celebration of the festival itself and as a veritable history of cinema and the 20th century. As von Bagh explains, the life of cinema is short enough "that a small festival far up north can span it completely." One of the questions addressed to all guests – "What was the first film you saw?" – becomes a way to extend the story of the festival back to the silent era, because a "festival is as deep as the memory it contains.""

The Midnight Sun Film Festival guest list include e.g. the French [[Chris Marker]], [[Jean Rouch]], [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]], [[Jean-Pierre Léaud]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jacques Demy]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Robert Guédiguian]] and the brothers Pierre and [[Luc Dardenne]], the Iranian [[Jafar Panahi]], [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and [[Samira Makhmalbaf]], the Hungarian [[István Szabó]], [[Miklós Jancsó]] and [[Béla Tarr]], the Polish [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]], [[Agnieszka Holland]], [[Jerzy Kawalerowicz]] and [[Krzysztof Zanussi]], the Czech [[Ivan Passer]] and [[Miloš Forman]], the Russian [[Marlen Khutsiev]], [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], [[Aleksei Yuryevich German|Alexei German]], [[Andrei Smirnov (actor)|Andrei Smirnov]]. [[Samuel Fuller]], [[D. A. Pennebaker]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Roger Corman]], [[Vincent Sherman]], [[Joseph H. Lewis]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] from the USA, the Argentinian [[Fernando Solanas]], the Palestinian [[Elia Suleiman]], the Israeli [[Amos Gitai]], the German [[Wim Wenders]] and [[Robby Müller]], the Egyptian [[Youssef Chahine]], the Malinese [[Souleymane Cissé]], the Italians [[Nanni Moretti]], [[Paolo Taviani]], [[Sergio Sollima]] and [[Dino Risi]]. [[Dusan Makavejev]] and [[Emir Kusturica]] from former [[Yugoslavia]], and already during the first year, [[Michael Powell]] from the United Kingdom.

In addition, the festival has had the privilege of being able to listen to major film writers like [[Joāo Bénard da Costa]], [[Jim Hoberman]], [[Jean Douchet]], [[Bernard Eisenschitz]] and [[Olaf Möller]].

Since 2001 Peter von Bagh has worked as the [[Artistic Director]] of [[Il Cinema Ritrovato]] Festival in [[Bologna]]. The Festival specializes in "recovered" treasures, previously believed lost or unknown, silent films and restored prints. The screen annually erected in [[Piazza Maggiore]] in Bologna at the turn of June/July attracts an audience of thousands of spectators. The Festival audience includes both local cinephiles and international specialists of the field.

Von Bagh also acted as an Artistic Expert for [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] in 2009, the Visiting Artistic Director of the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in 1997, and as a member of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] Competition section in 2004.

== Film archives ==
Peter von Bagh worked as the Executive Director of the Finnish Film Archive in 1966–1969, and as the Programme Planner until 1984. During that period, the Archive's programming gained its present esteemed reputation, and the number of screenings proliferated.

In the speech von Bagh gave at the FIAF (International Federation of Film Archives) conference in [[Lisbon]] in 1989 he emphasized: 
"When I started the Archive offered only two screenings per week. I immediately increased the number of screenings to four. Soon we managed to screen eight films each week. A few years passed this way, and when the confidence of the audience had solidified, we began to screen three films a day." It was a golden era for the cinemas in Helsinki. An example: "In the 1970s Bresson's films brought in more money in Helsinki than in Paris."

Peter von Bagh continues: "Many archives have fallen for easy baits and an emphasis on fashionable films. That is the best way to lose an audience whose confidence can only be won through a patient building process. Officials equipped with short-sighted calculations may find it difficult to understand why a small archive would order a rare film from a distant country for one screening only. Calculations like this easily paralyzes socio-cultural activities altogether. The discrepancy hangs in the air, written in fiery letters: the audience seems to be drooling after de Palma and Eastwood, although an inner voice calls you to screen bodies of works scrutinizing the output of Victor Sjöström and Carl Th. Dreyer...
The first screening of [[Victor Sjöström]] or [[Carl Th. Dreyer]] might bring in fifteen people, but after five years and some more efforts there will be a full house. The preservation prints of an early [[Yevgeni Bauer]] film, or [[Maurice Tourneur]]'s ''The Wishing Ring'' (which would be almost nothing in 16 mm or in video) will look just miraculous to any public that comes in – and there will be one once you build a place where everyone can trust that miracles take place, almost on daily basis. --. In the beginning a film maybe a complete unknown but the visiting card it leaves behind remains forever: a wonderful beauty."

In the same speech, von Bagh defines the responsibilities of the archives: preservation of a confidential relationship with the audience, protection and restoration of the classics, and especially domestic films, and supportto film clubs as a common film bank which makes the screenings possible.

In linguistics, the '''Philippine languages''' are a proposal by Zorc (1986) and [[Robert Blust]] (1991, 2005) that all the languages of the [[Philippines]] and northern [[Sulawesi]]—except [[Sama–Bajaw languages|Sama–Bajaw]] (languages of the "Sea Gypsies") and a few languages of [[Palawan]]—form a [[language family|subfamily]] of [[Austronesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Zorc, R.D.

==Classification==
From approximately north to south, the Philippine languages are divided into the following subgroups:

*[[Batanic languages]] (4 languages between [[Batanes]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]])
*[[Northern Luzon languages]] (40 languages, including [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]])
*[[Central Luzon languages]] (5 languages, including [[Sambalic languages|Sambal]] and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]])
*[[Northern Mindoro languages]] (or North Mangyan; 3 languages)
*[[Greater Central Philippine languages]]
**[[Southern Mindoro languages]] (or South Mangyan; 3 languages)
**[[Central Philippine languages]] (40 languages, including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Bikol languages]] and [[Visayan languages]])
**[[Palawan languages]] (3 languages)
**[[Subanon language|Subanen languages]] (6 languages)
**[[Danao languages]] (3 languages, including [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]] and [[Maranao language|Maranao]])
**[[Manobo languages]] (15 languages)
**[[Gorontalo–Mongondow languages]] (9 languages of [[Gorontalo]] and [[North Sulawesi]])
*[[Kalamian languages]] (2 languages of northern [[Palawan]])
*[[South Mindanao languages]] (5 languages)
*[[Sangiric languages]] (4 languages of [[Sangihe Islands|Sangir]] and [[Talaud Islands]])
*[[Minahasan languages]] (5 languages of [[North Sulawesi]])

In addition, the [[Ati language|Ati]], [[Umiray Dumaget language|Umiray Dumaget]], [[Manide language|Manide]], and [[Inagta Alabat language|Inagta Alabat]] languages are unclassified within the Philippine family, and are considered by Reid (2013)&lt;ref name="Reid2013"/&gt; to be early splits from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">The term '''reparation''' was used by [[Melanie Klein]] (1921) to indicate a psychological process of making mental repairs to a damaged internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Lani A. Gerity, ''Creativity and the Dissociated Patient'' (1999) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In [[object relations theory]], it represents a key part of the movement from the [[paranoid-schizoid position]] to the [[depressive position]] — the pain of the latter helping to fuel the urge to reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Caper, ''Immaterial Facts'' (2000) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klein==
{{Main|Melanie Klein|Splitting (psychology)#Melanie Klein|l2=Klein's theory splitting}}
Klein considered the ability to recognise our destructive impulses towards those we love, and to make reparation for the damage we have caused them, to be an essential part of mental health. A key condition for this to take place is the recognition of one's separateness from one's parents,&lt;ref name = Segal89&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; which makes possible the reparative attempt to restore their inner representations, however damaged these may be felt to be.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of reality, inner and outer, forms a major part of this process; it involves both an abandonment of fantasies of [[omnipotence]],&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and accepting the independent existence of one's objects of attachment.&lt;ref name = Segal89/&gt;

Where the damage done to the internal world is felt by a patient to be extreme, however, the task of reparation may seem too great — which is one of the obstacles facing the analytic attempt at cure.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic reparation==

Kleinian thought distinguishes between true reparation and manic reparation, the latter being driven by guilt rather than overcoming it.&lt;ref&gt;Hyam Sydney Klein/Joan Symington, ''Imprisoned Pain and its Transformation'' (London 2000) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Manic reparation denies the pain and concern of feeling guilty by using magical methods of repair&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 84-5 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; which maintain omnipotent control of the object in question, and refuse to allow it its separate existence. Thus manic reparation has to be endlessly repeated, since success would free the object from the manic person's (contemptuous) power.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winnicott==
{{Main|Donald Winnicott}}
Donald Winnicott made his own distinctive contribution to the role of reparation in the "personalising" of the individual, the move from the ruthless use of the external object to a sense of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 34-5&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott focused on the way at a certain stage of development a feeling of guilt or concern begins to appear after the wholehearted instinctual experience of a feed. But once the reparative gesture—a smile, a gift—has been successfully acknowledged by the mother, Winnicott writes: "The breast (body, mother) is now mended and the day's work is done. Tomorrow's instincts can be awaited with limited fear".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 17 and p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The child's contribution is a way of accepting the debt owed to the mother, for their survival and their participation in the work of reparation.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83/&gt; If, on the other hand, the reparative gesture is not accepted, the infant is left with a feeling of depression or meaninglessness.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83&gt;A. Gaitanidis/P. Curk, ''Narcissism: A Critical Reader'' (London 2007) p. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar dynamic may later appear between patient and analyst, with the making of progress being offered as a means of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;I. Salzberger-Wittenberg, ''Psychoanalytic Insight and Relationships'' (1984) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Kleinians considered that artistic creation was driven by the phantasy of repairing the loved object (mother).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Nicola Glover "Psychoanalytic Aesthetics: The British School"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marion Milner]] in the [[Middle Group|Independent]] tradition also saw art as a way of both symbolizing and enacting inner reparation;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; but was criticised by Kleinians for giving too large a role to the omnipotent feelings of the artist in reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinshelwood, Chapter 3 n54, in [http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Glover]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Wikipedia''' ({{lang-ru|{{#property:P1448}}}}, ''''Russkaya Vikipediya'''') is the [[Russian-language]] edition of Wikipedia. As of {{Currentmonth}}, {{Currentyear}}, it has [[:ru:Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|ru|N}} articles]]. It was started on 11 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-May/000116.html&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 it became the sixth-largest Wikipedia by the number of articles. It has the fifth-largest number of edits ({{Format price|{{NUMBEROF|EDITS|ru}}}}). Since 2016, [[Alexa Internet]] rankings tend to show it as the world's most visited language Wikipedia after [[English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/wikipedia.org|title=Wikipedia.org Traffic, Demographics and Competitors - Alexa|website=www.alexa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the largest Wikipedia written in any [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]], surpassing its nearest rival, the [[Polish Wikipedia]], eightfold by the parameter of [[:meta:Wikipedia article depth|depth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[meta:List of Wikipedias#All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles|All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Russian Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Wikipedias#List|List of Wikipedias given in decadic logarithm]]&lt;/ref&gt; or in a script other than [[Latin script]]. In April 2016, the project had 3,377 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, ranking third behind the English and Spanish versions.

==Policies==
Difficult issues are resolved through the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]], which handles content disputes, blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [[:ru:Википедия:Арбитражный комитет|ru:WP:Arbitration Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrators (currently {{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|ru|N}}) are elected through a vote; a minimum [[quorum]] of 30 voters and 66% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Administrators who have become inactive (i.e. have not used administrative tools, such as "delete" or "block" buttons, at least 25 times in six months) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [[:ru:ВП:А#Лишение статуса неактивных администраторов|ru:WP:Administrators (rus)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
As of 1 June 2012, some of the biggest categories (which contain more than 5,000 articles) in the Russian Wikipedia are:&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Служебная:Mostlinkedcategories|Most linked categories]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*176,411 biographical articles. Although the Western [[name order]] (given name(s) followed by family name) is generally used in Russian, the Russian Wikipedia uses lexical order (last name, comma, given name(s) and also the [[patronymic]] for most people from ex-Soviet countries) for all articles on non-fictional persons. This order has been traditionally used in major Russian language encyclopedias, like the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]''.
*144,322 [[human settlement]]s articles. 
*28,187 river articles
*19,302 film articles
*16,925 animal articles
*16,517 [[Scientist|scientific]] articles
*16,133 surname articles
*13,936 [[Association football|footballers']] articles
*11,247 Musicians' articles
*10,755 Writers' articles
*9,243 album articles
*9,237 articles on recipients of the [[Order of Lenin]]
*7,307 Company's articles
*6,734 plant articles
*6,574 street articles
*6,265 [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] astronomical articles
*6,157 actors articles
*5,719 artist articles
*5,580 music group articles
*5,292 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] articles

10,340 articles contain material from the ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]''.

More than 11,000 articles were translated from the [[English Wikipedia]].

===Namespaces===
In addition to common{{which|date=December 2014}} Wikipedia [[namespace]]s, the Russian Wikipedia has three custom ones: "Incubator" (# 102–103) – which is used as a training camp for new users and their first articles, "Project" (# 104–105) – for [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|Wikipedia projects]] and "Arbitration" (# 106–107) – for [[Wikipedia:Arbitration|arbitration]] requests.

==Criticism==
In 2015, [[Roman Leibov]], a professor at [[University of Tartu]], in an interview opined that articles related to humanities in the Russian Wikipedia are of considerably inferior quality compared to English Wikipedia, and some articles even deteriorate with time. He suggested that this effect is due to overzealous policing of intellectual property rights by the community and bemoaned poor editing skills of some Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gefter.ru/archive/15359|title=Википедия – знакомая и неизвестная|last=Усыскин|first=Лев|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Гефтер|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Wiki.500.000.png|thumb|150px|Celebration logo for 500.000 articles plays a pun as "half a lemon" means "half a million" in Russian jargon.]]
[[File:Ru-wiki awards-2010.jpg|thumb|left|Awards of RuWiki. "Golden site" prize (2007) and four [[Runet Prize]]s (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010)]]
The Russian Wikipedia was created on 20 May 2001 in the first wave of non-English Wikipedias, along with editions in [[Catalan Wikipedia|Catalan]], [[Chinese Wikipedia|Chinese]], [[Dutch Wikipedia|Dutch]], [[German Wikipedia|German]], [[Esperanto Wikipedia|Esperanto]], [[French Wikipedia|French]], [[Hebrew Wikipedia|Hebrew]], [[Italian Wikipedia|Italian]], [[Japanese Wikipedia|Japanese]], [[Portuguese Wikipedia|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish]], and [[Swedish Wikipedia|Swedish]].

[[File:Russian Wikipedia – Most popular edition of Wikipedia by country – Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report – 1 Jul 2009-31 Oct 2013.svg|thumb|right|The countries in which the Russian Wikipedia is the most popular language version of Wikipedia are shown in red ([[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]).&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryTrends.htm|title=Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report – Wikipedia Page Views Per Country – Trends|author=Erik Zachte|date=14 November 2011|publisher=Wikimedia Statistics|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first edit of the Russian Wikipedia was on 24 May 2001, and consisted of the line {{lang|ru|"Россия – великая страна" }}("''Russia is a great nation''"). The following edit changed it to the joke: {{lang|ru|"Россия — родина слонов (ушастых, повышенной проходимости — см. мамонт)"}} ("''Russia is the motherland of elephants (big-eared, improved cross-country capability, see [[Mammoth]].''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news2/2007/09/04/wikipedia/index.htm|script-title=ru:В русской Википедии появилась 200-тысячная статья|date=4 September 2007|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=16 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208020858/http://lenta.ru/news2/2007/09/04/wikipedia/index.htm|archivedate=8 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time development was slow (especially after some participants left for [[WikiZnanie]]), but in the 12-month period between February 2005 and February 2006 it surpassed nine editions in other languages – the Catalan, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Finnish, Norwegian, Chinese, Esperanto and Danish Wikipedias.
In 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010&lt;ref name="ПР2010"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.premiaruneta.ru/laureates/2010/|title=Номинанты и Лауреаты 2010 года|work=Премии Рунета|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian Wikipedia won the "Science and education" category of the "[[Runet Prize]]" ({{lang-ru|link=no|Премия Рунета}}) award, supervised by the [[Politics of Russia|Russian government]] agency [[Rospechat|FAPMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://lenta.ru/news/2005/08/29/premia/_Printed.htm|script-title=ru:Главная премия российского интернета стала государственной|date=29 August 2005|publisher=Lenta.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troubles with the government===
[[File:Ru-wiki-blackout.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Wikipedia Main Page during 10 July 2012 blackout.]]

On 10 July 2012 Russian Wikipedia closed access to its content for 24 hours in protest against proposed amendments to Russia's Information Act ([[Russian State Duma Bill 89417-6|Bill No. 89417-6]]) regulating the accessibility of Internet-based information to children. Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of [[blacklist]]s, which would block access to forbidden sites. Several aspects of this amendment drew criticism from various civil rights activists and Internet providers. In particular, the blacklist inclusion criteria were characterized as "too vague" and "paving the way for [[Internet censorship]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120706/174427445.html|title=Russian Lawmakers Set to Debate Internet Blacklist|date=6 July 2012|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the amendment stated that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as [[child pornography]] and similar information, but the Russian [[:foundation:Wikimedia chapters|Wikimedia chapter]] has declared that conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the "great Chinese firewall". They further claimed that existing Russian legal practice demonstrates a high likelihood of a worst-case scenario, resulting in a country-wide ban of Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ru.wikimedia.org/wiki/Забастовка_Википедии_на_русском_языке|title=Забастовка Википедии на русском языке|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18781869|title=Russian Wikipedia goes dark in protest at censor law|date=10 July 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and the third readings of the law were held in the [[State Duma]] on 11 July; no essential corrections were introduced. The law will come into force after three readings in the State Duma, one reading in the Federation Council and presidential approval.&lt;ref name="Euronews10072012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/07/10/wikipedia-down-in-protest-in-russia/|title=Wikipedia down in protest in Russia|date=10 July 2012|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July, [[Nikolai Nikiforov]], [[Ministry of Communications and Mass Media (Russia)|Russian Minister for Telecommunications and Mass Media]] announced in his Twitter account, that the organization of the List of the prohibited websites (that was sited on the [[Russian State Duma Bill 89417-6|Law Project No. 89417-6]]) will be suspended until 1 November 2012.&lt;ref name="Euronews10072012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/nnikiforov|title=Николай Никифоров|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day [[Yelena Mizulina]], a Duma deputy and the head of the subcommittee which sponsored the law, said that the blackout is an attempt to blackmail the Duma and was sponsored by the "pedophile lobby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slon.ru/russia/elena_mizulina_vikipediya_prikrytie_pedofilskogo_lobbi-809860.xhtml |script-title=ru:Елена Мизулина: Википедия – прикрытие педофильского лобби|last=Доброхотов|first= Роман|author2=Никита Лашук |author3=Маргарита Белодедова |date=10 July 2012|publisher=Slon.ru |language=Russian|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, since 2012, [[Russian foreign agent law]] resulted in reduced funding available for the Russian Wikipedia and its volunteers, who no longer can receive financial aid from abroad, including their share of funds raised through global Wikipedia fundraisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvertjournal.com/opinion/show/2967/wikipedia-russian-government-edits|title=Knowledge is power: why is the Russian government editing Wikipedia?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media]] that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article '[[:ru:%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0|Cannabis Smoking]]' on Russian Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130405/180469665.html|title=Russia May Block Wikipedia Access Over Narcotics Article|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/news/2013/04/05/russian_media_regulator_confirms_wikipedia_blacklisted_24706.html|title=Russian media regulator confirms Wikipedia blacklisted|publisher=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|date= 5 April 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2013 the ''New York Times'' reported that Russia was 'Selectively Blocking [the] Internet',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/technology/russia-begins-selectively-blocking-internet-content.html?_r=0|author=Andrew E. Kramer|title=Russians Selectively Blocking Internet|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 March 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Wikipedia itself was not blocked at that time.

The entire Russian Wikipedia was blocked in the Russian Federation for a few hours in August 2015 due to the contents of the article on [[charas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/08/25/world/europe/ap-eu-russia-wikipedia-ban.html Russia Cancels Short-Lived Wikipedia Ban], The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===False edits made by the government===
Articles on Russian Wikipedia, and also on other Wikipedia versions, concerning the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|flight MH17 down-shoot]] and the [[War in Donbass|2014 Ukraine conflict]] have been targeted by Internet propaganda outlets associated with the Russian government. Some of the edits were spotted by a twitter bot which monitors Wikipedia edits made from Russian government IP addresses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/a-tweetbot-caught-the-russian-govt-editing-flight-mh17-1607483459|title=A Tweetbot Caught the Russian Gov't Editing Flight MH17 Wikipedia Info|first=Robert|last=Sorokanich|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/07/21/flight_mh17s_wikipedia_page_edited_from_ip_address_associated_with_putins_office.html|title=Flight MH17’s Wikipedia page edited by Russian government; An IP address associated with Vladimir Putin’s office has made multiple edits to the Wikipedia page for the MH17 flight page|work=[[Toronto Star]]|agency=The Washington Post|date=July 21, 2014|access-date=August 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeveleva|first=Olga|url=http://calvertjournal.com/comment/show/2967/wikipedia-russian-government-edits|title=Knowledge is power: why is the Russian government editing Wikipedia?|work=The Calvert Journal|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pedagogy]] and theoretical syntax, a '''sentence diagram''' or ''[[parse tree]]'' is a pictorial representation of the [[grammar|grammatical]] structure of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The term "sentence diagram" is used more in pedagogy, where sentences are ''diagrammed''. The term "parse tree" is used in linguistics (especially computational linguistics), where sentences are ''[[Parsing|parsed]]''. Their purposes are to demonstrate the structure of sentences. The model is informative about the relations between words and the nature of syntactic structure and is thus used as a tool to help predict which sentences are and are not possible.

== History ==
Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy are based on the work of Alonzo Reed and [[Brainerd Kellogg]] in their book ''Higher Lessons in English,'' first published in 1877, though the method has been updated with recent understanding of grammar. Reed and Kellogg were preceded, and their work probably informed, by W. S. Clark, who published his "balloon" method of depicting grammar in his 1847 book ''A Practical Grammar: In Which Words, Phrases &amp; Sentences are Classified According to Their Offices and Their Various Relationships to Each Another.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitty Burns Florey]] (2006) [[Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog]], [[Melville House Publishing]] {{ISBN|978-1-933633-10-7}}.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schoolteachers continue to use the Reed–Kellogg system in teaching grammar, but others have discouraged it in favor of more modern tree diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-12-15.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.12.15 |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these modern tree structures draw on techniques that were already present in Reed–Kellogg diagrams. Reed and Kellogg defend their system in the preface to their grammar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Objections to the Diagram.''--The fact that the pictorial diagram groups the parts of a sentence according to their offices and relations, and not in the order of speech, has been spoken of as a fault. It is, on the contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the literary order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the literary order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so long as the logical relations are kept clear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The assertion that correct diagrams can be made mechanically is not borne out by the facts. It is easier to avoid precision in oral analysis than in written. The diagram drives the pupil to a most searching examination of the sentence, brings him face to face with every difficulty, and compels a decision on every point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements bear witness to the fact that Reed–Kellogg diagrams abstract away from actual word order in order to focus more intently on how words in sentences function and relate to each other.

==Reed–Kellogg system==

Simple sentences in the Reed–Kellogg system are diagrammed according to these forms:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram1.jpg|Basic Reed–Kellogg schema]]
	 
The diagram of a simple sentence begins with a horizontal line called the ''base''. The [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is written on the left, the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] on the right, separated by a vertical bar which extends through the base. The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb either requires other sentence elements to complete the predicate, permits them to do so, or precludes them from doing so. The verb and its [[object (grammar)|object]], when present, are separated by a line that ends at the baseline. If the object is a [[direct object]], the line is vertical. If the object is a [[subject complement|predicate noun]] or [[predicate adjective|adjective]], the line looks like a [[backslash]], \, sloping toward the subject.

[[Grammatical modifier|Modifiers]] of the subject, predicate, or object are placed below the base line:

::[[File:Examples of Reed-Kellogg diagrams.jpg|Full Reed–Kellogg examples]]

Modifiers, such as [[adjective]]s (including articles) and [[adverb]]s, are placed on slanted lines below the word they modify. Prepositional phrases are also placed beneath the word they modify; the preposition goes on a slanted line and the slanted line leads to a horizontal line on which the object of the preposition is placed.

These basic diagramming conventions are augmented for other types of sentence structures, e.g. for [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[dependent clause|subordinate clauses]].

==Constituency and dependency==
The connections to modern principles for constructing parse trees are present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, although Reed and Kellogg understood such principles only implicitly. The principles are now regarded as the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s and the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s. These two relations are illustrated here adjacent to each other for comparison:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram3.jpg|Constituency and dependency]]

::(D = Determiner, N = Noun, NP = Noun Phrase, S = Sentence, V = Verb, VP = Verb Phrase)

[[Image:Xbarst1.svg|thumb|X-bar theory graph of the sentence ''He studies linguistics at the university.'' IP = Inflectional phrase.]]

Constituency is a one-to-one-or-more relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to one or more nodes in the tree diagram. Dependency, in contrast, is a one-to-one relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to exactly one node in the tree diagram. Both parse trees employ the convention where the category acronyms (e.g. N, NP, V, VP) are used as the labels on the nodes in the tree. The one-to-one-or-more constituency relation is capable of increasing the amount of sentence structure to the upper limits of what is possible. The result can be very "tall" trees, such as those associated with [[X-bar theory]]. Both constituency-based and dependency-based theories of grammar have established traditions.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957"&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. Syntactic structures. The Hague/Paris: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesniere 1959"&gt;Tesnière, L. 1959. Éleménts de syntaxe structurale. Paris: Klincksieck.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed–Kellogg diagrams employ both of these modern tree generating relations. The constituency relation is present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams insofar as subject, verb, object, and/or predicate are placed equi-level on the horizontal base line of the sentence and divided by a vertical or slanted line. In a Reed–Kellogg diagram, the vertical dividing line that crosses the base line corresponds to the binary division in the constituency-based tree (S → NP + VP), and the second vertical dividing line that does not cross the baseline (between verb and object) corresponds to the binary division of VP into verb and direct object (VP → V + NP). Thus the vertical and slanting lines that cross or rest on the baseline correspond to the constituency relation. The dependency relation, in contrast, is present insofar as modifiers dangle off of or appear below the words that they modify.

==Hybrid trees==
One can render Reed–Kellogg diagrams according to modern tree conventions. When one does so, the result is a hybrid dependency-constituency tree. The Reed–Kellogg diagrams above appear as the following trees:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram4.jpg|Hybrid trees]]

A mixing of labeling conventions (i.e. category label vs. actual word) helps draw attention to the presence of both constituency and dependency. The S and VP in these trees mark the constituency relation and the words themselves mark the dependency relation. A major difference between these hybrid trees and the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, however, is that the hybrid trees encode actual word order, whereas the Reed–Kellogg diagrams are abstracting away from actual word order in order to focus more on function.

==Functional breakdown==
A sentence may also be broken down by functional parts: subject, object, adverbial, verb (predicator).&lt;ref&gt;B. Arts and L. Haegerman, English Word Classes and Phrases in The Handbook of English Linguistics, Wiley– Blackewell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is the owner of an action, the verb represents the action, the object represents the recipient of the action, and the adverbial qualifies the action. The various parts can be phrases rather than individual words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5506">A '''sopranist''' (also, '''sopranista''' or '''male soprano''') is a male singer who is able to sing in the vocal [[tessitura]] of a [[soprano]] usually through the use of [[falsetto]] vocal production. This [[voice type]] is a specific kind of [[countertenor]].&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-1-56593-940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases an adult man may be able to sing in the soprano range using his normal or [[modal voice]] and not falsetto due to [[Endocrine system|endocrinological]] reasons, like [[Radu Marian]], or as a result of a [[larynx]] that has not completely developed as in the case of [[Michael Maniaci]].&lt;ref name="Times Online"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The man with the 300-year-old voice | date=12 October 2007|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice==
A sopranist is able to sing in the [[soprano]] [[vocal range]] which is approximately between [[middle C|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], though at times may expand somewhat higher or lower. Men of all [[voice type]]s can possess the wide-ranged and effective reinforced [[falsetto]] needed to produce the [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] [[vocal range]]s. Some countertenors can sing up into the female vocal tessituras using the modal register (normal singing production) and need not employ any falsetto. However, this extension does not reach into the upper part of soprano range going no further than an E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, sopranists must at some point employ falsetto to sing notes in the upper part of the soprano tessitura.&lt;ref name=Giles&gt;{{cite book
|title= The Countertenor
|last= Giles
|first= Peter
|authorlink=
|year= 1982
|publisher= Muller Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception would be those rare singers mentioned above.

==Controversy over the term male soprano==
Typically, the term "soprano" refers to female singers but at times the term "male soprano" has been used by men who sing in the soprano vocal range using falsetto vocal production instead of the modal voice. This practice is most commonly found in the context of [[choral music]] in England. However, these men are more commonly referred to as countertenors or sopranists. The practice of referring to countertenors as "male sopranos" is somewhat controversial within vocal pedagogical circles as these men do not produce sound in the same physiological way that female sopranos do.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt; [[Michael Maniaci]] and [[Radu Marian]] can refer to themselves as true male sopranos because they are able to sing in the soprano vocal range using the modal voice. Maniaci is able to do this because his larynx never fully developed as do most other men's voices during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece ''Times'' (London) article October 2007] {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertoire==
There is a large body of music for the male soprano that was written when it was common to use a [[castrato]] – a voice type which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists, as the practice of castrating [[boy soprano|trebles]] was abolished before the end of the 19th century. Sopranists are very rare, since most countertenors are altos and mezzos. In fact, probably because early famous countertenors were altos (like [[Alfred Deller]]), it was believed for a long time that countertenors can only be altos (and later, mezzo countertenors, like [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]] or [[Jochen Kowalski]] were recognized). While there is some modern repertoire written for countertenors (sometimes written specifically for certain singers, like [[Benjamin Britten|Britten's]] [[Death in Venice (opera)|''Death in Venice'']], which has a part that was written specifically for [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]]), at present there are only a small number of modern pieces written specifically for the sopranist vocal type. An exception is [[Alfred Schnittke]]'s 1995 opera ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (opera)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]'' which calls for both a female alto and a male soprano [[Mephistopheles]].

==Notable sopranists==
Present day notable sopranists include:
* [[Simone Bartolini]]
* [[Edson Cordeiro]] (classic, pop, jazz)
* [[Aris Christofellis]]
* [[Robert Crowe (singer)|Robert Crowe]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">In [[geometric topology]], the '''spherical space form conjecture''' states that a [[finite group]] acting on the [[3-sphere]] is conjugate to a [[group of isometries]] of the 3-sphere.

The conjecture is implied by [[William Thurston|Thurston]]'s [[geometrization conjecture]], which was proven by [[Grigori Perelman]] in 2003. The conjecture was independently proven for groups whose actions have [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]]—this special case is known as the [[Smith conjecture]]. It is also proven for various groups acting without fixed points, such as [[cyclic group]]s whose orders are a power of two (Livesay, Myers) and cyclic groups of order 3 (Rubinstein).

A '''telephony portal''' is a platform that aggregates many [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] [[IP telephony]] account providers through a unified service{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. It allows the user to choose one or many [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] [[VoIP]] operators or [[IP telephony]] operators to use into an SIP phone. Whoever the SIP telephony operator is the user can access to the portal services transparently from VoIP software, whether the service is [[IPTV]], dating services, [[Wi-Fi]] location-based content etc. Paid services, such as Wi-Fi access or paid TV, can be billed through the operator when the portal and the operator have interconnected their billing systems. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Telephony portals are usually composed of a web site that features IP telephony operators, and various services that can be accessed from an IP phone and a software that can be a widget that can be used on a PC, a Wi-Fi GSM handset or a Wi-Fi PDA. The software can be downloaded from the telephony portal web site; it is delivered with the features selected from the web site.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'USTAD DAMAN--THE PEOPLE'S POET By Dr. Afzal Mirza published May 10, 2006, Retrieved 2 July 2018
&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most celebrated Punjabi language poet at the time of the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947.
 
"Eh Duniya Mandi Paise Di, Har Cheej Vikendi Bhaa Sajjna,
Ethe Ronde Chehre Vikde Nahi, Hasne Di Aadat Paa Sajjna"...
A severe critic of military dictators who ruled over Pakistan for many decades, his most quoted lines censure the state of affairs in his country:

{{quote|text= Pakistan diyaan maujaan hee maujaan, chaarey passay faujaan hee faujan.|sign=(Pakistan is great fun and more joy, wherever you look there is military people and more military people.)}}

He goes on:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|pa-Latn|Jidhar vekho sigrat paan
zindabad mera Pakistan
Jidhar vekho kulchey naan
zindabad mera Pakistan!}}
|
Wherever you look, it's shops selling cigarettes and paan
Long live Pakistan!
Wherever you look, it's shops selling bread and 'naan'
Long live my Pakistan!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110903/saturday/above.htm Ustad Daman by KHUSHWANT SINGH], The Tribune (Chandigarh newspaper), Published 3 September 2011, Retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was introduced into politics by [[Iftikharuddin|Mian Iftikharuddin]], a known left-leaning politician, a member of [[Pakistan Movement]] and owner of '''Pakistan Times''' - a major newspaper in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. Ustad Daman was introduced originally as part of the struggle for independence from the British rule. A tailor by profession, in 1930, he stitched a suit for Iftikharuddin, who got impressed by his inspiring poetry verse, when the two met each other at his shop. He invited Ustad Daman to recite his poem at a public meeting organised by the [[Indian National Congress]], where Ustad Daman became an instant hit. [[Pandit Nehru]], who was present at that public meeting, dubbed him the ‘Poet of Freedom’ after listening to his revolutionary anti-imperialist poetry.&lt;ref name=interview1974&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QxLpGN0U80 Ustad Daman interviewed by writers Munnu Bhai and Karam Nawaz in 1974] Uploaded 11 Dec 2011, Retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of 1947 [[Partition of British India]], his shop and house were burned down by rioting mobs and his wife and young daughter were killed. However, Ustad Daman decided to stay in [[Lahore]] and the newly created country of [[Pakistan]]. He remained, throughout his life, a fierce opponent of dictatorship, civilian or military, and all corruption and hypocrisy. His work and poetry were published as 'Daman dey Moti' after his death by his devoted followers and admirers. The poems he wrote are still widely quoted in the Punjab as well as in other regions of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RPsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ustad+Daman&amp;dq=Ustad+Daman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9krHQisvRAhUU92MKHYmeDYAQ6AEIHDAA Profile and books of Ustad Daman on books.google.com website] Retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He first wrote under the pen name 'Humdam', which was later changed to 'Daman'. The title ‘Ustad’ (meaning teacher or expert) was bestowed on him by the local people. After that he became a regular participant in these political public meetings. He believed that the unity of [[Hindu]]s, [[Muslim]]s and [[Sikh]]s was essential, if the struggle for freedom from the British, was to be carried on successfully. An example of his poetry:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
In China, the Chinese are grand,
In Russia they do as they have planned
In Japan, its people rule over its strand
The British rule the land of England,
The French hold the land of France,
In Tehran, the Persians make their stand
The Afghans hold on to their highland,
Turkmenistan’s freedom bears the Turkmen’s brand,
How very strange is indeed this fact,
That freedom in India is a contraband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv11n2/damanintro.htm Ustad Daman The Poet Laureate of the Twentieth Century Punjab by fowpe sharma]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Super-hit film songs==
 
The following poems of '''Ustad Daman''' were used in [[Pakistani]] films:

* "Bach jaa mundia maurr taun, mein sadqey teri tore taun" Sung by [[Noor Jehan]], lyrics by '''Ustad Daman''' and music by '''Feroz Nizami''', film '''Chan Wey (1951)'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpaop.org/mpaop/artists/actresses/noor-jahan/noor-jahan-in-pakistan/ Ustad Daman's film song on mpaop.org website] Retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Changa banaya aee sahnun khidona" Sung by [[Noor Jehan]], lyrics by '''Ustad Daman''', music by '''Feroz Nizami''', film '''Chan Wey (1951)'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212051/ film Chan Wey (1951) on IMDb website] Retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Na mein sonay jai na Chandi jai mein pittal bhari paraat, meinun dharti qali kara de, mein nachhaan sari raat" Sung by [[Humaira Channa]], lyrics by '''Ustad Daman''', music by '''Kaalay Khan''', a [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]], [[Lahore]] production. Another later version of this song sung by Saira Nasim is also popular.

==Death and legacy==
Ustad Daman was last seen on the funeral of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] on November 20, 1984. He appeared terribly ill but he had managed to make it to [[Model Town, Lahore]] to attend the funeral in a rickshaw. Although the mourners were visibly shocked by Faiz's death but whoever saw Daman was also shaken by his condition. Those who had seen his wrestler-like figure in 'good old days', could not believe their eyes to see the skeleton-like Daman arriving at the gathering with the help of two people. Ustad Daman died two weeks later on 3 December 1984.&lt;ref name=peoplespoet/&gt; Veteran Pakistani film actor [[Allauddin (Pakistani actor)|Allauddin]] used to visit him frequently in his one-room-residence in Lahore near [[Anarkali Bazaar]]. He had a lot of respect for Ustad Daman and treated him like a father-figure. Ustad Daman used to call him 'my adopted son'.&lt;ref name=interview1974/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7298">'''Word error rate''' ('''WER''') is a common metric of the performance of a [[speech recognition]] or [[machine translation]] system.

The general difficulty of measuring performance lies in the fact that the recognized word sequence can have a different length from the reference word sequence (supposedly the correct one). The WER is derived from the [[Levenshtein distance]], working at the word level instead of the [[phoneme]] level. The WER is a valuable tool for comparing different systems as well as for evaluating improvements within one system. This kind of measurement, however, provides no details on the nature of translation errors and further work is therefore required to identify the main source(s) of error and to focus any research effort.

This problem is solved by first aligning the recognized word sequence with the reference (spoken) word sequence using dynamic string alignment. Examination of this issue is seen through a theory called the power law that states the correlation between perplexity and word error rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klakow|first=Dietrich|author2=Jochen Peters |title=Testing the correlation of word error rate and perplexity|journal=Speech Communication|date=September 2002|volume=38|issue=1-2|pages=19–28|doi=10.1016/S0167-6393(01)00041-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639301000413|accessdate=28 August 2013|issn=0167-6393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word error rate can then be computed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{WER} = \frac{S+D+I}{N} = \frac{S+D+I}{S+D+C} &lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''S'' is the number of substitutions,
* ''D'' is the number of deletions,
* ''I'' is the number of insertions,
* ''C'' is the number of correct words,
* ''N'' is the number of words in the reference (N=S+D+C)

The intuition behind 'deletion' and 'insertion' is how to get from the reference to the hypothesis. So if we have the reference "This is wikipedia" and hypothesis "This _ wikipedia", we call it a deletion.

When reporting the performance of a speech recognition system, sometimes ''word accuracy (WAcc)'' is used instead:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{WAcc} = 1 - \mathit{WER} = \frac{N-S-D-I}{N} = \frac{H-I}{N} &lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''H'' is N-(S+D), the number of correctly recognized words.
IF I=0 then WAcc will be equivalent to [[Recall (information retrieval)]] a ratio of correctly recognized words 'H' to Total number of words in reference 'N'.

Note that since ''N'' is the number of words in the reference, the word error rate can be larger than 1.0, and thus, the word accuracy can be smaller than 0.0.

==Experiments==

It is commonly believed that a lower word error rate shows superior accuracy in recognition of speech, compared with a higher word error rate. However, at least one study has shown that this may not be true. In a Microsoft Research experiment, it was shown that, if people were trained under "that matches the optimization objective for understanding", (Wang, Acero and Chelba, 2003) they would show a higher accuracy in understanding of language than other people who demonstrated a lower word error rate, showing that true understanding of spoken language relies on more than just high word recognition accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Acero | first2 = A. | last3 = Chelba | first3 = C. | date = 2003 | title = Is Word Error Rate a Good Indicator for Spoken Language Understanding Accuracy | citeseerx = 10.1.1.89.424 | conference = IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding | location = St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other metrics ==
One problem with using a generic formula such as the one above, however, is that no account is taken of the effect that different types of error may have on the likelihood of successful outcome, e.g. some errors may be more disruptive than others and some may be corrected more easily than others. These factors are likely to be specific to the [[syntax]] being tested. A further problem is that, even with the best alignment, the formula cannot distinguish a substitution error from a combined deletion plus insertion error.

Hunt (1990) has proposed the use of a weighted measure of performance accuracy where errors of substitution are weighted at unity but errors of deletion and insertion are both weighted only at 0.5, thus:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{WER} = \frac{S+0.5D+0.5I}{N} &lt;/math&gt;

There is some debate, however, as to whether Hunt’s formula may properly be used to assess the performance of a single system, as it was developed as a means of comparing more fairly competing candidate systems. A further complication is added by whether a given syntax allows for error correction and, if it does, how easy that process is for the user. There is thus some merit to the argument that performance metrics should be developed to suit the particular system being measured.

Whichever metric is used, however, one major theoretical problem in assessing the performance of a system is deciding whether a word has been “mis-pronounced,” i.e. does the fault lie with the user or with the recogniser. This may be particularly relevant in a system which is designed to cope with non-native speakers of a given language or with strong regional accents.

The pace at which words should be spoken during the measurement process is also a source of variability between subjects, as is the need for subjects to rest or take a breath. All such factors may need to be controlled in some way.

For text dictation it is generally agreed that performance accuracy at a rate below 95% is not acceptable, but this again may be syntax and/or domain specific, e.g. whether there is time pressure on users to complete the task, whether there are alternative methods of completion, and so on.

The term "Single Word Error Rate" is sometimes referred to as the percentage of incorrect recognitions for each different word in the system vocabulary.

==Edit distance==
The word error rate may also be referred to as the length normalized [[edit distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Nießen et al.(2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The normalized edit distance between X and Y, ''d''( X, Y ) is defined as the minimum of W( P ) / L ( P ), where P is an editing path between X and Y, W ( P ) is the sum of the weights of the elementary edit operations of P, and L(P) is the number of these operations (length of P).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b93076/Computation%20of%20Normalized%20Edit%20Distance%20and%20Applications.pdf Computation of Normalized Edit Distance and Application:AndrCs Marzal and Enrique Vidal ]&lt;/ref&gt;
