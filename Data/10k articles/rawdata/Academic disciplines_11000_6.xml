'''Active defense''' can refer to a defensive [[strategy]] in the [[military]] or [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] arena.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] defines active defense as:  "The employment of limited offensive action and [[counterattack]]s to deny a contested area or position to the [[enemy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=37|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: active defense|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition does not specify whether it refers to physical actions, or cyber-related actions.

In the cybersecurity arena, active defense may mean "[[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] defenses," namely defenses that increase costs to cyber-adversaries by reducing costs to cyber-defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.cryptomove.com/what-does-active-defense-mean-4ecff93c4bc4|title=What does ‘Active Defense’ mean?|last=Burshteyn|first=Mike|date=2016-12-22|newspaper=CryptoMove|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an active defense [[data protection]] strategy invented by CryptoMove&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cryptomove.com|title=CryptoMove {{!}} Active Defense Data Protection|last=|first=|date=|website=CryptoMove|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; leverages dynamic data movement, distribution, and [[encryption|re-encryption]] to make data harder to attack, steal, or destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cryptomove.com CryptoMove] invented such technology that protects data by constantly moving, distributing, mutating, and re-encrypting it.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior data protection approaches relied on [[encryption]] of data at rest, which leaves data vulnerable to attacks including [[ciphertext stealing|stealing of ciphertext]], [[cryptographic attack]], attacks on [[encryption keys]], destruction of encrypted data, [[ransomware]] attacks, insider attacks, and others. Three ACM computing conferences have explored Moving Target Defense as a strategy for network and application-level security as well, for instance by [[Rotation|rotating]] IP addresses or dynamically changing network [[topologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtd.mobicloud.asu.edu/|title=Second ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD 2015)|website=mtd.mobicloud.asu.edu|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production implementations of MTD are provided by companies such as Dispel for applications including legacy systems, communications, and election security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.securityweek.com/dispel-launches-election-security-platform|title=Dispel Launches Election Security Platform|website=securityweek.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have defined active defenses as including of [[deception]] or [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]], which seek to confuse attackers with traps and advanced forensics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/implementing-active-defense-systems-private-networks-34312|title=Implementing Active Defense Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=SANS White Paper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such honeypot technologies include Illusive Networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illusivenetworks.com/|title=illusive networks: The Leader In Deception Technology|website=www.illusivenetworks.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; TrapX,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trapx.com/|website=trapx.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cymmetria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cymmetria.com/|title=Home - Cymmetria|website=Cymmetria {{!}} Cyber deception|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attivo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://attivonetworks.com/|title=Deception-Based Threat Detection - Attivo Networks|website=Attivo Networks|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Other types of active defenses might include automated incident response, which attempts to tie together different response strategies in order to increase work for attackers and decrease work for defenders.&lt;ref&gt;SANS WhitePaper on Incident Response and Active Defense, https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/implementing-active-defense-systems-private-networks-34312&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and financial [[institution]]s have identified Active Defense as a top priority for security [[Infrastructure|industrial infrastructure]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=bbef769b0349f41d40d472d58b445306&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|title=Financial Services Cyber Security Active Defense (FSCSAD) - Federal Business Opportunities: Opportunities|website=www.fbo.gov|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a broader push for greater resiliency, the [[NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] 800-160 Volume 2 framework has gone further, providing guidance on standardization for active defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-160/vol-2/draft/documents/sp800-160-vol2-draft.pdf|title=Systems Security Engineering: Cyber Resiliency Considerations for the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems|website=www.nist.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Сreativ (painting)==
Aydar Akhatov paints pictures in different styles and genres ([[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Renaissance]], [[surrealism]], [[modernism]], [[expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[pop art]], etc.), using various techniques (oil painting, tempera, pastel, acrylic, drawing, watercolor, etc.).

In the early 21st century, Aydar Akhatov invented a new style of painting, which he called "art-sensualism" (from Lat. Sensus – perception, feeling, sensation), the meaning of which is that the result depends only on the creativity of impressions, feelings of the artist, and not by a so-called objective reality. Any particular item of reality any artist can paint their own way and this will be his only true reality at the time of the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlikor.com/page69.html Art-sensualism / Pushkin Gallery of Art Likor] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://akhatov-a.ru/index/aktualnoe_intervju/0-45 Interview with А.

The creator of the new language of painting Aydar Ahatov reveals in his paintings elusive, fleeting harmony of man and the environment.

Aydar Akhatov wrote more than 350 paintings, which are not only involved in exhibitions, but also purchased by private collectors and museums around the world (US, [[Switzerland]], Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://art-new.ru/ Maestro Aydar Akhatov.] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''basic rest–activity cycle''' (BRAC) is a physiological arousal mechanism in humans proposed by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]],&lt;ref&gt;Kleitman, N., ''Sleep and Wakefulness'', 1963, Reprint 1987: {{ISBN|9780226440736}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized to occur during both [[sleep]] and [[wakefulness]]. 

Empirically, it is an [[ultradian rhythm]] of approximately 90 minutes (80–120 minutes&lt;ref&gt;Kleitman, N., ''Basic rest-activity cycle—22 years later'', Journal of Sleep Research &amp; Sleep Medicine, Vol 5(4), Dec 1982, 311–317&lt;/ref&gt;) that is characterized by different level of excitement and rest. The cycle is mediated by the human [[circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. It is most readily observed in stages of sleep, for example, [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM) and the delta activity cycle.

When awake, our brainwaves are faster during the first half of the cycle, when we feel alert and focused, and then our brainwaves slow; in the last 20 minutes when we feel dreamy and perhaps a little tired, while our body is being readied for the alert part of the following cycle. 

When asleep, our brainwaves first slow and then rise, and the BRAC occurs as stages of sleep—first falling into deep sleep, then rising into the REM stage, when dreams occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/science/brac/ "Basic Rest and Activity Cycles," Polyphasic Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biochemistry''', sometimes called '''biological chemistry''', is the study of [[chemical process]]es within and relating to living [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/areas-of-chemistry/biological-biochemistry.html.html |title=Biochemistry|work=acs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of [[life]]. 

A sub-discipline of both [[biology]] and [[chemistry]], biochemistry can be divided in three fields; [[molecular genetics]], [[Protein|protein science]] and [[metabolism]]. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes. Almost all [[List of life sciences|areas of the life sciences]] are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research.&lt;ref name="Voet_2005"&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemistry focuses on understanding how [[biomolecule|biological molecules]] give rise to the processes that occur within living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and between cells,&lt;ref name="Karp2009"&gt;[[#Karp|Karp]] (2009), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], and organism structure and function.&lt;ref name="MillerSpoolman2012"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]] (2012). p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemistry is closely related to [[molecular biology]], the study of the [[molecule|molecular]] mechanisms by which [[Genetics|genetic]] information [[Genetic code|encoded]] in [[DNA]] is able to result in the processes of life.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;[[#Astbury|Astbury]] (1961), p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life.&lt;ref name="Biology"&gt;[[#Eldra|Eldra]] (2007), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s. These can be [[inorganic]], for example [[water]] and [[metal]] ions, or [[Organic compound|organic]], for example the [[amino acid]]s, which are used to [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesize proteins]].&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;[[#Marks|Marks]] (2012), Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as [[metabolism]]. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in [[medicine]], [[nutrition]], and [[agriculture]]. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and [[Pharmaceutical drug|cures]] of [[disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkel|Finkel]] (2009), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In nutrition, they study how to maintain health wellness and study the effects of [[nutritional deficiencies]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010&gt;[[#UNICEF|UNICEF]] (2010), pp. 61, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In agriculture, biochemists investigate [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]]s, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage and [[pest control]].

== History==
{{Main article| History of biochemistry}}
[[File:Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori (1896-1957) and Carl Ferdinand Cori.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Cori]] jointly won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1947 for their discovery of  the [[Cori cycle]] at RPMI.]]

At its broadest definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the components and composition of living things and how they come together to become life, in this sense the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref name="history of science"&gt;[[#Helvoort|Helvoort]] (2000), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, biochemistry as a specific [[scientific discipline]] has its beginning sometime in the [[19th century]], or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first [[enzyme]], [[diastase]] (today called [[amylase]]), in 1833 by [[Anselme Payen]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; while others considered [[Eduard Buchner]]'s first demonstration of a complex biochemical process [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hamblin|Hamblin]] (2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by [[Justus von Liebig]], ''Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology'', which presented a chemical theory of metabolism,&lt;ref name="history of science" /&gt; or even earlier to the 18th century studies on [[fermentation]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] by [[Antoine Lavoisier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berg|Berg]] (1980), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holmes|Holmes]] (1987), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] for his work on the chemistry of proteins,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]] (2001), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|F. Gowland Hopkins]] on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rayner|Rayner-Canham]] (2005), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "biochemistry" itself  is derived from a combination of [[biology]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1877, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]] used the term (''biochemie'' in German) as a synonym for [[physiological chemistry]] in the foreword to the first issue of ''[[Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie]]'' (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ziesak|Ziesak]] (1999), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[chemist]] [[Carl Neuberg]] however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903,&lt;ref name="Ben-Menahem 2009"&gt;[[#Ben|Ben-Menahem]] (2009), p. 2982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amsler|Amsler]] (1986), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Horton|Horton]] (2013), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while some credited it to [[Franz Hofmeister]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA orbit animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|DNA structure ({{PDB2|1D65}})&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]] (1992), pp. 1161–1173.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the "[[vital principle]]") distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fiske|Fiske]] (1890), pp. 419–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] published a paper on [[Wöhler synthesis|the synthesis]] of [[urea]], proving that [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds can be created artificially.&lt;ref name="Kauffman 2001"&gt;[[#Kauffman|Kauffman]] (2001), pp. 121–133.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as [[chromatography]], [[X-ray diffraction]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]], [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], [[radioisotopic labeling]], [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], and [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and [[metabolic pathway]]s of the [[cell (biology)|cell]], such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding of biochemistry on a molecular level.[[philip Randle]] is well-known for his discovery in diabetes research is possibly the glucose-fatty acid cycle in 1963.He confirmed that fatty acids reduce oxidation of sugar by the muscle. High fat oxidation was responsible for the insulin resistance.&lt;ref name= "Ashcroft, Steve, 2006"&gt;[[#Ashcroft|Ashcroft]](2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the [[gene]], and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Rosalind Franklin]], and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]] received the [[Nobel Prize]] for work in fungi showing that [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis|one gene produces one enzyme]].&lt;ref name="Krebs 2012"&gt;[[#Krebs|Krebs]] (2012), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Colin Pitchfork]] was the first person convicted of murder with [[DNA]] evidence, which led to the growth of [[forensic science]].&lt;ref name="Butler 2009"&gt;[[#Butler|Butler]] (2009), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Andrew Z. Fire]] and [[Craig C. Mello]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|2006 Nobel Prize]] for discovering the role of [[RNA interference]] ([[RNAi]]), in the silencing of [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name="Sen 2007"&gt;[[#Chandan|Chandan]] (2007), pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starting materials: the chemical elements of life ==
[[Image:201 Elements of the Human Body.02.svg|thumb|upright|The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by mass) to least abundant.]]
{{main article|Composition of the human body|Dietary mineral}}

Around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring [[chemical elements]] are essential to various kinds of [[life|biological life]]. Most [[Rare earth element|rare elements on Earth]] are not needed by life (exceptions being  [[selenium]] and [[iodine]]), while a few common ones ([[aluminum]] and [[titanium]]) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between [[plants]] and [[animals]]. For example, ocean algae use [[bromine]], but land plants and animals seem to need none. All animals require [[sodium]], but some plants do not. Plants need [[boron]] and [[silicon]], but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).

Just six elements&amp;mdash;[[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]&amp;mdash;make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see [[composition of the human body]] for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nielsen|Nielsen]] (1999), pp. 283–303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomolecules==
{{main|Biomolecule}}
The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called [[biomolecule]]s) are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=slabaugh&gt;[[#Slabaugh|Slabaugh]] (2007), pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many biological molecules are [[polymer]]s: in this terminology, [[monomer]]s are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large [[macromolecule]]s known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a [[Biopolymer|biological polymer]], they undergo a process called [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for [[biological activity]].

Two of the main functions of carbohydrates are energy storage and providing structure. [[Sugar]]s are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and [[genetic information]], as well as play important roles in cell to [[Cell–cell interaction|cell interactions]] and [[Cell signaling|communications]].

The simplest type of carbohydrate is a [[monosaccharide]], which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is at least 3). [[Glucose]]  (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include [[fructose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the sugar commonly associated with the [[sweet taste]] of [[fruit]]s,&lt;ref name=Whiting1970&gt;[[#Whiting|Whiting]] (1970), pp. 1–31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[deoxyribose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  A monosaccharide can switch between [[Open-chain compound|acyclic (open-chain) form]] and a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] form.  The open-chain form can be turned into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an [[oxygen]] atom created from the [[carbonyl group]] of one end and the [[hydroxyl]] group of another. The cyclic molecule has an [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]] group, depending on whether the linear form was an [[aldose]] or a [[ketose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Existence in solution.png|center|thumb|500px|Conversion between the [[furanose]], [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]], and [[pyranose]] forms of D-glucose]]

In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has '''5''' or '''6''' atoms.  These forms are called [[furanose]]s and [[pyranose]]s, respectively&amp;nbsp;— by analogy with [[furan]] and [[pyran]], the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the [[double bond]]s of these two molecules).  For example, the aldohexose [[glucose]] may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called [[glucofuranose]].  The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called [[glucopyranose]]. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring called [[heptoses]] are rare.

Two monosaccharides can be joined together by a [[Glycosidic bond|glycosidic]] or [[ether bond]] into a ''[[disaccharide]]'' through a [[dehydration reaction]] during which a molecule of water is released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed ''[[hydrolysis]]''.  The best-known disaccharide is [[sucrose]] or ordinary [[sugar]], which consists of a [[glucose]] molecule and a [[fructose]] molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is [[lactose]] found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a [[galactose]] molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by [[lactase]], and deficiency in this enzyme results in [[lactose intolerance]].

When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an ''[[oligosaccharide]]'' (''oligo-'' meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and [[Cell signaling|signals]], as well as having some other uses.&lt;ref name=Varki_1999&gt;[[#Varki|Varki]] (1999), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Many monosaccharides joined together make a [[polysaccharide]]. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branched]]. Two of the most common polysaccharides are [[cellulose]] and [[glycogen]], both consisting of repeating glucose [[monomer]]s.  Examples are ''cellulose'' which is an important structural component of plant's [[cell wall]]s, and ''[[glycogen]]'', used as a form of energy storage in animals.

[[Sugar]] can be characterized by having [[Reducing sugar|reducing]] or non-reducing ends. A [[reducing end]] of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain [[aldehyde]] ([[aldose]]) or keto form ([[ketose]]). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the [[pyranose]] or [[furanose]] form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full [[acetal]]. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. [[Saccharose]] does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

At the top are [[cholesterol]] and [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stryer|Stryer]] (2007), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle structure is a [[triglyceride]] composed of [[oleate|oleoyl]], [[stearate|stearoyl]], and [[palmitate|palmitoyl]] chains attached to a [[glycerol]] backbone. At the bottom is the common [[phospholipid]], [[phosphatidylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 12 Lipids and Membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''[[Lipid]]s''' comprises a diverse range of [[molecules]] and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or [[nonpolar]] compounds of biological origin, including [[wax]]es, [[fatty acid]]s, fatty-acid derived [[phospholipid]]s, [[sphingolipid]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, and [[terpenoid]]s (e.g., [[retinoid]]s and [[steroid]]s). Some lipids are linear [[aliphatic]] molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are [[aromatic]], while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipids are usually made from one molecule of [[glycerol]] combined with other molecules.  In [[triglyceride]]s, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three [[fatty acid]]s. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] (no [[double bond]]s in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 382–385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lipids have some [[polar molecule|polar]] character in addition to being largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or [[hydrophobic]] ("water-fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or [[hydrophilic]] ("water-loving") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them [[amphiphilic]] molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of [[cholesterol]], the polar group is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 385–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most [[oil]]s and [[milk product]]s that we use for cooking and eating like [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[ghee]] etc., are composed of [[fat]]s. [[Vegetable oil]]s are rich in various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.  Lipids, especially [[phospholipid]]s, are also used in various [[pharmaceutical product]]s, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] infusions) or else as [[drug carrier]] components (e.g., in a [[liposome]] or [[transfersome]]).

===Proteins===
{{Main article|Protein|Amino acid}}

[[File:AminoAcidball.svg|thumbnail|160px|The general structure of an α-amino acid, with the [[amine|amino]] group on the left and the [[carboxyl]] group on the right.]]

[[Protein]]s are very large molecules – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called [[amino acid]]s. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom attached to an [[amino]] group, &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[carboxylic acid]] group, &amp;mdash;COOH (although these exist as &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;mdash;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom, and a side chain commonly denoted as "&amp;mdash;R". The side chain  "R" is different for each amino acid of which there are 20 [[proteinogenic amino acid|standard ones]].  It is this "R" group that made each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains greatly influence the overall [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional conformation]] of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, [[glutamate]] functions as an important [[neurotransmitter]]. Amino acids can be joined via a [[peptide bond]]. In this [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a ''[[dipeptide]]'', and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called ''peptides'' or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title ''proteins''. As an example, the important blood [[blood plasma|serum]] protein [[human serum albumin|albumin]] contains 585 amino acid residues.&lt;ref name="Metzler 2001"&gt;[[#Metzler|Metzler]] (2001), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amino acids 1.png|thumb|left|390px|Generic amino acids (1) in neutral form, (2) as they exist physiologically, and (3) joined together as a dipeptide.]]

[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|160px|A schematic of [[hemoglobin]]. The red and blue ribbons represent the protein [[globin]]; the green structures are the [[heme]] groups.]]
Proteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements of the proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules&amp;mdash;they may be ''extremely'' selective in what they bind. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation based on differences in the N-terminal domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2009.11.005 |pmid=20022755 |pmc=4716677 |title=How antibodies fold |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=189–198 |year=2010 |last1=Feige |first1=Matthias J. |last2=Hendershot |first2=Linda M. |last3=Buchner |first3=Johannes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the [[enzyme]]s. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called ''[[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s''; they then [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the reaction between them. By lowering the [[activation energy]], the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The [[primary structure]] of a protein consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…". [[Secondary structure]] is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an [[alpha helix|α-helix]] or into a sheet called a [[Beta sheet|β-sheet]]; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. [[Tertiary structure]] is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the [[glutamate]] residue at position 6 with a [[valine]] residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in [[sickle-cell disease]]. Finally, [[quaternary structure]] is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the [[small intestine]], and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]]. These are the [[essential amino acid]]s, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize [[alanine]], [[asparagine]], [[aspartate]], [[cysteine]], [[glutamate]], [[glutamine]], [[glycine]], [[proline]], [[serine]], and [[tyrosine]], the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize [[arginine]] and [[histidine]], they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.

If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-[[keto acid]]. Enzymes called [[transaminase]]s can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via [[transamination]]. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 279–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), existing as the [[ammonium]] ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. [[Unicellular]] organisms simply release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, [[osteichthyes|bony fish]] can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the [[urea cycle]].&lt;ref name="Sherwood 2012"&gt;[[#Sherwood|Sherwood]] (2012), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like [[sequence alignment]]s and [[structural alignment]]s are powerful tools that help scientists identify [[Sequence homology|homologies]] between related molecules.&lt;ref name="Fariselli 2007"&gt;[[#Fariselli|Fariselli]] (2007), pp. 78–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of [[Protein family|protein families]]. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.

===Nucleic acids===
{{Main article|Nucleic acid|DNA|RNA|Nucleotide}}
[[File:0322 DNA Nucleotides.jpg|thumbnail|350px|The structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA), the picture shows the monomers being put together.]]

[[Nucleic acids]], so called because of their prevalence in cellular [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey [[genetic information]] in all living cells and viruses.&lt;ref name="Voet_2005"/&gt; The monomers are called [[nucleotide]]s, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic [[base (chemistry)|base]] (either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]]), a pentose sugar, and a [[phosphate]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Saenger|Saenger]] (1984), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nucleotides 1.svg|thumb|center|500px|Structural elements of common nucleic acid constituents. Because they contain at least one phosphate group, the compounds marked ''nucleoside monophosphate'', ''nucleoside diphosphate'' and ''nucleoside triphosphate'' are all nucleotides (not simply phosphate-lacking [[nucleoside]]s).]]

The most common nucleic acids are [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phosphate group]] and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]].  The [[nitrogenous base]]s of each strand of a nucleic acid will form [[hydrogen bonds]] with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.

Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as [[second messenger]]s, as well as forming the base molecule for [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knowles|Knowles]] (1980), pp. 877–919.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.

==Metabolism==

===Carbohydrates as energy source===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Glucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers ([[glycogen phosphorylase]] removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.

====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====
{{Glycolysis summary}}
Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]] called [[glycolysis]], the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of [[pyruvate]]. This also produces a net two molecules of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate (lactic acid)]] (e.g., in humans) or to [[ethanol]] plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in [[yeast]]). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 163–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerobic====
In [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to [[acetyl-CoA]], giving off one carbon atom as the waste product [[carbon dioxide]], generating another reducing equivalent as [[NADH]]. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the [[citric acid cycle]], producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an [[electron transport system]] transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane ([[inner mitochondrial membrane]] in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[quinone]] are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional ''28'' molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 17 Glycolysis.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

====Gluconeogenesis====
{{Main article|Gluconeogenesis}}
In [[vertebrate]]s, vigorously contracting [[skeletal muscle]]s (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], converting glucose to lactate. The [[liver]] regenerates the glucose, using a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or [[starch]] in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the [[Cori cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 183–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other "molecular-scale" biological sciences==
[[File:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic relationship between biochemistry, [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]].]]

Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biophysics]]. There has never been a hard-line among these disciplines in terms of content and technique. Today, the terms ''molecular biology'' and ''biochemistry'' are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:

* ''Biochemistry'' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecule]]s. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.
* ''Genetics'' is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g., one [[gene]]), in the study of "[[mutant]]s" &amp;ndash; organisms with a changed gene that leads to the organism being different with respect to the so-called "[[wild type]]" or normal [[phenotype]]. [[Genetic interactions]] ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such "knock-out" or "knock-in" studies.
* ''Molecular biology'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the [[genetic material]]. The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="Ulveling 2011"&gt;[[#Ulveling|Ulveling]] (2011), pp. 633–644.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Chemical biology]]'' seeks to develop new tools based on [[small molecule]]s that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied [[viral capsid]]s that can deliver [[gene therapy]] or [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug molecules]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rojas|Rojas-Ruiz]] (2011), pp. 2672–2687.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits. Glucose and sucrose are also found in varying quantities in various fruits, and indeed sometimes exceed the fructose present. For example, 32% of the edible portion of date is glucose, compared with 23.70% fructose and 8.20% sucrose. However, peaches contain more sucrose (6.66%) than they do fructose (0.93%) or glucose (1.47%).&lt;ref name=Whiting1970p5&gt;[[#Whiting|Whiting]], G.C. (1970), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boundary problem''' in analysis is a phenomenon in which geographical patterns are differentiated by the shape and arrangement of boundaries that are drawn for administrative or measurement purposes.  This is distinct from and must not be confused with the boundary problem in the philosophy of science that is also called the '''[[demarcation problem]]'''.

== Definition ==
In '''[[spatial analysis]]''', four major problems interfere with an accurate estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale problem, pattern problem (or [[spatial autocorrelation]]), and [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (Barber 1988). The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbours in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbours. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with area data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.

In geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbours do not exist (Henley 1981), or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration) (Haining 1990). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area.

If a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbours outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem (Upton and Fingleton 1985).

That is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries per se can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena (BESR 2002). It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process (Cressie 1992; Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993; Griffith 1983; Martin 1987). The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded (Leung 1987) but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes (Miller 1999). Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary (Martin 1989).

The boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.

&lt;sup&gt;Notes: Land cover datasets were obtained from USGS and population density from FGDL.&lt;/sup&gt;

== Types and examples ==

By drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). The first is an '''edge effect'''. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighbouring municipality (McGuire 1995).

The second is a '''shape effect''' that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.

In spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary (Rogerson 2006). For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured (BESR 2002).

In the strict sense of the term, meaning a stem, "caudex" is most often used with plants that have a different stem [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] from the typical [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[dicotyledon]] stem:&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; examples of this include [[Arecaceae|palms]], [[fern]]s, and [[cycad]]s.

The related term '''caudiciform''', literally meaning stem-like, is sometimes used to mean [[pachycaul]], thick-stemmed.&lt;ref name=Simpson/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''caudex'', a noun meaning "tree trunk".&lt;ref name=Stearn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/caudex |title=caudex - definition of caudex by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12061">The '''chiral Potts model''' is a spin model on a planar lattice in [[statistical mechanics]]. As with the [[Potts model]], each spin can take n=0,...N-1 values. To each pair of nearest neighbor of spins n and n', a Boltzmann weight W(n-n') ([[Boltzmann factor]]) is assigned. The model is [[Chirality|chiral]], meaning W(n-n')≠ W(n'-n).  When its weights satisfy the [[Yang-Baxter equation]], (or the [[star-triangle relation]]), it is integrable. For the integrable chiral Potts model, its weights are parametrized by a high [[Genus (mathematics)|genus curve]], the [[Chiral Potts curve|chiral Potts curve]].&lt;ref name=AMPTY&gt;Au-Yang H, McCoy B M, Perk J H H, Tang S and Yan M-L (1987), "Commuting transfer matrices in the chiral Potts models: Solutions of the star-triangle equations with genus &gt; 1", [[Physics Letters A]] '''123''' 219–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BPA&gt;Baxter R J, Perk J H H and Au-Yang H (1988), "New solutions of the star-triangle relations for the chiral Potts model", [[Physics Letters A]] '''128''' 138–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the other solvable models,&lt;ref name=Baxterbk&gt;[[R. J. Baxter]],"Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics", [[Academic Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-12-083180-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCoybk&gt;B.M.McCoy,"Advanced Statistical Mechanics", '''146''' International Series of Monographs on Physics, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|9780199556632}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose weights are parametrized by curves of genus less or equal to one, so that they can be expressed in term of trigonometric, or rational function (genus=0) or by [[theta functions]] (genus=1), this model involves high genus theta functions, which are not yet well developed. Therefore, it was thought that no progress could be made for such a difficult problem. Yet, many breakthroughs have been made since the 1990s. It must be stressed again that the chiral Potts model was not invented because it was integrable but the integrable case was found, after it was introduced to explain experimental data. In a very profound way physics is here far ahead of mathematics. The history and its development will be presented here briefly.

Note that the ''chiral clock model'', which has been introduced in the 80s of the last century, independently, by David Huse and Stellan Ostlund, is not exactly solvable, in contrast to the chiral Potts model.

== The model ==
This model is out of the class of all previously known models and raises a host of unsolved questions which are related to some of the most intractable problems of [[algebraic geometry]] which have been with us for 150 years. The chiral Potts models are used to understand the commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions.&lt;ref name=HKN83&gt;S. Howes, L.P. Kadanoff and M. den Nijs (1983), [[Nuclear Physics]] B '''215''', 169.&lt;/ref&gt; For N = 3 and 4, the integrable case was discovered in 1986 in Stony Brook and published the following year.&lt;ref name=AMPTY/&gt;&lt;ref name=MPTS87&gt;McCoy B M, Perk J H H, Tang S and Sah C H (1987),
"Commuting transfer matrices for the 4 state self-dual chiral Potts model with a genus 3 uniformizing Fermat curve", [[Physics Letters A]] '''125''', 9–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-dual case ===
The model is called [[self-dual]], if the Fourier transform of the weight is equal to the weight. A special (genus 1) case had been solved in 1982 by Fateev and Zamolodchikov.&lt;ref name=FZ82&gt;V.A. Fateev and A.B. Zamolodchikov, (1982) [[Physics Letters]] A '''92'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
By removing certain restrictions of the work of Alcaraz and Santos,&lt;ref name=Alcaraz&gt;E.C. Alcaraz and A. Lima Santos, [[Nuclear Physics]] B 275.&lt;/ref&gt; a more general self-dual case of the integrable chiral Potts model was discovered.&lt;ref name=AMPTY/&gt; The weight are given in product form&lt;ref name=AMPS88&gt;H. Au-Yang, B.M. McCoy, J.H.H. Perk, and S. Tang (1988), "Solvable models in statistical mechanics and Riemann surfaces of genus greater than one, in Algebraic Analysis", Vol. 1, M. Kashiwara and T. Kawai, eds., [[Academic Press]], pp. 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perk87&gt;J.H.H. Perk (1987), "Star-triangle equations, quantum Lax pairs, and higher genus curves", in Proc. 1987 Summer Research Institute on Theta Functions, Proc. Symp. Pure Math., Vol. 49, part 1 (Am. Math. Soc., Providence, R.I., 1989), pp. 341–354.&lt;/ref&gt; and the parameters in the weight are shown to be on the [[Fermat curve]], with genus greater than 1.

=== General case ===
In Canberra, the general solution for all ''k'' (the temperature variable) was found.&lt;ref name=BPA/&gt; The weights were also given in product form and it was tested by Fortran that they satisfy the [[star-triangle relation]]. The proof was published later.&lt;ref name=AP89Tani&gt;Au-Yang H and Perk J H H (1989). "Onsager's star-triangle equation: Master key to integrability", Proc. Taniguchi Symposium, Kyoto, October 1988, Advanced Studies in Pure Mathematics vol 19 (Tokyo: Kinokuniya–Academic) pp 57–94&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
=== Order parameter ===
From the series&lt;ref name=HKN83/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Henkel and J. Lack, preprint Bonn-He- 85-22&lt;/ref&gt; the order parameter is conjectured&lt;ref name=AMPT89&gt;Albertini G., McCoy B.M., Perk J.H.H. and Tang S. (1989), "Excitation spectrum and order parameter for the integrable ''N''-state chiral Potts model", [[Nuclear Physics]] B '''314''', 741–763&lt;/ref&gt; to have the simple form
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma^n\rangle=(1-k'^2)^\beta,\quad \beta=n(N-n)/2N^2.&lt;/math&gt;
It took many years to prove this conjecture, as the usual corner transfer matrix technique could not be used, because of the higher genus curve. This conjecture was finally proven by Baxter in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2005), "Derivation of the order parameter of the chiral Potts model", [[Physical Review Letters]], '''94''' 130602 (3 pp) [[arXiv:cond-mat/0501227]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2005), "The order parameter of the chiral Potts model", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''120''', 1–36: [[arXiv:cond-mat/0501226]].&lt;/ref&gt; using functional equations and the "broken rapidity line" technique of Jimbo ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Jimbo M, Miwa T and Nakayashiki A (1993), "Difference equations for the correlation functions of the eight-vertex model", [[Journal of Physics A]]: Math. Gen. '''26''', 2199–210: [[arXiv:hep-th/9211066]].&lt;/ref&gt; assuming two rather mild analyticity
conditions of the type commonly used in the field of Yang—Baxter integrable models. Most recently, in a series of papers&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2008) "Algebraic reduction of the Ising model", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''132''', 959–82, [[arXiv:0803.4036]];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2008), "A conjecture for the superintegrable chiral Potts model",
[[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''132''', 983–1000, [[arXiv:0803.4037]];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2009), "Some remarks on a generalization of the superintegrable chiral Potts model", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''137''', 798–813, [[arXiv:0906.3551]];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2010), "Spontaneous magnetization of the superintegrable chiral Potts model: calculation of the determinant ''D&lt;sub&gt;PQ&lt;/sub&gt;''", [[Journal of Physics A]] '''43''', 145002 (16pp) [[arXiv:0912.4549]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (2010), "Proof of the determinantal form of the spontaneous magnetization of the superintegrable chiral Potts model", Australian &amp; New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics Journal, '''51'''
[[arXiv:1001.0281]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iorgov N, Pakuliak S, Shadura V, Tykhyy Yu and von Gehlen G (2009), "Spin operator matrix elements in the superintegrable chiral Potts quantum chain", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''139''', 743–68 [[arXiv:0912.5027]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Au-Yang H and Perk J H H (2011), "Spontaneous magnetization of the integrable chiral Potts model", [[Journal of Physics A]] '''44''', 445005 (20pp), [[arXiv:1003.4805]].&lt;/ref&gt;
an algebraic ([[Ising model|Ising-like]]) way of obtaining order parameter has been given, giving more insight into the algebraic structure.

=== Connection to 6-[[vertex model]] ===
In 1990 Bazhanov and Stroganov&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Bazhanov and Yu.G. Stroganov (1990), "Chiral Potts model as a descendant of the six-vertex model", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''59''', pp 799–817.&lt;/ref&gt; show that there exist an 2 × N '''''L'''''-operators, which satisfy the [[Yang-Baxter equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; L_{i_1\alpha}^{j_1\beta}(x)L_{i_2\beta}^{j_2\gamma} (y)R_{j_1j_2}^{k_1k_2}(y/x)= R_{i_1i_2}^{j_1j_2} (y/x)L_{j_2\alpha}^{k_2\beta} (y)L_{j_1\beta}^{k_1\gamma}(x),\quad 0&lt;i,j,k\le1,\quad 0\le \alpha, \beta,\gamma\le N-1.&lt;/math&gt;
where 2 × 2 '''''R'''''-operator is the 6-vertex  '''''R'''''-matrix (see [[Vertex model]]). 
The product of four chiral Potts weight '''''S''''' was shown to intertwine two '''''L'''''-operators as
:&lt;math&gt; L_{i_1\alpha_1}^{i_2\alpha_2} {\hat L}_{i_2\beta_1}^{i_3\beta_2} S_{\alpha_2\beta_2}^{\alpha_3\beta_3}= S_{\alpha_1\beta_1}^{\alpha_2\beta_2} {\hat L}_{i_1\beta_2}^{i_2\beta_3} L_{i_2\alpha_2}^{i_3\alpha_3},\quad 0&lt;i_i\le1,\quad 0\le \alpha_i, \beta_i\le N-1.&lt;/math&gt;
This inspired a most important breakthrough, namely the functional relations for the [[Transfer matrix|transfer matrices]] of the chiral Potts models are discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J, Bazhanov V V and Perk J H H (1990), "Functional relations for transfer matrices of the chiral Potts model", International Journal of Modern Physics B '''4''', 803–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free energy and interfacial tension ===
Using these functional relation, Baxter was able to calculate the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the chiral Potts model,&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (1991), "Calculation of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the chiral Potts model", Proceeding of Fourth Asia Pacific Physics Conference (Singapore: World Scientific) pp 42–58.&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained the critical exponent for the specific heat α=1-2/N, which was also conjectured in reference 12. The [[Interfacial tension|interfacial tensions]] are also calculated by him with the exponent μ=1/2+1/N.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (1993), "Chiral Potts model with skewed boundary conditions", [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] '''73''', 461–95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter R J (1994), "Interfacial tension of the chiral Potts model", [[Journal of Physics A]] '''27''', pp 1837–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with Mathematics  ==
=== Knot Theory ===
The integrable chiral Potts weights are given in product form &lt;ref name=BPA/&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt; 
W_{pq}(n)\!=\!\Big({\mu_p\over\mu_q}\Big)^{\!\!n}\prod_{j=1}^n
{y_q-x_p\omega^j\over y_p-x_q\omega^j},\quad
  \overline W_{pq}(n)\!=\!\big({\mu_p\mu_q}\big)^{\!n}\!\prod_{j=1}^n
{\omega x_p\!-\!x_q\omega^j\over y_q\!-\!y_p\omega^j},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ω&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;=1 and we associate with each of the rapidity variable p with three variables (x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,μ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfying
:&lt;math&gt; x_p^N+y_p^N=k(1+x_p^N y_p^N),\quad
k'^2+k^2=1,\quad
k'\mu_p^N=1-k y_p^N,\quad
k'\mu_p^{-N}=1-k x_p^N.
 &lt;/math&gt;
It is easy to see that
:&lt;math&gt; 
W_{pp}(a-b)=1,\quad \overline W_{pp}(a-b)=\delta_{a,b}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is similar to Reidemeister move I. It was also known that the weights satisfying the inversion relation,
:&lt;math&gt; 
W_{pq}(a-b)W_{qp}(a-b)=1,\quad
\sum_{d=0}^{N-1}\overline W_{pq}(a-d)\overline W_{qp}(d-a')=r_{pq}\delta_{a,a'}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to Reidemeister move II. The star-triangle relation
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum^{N}_{d=1}\,{\overline W}_{pr}(a-d)\,W_{pq}(d-c)\,{\overline  W}_{rq}(d-b)
=R_{pqr}\,\overline W_{pq}(a-b)\,{ W}_{pr}(b-c)\,W_{rq}(a-c)&lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to Reidemeister move III. These are shown in the figure shown here.

G.|title=Small Group Decision Making: Communication and the group Process|year=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Group communication ==
The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s .&lt;ref name="Bales"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Page 33. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Balesss"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bales, R. F., and Strodtbeck, F. L. (1951). Phases in group problem-solving. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 46,'' 485-495.&lt;/ref&gt; This research entailed the [[content analysis]] of discussions within groups making decisions about "human relations" problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the ''linear phase model''. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others.

===Linear phase model===
The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, B. A.  (1970). Decision emergence: Phases in group decision making. ''Speech Monographs, 37,'' 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher's) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher [[Marshall Scott Poole]] examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Scott Poole|Poole, M. S.]], &amp; Roth, J. (1989). Decision development in small groups IV: A typology of group decision paths. ''Human Communication Research, 15,'' 323-356.&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a "complete" discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary.

===Idea development===
Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem.&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel, T. M., &amp; Crowell, L. (1964). Idea development in small discussion groups. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 50,'' 140-145.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their "comfort level" with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as "spiraling."  Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal's acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L. R. (1979). ''The group problem-solving process''. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a "bona fide" groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., &amp; Stohl, C. (1990). Bona fide groups: A reconceptualization of groups in context. ''Communication Studies, 41, 3,'' 248-265.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides researchers with model of group behavior that stays true to the characteristics displayed by most naturally occurring groups, (s).

== Social influence in groups ==
Work relevant to [[social influence]] in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by [[Muzafer Sherif]] in 1935 using the [[autokinetic effect]]. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M. (1935). A study of some social factors in perception. ''Archives of Psychology, 27''(187).&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these was a series of studies by [[Solomon Asch]], in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the "judgments" of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: 1. A minority of one against a unanimous majority. ''Psychological Monographs, 70''(9), Whole #416.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see [[conformity]]). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.

===Conflict resolution===
Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"&gt;Guffey, Mary E., Kathleen Rhodes and Patricia Rogin. ''Business Communication: Process and Product''. 3rd ed. Toronto: Thomson South-Western, 2010. 32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the group members have to listen carefully to each other
* Understand the different points of view that were discussed
* Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions
* Try to find a common ground
* Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation
* Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone

===Group decisions===
By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif's led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, M. A., Kogan, N., &amp; Bem, D. J. (1962). Group influence on individual risk taking. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65,'' 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the [[risky shift]]), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion ([[group polarization]]). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on [[social comparison theory]], claiming that members look to one another for the "socially correct" side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R. S., Dion, K. L., Baron, P. H., &amp; Miller, N. (1971). Group consensus and cultural values as determinants of risk taking. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 20,'' 446-455.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an example of normative influence. The other 'persuasive arguments theory' (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Vinokur, A., &amp; Burnstein, E. (1974). Effects of partially shared persuasive arguments on group induced shifts: A group problem-solving approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,'' 305-315.&lt;/ref&gt; PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence.

The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a "[[hidden profile]]" and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.&lt;ref&gt;Stasser, G., &amp; Titus, W. (1985). Pooling of unshared information in group decision making: Biased information sampling during discussion. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53,'' 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member's ideas, and has final say on a decision.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"/&gt;

=== Nonverbal communication ===
{{Main|Nonverbal communication}}
'''Body language''' is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech). Humans send and interpret such signals unconsciously.
It is often said that human communication consists of 93% body language and paralinguistic cues, while only 7% of communication consists of words themselves&lt;ref&gt;Borg, John. Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons to Master the Silent Language. Prentice Hall life, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; - however, [[Albert Mehrabian]], the researcher whose 1960s work is the source of these statistics, has stated that this is a misunderstanding of the findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

=== Physical expression ===

Physical expressions like waving, pointing, touching and slouching are all forms of nonverbal communication.  The study of body movement and expression is known as [[kinesics]].  Humans move their bodies when communicating because as research has shown, it helps "ease the mental effort when communication is difficult."  Physical expressions reveal many things about the person using them for example, gestures can emphasize a point or relay a message, posture can reveal boredom or great interest, and touch can convey encouragement or caution.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples list ===

*''Hands on knees'': indicates readiness.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"&gt;Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, Patrick Fanning [1983] (1995) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bUDNZkqUt0AC Messages: The Communication Skills Book]'', Second Edition, New Harbinger Publications, {{ISBN|1-57224-592-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57224-592-1}}, pp.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hands on hips'': indicates impatience.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Lock your hands behind your back'': indicates self-control.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Locked hands behind head'': states confidence.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair'': suggests indifference.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Legs and feet pointed in a particular direction'': the direction where more interest is felt&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Crossed arms'': indicates submissiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnow, E. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. Humans, sometimes unconsciously, send and receive non-verbal signals all the time.

== Body language and space ==

Interpersonal space refers to the psychological "bubble" that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us.  Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart.  Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends.  The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away.  We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions.  The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you.  Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances.  The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you.  This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language difficulties===

Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language.  Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions.
One of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon.  Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand.  It also syllabifies group membership when used properly.  The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth.
Another barrier to language is bypassing.  Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other's meanings.  To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says.  The third most common language barrier is offensive language.  Offensive language is "any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason.  Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication.  Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate.  Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood.  Only through habitual awareness can one begin to truly understand and then be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.

'''DNA-directed RNA interference''' ('''ddRNAi''') is a [[gene silencing|gene-silencing]] technique that utilizes DNA constructs to activate an animal cell’s endogenous [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) pathways. DNA constructs are designed to express self-complementary double-stranded RNAs, typically short-hairpin RNAs ([[shRNA]]), that once processed bring about silencing of a target gene or genes.&lt;ref name="Lambeth LS ''et al''.

[[File:ddRNAi diagram.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=text|Figure 1: ddRNAi mechanism of action]]

== ddRNAi mechanism ==

As seen in Figure 1, a ddRNAi construct encoding an shRNA is packaged into a delivery [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] or reagent tailored to target specific cells. Inside the cell, the DNA is transported to the nucleus where [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] machinery continually manufactures the encoded RNAs. The shRNA molecules are then processed by endogenous systems and enter the [[RNAi]] pathway and silence the desired genes.&lt;ref name="Lambeth LS ''et al''. ''Mol Biol'' 2013"/&gt;

=== Long-term activity ===
Unlike small interfering RNA ([[siRNA]]) therapeutics that turn over within a cell and consequently only silence genes transiently, DNA constructs are continually transcribed, replenishing the cellular ‘dose’ of shRNA, thereby enabling long-term silencing of targeted genes. The ddRNAi mechanism, therefore, offers the potential for ongoing clinical benefit with reduced medical intervention.&lt;ref name="DiGiusto DL ''et al''. ''Science Translational Medicine'' 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suhy DA ''et al''. ''Molecular Therapy'' 2012"/&gt;

== Organization of ddRNAi constructs ==
Figure 2 illustrates the most common type of ddRNAi DNA construct, which is designed to express a shRNA. This consists of a promoter sequence, driving expression of sense and antisense sequences separated by a loop sequence, followed by a transcriptional terminator. The antisense species processed from the shRNA can bind to the target RNA and specify its degradation. shRNA constructs typically encode sense and antisense sequences of 20 – 30 nucleotides. Flexibility in construct design is possible: for example, the positions of sense and antisense sequences can be reversed, and other modifications and additions can alter intracellular shRNA processing.&lt;ref name="Gu S ''et al''. ''Cell'' 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = S. | last2 = Jin | first2 = L. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Huang | first4 = Y. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = F. | last6 = Valdmanis | first6 = P.

''Molecular Therapy'' 2012"/&gt;

[[File:ddRNAi constructs jpg.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=text|Figure 2: ddRNAi DNA constructs]]

A particularly useful variant is a multi-cassette (Figure 2b). Designed to express two or more shRNAs, they can target multiple sequences for degradation simultaneously. This is a particularly useful strategy for targeting viruses. Natural sequence variations can render a single shRNA-target site unrecognizable preventing RNA degradation. Multi-cassette constructs that target multiple sites within the same viral RNA circumvent this issue.&lt;ref name="Suhy DA ''et al''. ''Molecular Therapy'' 2012"/&gt;

== Delivery ==

Delivery of ddRNAi DNA constructs is simplified by the existence of a number of clinically-approved and well-characterized [[gene therapy]] vectors developed for the purpose. Delivery is a major challenge for RNAi-based therapeutics with new modifications and reagents continually being developed to optimize target cell delivery. Two broad strategies to facilitate delivery of DNA constructs to the desired cells are available: these use either viral vectors or one of a number of classes of [[transfection]] reagents.

For example, in a Phase I clinical trial at the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]], California, US, four HIV-positive patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were successfully treated with autologous [[hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic progenitor cells]] pre-transduced ex vivo with ddRNAi constructs using lentiviral vectors. This construct was designed to express three therapeutic RNAs, one of which was a shRNA, thereby combating HIV replication in three different ways:&lt;ref name="DiGiusto DL ''et al''. ''Science Translational Medicine'' 2010"/&gt; 
*shRNA, that silences the tat and rev genes of the HIV genome
*CCR5 ribozyme, inhibiting viral cell entry
*TAR decoy RNA, inhibiting initiation of viral transcription.

Ongoing expression of the shRNA has been confirmed in T cells, monocytes and B cells more than one year after transplantation.&lt;ref name="DiGiusto DL ''et al''. ''Science Translational Medicine'' 2010"/&gt;

== Therapeutic applications ==

=== Neuropathic pain ===

Nervana is an investigational ddRNAi construct that knocks down the expression of [[protein kinase C]] gamma (PKCγ) known to be associated with [[neuropathic pain]] and [[morphine#adverse effects#tolerance|morphine tolerance]].&lt;ref name="Zou W ''et al''. ''Human Gene Therapy'' 2011" /&gt;

Two conserved PKCγ sequences found across all key model species and humans have been identified, and both single and double DNA cassettes designed. In vitro, expression of PKCγ was silenced by 80%. When similar ddRNAi constructs were delivered intrathecally using a lentiviral vector, pain relief in a neuropathic-rat model was demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Zou W ''et al''. ''Human Gene Therapy'' 2011" /&gt;

=== Drug-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer ===

The development of resistance to chemotherapies such as [[paclitaxel]] and [[cisplatin]] in [[non-small-cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC) is strongly associated with over expression of [[Class III b-tubulin|beta III tubulin]]. Investigations by the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia ([[UNSW Lowy Cancer Research Centre|University of NSW, Lowy Cancer Research Centre]]) demonstrated that beta III-tubulin knockdown by ddRNAi delayed tumor growth and increased chemosensitivity in mouse models.&lt;ref name="McCarroll JA ''et al''. ''Cancer Research'' 2010"/&gt;

Tribetarna is a triple DNA cassette expressing three shRNA molecules that each separately target beta III tubulin and strongly inhibit its expression. Studies in an orthotopic-mouse model, where the construct is delivered by a modified [[polyethylenimine]] vector, jetPEI, that targets lung tissue are in progress.

=== Hepatitis B viral infection ===

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome encodes its own [[DNA polymerase]] for replication. Biomics Biotechnologies has evaluated around 5000 siRNA sequences of this gene for effective knockdown; five sequences were chosen for further investigation and shown to have potent silencing activity when converted into shRNA expression cassettes. A multi-cassette construct, Hepbarna, is under preclinical development for delivery by an [[adeno-associated virus]] 8 (AAV-8) liver-targeting vector.

=== Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ===

Classified as an [[orphan disease]], there is currently no therapy for OPMD, caused by a mutation in the poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 ([[PABPN1]]) gene. Silencing the mutant gene using ddRNAi offers a potential therapeutic approach.&lt;ref name="Trollet C ''et al''. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Safety concerns ==

As with all [[gene therapy|gene therapies]], a number of safety and toxicity issues need to be evaluated during the development of ddRNAi therapeutics:

Oncogene activation by viral insertion: Some gene therapy vectors integrate into the host genome, thereby acting as insertional mutagens. This was a particular issue with early retroviral vectors where insertions adjacent to [[oncogenes]] resulted in the development of lymphoid tumors.&lt;ref name="Woods NB ''et al''. ''Nature'' 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAV vectors are considered a low risk for host-genome integration, as [[adeno-associated virus]] infection has not been associated with the induction of cancers in humans despite widespread prevalence across the general population. Moreover, extensive clinical use of AAV vectors has provided no evidence of carcinogenicity. While lentiviral vectors do integrate into the genome they do not appear to show a propensity to activate oncogene expression.&lt;ref name="Wang GP ''et al''.

Immune response to gene therapy vectors: An immunological response to an adenoviral vector resulted in the death of a patient in an early human trial. Careful monitoring of potential toxicities in preclinical testing and analyses of pre-existing antibodies to gene therapy vectors in patients minimizes such risks.

Innate immune response: siRNAs have been shown to activate immune responses through interaction with Toll-like receptors leading to interferon responses. These receptors reside on the cells surface and so ddRNAi constructs – delivered directly into intracellular space – are not expected to induce this response.&lt;ref name="Kleinman ME ''et al''.

[[File:Orion Drop Test on Feb 29.jpg|thumb|right|Orion [[test article]] being released during airborne drop test.]]
A '''drop test''' is a method of testing the in-flight characteristics of [[prototype]] or [[experimental aircraft|experimental]] [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] by raising the test vehicle to a specific altitude and then releasing it.  Test flights involving powered aircraft, particularly [[rocket-powered aircraft]], may be referred to as '''drop launches''' due to the [[Rocket launch|launch]] of the aircraft's rockets after release from its carrier aircraft.

In the case of unpowered aircraft, the test vehicle [[free fall|falls]] or [[glider aircraft|glides]] after its release in an [[unpowered flight|unpowered]] descent to a landing site.  Drop tests may be used to verify the [[aerodynamic|aerodynamic performance]] and [[Flight dynamics (fixed wing aircraft)|flight dynamics]] of the test vehicle, to test its landing systems, or to evaluate [[survivability]] of a planned or crash landing.  This allows the vehicle's designers to validate [[Computational fluid dynamics|computer flight models]], [[wind tunnel]] testing, or other theoretical design characteristics of an aircraft or spacecraft's design.

High-altitude drop tests may be conducted by carrying the test vehicle aboard a [[mother ship|mothership]] to a target altitude for release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/12/snc-building-schedule-dream-chaser-tests-upcoming/ | title = SNC building test schedule for Dream Chaser – Dryden Drop Tests upcoming | date = December 10, 2012 | accessdate = March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low-altitude drop tests may be conducted by releasing the test vehicle from a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] or [[gantry (rocketry)|gantry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/fs-2007-08-138-larc.html | title = NASA Fact Sheet - NASA's Gantry: Past, Present and Future Asset to Exploration | publisher = NASA.gov | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft and lifting-body testing==

===Carrier landing simulation tests===
The landing gear on aircraft used on aircraft carriers must be stronger than those on land-based aircraft, due to higher approach speeds and sink rates during carrier landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navalhistory.org/2011/01/12/first-test-of-angled-deck | publisher = Naval History Blog | title = First Test of Angled Deck | date = January 12, 2011 | accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/fighter-aircraft.htm | publisher = globalsecurity.org | title = Fighter Aircraft | accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the 1940s, drop tests were conducted by lifting a carrier-based plane such as the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] to a height of ten feet and then dropped, simulating the impact of a landing at nineteen feet per second.  The F6F was ultimately dropped from a height of twenty feet, demonstrating it could absorb twice the force of a carrier landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graff | first = Cory | title = F6F Hellcat at War | page = 39 | publisher = Zenith Imprint |date=April 2009 | isbn = 1616732660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20121206/BLOG5206/121209933 | title = Hellcats were built to take a beating | last = Graff | first = Cory | date = December 6, 2012 | accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drop tests are still used in the development and testing of carrier-based aircraft; in 2010, the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35C|Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II]] underwent drop tests to simulate its maximum descent rate of 26.4 feet per second during carrier landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/stories/070810/tester_28230.shtml | title = JSF simulated carrier landing successful | date = July 8, 2010 | accessdate = March 27, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130410175614/http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/stories/070810/tester_28230.shtml | archivedate = April 10, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyfinance.com/rtn/pr/lockheed-martin-f-35-navy-jet-confirms-carrier-landing-strength-predictions/rfid341660372/ | title = Lockheed Martin F-35 Navy Jet Confirms Carrier-Landing Strength Predictions | date = June 23, 2010 | accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental aircraft===
Numerous [[experimental aircraft|experimental]] and [[prototype]] aircraft have been drop tested or drop launched.  Many powered [[X-plane]]s, including the [[Bell X-1]], [[Bell X-2]], [[North American X-15]], [[Martin Marietta X-24A]] and [[Martin Marietta X-24A|X-24B]], [[Orbital Sciences X-34]], [[Boeing X-40]], and [[NASA X-43|NASA X-43A]] were specifically designed to be drop launched. [[Test article]]s of the unpowered [[NASA X-38]] were also drop tested, from altitudes of up to 45,000 feet, in order to study its [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] and handling qualities, [[autonomous flight]] capabilities, and deployment of its steerable [[parafoil]].&lt;ref name="X-38 FS"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-038-DFRC.html "X-38."] ''NASA Dryden Fact Sheets''. Retrieved: March 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experimental aircraft designed for airborne launches, such as the [[Northrop HL-10]], have made both unpowered drop tests and powered drop launches.  Prior to powered flights using its rocket engine, the HL-10 made 11 unpowered drop flights in order to study the handling qualities and stability of the [[lifting body]] in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-010-DFRC.html | title = Fact Sheets - HL-10 Lifting Body | publisher = NASA.gov | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved: March 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] provided [[NASA]] with a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber to be used as a [[mother ship|mothership]] for the experimental [[North American X-15|X-15]].  Built in 1955, the B-52 was only the 10th to come off the assembly line, and was used by the Air Force for [[flight test]]ing before turning it over to NASA.&lt;ref name="Balls 8 factsheet"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-005-DFRC.html NASA's Mothership Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying with NASA tail number 008, the plane was nicknamed ''Balls 8'' by Air Force pilots, following a tradition of referring to aircraft numbered with multiple zeroes as "Balls" plus the final number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stormclimb.com/2011/08/07/a-brief-history-of-balls-8-the-famous-b-52-that-served-nasa-for-almost-50-years/ | title = A Brief History of Balls 8, the Famous B-52 that Served NASA for Almost 50 Years | date = August 7, 2011 | accessdate = March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Balls 8]]'' received significant modifications in order to carry the X-15.  A special [[Aircraft pylon|pylon]], designed to carry and release the X-15, was installed under the right wing between the fuselage and inboard engine.  A notch was also cut out of one of the right wing's flaps so that the plane could accommodate the X-15's vertical tail.  ''Balls 8'' was one of two such bombers modified to carry the X-15; while the other plane was retired in 1969 after the end of the X-15 program, NASA continued using ''Balls 8'' for drop tests until it was retired in 2004.  During its 50-year career, ''Balls 8'' carried numerous experimental vehicles including the HL-10, X-24A, X-24B, X-38, and X-43A.&lt;ref name="Balls 8 factsheet" /&gt;

===X-24B role in Space Shuttle development===
{{main|Martin Marietta X-24B}}
During the design of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] in the 1970s, engineers debated whether to design the orbiter to [[Glider (aircraft)|glide]] to an unpowered landing or equip the orbiter with pop-out jet engines in order to make a powered landing.  While powered landing design required carrying the engines and jet fuel, adding weight and complexity to the orbiter, engineers began favoring the powered landing option.  In response, NASA conducted unpowered drop tests of the [[X-24B]] to demonstrate the feasibility of landing a lifting-body aircraft in unpowered flight.  In 1975, the X-24B aircraft was dropped from a ''[[Balls 8]]'' at an altitude of 45,000 feet above the [[Mojave Desert]], and then ignited rocket engines to increase speed and propel it to 60,000 feet.  Once the rocket engine cut off, the high-speed and high-altitude conditions permitted the X-24B to simulate the path of a Space Shuttle orbiter under post-[[atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]] conditions.  The X-24B successfully made two unpowered precision landings at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], demonstrating the feasibility of an unpowered lifting body design for the Space Shuttle.  These successes convinced those in charge of the [[Space Shuttle program]] to commit to an unpowered landing design, which would save weight and increase the orbiter's payload capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/x24b.html | title = X-24B Precision Landings Proved That Shuttle Could Land Unpowered | publisher = NASA.gov | date = July 1, 2011 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.whiteeagleaerospace.com/blog/2010/08/23/x-24b-precision-landing/ | title = X-24B Precision Landing | date = August 23, 2010 | accessdate = March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' being released by [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]]]

===Space Shuttle Enterprise===
{{main|Approach and Landing Tests}}
In 1977, a series of drop tests of the [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' were conducted to test the Space Shuttle's flight characteristics.  Because the Space Shuttle is designed to glide unpowered during its descent and landing, a series of drop tests using a test orbiter were used to demonstrate that the orbiter could be successfully controlled in unpowered flight.  These drop tests, known as the [[Approach and Landing Tests|Approach and Landing Test]] program, used a modified [[Boeing 747]], known as the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] or SCA, to carry ''Enterprise'' to an altitude of 15,000 to 30,000 feet.  After a series of captive-flight tests in which the orbiter was not released, five free-flight tests were performed in August through October 1977.&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-000218.html |title=Shuttle Enterprise Free Flight |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |publisher=NASA |year=1977 |author=NASA - Dryden Flight Research Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307094536/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-000218.html |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While free-flight tests of ''Enterprise'' involved the release of an unpowered aircraft from a powered aircraft, these tests were not typical of drop testing because the orbiter was actually carried and released from a position above the SCA.  This arrangement was potentially dangerous because it placed ''Enterprise'' in free flight directly in front of the SCA's [[Vertical stabilizer|tail fin]] immediately after release.  As a result, the "drop" was conducted by using a series of carefully planned maneuvers to minimize the risk of aircraft collision.  Immediately after release, the ''Enterprise'' would climb to the right while the SCA performed a shallow dive to the left, allowing for quick vertical and horizontal separation between the two aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Damohn, Ph.D. |first=Mark |title=Back Down to Earth: The Development of Space Policy for NASA During the Jimmy Carter Administration |date=March 2001 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=1475908458 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream Chaser===
{{main|Dream Chaser}}
In mid-2013, [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] plans to conduct drop tests of its [[Dream Chaser]] prototype [[commercial spaceflight|commercial]] [[spaceplane]].  The unmanned first flight test will drop the Dream Chaser prototype from an altitude of 12,000 feet, where it is planned that the vehicle will autonomously fly to an unpowered at [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/02/dream-chaser-spaceship/ | title = Astronaut-Transporting ‘Dream Chaser’ Spacecraft Preps for First Test Flights | date = February 4, 2013 | accessdate = March 25, 2013 | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/19551-dream-chaser-space-plane-flight-test.html | title = Private Space Plane Poised for Big Test Flight | date = January 30, 2013 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manned capsule testing==
Drop tests of prototype [[manned spaceflight|manned]] [[space capsule]]s may be done to test the survivability of landing, primarily by testing the capsule's descent characteristics and its post-[[atmospheric reentry|reentry]] landing systems.  These tests are typically carried out unmanned prior to any manned spaceflight testing.

===Apollo command module===
In 1963, [[North American Aviation]] built BP-19A, an unmanned [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo command module]] for use in drop testing.  NASA conducted a series of tests in 1964 which involved dropping BP-19A from a [[Douglas C-133 Cargomaster|C-133 Cargomaster]] in order to test the capsule's parachute systems prior to the start of manned testing of the Apollo spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/14801-apollo-drop-test-capsule-restored.html | title = Restored Apollo Test Capsule to Land at Science Center | date = March 6, 2012 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orion parachute test Dec 20 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Orion test article after release from C-130 and separation from pallet]]

===Orion capsule===
In 2011 and 2012, NASA conducted a series of short drop tests on the survivability of water landings in its [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] manned capsule by repeatedly dropping an Orion test vehicle into a large water basin.  The tests simulated water landings at speeds varying from 7&amp;nbsp;mph to 50&amp;nbsp;mph by changing the height of the drop [[gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] above the basin.  The range of landing velocities allowed NASA to simulate a range of possible entry and landing conditions during water landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/mpcv-splashtest-jul21.html | title = Testing NASA's Next Deep Space Vehicle | publisher = NASA | date = July 22, 2011 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/orion-droptest-dec01.html | title = Orion Continues to Make a Splash | publisher = NASA | date = December 2, 2011 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/orion-droptest-jan06.html | title = Orion Drop Test - Jan. 06, 2012 | publisher = NASA | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GantryPhoto"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/Budget_Gallery_Orion.html | title = Future Space Flight: Orion Testing | publisher = NASA | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, NASA also conducted drop tests of the Orion test vehicle's parachute systems and land-based landing capabilities.  In each test, the Orion spacecraft was dropped from a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] or [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] [[cargo aircraft|cargo plane]].  For testing, the capsule is mounted on a pallet system and placed inside the cargo aircraft.  Parachutes on the pallet are used to pull the pallet and capsule out of the rear of the aircraft; the capsule then separates from the pallet and begins its free fall descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/02/orion-ptv-preparing-drop-test-eft-1-orion-progress/ | title = Orion PTV preparing for drop test on Wednesday – EFT-1 Orion progress | publisher = NASASpaceflight.com | date = February 26, 2012 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2012, a C-17 dropped an Orion test article from an altitude of 25,000 feet.  The capsule's parachutes successfully deployed between 15,000 and 20,000 feet, slowing the spacecraft to a landing on ground in the Arizona desert.  The capsule landed at a speed of 17&amp;nbsp;mph, well below the designed maximum touchdown speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1203/04orionchutes/ | title = Orion spacecraft's parachutes tested over Arizona | date = March 4, 2012 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boeing CST-100===
In September 2011, Boeing conducted a series of drop tests, carried out in the [[Mojave Desert]] of southeast [[California]], to validate the design of the [[CST-100]] capsule's [[parachute]] and [[airbag|airbag cushioning]] landing systems.  The airbags are located underneath the heat shield of the CST-100, which is designed to be separated from the capsule while under parachute descent at about {{convert|5000|ft}} altitude.  The tests were carried out at ground speeds between {{convert|10|and|30|mph}} in order to simulate cross wind conditions at the time of landing. Bigelow Aerospace built the mobile test rig and conducted the tests.&lt;ref name="Memi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Memi |first=Ed |title=Space capsule tests aim to ensure safe landings |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2011/09/bds_cst_100_airbag_09_12_11.html |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |newspaper=Boeing Defense Space &amp; Security |date=September 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924163725/http://www.boeing.com/Features/2011/09/bds_cst_100_airbag_09_12_11.html |archivedate=September 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Boeing conducted another drop test of its CST-100 prototype space capsule in order to test the capsule's landing systems.  The test vehicle was raised by [[helicopter]] to an altitude of 11,000 feet and then released; the capsule's three main parachutes then deployed successfully and slowed the capsule's descent.  Immediately prior to landing, the capsule's six [[airbag]]s inflated underneath the capsule in order to absorb some of the impact energy from landing.  Similar drop tests are planned in order to conduct additional airbag testing, as well as [[drogue parachute|drogue chute]] and [[heat shield]] jettison tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-04/boeings-new-space-capsule-parachutes-safe-landing-after-first-ever-drop-test | title = Boeing's Space Capsule Undergoes First Drop Test | publisher = Popular Science | date = April 4, 2012 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helicopter testing==
In 2009 and 2010, NASA conducted a pair of drop tests to study the survivability of helicopter crashes.  Using an [[MD Helicopters MD 500|MD 500]] helicopter donated by the U.S. Army, NASA dropped the helicopter at an angle from an altitude of 35 feet to simulate a hard helicopter landing.  Sophisticated [[Crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] with simulated internal organs were located inside the helicopter and used to assess internal injuries from such a crash.&lt;ref name="NASAHelo1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/helo-droptest.html | title = Chopper Drop Tests New Technology | date = December 8, 2009 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASAHelo2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/helodrop-mar2010.html | title = Chopper Crash Test a Smash Hit | date = March 11, 2010 | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to extensive damage to the test helicopter after the second test, no third test was planned.&lt;ref name="NASAHelo2" /&gt;

'''Eastern Asia''' is one of the regions of [[temperate]] [[Asia]] defined in the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]] (WGSRPD) for use in recording the distribution of plants. It is very much smaller than common definitions of [[East Asia]]. It consists of the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Japan]] ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Shikoku]], plus associated offshore islands – the [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan-retto), the [[Ryukyu Islands]] (Nansei-shoto) and the [[Bonin Islands]] (Ogasawara-shoto)), and [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=42}} Some islands belonging to Japan politically, such as [[Marcus Island]] (Minami-Tori-shima), have greater floristic affinity with similar Pacific islands and are placed in the botanical continent of the Pacific.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=5}}

==WGSRPD system==
The WGSRPD is a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] system developed by the international [[Biodiversity Information Standards|Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)]] organization.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=ix}} The system provides clear definitions and codes for recording [[plant]] distributions at four scales or levels, from "botanical continents" down to parts of large countries.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pages=xi,19}} The top two levels are given numerical codes. The botanical continent 3 Asia-Temperate has nine regions, one of which is 38 Eastern Asia.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=19}}

Organizations and works using the scheme include the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN),&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Is Using This Standard |website=Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) |url=http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713195024/http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |accessdate=2015-08-02 |archivedate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] (GRIN), and the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] (WCSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/about.do | title=About the Checklist |work=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the entry for ''[[Lilium concolor]]'' in the WCSP includes the numerical codes "30 31 36 37 38",&lt;ref name="WCSP_279952"&gt;{{citation |title=''Lilium concolor''|work=[[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=279952 |accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial "3" showing these are all regions of Asia-Temperate, with "38" being Eastern Asia.

==Eastern Asia subdivisions==
The Eastern Asia region is subdivided into areas and "basic recording units", which are given letter codes:{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=42}}

==Changes==

Some small changes were made to the Eastern Asia region between the first and second editions of the WGSRPD. The [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan-retto) and the [[Bonin Islands]] (Ogasawara-shoto) were moved from the Pacific botanical continent to Eastern Asia within Asia-Temperate as they have many [[Endemism|endemic]] plants in common with Eastern Asia.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=5}}

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Efficient energy use''', sometimes simply called '''energy efficiency''', is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.

There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency. Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy-efficient technology. Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important solution is to remove government-led energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use in more than half of the countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, International Journal of Environmental Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prindle |first1= Bill |last2= Eldridge |first2= Maggie |last3= Eckhardt |first3= Mike |last4= Frederick |first4= Alyssa |title= The twin pillars of sustainable energy: synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and policy |date= May 2007 |publisher= American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) |place= Washington, DC, USA |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.545.4606&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate of energy at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

==Overview==
{{Further|Domestic energy consumption}}
Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing [[energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=UNP|location=London|pages=180–181|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public [[Green bank (financial institution)|Green Banks]] to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers' energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy" http://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WorkingPaper_StateGreenBanks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovin's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] points out that in industrial settings, "there are abundant opportunities to save 70% to 90% of the energy and cost for lighting, fan, and pump systems; 50% for electric motors; and 60% in areas such as heating, cooling, office equipment, and appliances." In general, up to 75% of the electricity used in the US today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself, the same holds true for home settings. The US Department of Energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 Billion kWh by increasing home energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |title=Weatherization in Austin, Texas |publisher=Green Collar Operations |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235602/http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have emphasized this. A report published in 2006 by the [[McKinsey Global Institute]], asserted that "there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annum"—less than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario.&lt;ref name= NYT292006&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Use Can Be Cut by Efficiency, Survey Says.... |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/business/29energy.html |accessdate= November 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 29, 2006|author= Steve Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy productivity, which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input, can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something, or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy.

The [[Vienna Climate Change Talks 2007]] Report, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), clearly shows "that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appliances==
{{See also|green computing|solar lamp|energy saving lamp|power usage effectiveness}}

Modern appliances, such as, [[freezers]], [[oven]]s, [[stove]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and clothes washers and dryers, use significantly less energy than older appliances. Installing a clothesline will significantly reduce one's energy consumption as their dryer will be used less. Current energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001. Following this, if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones, 20 billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually, hence reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by almost 18 billion kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |title=Ecosavings |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070945/http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kWh of electricity and {{convert|27000000000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrolux.com/ecosavings_us |title=Ecosavings (Tm) Calculator |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study from [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Version 2 of the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/cost%20curve%20pdfs/pathways_lowcarbon_economy_version2.ashx|accessdate=February 16, 2016|page=7|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time. Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using [[energy input labeling]].&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://www.eesi.org/buildings_efficiency_0506 |title=Energy-Efficient Buildings: Using whole building design to reduce energy consumption in homes and offices |publisher=Eesi.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used. For example, an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot. Therefore, an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand. An energy-efficient dishwasher, on the other hand, uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes. This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand.

Buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer. However, the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot. The measures that keep buildings comfortable, lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation, all consume energy. Typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building which is referred to as specific energy consumption (SEC) or energy use intensity (EUI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=buildingcontest.eui]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \text{Energy consumed}\text{Built area}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the issue is more complex as building materials have [[embodied energy]] in them. On the other hand, energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy. Moreover, when the building is used, the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments. Finally, overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building: is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used — or is the building largely empty? It has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency, SEC should be amended to include these factors:&lt;ref&gt;Juha Forsström, Pekka Lahti, Esa Pursiheimo, Miika Rämä, Jari Shemeikka, Kari Sipilä, Pekka Tuominen &amp; Irmeli Wahlgren (2011): [http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/tiedotteet/2011/T2581.pdf Measuring energy efficiency]. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{Embodied energy} + \text{Energy consumed} - \text{Energy recovered}}{\text{Built area} \times \text{Utilization rate} \times \text{Quality factor}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.

A building's location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination. For example, trees, landscaping, and hills can provide shade and block wind. In cooler climates, designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun (ultimately heat energy) entering the building, minimizing energy use, by maximizing [[passive solar heating]]. Tight building design, including energy-efficient windows, well-sealed doors, and additional thermal insulation of walls, basement slabs, and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most heat is lost through the walls of your building, in fact about a third of all heat losses occur in this area. [https://www.simplybusinessenergy.co.uk/news/electricity-and-energy-cost-savings-for-small-businesses~188/ Simply Business Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark roofs may become up to 39&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) hotter than the most [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|reflective white surfaces]]. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light, and in most applications they are cost effective, despite their higher initial cost, with payback periods as low as a few months. [[LED lamp]]s use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole building's lighting and power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Energy Efficient Offices - Electrical Contractor Fit-out Article&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model, it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load. The study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12053-015-9392-9 |title=Beyond the end-consumer: how would improvements in residential energy efficiency affect the power sector in Saudi Arabia? |year=2015 |last1=Matar |first1=W |journal=Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient [[furnace#Household furnaces|natural gas furnace]] with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. [[Ground source heat pump]]s can be even more energy-efficient and cost-effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to "pump" heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.

[[Smart meter]]s are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the building's energy usage in a dynamic presentable format. The use of Power Quality Analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage, harmonic distortion, peaks, swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient. Often such meters communicate by using [[wireless sensor network]]s.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the [[Building Information Modeling]] efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines. But with the development of modern computer technology, a large number of [[building performance simulation]] tools are available on the market. When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=A |last2=Dong |first2=B |last3=Leite |first3=F |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a rating system organized by the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) to promote environmental responsibility in building design. They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings (LEED-EBOM) and new construction (LEED-NC) based on a building's compliance with the following criteria: [[Sustainable sites]], [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction Checklist |url=http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150226000022/http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2015 |website=USGBC |accessdate=29 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification. The following year, the council collaborated with [[Honeywell]] to pull data on energy and water use, as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque, providing a near-real-time view of performance. The USGBC office in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell, USGBC Tool Monitors Building Sustainability|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/10/22/honeywell-usgbc-tool-monitors-building-sustainability/|website=Environmental Leader|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deep energy retrofit]] is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], and [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindow]]s which block heat but pass light. [[Air conditioning]] operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving a gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.&lt;ref name="inhabitat1"/&gt;
The [[Indianapolis City-County Building]] recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.

Energy retrofits, including deep, and other types undertaken in residential, commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives. Incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyer/user may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or "bought down". "Upstream" or "Midstream" buy downs are common for efficient lighting products. Other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications. In addition to rebates, which may be offered through government or utility programs, governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects. Some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs.

To evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce the value of energy saved, sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s'', in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

==Energy efficiency by country==

===Europe===
{{See also|Energy efficiency in Europe (study)}}
{{Expand section|proper text and additional citations|date=June 2016}}

Energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030.

The first EU-wide target was set in 1998. Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by 1 percent a year over twelve years. In addition, legislation about products, industry, transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework. More effort is needed to address heating and cooling: there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heatroadmap.eu/|title=Heat Roadmap Europe|website=www.heatroadmap.eu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to 326 million tons of oil per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set itself a [[EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012|20% energy savings target]] by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved. At an EU summit in October 2014, EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27% or greater by 2030. One mechanism used to achieve the target of 27% is the 'Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/white-certificates|website=Europa.EU|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing debate around the 2016 Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency, but the goal will probably remain around 30% greater efficiency compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.

===Australia===
The [[Australian national government]] is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency, mainly through the government's [[Department of Industry and Science]]. In July 2009, the [[Council of Australian Governments]], which represents the individual states and territories of Australia, agreed to a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (NSEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Strategy on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Industry.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913191712/http://www.industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy-efficient practices and a preparation for the country's transformation into a [[low carbon]] future. There are several different areas of energy use addressed within the NSEE. But, the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency. They are:
*To help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future
*To streamline the adoption of efficient energy
*To make buildings more energy-efficient
*For governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency

The overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Fif.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005515/http://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document also explains the role of both the [[commonwealth]] and the individual states and territories in the NSEE, as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nation's progress in relation to the stated goals, and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward.

===Canada===

In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy.

The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy-efficiency performance of existing and new Canadian buildings, and establishes five goals to that end:
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt the code.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019.
*The federal government will set new standards for heating equipment and other key technologies to the highest level of efficiency that is economically and technically achievable.
*Provincial and territorial governments will work to sustain and expand efforts to retrofit existing buildings by supporting energy efficiency improvements and by accelerating the adoption of high-efficiency equipment while tailoring their programs to regional circumstances.

The strategy details a range of activities the Government of Canada will pursue, and investments it will make, in support of the goals. As of early 2018, only one of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, British Columbia, has developed a policy in support of federal government's goal to reach net zero energy ready ambitions: the [[BC Energy Step Code]].

Local British Columbia governments may use the BC Energy Step Code, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation and standard is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful, with a growth of 1.7% between 2005–2014. This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport. Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany. Rebound effects played a significant role, both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled, and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency. The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures. The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry. German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

{{Main|Energy conservation in the United States}}

A 2011 [[Energy Modeling Forum]] study covering the United States examines how energy efficiency opportunities will shape future fuel and electricity demand over the next several decades. The US economy is already set to lower its energy and carbon intensity, but explicit policies will be necessary to meet climate goals. These policies include: a carbon tax, mandated standards for more efficient appliances, buildings and vehicles, and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy-efficient equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industry==
Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes. Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power, most of which is delivered as [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|petroleum fuels]], and [[electricity]]. In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy.

Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry. Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility. There are, however, a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries.

Various industries generate [[steam]] and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities. When electricity is generated, the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam, heating or other industrial purposes. Conventional electricity generation is about 30% efficient, whereas combined heat and power (also called [[co-generation]]) converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy.&lt;ref name=indust&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://ladoma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Energy-Efficiency-Fact-Sheet.pdf |title=Industrial Energy Efficiency: Using new technologies to reduce energy use in industry and manufacturing |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel. These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Over 45 percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam. The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent (according to the [[US Department of Energy]]) by insulating steam and condensate return lines, stopping steam leakage, and maintaining steam traps.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s usually run at a constant speed, but a [[variable speed drives|variable speed drive]] allows the motor's energy output to match the required load. This achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent, depending on how the motor is used. Motor coils made of [[superconducting]] materials can also reduce energy losses.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt; Motors may also benefit from [[voltage optimisation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Industry uses a large number of [[pumps]] and [[compressors]] of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications. The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better [[process control]] and better maintenance practices. Compressors are commonly used to provide [[compressed air]] which is used for sand blasting, painting, and other power tools. According to the US Department of Energy, optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives, along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks, can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

===Automobiles===
{{Main|Fuel economy in automobiles}}

[[File:NYPD Traffic Enforcement RMP In White.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Prius]] used by [[NYPD#Traffic Enforcement|NYPD Traffic Enforcement]]]]

The estimated energy efficiency for an automobile is 280 Passenger-Mile/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Btu.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dorf, ''The Energy Factbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to enhance a vehicle's energy efficiency. Using improved [[aerodynamics]] to minimize drag can increase vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy, which is why [[composite materials]] are widely used in car bodies.

More advanced tires, with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance, can save gasoline. Fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3% by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml |title=Tips to improve your Gas Mileage |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On newer vehicles (1980s and up) with fuel-injected, computer-controlled engines, a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/Air_Filter_Effects_02_26_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle. The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air. Aerodynamics involves the air around the car, which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-makes-a-car-fuel-efficient|title=What Makes a Fuel Efficient Car? The 8 Most Fuel Efficient Cars|work=CarsDirect|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turbocharger]]s can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine. The 'Engine of the year 2011' is a Fiat 500 engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger. "Compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine, the new 85 HP turbo has 23% more power and a 30% better performance index. The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine, but fuel consumption is 30% lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat 875cc TwinAir named International Engine of the Year 2011|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/fiat-20110520.html|website=Green Car Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile. Cutting-edge designs, such as the diesel [[Mercedes-Benz Bionic]] concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as {{convert|84|mpgus}}, four times the current conventional automotive average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pd{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of [[electric vehicle]]s (all@electric or hybrid electric). Hybrids, like the [[Toyota Prius]], use [[regenerative braking]] to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars; the effect is especially pronounced in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nom * |url=https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |title=La Prius de Toyota, une référence des voitures hybrides &amp;#124; L'énergie en questions |publisher=Lenergieenquestions.fr |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017080726/https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plug-in hybrid]]s also have increased battery capacity, which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline; in this case, energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process (such as coal-burning, hydroelectric, or renewable source) created the power. Plug-ins can typically drive for around {{convert|40|mi}} purely on electricity without recharging; if the battery runs low, a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range. Finally, all-electric cars are also growing in popularity; the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market.

===Street lighting===
Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2763639/global_led_and_smart_street_lighting_market&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities are seeking to reduce [[street light]] power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/street-lighting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of LEDs will lead to real reductions in energy, as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C.

===Aircraft===
{{Main|Fuel economy in aircraft|Environmental impact of aviation}}

There are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from modifications to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.

Air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole. New technology allows for superior automation of takeoff, landing, and collision avoidance, as well as within airports, from simple things like HVAC and lighting to more complex tasks such as security and scanning.

==Energy conservation==
{{Main|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|250px|right|Elements of [[Passive solar building design|passive solar energy design]], shown in a direct gain application]]

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption, for example through [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], in addition to using energy more efficiently. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter, using the car less, air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer, or enabling energy saving modes on a computer. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. et al. (2009).[http://www.pnas.org/content/106/44/18452.full Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions].

''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes, technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand. Many energy [[intermediary]] organisations, for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local, regional, or national level, are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of apps useful for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/ |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory. (2012) |publisher=En.openei.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

==Sustainable energy==
{{Main|Sustainable energy}}

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the “twin pillars” of a sustainable [[energy policy]]. Both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. Efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising [[clean energy]] supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too rapidly, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions; a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. A sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df=}}([[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Lieef (www.Lieef.com) have started reporting ESG metrics on behalf of companies, and investment funds, in an effort to increase transparency in the space which to date has increased in importance, but has not found a unified measurement tool. In addition, the majority of companies that report sustainability do so on a 'net' basis, and do not reflect their carbon emissions, and separate those emissions from their activities that offset those emissions, such as buying renewable credits and green power..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Lieef.com/ |title=Lieef.com; Lieef inc |publisher=Lieef.com |date=2018-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebound effect==
{{Further|Rebound effect (conservation)|Jevons' paradox}}
If the demand for energy services remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper, consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

The '''Electronic Information Exchange System''' ('''EIES''', pronounced ''[[eye]]s'') was an early [[online conferencing]] [[bulletin board system]] that allowed [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and [[asynchronous communication]]. The system was used to deliver courses, conduct conferencing sessions, and facilitate research. Funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and developed from 1974-1978 at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT) by [[Murray Turoff]] based on his earlier EMISARI done at the now-defunct [[Office of Emergency Preparedness]], EIES was intended to facilitate group communications that would allow groups to make decisions based on their [[collective intelligence]] rather than the [[lowest common denominator]]. Initially conceived as an experiment in [[computer mediated communication]], EIES remained in use for decades because its users "just wouldn't let go" of it, eventually adapting it for legislative, medical and even spiritual uses.

==Technology==
In the mid-1980s, a new version called ''EIES-2'' was developed to research the implementation of group communications in distributed environments, versus the centralized [[time-sharing]] environment used for the first version. EIES-2 had an [[object database]] architecture using over 2 dozen classes and implementing a notion of ''activities'', which was a standardized interface for implementing nonstandard functions such as polls or list-gathering. The activities concept was similar to what would be done in today's [[message board]] applications using [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]. The standard message-based functions were also implemented as activities. EIES-2 ran on [[Unix]] and was written in the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Smalltalk]]. EIES-2 used the [[X.400]] database standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts were available to the public for a monthly fee of USD $75 plus connect-time charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In his book [[The Virtual Community]], [[Howard Rheingold]] called EIES "the lively great-great-grandmother of all virtual communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/hlr/vcbook/vcbook4.html|title=The Virtual Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIES was one of the earliest instances of [[groupware]], if not the earliest, and some users contend it is where the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/GroupWare|title=GroupWare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the [[Whole Earth Software Catalog]] set up a private conference on EIES where they could collaborate on software reviews from around the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SNFpgX_WigC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131|title=From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with serious research, there were diversions like the "EIES Soap Opera", which was a series of stories written collaboratively by the service's users. The first soap opera was initiated in 1980 by [[Martin Nisenholtz]].&lt;ref name="ChangeLife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/computer_networking.php|title=Computer Networking Can Change Your Life|quote=My worklife, homelife and communications life melded together.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working groups from different corporations used EIES to collaborate, some working exclusively from home. EIES gave an early glimpse of the challenges of [[work–life balance]]&lt;ref name="ChangeLife" /&gt; and pointed the way toward [[hypertext]] and [[gamification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz|quote=Gaming takes on a new dimension when it is possible for players in the game to participate asynchronously and it also becomes possible to replicate realistic communication constraints. We have explored and documented the benefits of this type of gaming in the management educational environment. Further work will be oriented, not only towards education, but also towards the possibility of gaming as a decision analysis tool.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable users included [[Alvin Toffler]], Peter &amp; Trudy Johnson-Lenz, [[Barry Wellman]], and Whole Earth editor-in-chief [[Stewart Brand]], who was influenced by EIES to develop [[The WELL]]. At its peak EIES had more than 2000 subscribers from various government agencies, large corporations and educational institutions. The [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]] ran a private conference called the ''School of Management and Strategic Studies'', of which [[Harlan Cleveland]] was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[legacy system]] lacking support for [[multimedia]] or [[Email attachment|file attachments]], EIES was shut down in 2000, despite NJIT's inability to locate a replacement with equivalent performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |title=EIES/VC Phaseout |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802212954/http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |archivedate=August 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its shutdown, EIES-2 held 6 GB of stored data, and could serve 1,000 concurrent users with an average response time of under 15 seconds.

The '''Etching Revival''' is the re-emergence and invigoration of [[etching]] as an original form of [[printmaking]] during a period of time stretching approximately from 1850 to 1930.

==Historical outline==
During the century after [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt's]] death the techniques of etching and [[drypoint]] brought to their highest point by him gradually declined. By the late eighteenth century, with brilliant exceptions like [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], most etchings were reproductive or illustrative.

However, in the 1840s and 50's in France, a number of artists did produce some landscape etchings which seemed to recapture some of the spirit of the [[Old Master print]]. [[Daubigny]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and especially [[Charles Jacque]] produced etchings that were different from those heavily worked reproductive plates of the previous century.

Several people were of special importance to the French Etching Revival. The publisher [[Alfred Cadart]],&lt;ref name="Oxford 359"&gt;Martin Kemp (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=95J-ppmZmt8C&amp;pg=PA359 ''The Oxford History of Western Art''], Oxford University Press (2000), p. 359, {{ISBN|0-19-860012-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the printer Auguste Delâtre, and [[Maxime Lalanne]], an etcher who wrote a popular textbook of etching in 1866, established the broad contours of the movement. Cadart founded the ''Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; des Aquafortistes'' in 1862, reviving the awareness of the beautiful, original etching in the minds of the collecting public.&lt;ref name="Oxford 359" /&gt; [[Charles Méryon]] was an early inspiration, and close collaborator with Delâtre, laying out the various possible techniques of modern etching and producing works that would be ranked with Rembrandt and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;van Breda, Jacobus. "Charles Meryon: Paper and Ink," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 3 No. 3 (September-October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Treatise on Etching'' by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880. It played a significant role in the Etching Revival in America. However, before the translation of Lalanne's book, [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton]] had become an enthusiastic promoter of etching in Britain. His ''Etching and Etchers'' (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled ''[[The Portfolio]]'', that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.[[File:Zaandam2.jpg|thumb|''Zaandam by [[James MacNeill Whistler]], c.1889]]

For Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was [[Francis Seymour Haden]], the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one the highpoints of etching history. Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.

It was Whistler who convinced the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], one of the members of the French Revival, to come to England as a teacher. This linking of the art of the two countries, though short-lived, did much to validate etching as an art form. Very soon, French etching would show the same modernist signs that French art showed generally, while English and American etching remained true to the kind of technical proficiency and subject matter artists revered in Rembrandt. One distinct aspect of the revival, in contrast with the Old Master period, was an interest in giving unique qualities to each impression of a print.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury, Sara. "Giving a Good Impression: B.J.O. Nordfeldt's Inscribed Etchings," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 7 No. 2 (July-August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall in popularity==
Etching as a collected and therefore as a practised art appears to have died with the [[Great Depression]]. Without a large group of collectors many artists returned to their canvases. Etchings fell hugely in value until the 1980s when a new market (albeit a small one) began to develop for what is now seen as a small but important tributary of the stream of 19th- and 20th-century art.

'''Ethnozoology''' is the study of the past and present interrelationships between [[human culture]]s  and the [[animal]]s in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml Ethnozoology Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508024045/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes classification and naming of zoological forms, cultural knowledge and use of wild and domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson,  Leslie Main. Ethnobiology - Traditional Biological Knowledge in Contemporary Global Context.  Anthropology 491 study guide,  Athabasca University 2002. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the main subdisciplines of [[ethnobiology]] and shares many methodologies and theoretical frameworks with [[ethnobotany]].

Ethnozoology is the study of human and animal interaction. Ethnobiology includes ethnobotany, which concerns the study of human-plant relationships and ethnozoology. Ethnozoology focuses explicitly on human-animal relationships and knowledge humans have acquired concerning the Earth's fauna. Ethnozoological study concerns the significance of this knowledge to our understanding of the roles played by animals in human society. Faunal resources play a variety of roles in human life throughout history, and their importance to human beings is not only utilitarian but cultural, religious, artistic, and philosophical. Ethnozoology can be understood broadly, from ecological, cognitive, and symbolic perspectives. Human knowledge about natural faunal resources entails sensing, recognizing, classifying, living things. Ethnozoology is a discipline that connects scientific methods to traditional systems of knowledge and cultural beliefs.

== Conservation ==
In a broader context, ethnozoology and its companion discipline, ethnobotany, contribute to the larger science of [[ethnobiology]]. The history of ethnobiology is divided into three periods. The pre-classical period, which began around 1860, focused on collecting information about humans' use of resources, while the classical period, which began in 1954, produced anthropological studies on [[linguistics]] and biological classifications. The current period, or post-classical period, has been described as a meeting of [[social science]] and the study of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Alves2012&gt;Alves, R. (2012). Relationships between fauna and people and the role of ethnozoology in animal conservation. Ethnobiology and Conservation, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the profound human influence on faunal biodiversity, wildlife conservation planning is becoming increasingly urgent. It is widely acknowledged that environmental health is important to human health, and [[biodiversity loss]] can have both indirect and direct negative effects on human wellbeing. The close link between human health and ecological/faunal health is substantiated with five important concepts: animals cause and disseminate disease for humans and vice versa, animals can be guards of human health, animals are used in traditional medicine practices throughout the world, animals are a source of drugs and treatments in human diseases, and animals are used in medical research.&lt;ref name=Alves2012/&gt;

== The social sciences ==

=== Sociology ===

[[Sociology]] has been slow to explore ethnozoology and grant it credibility.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003&gt;Arluke, A. (2003). Ethnozoology and the future of sociology. International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 23(3), 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ethnozoology is important because policy makers and concerned citizens are too often left to be informed only by animal advocates or biomedical researchers, both of which are inherently biased. Animals provide humans with a better understanding of ourselves, and how we think and act toward animals has the potential to reveal our attitudes toward other people and social order. Evidence of this can be seen in the ways that animal images may at times be expressing underlying racism: "the most damning testimony given by accused police at the [[Rodney King]] trial involved characterization of King as a 'gorilla'; during the Gulf War Saddam Hussein was described in the American press as a 'rat'; and the actions of people in the Los Angeles riots were likened by the media commentators to 'packs of vicious animals'".&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt;

Sociology is a science concerned with groups and group formation, including those facing structural and interpersonal oppression, suffering, and vulnerability. Sub-fields in this area include [[African-American studies|African Americans studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[gay/lesbian studies]]. However, not much attention or legitimacy is awarded animal studies as a sub-field. Modern use of animals in the developed world, especially in the United States, can be characterized by exploitation, domination, and oppression.&lt;ref name=Irvine&gt;Irvine, L. (2008). Animals and sociology. Sociology Compass, 2(6), 1954–1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal cruelty and abuse is not only present in the industrial farming of livestock, but also in such circumstances as dog fighting, cow tipping, horse racing, circus acts, and other entertainment industries and practices. Furthermore, animals are often victims and pawns used in domestic violence. The widespread abuse of animals in modern society is important for sociology because it involves an entrenched assumption about the connection between cruelty toward animals and violence directed and human beings. Some research has even suggested ways in which the human-animal interaction can challenge dominant sociological theories about the self.&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

=== Anthropology ===
[[Anthropology]] has done more to study ethnozoology in terms of the history of the function of animals in non-industrialized societies and the role that animals play symbolically and religiously in different cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt; The [[domestication]] process has been a chief concern for anthropologists, whose interests are in the history of human desire to understand animals, enslave them, and harness their power. Animal-derived products have been used especially for food, but also for clothing, tools, toys, and for medicinal and magic-religious purposes. Many cultures associate strong supernatural powers between the animal and human worlds, including mythologies and connections with totemic, ancestral, or magical animals and animal-gods.&lt;ref&gt;Alves, R. R., Rosa, I. L., Neto, N. A. L., &amp; Voeks, R. (2012). Animals for the gods: Magical and religious faunal use and trade in Brazil. Human Ecology, 40(5), 751-780.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax2001&gt;Sax, B. (2001). The mythical zoo. An Encyclopedia of Animals in World Myth, Legend and Folklore.Santa Barbara, CA: ABC Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals are given symbolic meaning, as in the western association of [[black cat]]s with poor luck.&lt;ref name=Sax2001/&gt; Biological knowledge varies according to cultural and traditional knowledge and experiences. People share a basic way of comprehending the natural world based on common [[evolution]]ary history, and this foundation connects scientific biology with its historical roots in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary perspective on human cognition and affect indicates some degree of universality in perception and decision-making with regard to the natural world and its fauna. The interaction between these aspects of [[psychology]], [[biodiversity]] of the Earth's wildlife, and the unique social, cultural, and economic contexts within which humans interact and develop produces [[cultural diversity]]. Paleoanthropological studies suggest that linguistic approaches to ethnobiology have only recently evolved in the context of human history,&lt;ref&gt;Hunn, E. (2007). Ethnobiology in four phases. Journal of Ethnobiology, 27(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that these linguistic approaches only provide a partial understanding to how humans perceive and engage with the natural world around them.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S. (2006). Ethnobiology and the evolution of the human mind. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 12(s1), S45-S61.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flavonoids''' (or '''bioflavonoids''') (from the Latin word ''flavus'' meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of [[plant]] and [[fungus]] [[secondary metabolite]]s.

Chemically, flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two [[phenyl]] rings (A and B) and a heterocyclic ring (C). This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6. According to the [[IUPAC]] nomenclature,&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;
{{Citation |title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |edition=2 |last=McNaught |first=Alan D |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Andrew | author3=IUPAC |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |place=Oxford |year=1997 |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02424.html |doi=10.1351/goldbook.F02424 |isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7}}

they can be classified into:
*''flavonoids'' or ''bioflavonoids''
*''[[isoflavonoid]]s'', derived from 3-phenyl[[chromone|chromen-4-one]] (3-phenyl-1,4-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure
*''[[neoflavonoids]]'', derived from 4-phenyl[[coumarine]] (4-phenyl-1,2-[[benzopyran|benzopyrone]]) structure

The three flavonoid classes above are all [[ketone]]-containing compounds, and as such, are [[anthoxanthin]]s ([[flavone]]s and [[flavonol]]s). This class was the first to be termed ''bioflavonoids''. The terms ''flavonoid'' and ''bioflavonoid'' have also been more loosely used to describe non-ketone polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds which are more specifically termed flav'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'''noids.  The three cycle or heterocycles in the flavonoid backbone are generally called ring A, B and C. Ring A usually shows a [[phloroglucinol]] substitution pattern.

{{Main|Flavonoid biosynthesis}}

==Functions of flavonoids in plants==
Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants, fulfilling many functions.  Flavonoids are the most important [[Biological pigment|plant pigment]]s for flower coloration, producing yellow or red/blue pigmentation in petals designed to attract [[pollinator]] animals.  In higher plants, flavonoids are involved in UV filtration, symbiotic nitrogen fixation and floral pigmentation.  They may also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and cell cycle inhibitors.  Flavonoids secreted by the root of their host plant help ''[[Rhizobia]]'' in the infection stage of their [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with legumes like peas, beans, clover, and soy. Rhizobia living in soil are able to sense the flavonoids and this triggers the secretion of [[Nod factor]]s, which in turn are recognized by the host plant and can lead to root hair deformation and several cellular responses such as ion fluxes and the formation of a [[root nodule]].  In addition, some flavonoids have inhibitory activity against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g. ''Fusarium oxysporum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phytol.2007.10.001|title=Flavonoids from carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) and their antifungal activity|year=2008|last1=Galeotti|first1=F|last2=Barile|first2=E|last3=Curir|first3=P|last4=Dolci|first4=M|last5=Lanzotti|first5=V|journal=Phytochemistry Letters|volume=1|pages=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been characterized from various plants. They have been classified according to their chemical structure, and are usually subdivided into the following subgroups (for further reading see&lt;ref name="Ververidis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ververidis F, Trantas E, Douglas C, Vollmer G, Kretzschmar G, Panopoulos N | title = Biotechnology of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived natural products.

Biological and pharmacological activities which have been investigated in greater depth are described below.

===Antioxidant===

Research at the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] shows that flavonoids are poorly absorbed in the human body (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed being quickly metabolized and excreted.&lt;ref name="EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies NDA2, 3 European Food Safety Authority EFSA, Parma, Italy 2010 1489"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lotito SB, Frei B | title = Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and increased plasma antioxidant capacity in humans: cause, consequence, or epiphenomenon? | journal = Free Radic.

===Inflammation===
[[Inflammation]] has been implicated as a possible origin of numerous local and systemic diseases, such as [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravishankar D, Rajora AK, Greco F, Osborn HM | title = Flavonoids as prospective compounds for anti-cancer therapy | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 45 | issue = 12 | pages = 2821–2831 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24128857 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cardiovascular disorders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manach C, Mazur A, Scalbert A | title = Polyphenols and prevention of cardiovascular diseases | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15650567 | doi = 10.1097/00041433-200502000-00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diabetes mellitus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Babu PV, Liu D, Gilbert ER | title = Recent advances in understanding the anti-diabetic actions of dietary flavonoids | journal = The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 1777–1789 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24029069 | pmc = 3821977 | doi = 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.06.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferretti G, Bacchetti T, Masciangelo S, Saturni L | title = Celiac Disease, Inflammation and Oxidative Damage: A Nutrigenetic Approach | journal = Nutrients | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 243–257 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22606367 | pmc = 3347005 | doi = 10.3390/nu4040243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary studies indicate that flavonoids may affect [[anti-inflammatory]] mechanisms via their ability to inhibit [[reactive oxygen]] or [[reactive nitrogen|nitrogen]] compounds.&lt;ref name="izzi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Izzi V, Masuelli L, Tresoldi I, Sacchetti P, Modesti A, Galvano F, Bei R | title = The effects of dietary flavonoids on the regulation of redox inflammatory networks | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 2396–2418 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22652788 | doi = 10.2741/4061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flavonoids have also been proposed to inhibit the pro-inflammatory activity of [[enzymes]] involved in [[free radical]] production, such as [[cyclooxygenase]], [[lipoxygenase]] or [[inducible nitric oxide synthase]],&lt;ref name=izzi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomes A, Couto D, Alves A, Dias I, Freitas M, Porto G, Duarte JA, Fernandes E | title = Trihydroxyflavones with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy | journal = BioFactors | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 378–386 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22806885 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/biof.1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to modify intracellular [[signaling pathways]] in [[immune cells]],&lt;ref name=izzi/&gt; or in brain cells after a stroke.&lt;ref name="pmid24741667"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang CF, Cho S, Wang J | title = (-)-Epicatechin protects hemorrhagic brain via synergistic Nrf2 pathways | journal = Ann Clin Transl Neurol. | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 258–271 |date=Apr 2014 | pmid = 24741667 | doi =10.1002/acn3.54 | pmc=3984761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Procyanidins]], a class of flavonoids, have been shown in preliminary research to have anti-inflammatory mechanisms including modulation of the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway, inhibition of [[gene transcription]], [[gene expression|expression]] and activity of inflammatory enzymes, as well as secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Micaelo N, González-Abuín N, Ardèvol A, Pinent M, Blay MT | title = Procyanidins and inflammation: Molecular targets and health implications | journal = BioFactors | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–265 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22505223 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/biof.1019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
[[Clinical trial|Clinical]] studies investigating the relationship between flavonoid consumption and cancer prevention/development are conflicting for most types of cancer, probably because most studies are [[retrospective]] in design and use a small [[Sample size determination|sample size]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romagnolo DF, Selmin OI | title = Flavonoids and cancer prevention: a review of the evidence | journal = J Nutr Gerontol Geriatr | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–38 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22888839 | doi = 10.1080/21551197.2012.702534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two apparent exceptions are [[gastric carcinoma]] and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]]-related cancers.

===Antibacterial===
Flavonoids have been shown to have (a) direct [[antibacterial]] activity, (b) [[synergistic]] activity with [[antibiotics]], and (c) the ability to suppress bacterial [[virulence factors]] in numerous ''[[in vitro]]'' and a limited number of ''[[in vivo]]'' studies.&lt;ref name="pmid21514796" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19844590"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor PW, Hamilton-Miller JM, Stapleton PD | title = Antimicrobial properties of green tea catechins | journal = Food Science and Technology Bulletin | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 71–81 | year = 2005 | pmid = 19844590 | pmc = 2763290 | doi = 10.1616/1476-2137.14184 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763290/pdf/nihms-1032.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy among the ''[[in vivo]]'' studies&lt;ref name="pmid17391908 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi O, Yahiro K, Morinaga N, Miyazaki M, Noda M | title = Inhibitory effects of various plant polyphenols on the toxicity of Staphylococcal alpha-toxin | journal = Microbial Pathogenesis | volume =  42| issue = 5–6 | pages = 215–224 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17391908 | doi = 10.1016/j.micpath.2007.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20512479"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh DR, Kim JR, Kim YR | title = Genistein inhibits Vibrio vulnificus adhesion and cytotoxicity to HeLa cells | journal = Archives of Pharmacal Research | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 787–792 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20512479 | doi = 10.1007/s12272-010-0520-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18600388"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Segovia R, Quintanar JL, Salinas E, Ceballos-Salazar R, Aviles-Jiménez F, Torres-López J | title = Effect of the flavonoid quercetin on inflammation and lipid peroxidation induced by Helicobacter pylori in gastric mucosa of guinea pig | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–447 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18600388 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-008-2184-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the finding that oral [[quercetin]] protects [[guinea pigs]] against the [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid18600388" /&gt;  Researchers from the [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]]  have speculated this may be one reason why dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced [[gastric carcinoma]] risk in European women.&lt;ref name="pmid23076618"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zamora-Ros R, Agudo A, Luján-Barroso L, Romieu I, Ferrari P, Knaze V, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Leenders M, Travis RC, Navarro C, Sánchez-Cantalejo E, Slimani N, Scalbert A, Fedirko V, Hjartåker A, Engeset D, Skeie G, Boeing H, Förster J, Li K, Teucher B, Agnoli C, Tumino R, Mattiello A, Saieva C, Johansson I, Stenling R, Redondo ML, Wallström P, Ericson U, Khaw KT, Mulligan AA, Trichopoulou A, Dilis V, Katsoulis M, Peeters PH, Igali L, Tjønneland A, Halkjær J, Touillaud M, Perquier F, Fagherazzi G, Amiano P, Ardanaz E, Bredsdorff L, Overvad K, Ricceri F, Riboli E, González CA | title = Dietary flavonoid and lignan intake and gastric adenocarcinoma risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 1398–1408 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23076618 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.037358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional ''[[in vivo]]'' and [[Clinical trial|clinical]] research is needed to determine if flavonoids could be used as [[pharmaceutical drug]]s for the treatment of bacterial infection, or whether dietary flavonoid intake offers any protection against infection.

== Synthesis, detection, quantification, and semi-synthetic alterations ==

=== Color spectrum ===
Flavonoid synthesis in plants is induced by light color spectrums at both high and low energy radiations. Low energy radiations are accepted by [[phytochrome]], while high energy radiations are accepted by [[carotenoid]]s, [[Flavin group|flavins]], [[cryptochrome]]s in addition to phytochromes. The [[Photomorphogenesis|photomorphogenic]] process of phytochome-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in [[Amaranth|''Amaranthus'']], [[barley]], [[maize]], ''[[Sorghum]]'' and [[turnip]]. Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Plant Physiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=03S6VbTjCmUC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780849317149|language = en|first = Rajiv Kumar|last = Sinha|page = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantification ===
Lamaison and Carnet have designed a test for the determination of the total flavonoid content of a sample (AlCI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; method). After proper mixing of the sample and the reagent, the mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and the absorbance of the solution is read at 440&amp;nbsp;nm. Flavonoid content is expressed in mg/g of quercetin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lamaison, JL  |author2=Carnet, A |title=Teneurs en principaux flavonoides des fleurs de Cratageus monogyna Jacq et de Cratageus Laevigata (Poiret D.C) en Fonction de la vegetation|journal=Plantes Medicinales Phytotherapie|year= 1991|volume =25| pages= 12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

Toll |title=Proposed Fountain of Youth Monument to the 72nd Congress |url=http://www.npshistory.com/publications/proposed-parks/fl-fountain-of-youth-nm.pdf |pages=6–7 |quote=Presumably, Ponce de Leon's first landing was north of St. Augustine and south of Jacksonville. The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Clark|title=A Concise History of Florida|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBl3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-62585-153-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

The GC box is upstream of the [[TATA box]] and approximately 110 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site.

The GC elements are bound by transcription factors and have similar functions to enhancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Klug WS, Cummings MR, Spencer CA, Palladina MA |title= Concepts of Genetics |edition= Ninth|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-54098-0|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some known GC box-binding proteins include Sp1, Krox/Egr, Wilms' tumor, MIGI, and CREA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The GC box is commonly the binding site for [[Zinc finger]] proteins. An [[Alpha helix]] section of the protein corresponds with a major groove in the DNA. Zinc-fingers bind to triplet base pair sequences, with residue 21 binding to the first base pair, residue 18 binding to the second base pair, and residue 15 binding to the third base pair. The triplet base pairs can either be a GGG or a GCG. If residue 18 is a histidine, it will bind to a G, and if residue 18 is a glutamic acid, it will bind to a C. GC box-binding zinc-finger have between 2 and 4 fingers, making them interact with base pair sequences that are 6 to 8 base pairs in length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Geometric complexity theory (GCT)''', is a research program in [[computational complexity theory]] proposed by [[Ketan Mulmuley]] and Milind Sohoni. The goal of the program is to answer the most famous open problem in computer science – [[P versus NP problem|whether P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP]] – by showing that the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]] is not equal to the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]].

The idea behind the approach is to adopt and develop advanced tools in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[representation theory]] (i.e., [[geometric invariant theory]]) to prove lower bounds for problems. Currently the main focus of the program is on [[Arithmetic circuit complexity#Algebraic P and NP|algebraic complexity]] classes. Proving that [[computing the permanent]] cannot be efficiently [[Reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to computing [[determinant]]s is considered to be a major milestone for the program. These computational problems can be characterized by their [[symmetry (mathematics)|symmetries]]. The program aims at utilizing these symmetries for proving lower bounds.

The approach is considered by some to be the only viable currently active program to separate [[P (complexity)|P]] from [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. However, [[Ketan Mulmuley]] believes the program, if viable, is likely to take about 100 years before it can settle the [[P vs. NP]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The program is pursued by several researchers in mathematics and theoretical computer science. Part of the reason for the interest in the program is the existence of arguments for the program avoiding known barriers such as [[Oracle machine|relativization]] and [[natural proof]]s for proving general lower bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulmuley|first=Ketan D.|date=2011-04-01|title=On P vs. NP and geometric complexity theory: Dedicated to Sri Ramakrishna|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1944345.1944346|journal=Journal of the ACM|volume=58|issue=2|pages=5|doi=10.1145/1944345.1944346|issn=0004-5411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science''''' is a 1994 book by [[biologist]] [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[mathematician]] [[Norman Levitt]].

==Summary==
Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the "academic left" from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals.

==Reception and influence==
The book inspired the 1996 [[Sokal affair|Sokal hoax]], in which [[Alan Sokal]] published a bogus paper to a [[postmodernist]] journal that did not [[Peer review|peer-review]] submissions.&lt;ref name="postmodernism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |date=2007-04-01 |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Postmodernism Disrobed |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120082759/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about ''Higher Superstition'', he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levit criticized that they were describing them fairly in "about 80 percent of the cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Anatomy-of-a-Hoax/238728?key=bB4GOexLsAk2KfnFOkgPCI0O5azbXR52m3YJxfcw-igptJkoKi_rn3RCDgSQfq6pc3g5NWVSMTIzSXBPNlRyc3YyVnBuczlCYV82MUNMWXdMY2gxYnNKdEN4NA|title=Bait and Switch: How the physicist Alan Sokal hoodwinked a group of humanists and why, 20 years later, it still matters.|first=Jennifer |last=Ruark |date=1 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">The '''history of scholarship''' is the historical study of [[fields of study]] which are not covered by the English term "science" (cf., [[history of science]]), but are covered by, for example, the German term "[[Wissenschaft]]" (i.e., all kinds of academic studies). Examples are the history of classical studies, the history of the study of religions, of philosophy, of Biblical studies, of historiography, of the study of music, arts etc. It is a field which has recently undergone a complete renewal and is now a major branch of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ligota, C.

Rudolph Pfeiffer (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Rudolph (1968). History of Classical Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age.  Oxford University Press. (Oxford University Press academic monograph reprints). &lt;/ref&gt; describes the history of classical scholarship from its revival inspired by Petrarch to the achievements of the Italian humanists and the idependent movement in Holland (including Erasmus) and the German scholar-reformers. Pfeiffer traces the development of classical scholarship in the countries of Western Europe through the next two Centuries, with particular attention to sixteenth-century France and eighteenth-century England. Finally he provides an account of the new approach made by Winckelmann and his successors in Germany.

The word [[scientist]] was coined by the English philosopher and historian of science [[William Whewell]] in 1833.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Until then there was no differentiation between the [[history of science]], the [[history of philosophy]] and the history of scholarship. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Before 1700 the fields of scholarship were not of a size that made academic specialisation necessary.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Academic discipline]]s as we know them today did not exist.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In general scholars were both scientists and scholars in what today is termed [[Arts]] and [[Humanities]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">'''IEC 61162''' is a collection of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards for "Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship".

The 61162 standards are developed in Working Group 6 (WG6) of Technical Committee 80 (TC80) of the IEC.

==Sections of IEC 61162==
Standard ''IEC 61162'' is divided into four parts:
* Part 1: Single talker and multiple listeners (Also known as [[NMEA 0183]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design challenges and decisions for a new ship data network|url=http://www.mits-forum.org/resources/lwe-paper-isis-v9.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 2: Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission
* Part 3: Serial data instrument network (Also known as [[NMEA 2000]])
* Part 450:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners–Ethernet interconnection (Also known as Lightweight Ethernet)
* Part 460:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners - Ethernet interconnection - Safety and security
 
The 61162 standards are all concerning the transport of [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] sentences, but the IEC
does not define any of these. This is left to the [http://www.nmea.org/ NMEA Organization].

==IEC 61162-1==
Single talker and multiple listeners
is an international standard

==IEC 61162-2==
Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission

==IEC 61162-3==
Serial data instrument network

==IEC 61162-450==
Multiple talkers Multiple listeners

This subgroup of TC80/WG6 has specified the use of Ethernet for shipboard navigational networks. The
specification describes the transport of NMEA sentences as defined in 61162-1 over IPv4. Due to
the low amount of protocol complexity it has been nicknamed Lightweight Ethernet or LWE in short.

The historical background and justification for LWE was presented at the ISIS2011 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Ø.J. Rødseth, et al. "Overview of the IEC 61162-450 “Light Weight Ethernet” Ship Bridge Data Network", ISIS2011&lt;/ref&gt; An overview article of LWE was
given in the December issue of "Digital Ship"&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Christensen, et al. ''Lightweight Ethernet - a new standard for shipbord networks" [http://issuu.com/mortenjc/docs/digital_ship_december_2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was published in the first edition 06/2011 . The second edition is in progress(state 05/2016). 

==IEC 61162-460==
IEC 61162-460:2015(E) is an add-on to the IEC 61162-450 standard where higher safety and security standards are needed, e.g. due to higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity. This standard provides requirements and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection from the network to other networks. This standard also contains requirements for a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This standard extends the informative guidance given in Annex D of IEC 61162-450:2011. It does not introduce new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450. 

The first edition was published in 08/2015.

==Security==

ICONICS works to prevent the multitude of possible security threats against process control networks. These include [[malware]], [[denial of service]], [[phishing]], [[password cracking]], [[SQL injection]] and [[man-in-the-middle scenarios]].

ICONICS systems are in use at some of the most secure Defense Department applications, both for the US Department of Defense, and those of other nations. ICONICS software products also are routinely installed in FDA regulated sites, regulated utility and national grid installations and in other critical infrastructure. These applications require the products to be designed for, and tested to, rigid requirements.

ICONICS uses features such as encryption, certificate authentication, user and system encrypted passwords, and obfuscation to provide the highest level of security demanded of today’s systems. Equally important, the company makes the system extremely flexible for the system administrator, so that all system-to-system and system-to-client interface parameters can be adjusted to work within a customer’s secure infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;https://iconics.com/Site/Basic-Lead-Form.aspx?&amp;SourceCode=Web%20Whitepaper%20Secure%20HMI&amp;Subject=Highly%20Secure%20HMI%20SCADA%20and%20Automation%20Systems%20Whitepaper&amp;FileURL=~/Production/media/Literature/Whitepapers/Highly-Secure-HMI-SCADA-and-Automation-Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its own security-focused efforts, ICONICS has a working relationship with [[Bedrock Automation]], based in San Jose, California, to identify and prevent cyber security threats within industrial control systems. ICONICS utilizes an authentication method within its GENESIS64™ HMI/SCADA and building automation software suite via a control system root of trust provided through Bedrock Automation. ICONICS developers can generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) to be signed by the Bedrock Certificate Authority (CA). These electronic certificates provide users with signed and encrypted communication between their Bedrock control system and their HMI and SCADA applications.&lt;ref&gt;https://iconics.com/Site/News/Page.aspx?&amp;News=ICONICS%20Utilizes%20Bedrock%20Automation%20Root%20of%20Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Law''' (born 16 May 1946),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Law, John, 1946- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n91117383.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 13 February 2015 |quote= data sheet (b. 5/16/46) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociologist currently on the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [[Open University]] and key proponent of [[Actor-network theory]]. Actor-network theory, sometimes abbreviated to ANT, is a social science approach for describing and explaining social, organisational, scientific and technological structures, processes and events. It assumes that all the components of such structures (whether these are human or otherwise) form a network of relations that can be mapped and described in the same terms or vocabulary.

Developed by two leading French [[Science and technology studies|STS]] scholars, [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], Law himself, and others, ANT may alternatively be described as a 'material-semiotic' method. ANT strives to map relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and 'semiotic' (between concepts), for instance, the interactions in a bank involve both people and their ideas, and computers. Together these form a single network.

Professor John Law is one of the directors of the [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]] funded [[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]].

They grow on rock, walls, [[gravestones]], [[Roof|roofs]], exposed soil surfaces, and in the soil as part of a [[biological soil crust]]. Different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: [[arctic tundra]], hot dry [[desert]]s, [[Rocky coast|rocky coasts]], and toxic [[slag]] heaps. They can even live inside solid rock, growing between the grains.

==Pronunciation and etymology==
In American English, "lichen" is pronounced the same as the verb "liken" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|k|ən}}). In British English, both this pronunciation and one rhyming with "kitchen" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|tʃ|ən}}) are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/mind-your-language/8757911/lichen/ |title=Lichen |date=17 November 2012 |publisher=spectator.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/1992/4-29-1992/lichen.html |title=Lichens – Horticulture and Home Pest News |publisher=iastate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lichen |title=Lichen |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2014-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English ''lichen'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λειχήν}} ''leichēn'' ("tree moss, lichen, lichen-like eruption on skin") via [[Latin]] {{lang|la|lichen}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|lichen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|lichen|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|leixh/n|λειχήν|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek noun, which literally means "licker", derives from the verb {{lang|grc|λείχειν}} ''leichein'', "to lick".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lei/xw|λείχειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Robert S.

== Growth forms ==
{{Main|Lichen growth forms}}
Lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms ([[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]). The shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; The nonreproductive tissues, or vegetative body parts, is called the '''thallus'''. Lichens are grouped by thallus type, since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen. Thallus growth forms typically correspond to a few basic internal structure types. [[List of common names of lichen genera|Common names for lichens]] often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen [[genus]].

Common groupings of lichen thallus growth forms are:
# [[fruticose lichen|fruticose]]&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; – growing like a tuft or multiple-branched leafless mini-shrub, upright or hanging down, 3-dimensional branches with nearly round cross section ([[terete]]) or flattened
# [[foliose lichen|foliose]]&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; – growing in 2-dimensional, flat, leaf-like lobes
# [[crustose lichen|crustose]]&lt;ref name=ANBGLG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm |title=Lichen Glossary |last=Galloway |first=D.J. |date=13 May 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206070827/http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm |archive-date=6 December 2014 |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; – crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface ([[substrate (biology)|substrate]]) like a thick coat of paint
# [[Squamulose lichen|squamulose]]&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; – formed of small leaf-like scales crustose below but free at the tips
# [[Leprose lichen|leprose]]&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; – powdery
# [[Gelatinous lichen|gelatinous]] – jelly like
# [[filamentous lichen|filamentous]] – stringy or like matted hair
# [[Byssoid lichen|byssoid]] – wispy, like [[teased wool]]
# structureless

There are variations in growth types in a single lichen species, grey areas between the growth type descriptions, and overlapping between growth types, so some authors might describe lichens using different growth type descriptions.

When a crustose lichen gets old, the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint, old-broken asphalt paving, or like the polygonal "islands" of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed. This is called being [[rimose]] or [[areolate]], and the "island" pieces separated by the cracks are called [[areola (lichen)|areolas]].&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; The areolas appear separated, but are (or were){{citation needed|date=October 2014}} connected by an underlying "prothallus" or "hypothallus".&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; When a crustose lichen grows from a center and appears to radiate out, it is called [[crustose placodioid lichen|crustose placodioid]]. When the edges of the areolas lift up from the substrate, it is called [[squamulose]].&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}}&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;

These growth form groups are not precisely defined. Foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose. Fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy. Squamulose lichens may appear where the edges lift up. Gelatinous lichens may appear leafy when dry.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below.

Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} The thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is most visually noticeable. Some lichens can grow ''inside'' solid rock between the grains ([[endolithic lichen]]s), with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; These may be dramatic in color or appearance.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories.&lt;ref name="LNAILV"&gt;Lichen Vocabulary, Lichens of North America Information, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The most visually noticeable reproductive parts are often circular, raised, plate-like or disc-like outgrowths, with crinkly edges, and are described in sections below.

=== Color ===
Lichens come in many colors.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} Coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component.&lt;ref name=MSULB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/course/bot/423/Plntlist8mosslichen.html|title=Lichens and Bryophytes, Michigan State University, 10-25-99|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special pigments, such as yellow [[usnic acid]], give lichens a variety of colors, including reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, especially in exposed, dry habitats.&lt;ref name=SJCL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saguaro-juniper.com/i_and_i/lichens/lichens.html|title=Lichens, Saguaro-Juniper Corporation|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of special pigments, lichens are usually bright green to olive gray when wet, gray or grayish-green to brown when dry.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; This is because moisture causes the surface skin ([[cortex (lichen)|cortex]]) to become more transparent, exposing the green photobiont layer.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; Different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces, or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors "come to life" or "glow" in brilliant displays following rain.

Different colored lichens may inhabit different adjacent sections of a rock face, depending on the angle of exposure to light.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places, such as the [[Lichens of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)#On rock|vertical "paint"]] covering the vast rock faces of [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref name=LSN/&gt;

Color is used in identification.&lt;ref name="JJMML"&gt;Michigan Lichens, Julie Jones Medlin, B. Jain Publishers, 1996, {{ISBN|0877370397}}, 9780877370390, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Jo0yP2-69UC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Color changes depending on when a lichen is wet or dry.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt; Color descriptions when used for identification are based on when the lichen is dry.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt; Dry lichens with a cyanobacterium as the photosynthetic partner tend to be dark grey, brown, or black.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt;

The underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side ([[dorsiventral]]), often brown or black, sometimes white. A fruticose lichen may have flattened "branches", appearing similar to a foiliose lichen, but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the ''same'' color as the top side. The leaf-like lobes of a foliose lichen may branch, giving the appearance of a fruticose lichen, but the underside will be a ''different'' color from the top side.&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt;

The sheen on some jelly-like gelatinous lichens is from [[mucilaginous]] secretions.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt;

=== Internal structure and growth forms ===
[[File:Hyella caespitosa.jpg|thumb|right|The cyanobacterium ''Hyella caespitosa'' with fungal hyphae in the lichen ''Pyrenocollema halodytes'']]
A lichen consists of a simple photosynthesizing organism, usually a [[green alga]] or [[cyanobacterium]], surrounded by filaments of a fungus. Generally, most of a lichen's bulk is made of interwoven fungal filaments,&lt;ref name="LMM"&gt;Lichens: More on Morphology, University of California Museum of Paleontology, [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenmm.html]&lt;/ref&gt; although in filamentous and gelatinous lichens&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; this is not the case. The fungus is called a '''mycobiont'''. The photosynthesizing organism is called a '''photobiont'''. Algal photobionts are called '''phycobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP&gt;[http://www.unomaha.edu/lichens/Bio%204350%20PDF/Photobionts.pdf Lichen Photobionts, University of Nebraska Omaha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006145803/http://www.unomaha.edu/lichens/Bio%204350%20PDF/Photobionts.pdf |date=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria photobionts are called '''cyanobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

The part of a lichen that is not involved in reproduction, the "body" or "vegetative tissue" of a lichen, is called the '''thallus'''. The thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately. The thallus is made up of filaments of the fungus called '''[[hyphae]]'''. The filaments grow by branching then rejoining to create a mesh, which is called being "[[Glossary of botanical terms|anastomose]]". The mesh of fungal filaments may be dense or loose.

Generally, the fungal mesh surrounds the algal or [[cyanobacterial]] cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues that are unique to lichen associations. The thallus may or may not have a protective "skin" of densely packed fungal filaments, often containing a second fungal species,&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309" /&gt; which is called a '''cortex.''' Fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the "branches". Foliose lichens have an upper cortex on the top side of the "leaf", and a separate lower cortex on the bottom side. Crustose and squamulose lichens have only an upper cortex, with the "inside" of the lichen in direct contact with the surface they grow on (the '''substrate'''). Even if the edges peel up from the substrate and appear flat and leaf-like, they lack a lower cortex, unlike foliose lichens. Filamentous, byssoid, leprose,&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; gelatinous, and other lichens do not have a cortex, which is called being [[ecorticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGGO/&gt;

[[File:Lichen Cross Section Diagram.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Schematic cross section of [[foliose lichen]]:&lt;br&gt;1. The [[cortex (lichen)|cortex]] is the outer layer of tightly woven fungus filaments ([[hyphae]]) 2. This photobiont layer has photosynthesizing [[green algae]]&lt;br&gt;3. Loosely packed hyphae in the medulla&lt;br&gt;4. A tightly woven lower cortex, with anchoring hyphae called [[rhizines]] where the fungus attaches to the substrate.]]
Fruticose, foliose, crustose, and squamulose lichens generally have up to three different types of tissue, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] by having different densities of fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The top layer, where the lichen contacts the environment, is called a '''cortex'''.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The cortex is made of densely tightly woven, packed, and glued together ([[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinated]]) fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The dense packing makes the cortex act like a protective "skin", keeping other organisms out, and reducing the intensity of sunlight on the layers below.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The cortex layer can be up to several hundred micrometers (μm) in thickness (less than a millimeter).&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; The cortex may be further topped by an epicortex of secretions, not cells, 0.6–1&amp;nbsp;μm thick in [[Parmeliaceae|some lichens]].&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; This secretion layer may or may not have pores.&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt;

Below the cortex layer is a layer called the '''photobiontic layer''' or '''symbiont layer'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments, with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, similar to the anatomy of a leaf.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by a [[haustorium]].&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; In crustose and foliose lichens, algae in the photobiontic layer are diffuse among the fungal filaments, decreasing in gradation into the layer below. In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt;

The layer beneath the symbiont layer called is called the '''[[medulla (lichenology)|medulla]]'''. The medulla is less densely packed with fungal filaments than the layers above. In foliose lichens, there is usually, as in ''[[Peltigera]]'',&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} another densely packed layer of fungal filaments called the lower cortex.&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt;&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Root-like fungal structures called '''rhizines''' ([[Hypogymnia|usually]])&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} grow from the lower cortex to attach or anchor the lichen to the substrate.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; Fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the "stems" and "branches".&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt; The medulla is the lowest layer, and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus, or it may be hollow.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Crustose and squamulose lichens lack a lower cortex, and the medulla is in direct contact with the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] that the lichen grows on.

In crustose areolate lichens, the edges of the areolas peel up from the substrate and appear leafy. In squamulose lichens the part of the lichen thallus that is not attached to the substrate may also appear leafy. But these leafy parts lack a lower cortex, which distinguishes crustose and squamulose lichens from foliose lichens.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Conversely, foliose lichens may appear flattened against the substrate like a crustose lichen, but most of the leaf-like lobes can be lifted up from the substrate because it is separated from it by a tightly packed lower cortex.&lt;ref name=ASLTT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/lichenthallustypes.html#foliose|title=Foliose lichens, Lichen Thallus Types, Allan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelatinous,&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} byssoid, and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are [[ecorticate]]), and generally have only undifferentiated tissue, similar to only having a symbiont layer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In lichens that include both green algal ''and'' cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called '''[[cephalodium|cephalodia]]'''.

'''[[Pruinia]]''' is a whitish coating on top of an upper surface.&lt;ref name=HPTCLGD/&gt; An '''[[epinecral layer]]''' is "a layer of horny dead fungal hyphae with indistinct [[lumen (anatomy)|lumina]] in or near the cortex above the algal layer".&lt;ref name=HPTCLGD&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3244302 |jstor=3244302 |title=Pruina as a Taxonomic Character in the Lichen Genus ''Dermatocarpon'' |journal=The Bryologist |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=315–320 |year=1996 |last1=Heiđmarsson |first1=Starri |last2=Heidmarsson |first2=Starri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, it was reported that macrolichens have more than one species of fungus in their tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309"/&gt;

==Physiology==

=== Symbiotic relation ===
{{Main|Symbiosis in lichens}}
::''"Lichens are fungi that have discovered agriculture"'' —[[Trevor Goward]]&lt;ref name=LNAILBE&gt;Sharnoff, Sylvia and Sharnoff, Stephen. [http://www.sharnoffphotos.com/lichen_info/biology.html "Lichen Biology and the Environment"]. sharnoffphotos.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A lichen is a composite organism that emerges from [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]] living among the filaments ([[hyphae]]) of the [[Fungus|fungi]] in a mutually beneficial [[symbiotic]] relationship. The fungi benefit from the carbohydrates produced by the algae or cyanobacteria via [[photosynthesis]]. The algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungi, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it. Although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen, the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners, whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic. However, while symbiotic, the relationship is probably not [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], since the algae give up a disproportionate amount of their sugars (see below). Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. If a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can [[nitrogen fixation|fix atmospheric nitrogen]], complementing the activities of the green alga.

In three different lineages the fungal partner has independently lost the mitochondrial gene atp9, which has key functions in mitochondrial energy production. The loss makes the fungi completely dependent on their symbionts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14519 Reductions in complexity of mitochondrial genomes in lichen‐forming fungi shed light on genome architecture of obligate symbioses - Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The algal or cyanobacterial cells are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] and, as in plants, they [[redox|reduce]] atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Phycobionts (algae) produce [[sugar alcohols]] ([[ribitol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[erythritol]]), which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus).&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; Cyanobionts produce [[glucose]].&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; Lichenized fungal cells can make the photobiont "leak" out the products of photosynthesis, where they can then be absorbed by the fungus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|5}}

It appears many, probably the majority, of lichen also live in a symbiotic relationship with an order of basidiomycete yeasts called Cyphobasidiales. The absence of this third partner could explain the difficulties of growing lichen in the laboratory. The yeast cells are responsible for the formation of the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus, and could also be important for its shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6298/488 Basidiomycete yeasts in the cortex of ascomycete macrolichens – Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lichen combination of alga or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology), physiology, and biochemistry than the component fungus, alga, or cyanobacterium growing by itself, naturally or in culture. The body ([[thallus]]) of most lichens is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as a structureless, undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments ([[hyphae]]). If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=LNA/&gt; In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

Evidence that lichens are examples of successful [[symbiosis]] is the fact that lichens can be found in almost every habitat and geographic area on the planet.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; Two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens, but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19853051 |year=2010 |author1=Skaloud |first1=P |title=Evolutionary inferences based on ITS rDNA and actin sequences reveal extensive diversity of the common lichen alga ''Asterochloris'' (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=36–46 |last2=Peksa |first2=O |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.09.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case where one fungal partner simultaneously had two green algae partners that outperform each other in different climates, this might indicate having more than one photosynthetic partner at the same time might enable the lichen to exist in a wider range of habitats and geographic locations.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;

Phycobionts can have a net output of sugars with only water vapor.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; The thallus must be saturated with liquid water for cyanobionts to photosynthesize.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

Algae produce sugars that are absorbed by the fungus by diffusion into special fungal hyphae called [[appressoria]] or [[haustoria]] in contact with the wall of the algal cells.&lt;ref name=ELWWL&gt;{{cite web |author=Ramel, Gordon |title=What is a Lichen? |publisher=Earthlife Web, |url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/lichen.html|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appressoria or haustoria may produce a substance that increases permeability of the algal cell walls, and may penetrate the walls.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt; The algae may lose up to 80% of their sugar production to the fungus.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt;

===Ecology===
Lichen associations may be examples of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]] or even [[parasitism]], depending on the species. There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensalistic]], rather than [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]].&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmadjian V.|date= 1993 |title=''The Lichen Symbiosis'' |publisher=New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-57885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian/&gt; The [[fungus]] surrounds the algal cells,&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall,&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; forming penetration pegs ([[haustoria]]) similar to those produced by [[pathogenic fungus|pathogenic fungi]] that feed on a host.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Honegger1988/&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen.

Many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used to cheaply&lt;ref name=LLHE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Speer |first1=Brian R |author2=Ben Waggoner |title=Lichens: Life History &amp; Ecology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenlh.html |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |date=May 1997 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; assess [[air pollution]],&lt;ref name=ferry/&gt;&lt;ref name=rosehawksworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawksworthrose1976/&gt; [[ozone]] depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have been used in making [[dye]]s, [[Evernia prunastri|perfume]]s,&lt;ref name=OMAO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorie-inc.us/oakmoss.html|title=Oak Moss Absolute Oil, Evernia prunastri, Perfume Fixative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[traditional medicine]]s. A few lichen species are eaten by insects&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; or larger animals, such as reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.1984.tb01138.x |title=Wild reindeer foraging-niche organization |journal=Ecography |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=345 |year=1984 |last1=Skogland |first1=Terje }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens are widely used as environmental indicators or bio-indicators. If air is very badly polluted with sulphur dioxide there may be no lichens present, just green algae may be found. If the air is clean, shrubby, hairy and leafy lichens become abundant. A few lichen species can tolerate quite high levels of pollution and are commonly found on pavements, walls and tree bark in urban areas. The most sensitive lichens are shrubby and leafy while the most tolerant lichens are all crusty in appearance. Since industrialisation many of the shrubby and leafy lichens such as ''Ramalina, Usnea'' and ''Lobaria'' species have very limited ranges, often being confined to the parts with the purest air.

====Lichenicolous fungi====
Some fungi can only be found living ''on'' lichens as [[obligate]] [[parasite]]s. These are referred to as [[lichenicolous fungi]], and are a different species from the fungus living inside the lichen; thus they are not considered to be part of the lichen.&lt;ref name=LFIEB&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0007-2745(2003)106[0080:LFIEAB]2.0.CO;2|year=2003|volume=106|page=80|title=Lichenicolous Fungi: Interactions, Evolution, and Biodiversity|journal=The Bryologist|last1=Lawrey|first1=James D.|last2=Diederich|first2=Paul|url=http://www.lichenology.info/pdf/LawreyDiederich.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to water===
Moisture makes the cortex become more transparent.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} This way, the algae can conduct photosynthesis when moisture is available, and is protected at other times. When the cortex is more transparent, the algae show more clearly and the lichen looks greener.

===Metabolites, metabolite structures and bioactivity===
Lichens can show intense antioxidant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25808912 | doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12850 | title=Comparative analysis of the antioxidant properties of Icelandic and Hawaiian lichens |date=March 2015 | journal=Environmental Microbiology  |vauthors=Hagiwara K, Wright PR, etal | volume=18 | issue=8 | pages=2319–2325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15752633 | doi=10.1016/j.fitote.2004.05.012 | volume=76 | issue=2 | title=Antioxidant activity, reducing power and total phenolic content of some lichen species |date=March 2005 | journal=Fitoterapia | pages=216–219  |vauthors=Odabasoglu F, Aslan A, Cakir A, etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secondary metabolites]] are often deposited as crystals in the [[apoplast]].&lt;ref name=HSLNA&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.01.003|title=Norstictic acid: Correlations between its physico-chemical characteristics and ecological preferences of lichens producing this depsidone|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=68|issue=3|page=309|year=2010|last1=Hauck|first1=Markus|last2=Jürgens|first2=Sascha-René|last3=Leuschner|first3=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary metabolites are thought to play a role in preference for some substrates over others.&lt;ref name=HSLNA/&gt;

Sometimes lichens contain structures made from fungal [[metabolite]]s, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a [[polysaccharide]]{{clarify|reason=which polysaccharide? What is the evidence it derives from the fungus?|date=July 2015}} layer in the cortex.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Growth rate ===
Lichens often have a regular but very slow growth rate of less than a millimeter per year.&lt;ref name=LNAILBE/&gt; Different lichen species have been measured to grow as slowly as 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm, and as fast as 0.5 meter per year.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/growth.html|title=The Earth Life Web, Growth and Development in Lichens|publisher=earthlife.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In crustose lichens, the area along the margin is where the most active growth is taking place.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Most crustose lichens grow only 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter per year.

=== Life span ===
Lichens may be [[longevity|long-lived]], with some considered to be among the oldest living organisms.&lt;ref name=LNA/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2007"/&gt; Lifespan is difficult to measure because of what defines as the "same" individual lichen is not precise.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL/&gt; Lichens grow by vegetatively breaking off a piece, which may or may not be defined as the "same" lichen, and two lichens can merge, then becoming the "same" lichen.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL/&gt; An [[Arctic]] species called "map lichen" (''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'') has been dated at 8,600 years, apparently the world's oldest living organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/nature/lichens.htm |title=Lichens|publisher=National Park Service, US Department of the Interior, Government of the United States|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to environmental stress===
Unlike simple dehydration in plants and animals, lichens may experience a ''complete'' loss of body water in dry periods.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of [[water]] content ([[poikilohydric]]).&lt;ref name="Nash2008-intro"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} They quickly absorb water when it becomes available again, becoming soft and fleshy.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Reconfiguration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes or more.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In tests, lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the [[adaptive capacity|adaptation capacity]] of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic activity]] within the [[simulation|simulation time]] of 34 days under [[Life on Mars (planet)#Life on Earth under Martian conditions|Martian conditions]] in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR).&lt;ref name="Skymania-20120426"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Emily |title=Lichen survives harsh Mars environment |url=http://www.skymania.com/wp/2012/04/lichen-survives-harsh-martian-setting.html |date=26 April 2012 |publisher=Skymania News |accessdate=27 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]] has discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space. In an experiment led by Leopoldo Sancho from the Complutense University of Madrid, two species of lichen—''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'' and ''[[Xanthoria elegans]]''—were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket 31 May 2005. Once in orbit, the capsules were opened and the lichens were directly exposed to the vacuum of space with its widely fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation. After 15 days, the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be unchanged in their ability to photosynthesize.&lt;ref name="urlESA - Human Spaceflight and Exploration - Lichen survives in space"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sancho2007/&gt;

== Reproduction and dispersal ==

===Vegetative reproduction===
[[File:Lichen reproduction1.jpg|thumb|right|''Xanthoparmelia'' sp. with dark-colored reproductive structures (disc-like [[apothecia]]) at center, surrounded by a pale coloured vegetative [[thallus]].]]
Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own ([[vegetative reproduction]]) or through the dispersal of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]]s containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Because of the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus, the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred. Fruticose lichens can easily{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} fragment, and new lichens can grow from the fragment ([[vegetative reproduction]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns.&lt;ref name=Eichorn2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook1995/&gt; '''Soredia''' (singular: "soredium") are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia, from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; '''Isidia''' (singular: "isidium") are branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the "core species".&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

===Sexual reproduction===
[[File:Lichen reproduction.jpg|thumb|left|Disc-like [[apothecia]] (left) and [[thallus]] (right) on a [[foliose lichen]]]]
Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} Only the fungal partner in a lichen reproduces sexually.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Many lichen fungi reproduce sexually like other fungi, producing spores formed by [[meiosis]] and fusion of gametes. Following dispersal, such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form.

Some lichen fungi belong to [[Basidiomycetes]] ('''basidiolichens''') and produce [[mushroom]]-like reproductive structures resembling those of their nonlichenized relatives.

Most lichen fungi belong to [[Ascomycetes]] ('''ascolichens'''). Among the ascolichens, [[spore]]s are produced in spore-producing structures called '''[[ascomata]]'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt; The most common types of ascomata are the '''[[apothecium]]''' (plural: apothecia) and '''[[perithecium]]''' (plural: perithecia).&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} Apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs located on the top surface of the lichen thallus. When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called '''lirellae'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} Perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue, which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask, and appear like black dots on the lichen surface.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}}

The three most common spore body types are raised discs called '''[[Ascocarp|apothecia]]''' (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups with a small hole at the top called '''perithecia''' (singular: perithecium), and '''pycnidia''' (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an [[ascus]] is the structure that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the [[Ascomycota]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/reproduction.html | title=Lichen Reproductive Structures | author=Ramel, Gordon | accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called '''[[ascus|asci]]''' (singular: ascus), and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the apothecium has an outer margin, the margin is called the '''exciple'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called '''lecanorine''', meaning similar to members of the genus ''[[Lecanora]]''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the exciple is blackened like carbon it is called '''lecideine''' meaning similar to members of the genus ''[[Lecidea]]''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the margin is pale or colorless it is called '''biatorine'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}}

[[File:Pilophorus acicularis 109164.jpg|thumb|right|Crust-like thallus with [[pseudopodetia]]]]
A "[[podetium]]" (plural: [[podetia]]) is a lichenized stalk-like structure of the fruiting body rising from the thallus, associated with some fungi that produce a fungal [[apothecium]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. They usually bear the fungal [[pycnidia]] or [[apothecia]] or both.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Many lichens have [[apothecia]] that are visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

Most lichens produce abundant sexual structures.&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt; Many species appear to disperse only by sexual spores.&lt;ref name=Murtagh&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murtagh GJ, Dyer PS, Crittenden PD |title=Sex and the single lichen |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6778 |page=564 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10766229 |doi=10.1038/35007142 |bibcode=2000Natur.404..564M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the crustose lichens ''Graphis scripta'' and ''Ochrolechia parella'' produce no symbiotic vegetative propagules. Instead, the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are [[homothallic]]). This breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments.&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt;

'''Mazaedia''' (singular: mazaedium) are apothecia shaped like a [[Pin#Straight pins|dressmaker's pin]] in ([[pin lichen]])s, where the fruiting body is a brown or black mass of loose ascospores enclosed by a cup-shaped exciple, which sits on top of a tiny stalk.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|15}}

== Taxonomy and classification ==
Lichens are classified by the fungal component. Lichen species are given the same scientific name ([[binomial name]]) as the fungus species in the lichen. Lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungus.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt; There are about 13,500–17,000 identified lichen species.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt; Nearly 20% of known fungal species are associated with lichens.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt;

"'''Lichenized fungus'''" may refer to the entire lichen, or to just the fungus. This may cause confusion without context. A particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species, giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species, but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species.&lt;ref name=FSSD&gt;{{cite web |title=Form and structure – ''Sticta'' and ''Dendriscocaulon'' |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens |url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/form-structure-sticta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division, the '''Mycophycophyta''', but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate [[biological classification|lineages]]. Neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form [[monophyletic]] lineages in their respective fungal phyla, but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum.&lt;ref name=Lutzoni_2004/&gt; Even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus ''[[Geosiphon|Geosiphon pyriforme]]'', a member of the [[Glomeromycota]] that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells. ''[[Geosiphon]]'' is not usually considered to be a lichen, and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years. The genus is more closely allied to [[Mycorrhiza|endomycorrhizal]] genera. Fungi from [[Verrucariales]] also form marine lichens with the [[brown algae]] ''Petroderma maculiforme'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21653406 The intertidal marine lichen formed by the pyrenomycete fungus Verrucaria tavaresiae (Ascomycotina) and the brown alga Petroderma maculiforme (Phaeophyceae): thallus organization and symbiont interaction – NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; and have a symbiotic relationship with [[seaweed]] like ([[Ascophyllum|rockweed]]) and [[Blidingia minima]], where the algae are the dominant components. The fungi is thought to help the rockweeds to resist desiccation when exposed to air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/mycologywebpages/NaturalHistoryOfFungi/AlgalMutualisms.html Mutualisms between fungi and algae – New Brunswick Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/lichenologist/article/challenging-the-lichen-concept-turgidosculum-ulvae-verrucariaceae-represents-an-independent-photobiont-shift-to-a-multicellular-bladelike-alga/3F6C39EE053596364B0F5B23EE1F581C Challenging the lichen concept: Turgidosculum ulvae – Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, lichens can also use [[yellow-green algae]] ([[Heterococcus]]) as their symbiotic partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-39 Congruence of chloroplast – BMC Evolutionary Biology – BioMed Central]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria multiple times throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lutzoni |first1=Francois |last2=Pagel |first2=Mark |last3=Reeb |first3=Valerie |title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors |journal=Nature |date=June 21, 2001 |volume=411 |issue=6840 |pages=937–940 |doi=10.1038/35082053|pmid=11418855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fungi ===
The fungal component of a lichen is called the '''mycobiont'''. The mycobiont may be an [[Ascomycete]] or [[Basidiomycete]].&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; The associated lichens are called either [[Ascomycota|ascolichens]] or [[basidiolichen]]s, respectively. Living as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients since about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life.&lt;ref name=Hawksworth1988/&gt;

Thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the secondary metabolites identical,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} indicating{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. But the same mycobiont with different photobionts may also produce very different growth forms.&lt;ref name=FSSD/&gt; Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species.

Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

The following table lists the [[Order (biology)|orders]] and [[Family (biology)|families]] of fungi that include lichen-forming species.
{{Lichen family taxonomy}}

===Photobionts===
The [[photosynthetic]] partner in a lichen is called a '''photobiont'''. The photobionts in lichens come from a variety of simple [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] organisms. In the majority of lichens the photobiont is a green alga ([[Chlorophyta]]) or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. In some lichens both types are present. Algal photobionts are called '''phycobionts''', while cyanobacterial photobionts are called '''cyanobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; According to one source, about 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts, and about 10% have cyanobionts,&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; while another source states that two thirds of lichens have green algae as phycobiont, and about one third have a cyanobiont.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;  Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: [[Cyanophyceae]]; eukaryotic: [[Trebouxiophyceae]], [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Chlorophyceae]]) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.&lt;ref name=Friedl1996/&gt;

Common [[algal]] photobionts are from the genera ''[[Trebouxia]]'', ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'', ''[[Pseudotrebouxia]]'', or ''[[Myrmecia (alga)|Myrmecia]]''. ''[[Trebouxia]]'' is the most common genus of green algae in lichens, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. "Trebouxioid" means either a photobiont that is in the genus ''[[Trebouxia]]'', or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class [[Trebouxiophyceae]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html|title=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second most commonly represented green alga genus is ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]''.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; Overall, about 100 species of eukaryotes are known to occur as photobionts in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

A "[[cyanolichen]]" is a lichen with a [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] as its main photosynthetic component (photobiont).&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html|title=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cyanolichen are also ascolichens, but a few basidiolichen like [[Dictyonema]] and [[Acantholichen]] have cyanobacteria as their partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=AtOyDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=The+cyanobionts+of+the+Dictyonema+and+related+basidiomycetes+Cora+Acantholichen&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE1LyW1-vdAhUI2qQKHQaeALAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20cyanobionts%20of%20the%20Dictyonema%20and%20related%20basidiomycetes%20Cora%20Acantholichen&amp;f=false Modern Topics in the Phototrophic Prokaryotes: Environmental and Applied Aspects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly occurring cyanobacterium [[genus]] is ''[[Nostoc]]''.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt; Other&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; common [[cyanobacterium]] photobionts are from ''[[Scytonema]]''.&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have [[limestone]] as the substrate.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Another cyanolichen group, the [[jelly lichen]]s of the genera ''[[Collema]]'' or ''[[Leptogium]]'' are gelatinous and live on moist soils. Another group of large and [[foliose]] species including ''[[Peltigera]]'', ''[[Lobaria]]'', and ''[[Degelia]]'' are grey-blue, especially when dampened or wet. Many of these characterize the [[Lobarion]] communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the [[Celtic rain forest]]. Strains of cyanobacteria found in various cyanolichens are often closely related to one another.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; They differ from the most closely related free-living strains.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5580/357|title= Lichen Guilds Share Related Cyanobacterial Symbionts|accessdate=10 October 2014 | doi=10.1126/science.1072961|pmid= 12130774|volume=297|issue= 5580|journal=Science|page=357|year=2002 | last1 = Rikkinen | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'', which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the "core species".&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"/&gt;

The same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = H. | last2 = Miadlikowska | first2 = J. | last3 = Lutzoni | first3 = F. | year = 2005 | title = Assessing host specialization in symbiotic cyanobacteria associated with four closely related species of the lichen fungus ''Peltigera'' | url = | journal = European Journal of Phycology | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 363–378 | doi=10.1080/09670260500342647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same phycobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; More than one phycobiont may be present in a single thallus.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

===Controversy over classification method and species names===
There are about 20,000 known lichen [[species (biology)|species]].&lt;ref name=UCLS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichensy.html|title=Lichens: Systematics, University of California Museum of Paleontology|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But what is meant by "species" is different from what is meant by biological species in plants, animals, or fungi, where being the same species implies that there is a common [[ancestral lineage]].&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; Because lichens are combinations of members of two or even three different biological [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s, these components ''must'' have a ''different'' ancestral lineage from each other. By convention, lichens are still called "species" anyway, and are classified according to the species of their fungus, not the species of the algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens are given the same scientific name ([[binomial name]]) as the fungus in them, which may cause some confusion. The alga bears its own scientific name, which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungus.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt;

Depending on context, "lichenized fungus" may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus when it is in the lichen, which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria. Some algae and cyanobacteria are found naturally living outside of the lichen. The fungal, algal, or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture. When growing by themselves, the fungus, algae, or cyanobacteria have very different properties than those of the lichen. Lichen properties such as growth form, physiology, and biochemistry, are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae or cyanobacteria.

The same fungus growing in combination with different algae or cyanobacteria, can produce lichens that are very different in most properties, meeting non-DNA criteria for being different "species". Historically, these different combinations were classified as different species. When the fungus is identified as being the same using modern DNA methods, these apparently different species get reclassified as the ''same'' species under the current (2014) convention for classification by fungal component. This has led to debate about this classification convention. These apparently different "species" have their own independent evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;&lt;ref name="FSSD"/&gt;

There is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus, and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium ([[synecdoche]]). This is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms, which would be considered different species by any measure other than the DNA of the fungal component. If the whole lichen produced by the same fungus growing in association with different algae or cyanobacteria, were to be classified as different "species", the number of "lichen species" would be greater.

===Diversity===
The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the [[Ascomycota]], with about 40% of species forming such an association.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt; Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as [[saprotroph]]s or [[parasite|plant parasites]] (for example, the [[Leotiales]], [[Dothideales]], and [[Pezizales]]). Other lichen fungi occur in only five [[order (biology)|orders]] in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders [[Graphidales]], [[Gyalectales]], [[Peltigerales]], [[Pertusariales]], and [[Teloschistales]]).  Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont.&lt;ref name="Lutzoni Pagel Reeb pp. 937–940"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lutzoni | first=François | last2=Pagel | first2=Mark | last3=Reeb | first3=Valérie | title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors | journal=Nature | volume=411 | issue=6840 | date=2001 | doi=10.1038/35082053 | pmid=11418855 | pages=937–940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned [[fungi imperfecti]], a catch-all category for fungi whose sexual form of reproduction has never been observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Comparatively few [[Basidiomycetes]] are lichenized, but these include [[agarics]], such as species of ''[[Lichenomphalia]]'', [[clavarioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Multiclavula]]'', and [[corticioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Dictyonema]]''.

===Identification methods===
Lichen identification uses growth form and reactions to chemical tests.

"[[Pd test|Pd]]" refers to the outcome of the [[Pd test]] or is used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test, [[para-phenylenediamine]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; If putting a drop on a lichen turns an area bright yellow to orange, this helps identify it as belonging to either the genus ''[[Cladonia]]'' or ''[[Lecanora]]''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;

=== Evolution and paleontology ===

(2001) indicate that lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses.

== Ecology and interactions with environment ==

===Substrates and habitats===
[[File:Der Heilige Dominikus am Nordturm des Regensburger Doms.jpg|thumb|right|Lichens on a statue made of limestone on a tower of [[Regensburg Cathedral]]]]
Lichens grow on and in a wide range of substrates and habitats, including some of the most extreme conditions on earth. They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, and hanging from branches "living on thin air" ([[epiphyte]]s) in [[rain forest]]s and in [[temperate woodland]]. They grow on bare rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces. They can survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: [[arctic tundra]], hot dry [[desert]]s, rocky coasts, and toxic [[slag heap]]s. They can even live ''inside'' solid rock, growing between the grains, and in the soil as part of a [[biological soil crust]] in arid habitats such as deserts. Some lichens do not grow on ''anything'', living out their lives blowing about the environment.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals, contributing to the process of [[weathering]] by which rocks are gradually turned into soil. While this contribution to weathering is usually benign, it can cause problems for artificial stone structures. For example, there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]] that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument.

Lichens are not [[parasites]] on the plants they grow on, but only use them as a substrate to grow on. The fungi of some lichen species may "take over" the algae of other lichen species.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABGPPU&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/cryptogams/underworld/panel-6/index.html |title=Pollution, The Plant Underworld |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Lichens growing on leaves may have the appearance of being parasites on the leaves, but they are not. However, some lichens, notably those of the genus ''Diploschistes'' are known to parasitise other lichens. ''Diploschistes muscorum'' starts its development in the tissue of a host ''Cladonia'' species.&lt;ref name=Honegger1988/&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;{{rp|171}}

In the arctic tundra, lichens, together with [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]], make up the majority of the [[ground cover]], which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals. An example is "[[Reindeer moss]]", which is a lichen, not a moss.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt;

A crustose lichen that grows on rock is called a '''[[saxicolous lichen]]'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=VMBMLF&gt;''Mosses Lichens &amp; Ferns of Northwest North America'', Dale H.

Many squamulous lichens are terricolous.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} '''[[Umbillicate lichen]]s''' are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; A '''[[vagrant lichen]]''' is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.

===Lichens and soils===
In addition to distinct physical mechanisms by which lichens break down raw stone, recent studies indicate lichens attack stone chemically, entering newly chelated minerals into the ecology.&lt;blockquote&gt;The lichen exudates, which have powerful chelating capacity, the widespread occurrence of mineral neoformation, particularly metal oxalates, together with the characteristics of weathered substrates, all confirm the significance of lichens as chemical weathering agents.&lt;ref name=catena&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00085-5|title=Weathering of rocks induced by lichen colonization — a review |journal=CATENA |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=121 |year=2000 |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Blume |first2=Hans-Peter |last3=Beyer |first3=Lothar |url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~raman/papers2/ChenetalCatena.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Over time, this activity creates new fertile soil from lifeless stone.

Lichens may be [[Lichens and nitrogen cycling|important in contributing nitrogen]] to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting the nitrogen into the soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=Nature |volume=346 |issue=6287 |page=839 |year=1990 |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt; In deserts and semi-arid areas, [[lichens]] are part of extensive, living [[biological soil crust]]s, essential for maintaining the soil structure.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt; Lichens have a long fossil record in soils dating back 2.2 billion years.&lt;ref name="Retallack-2013"/&gt;

===Ecological interactions===
Lichens are [[pioneer species]], among the first living things to grow on bare rock or areas denuded of life by a disaster.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Lichens may have to compete with plants for access to sunlight, but because of their small size and slow growth, they thrive in places where higher plants have difficulty growing. Lichens are often the [[ecological succession|first to settle]] in places lacking soil, constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = T. R. | date = 2007 | title = Lichens of the boreal forests of Labrador, Canada: A checklist | journal = Evansia | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 85–90 | doi=10.1639/0747-9859-24.3.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some survive in the tough conditions of deserts, and others on frozen soil of the Arctic regions.&lt;ref name=Oksanen2006/&gt;

A major ecophysiological advantage of lichens is that they are [[poikilohydry|poikilohydric]] (''poikilo''- variable, ''hydric''- relating to water), meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration, they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe [[desiccation]]. Like some [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[fern]]s, and a few "[[resurrection plant]]s", upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as [[cryptobiosis]]) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity. In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit.
[[File:Moss_lichen.jpg|thumb|Lichens suppress the growth of mosses and higher plants around them]]
Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs and monuments. Many lichens also grow as [[epiphyte]]s (''epi''- on the surface, ''phyte''- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees. When growing on plants, lichens are not [[parasite]]s; they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it. Lichens produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic]] chemicals that inhibit the growth of mosses. Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus ''[[Cladoniaceae|Cladina]]'' (reindeer lichens), produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Lichen Allelopathy: A Review|author=Lawrey, James D. |pages=26–38| doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0582.ch002|title=Allelopathy. Organisms, Processes, and Applications|volume=582 |editors=Inderjit; K. M. M. Dakshini; Frank A. Einhellig|year=1994| publisher=American Chemical Society|series=ACS Symposium Series |isbn=978-0-8412-3061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stability (that is, longevity) of their [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] is a major factor of lichen habitats. Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, [[vascular plant|vascular (higher) plant]] seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water.

Lichens may be eaten by some animals, such as [[reindeer]], living in [[arctic]] regions. The [[larva]]e of a number of [[Lepidoptera]] species feed exclusively on lichens. These include [[Common Footman]] and [[Marbled Beauty]]. However, lichens are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates, making them unsuitable for some animals. Lichens are also used by the [[Northern Flying Squirrel]] for nesting, food, and a water source during winter.

=== Effects of air pollution ===
[[File:Lobaria pulmonaria 010108c.jpg|thumb|Some lichens, like the foliose ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'', are sensitive to air pollution.]]
If lichens are exposed to air pollutants at all times, without any [[deciduous]] parts, they are unable to avoid the accumulation of pollutants. Also lacking [[stomata]] and a [[plant cuticle|cuticle]], lichens may absorb [[aerosol]]s and gases over the entire thallus surface from which they may readily [[diffusion|diffuse]] to the photobiont layer.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt; Because lichens do not possess roots, their primary source of most [[chemical element|elements]] is the air, and therefore elemental levels in lichens often reflect the accumulated composition of ambient air. The processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include [[fog]] and [[dew]], gaseous absorption, and dry deposition.&lt;ref name=Knops1991/&gt; Consequently, many environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective [[bioindicator|biomonitors]] of atmospheric quality.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Halonen1993/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walker T.

Not all lichens are equally sensitive to [[air pollution|air pollutants]], so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants.&lt;ref name="hogan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |date=2010 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |work=Encyclopedia of Earth. |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=27 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |archivedate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity of a lichen to air pollution is directly related to the energy needs of the mycobiont, so that the stronger the dependency of the mycobiont on the photobiont, the more sensitive the lichen is to air pollution.&lt;ref name=Beltman1980/&gt; Upon exposure to air pollution, the photobiont may use metabolic energy for repair of its cellular structures that would otherwise be used for maintenance of its photosynthetic activity, therefore leaving less metabolic energy available for the mycobiont. The alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association. Therefore, lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances, but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt;

This interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859, with more systematic methods developed by [[William Nylander (botanist)|William Nylander]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

=== Food ===
[[File:Hiroshige II - Kishu kumano iwatake tori - Shokoku meisho hyakkei.jpg|thumb|[[Iwatake]] (''Umbilicaria esculenta'') gathering at Kumano in Kishū, by [[Hiroshige II]]]]
Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world. Although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine, others are a staple food or even a delicacy. Two obstacles are often encountered when eating lichens: lichen [[polysaccharide]]s are generally indigestible to humans, and lichens usually contain mildly toxic [[secondary compound]]s that should be removed before eating. Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in [[vulpinic acid]] or [[usnic acid]] are toxic.&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993"/&gt; Most poisonous lichens are yellow.

In the past, [[Iceland moss]] (''Cetraria islandica'') was an important source of food for humans in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. [[Wila (lichen)|Wila]] (''Bryoria fremontii'') was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer lichen]] (''Cladina'' spp.) after they remove it from the [[rumen]] of caribou or reindeer that have been killed. [[Rock Tripe|Rock tripe]] (''Umbilicaria'' spp. and ''Lasalia'' spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America, and one species, ''[[Umbilicaria esculenta]]'', is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.

=== Lichenometry ===
{{Main|Lichenometry}}
Lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli. Introduced by Beschel in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Beschel1950/&gt; the technique has found many applications. it is used in [[archaeology]], [[palaeontology]], and [[geomorphology]]. It uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the [[Surface exposure dating|age of exposed rock]].&lt;ref name=LSN/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;Curry, R. R. (1969) "Holocene climatic and glacial history of the central Sierra Nevada, California", pp. 1–47, Geological Society of America Special Paper, 123, S. A. Schumm and W. C. Bradley, eds.&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sowers, J.

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG/CR 5562.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period.&lt;ref name="innes"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/030913338500900202 |title=Lichenometry |journal=Progress in Physical Geography |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=187 |year=1985 |last1=Innes |first1=J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera ''[[Rhizocarpon]]'' (e.g. the species ''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'') and ''[[Xanthoria]]''.

===Biodegradation===
Lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of [[Baelo Claudia]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2227722|title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage|author1=Cappitelli, Francesca |author2=Sorlini, Claudia |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=3|pmid=18065627|doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07|pages=564–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead, copper, and radionuclides.&lt;ref name=gadd/&gt;

=== As dyes ===
Many lichens produce secondary compounds, including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that reduce [[herbivory]] or kill bacteria. These compounds are very useful for lichen identification, and have had economic importance as [[dye]]s such as [[cudbear]] or primitive [[antibiotics]].

The [[pH indicator]] (indicated acidic or basic) in the [[litmus test]] is a dye extracted from the lichen ''[[Roccella tinctoria]]'' by boiling.

[[Traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands|In the Highlands of Scotland, traditional dyes]] for [[Harris tweed]]&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; and other traditional cloths were made from lichens including the orange ''[[Xanthoria parietina]]'' and the grey foliaceous ''[[Parmelia saxatilis]]'' common on rocks known as "crottle".

There are reports dating almost 2000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes.&lt;ref name=Casselman1999/&gt; Of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family [[Roccellaceae]], commonly called orchella weed or orchil. [[Orcein]] and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.

===Traditional medicine and research===
Historically in [[traditional medicine]] of Europe, ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' was collected in large quantities as "Lungwort", due to its lung-like appearance (the ''[[doctrine of signatures]]'' suggesting that herbs can treat body parts that they physically resemble). Similarly, ''[[Peltigera leucophlebia]]'' was used as a supposed cure for [[candidiasis|thrush]], due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;

Lichens produce [[metabolite]]s in research for their potential therapeutic or diagnostic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = K | year = 2001 | title = Pharmaceutically Relevant Metabolites from Lichens | doi = 10.1007/s002530100684 | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities.&lt;ref name=morton&gt;Morton, E.; Winters, J. and Smith, L.

In early [[Midrashic]] literature, the Hebrew word "vayilafeth" in [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:8 is explained as referring to [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] entwining herself around [[Boaz]] like lichen.&lt;ref&gt;Thus explained by Rabbi [[Enoch Zundel ben Joseph]], in his commentary ''Etz Yosef'' ("Tree of Joseph"), on ''Sefer [[Midrash Rabbah]]'', vol. 2, New York 1987, s.v. ''Ruth Rabba'' 6:3&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth century Arab physician, [[Al-Tamimi, the physician|Al-Tamimi]], mentions lichens dissolved in [[vinegar]] and [[rose water]] being used in his day for the treatment of skin diseases and rashes.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Amar and Yaron Serri, ''The Land of Israel and Syria as Described by Al-Tamimi'', Ramat-Gan 2004, pp. 56, 108–109 {{ISBN|965-226-252-8}} (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of [[John Wyndham]]'s novel ''[[Trouble with Lichen]]'' revolves around an anti-aging chemical extracted from a lichen.

==History==

[[File:Haeckel Lichenes.jpg|thumb|"Lichenes" fancifully drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]] to emphasize his ideas of symmetry in his ''[[Kunstformen der Natur|Artforms of Nature]]'', 1904]]

Although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time, it was not until 1867, when Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]] proposed his dual theory of lichens, that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt; Schwendener's hypothesis, which at the time lacked experimental evidence, arose from his extensive analysis of the anatomy and development in lichens, algae, and fungi using a [[light microscopy|light microscope]]. Many of the leading lichenologists at the time, such as [[James Mascall Morrison Crombie|James Crombie]] and [[William Nylander (botanist)|Nylander]], rejected Schwendener's hypothesis because the common consensus was that all living organisms were autonomous.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;

Other prominent biologists, such as [[Heinrich Anton de Bary]], [[Albert Bernhard Frank]], [[Melchior Treub]] and [[Hermann Hellriegel]] were not so quick to reject Schwendener's ideas and the concept soon spread into other areas of study, such as microbial, plant, animal and human pathogens.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Treub1873/&gt; When the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified, Schwendener's hypothesis began to gain popularity. Further experimental proof of the dual nature of lichens was obtained when [[Eugen Thomas]] published his results in 1939 on the first successful re-synthesis experiment.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;

In the 2010s, a new facet of the fungi-algae partnership was discovered. Toby Spribille and colleagues found that many types of lichen that were long thought to be [[ascomycota|ascomycete]]-algae pairs were actually ascomycete-[[basidiomycota|basidiomycete]]-algae trios.&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yong_2016-07-21"&gt;{{Citation |last=Yong |first=Ed |author-link=Ed Yong |date=2016-07-21 |title=How a guy from a Montana trailer park overturned 150 years of biology |journal=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/how-a-guy-from-a-montana-trailer-park-upturned-150-years-of-biology/491702/ |access-date=2017-07-23 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Love Matters''' is a global program providing information on [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s, sex and love. The idea was first developed in the [[Netherlands]] by the independent media producer by Michele Ernsting and Michelle Chakkalackal at [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|RNW Media]]. It has been referred to as a [[freedom of speech]] program. Its current target countries are [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]] and [[India]].

The platform was originally launched in India (headed by [[Vithika Yadav]]), before expanding rapidly to [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and China. Love Matters works mainly online via its own websites and social media channels. In each region, it provides the same delivery method, but the content and language are tailored to each target market. It seeks to bridge the gap in sexual reproductive health information between young people, sexual health experts, educators and services.

The concept has been honored by the [[World Association for Sexual Health]] and is also mentioned in the [[United Nations]] manifesto on reproductive health.

==History==
The first Love Matters platform was launched in November 2010 in Netherlands, and then subsequently launched in India in 2011[[India]]. This was following the banning of sexual education in a number of regions in [[India]] in the years prior to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chadha|first1=Monica|title=Indian state bans sex education|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6523371.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|RNW Media]] launched the idea after seeing problems globally with [[sex education]]. The coverage in [[India]] gave them a platform to launch the idea, with them launching Love Matters India in late 2011. The idea came following decades of work by [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|RNW Media]], using shortwave radio. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] media group partnered with a number of local institutions, including the [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]] for Love Matters.&lt;ref name=hindustan&gt;{{cite web|title=An online guidebook on safe sex|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact strategy for the launch was created following a survey they carried out with young [[India]]n citizens in [[Delhi]] and [[Mumbai]]. Originally the platform was launched as a website, with the focus shifting to mobile [[css]]-styled websites after the survey's results clearly stated that their target market of young people wanted to access the information predominantly on their [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref name=hindustan /&gt;

Love Matters second launch was in [[South America]] in 2011, with “Hablemos de Amor”, which translates as ''Let’s talk about Love''. The region and name were later redefined, with the [[Latin America]]n version of the platform focusing on three areas, [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]] and [[Cuba]]. The title was also changed to ''Hablemos de Sexo y Amor'', to include sex in the title, a bid to make the platform more popular amongst men. The next step for the platform was to move to [[Kenya]], where it went live in 2012. As part of the launch, Kenyan newspaper [[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]], launched a weekly feature and an advice column, talking about common relationship issues.&lt;ref name=thestar&gt;{{cite web|title=Love Matters by The Star|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/sections/love-matters|publisher=[[The Star (Kenya)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Love Matters took the decision to expand to [[China]], where it is commonly taboo for people to openly talk about sex and sexual problems. This has contributed to the increase in [[teenage pregnancy]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Y.|last2=Lu|first2=Z.|last3=Shi|first3=R.|last4=Sun|first4=X.|last5=Cai|first5=Y.|title=AIDS and sex education for young people in China|journal=Reproduction, Fertility and Development|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Love Matters and their partners in [[China]] carried out a survey in [[Beijing]], it found that 47% of the young people had never received formal [[sex education]]. Of the 47%, nearly two thirds of them wanted to have access to more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=L.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Shah|first3=I. H.|title=Where do Chinese adolescents obtain knowledge of sex? Implications for sex education in China|journal=Health Education|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the platform in various regions, it was expanded to the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wereldomroep verzorgt seksles in het Arabisch|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22351621/__Seksles_in_het_Arabisch__.html|publisher=[[De Telegraaf]]|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform aims to tackle many taboos within Middle Eastern culture,which in general doesn't offer [[sex education]] within schools. Al Hubb Thaqafa, which can be translated to ''love is culture'', is predominantly managed and run by Middle Eastern women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egipto: hablemos de amor y de sexo|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/spanish/2014/03/24/cnnee-balderas-egypt-love-matters.cnn.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Love Matters approach goes against many traditional views in countries such as [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Egypt]], it has been accepted by many as a social tool for [[sex education]], especially for females in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=El Feki|first1=Shereen|title=An Arab spring of love matters – Al Hubb Thaqafa defies sexual taboos|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/20/love-matters-al-hubb-thaqafa-sex-education-defies-sexual-taboos|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Love Matters India works locally with many institutions to help promote the platform to local people. It is a sex-positive platform, meaning it refuses to be censored by [[religion]] or taboos. On that particular platform, visitors post [[blog]]s and queries, which are answered by the fictitious person ''Auntyji.'' The figure is aimed to provide a motherly figure for younger individuals, based on the relationship between elders and young adults in [[Indian culture]]. The framework of the site is to answer many general questions that Indians may have, while also providing tools such as an encyclopaedia of sex terms to promote self-learning.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web|title=Information matters|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/information-matters/article4062111.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other information and medical coverage is also displayed on many of the platforms, including information on [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=hindu /&gt; In regions such as [[Kenya]], Love Matters has also distributed content using the existing media channels. From 2012 onwards, the platform partnered with [[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]] in [[Kenya]], to write on a weekly basis about common relationship problems.&lt;ref name=thestar /&gt;

==Locations==
Love Matters operates regionally, creating targeted content, dependent on what is required for that given target region. The earliest launch was in [[India]], with other locations such as [[Kenya]] soon following. Other major regional platforms have included [[Latin America]], [[China]] and the [[Middle East]].

==Coverage==
The Love Matters concept received recognition in 2013 from the [[World Association for Sexual Health]], following its expansion to various locations globally. After receiving the award, a member of the awarding panel stated in an interview that he believed Love Matter carried out  “innovative work in reaching a large number of young people in challenging settings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fridman|first1=Cristina Tania|title=The 2013 WAS Gold Medal winners|publisher=[[World Association for Sexual Health]]|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, Love Matters was mentioned by the [[United Nations]] as part of their advice [[manifesto]] for their guidelines on reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, with support from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) - Guidelines on Reproductive Health|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
In [[Islamic]] terminology, something which is '''''makruh''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مكروه, [[transliteration|transliterated]]: '''makrooh''' or ''makrūh'') is a disliked or offensive act (literally "detestable" or "abominable"&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt;). It is one of the [[Ahkam|five categories]] (''al-ahkam al-khamsa'') in Islamic law -- ''[[wajib]]/[[fard]]'' (obligatory), ''[[Mustahabb]]/mandub'' (recommended), ''[[mubah]]'' (neutral), ''makruh'' (disapproved), ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref name=CampoEoI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=infobase|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Makruh+haram+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TEi8U_6ZGcqLyASr94KIDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20haram%20halal&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Though it is not ''[[haraam|haram]]'' (forbidden) or subject to punishment, a person who abstains from this act will be rewarded.&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt; [[Muslim]]s are encouraged to avoid such actions when or as possible. It is one of the degrees of approval (''[[ahkam]]'') in [[sharia|Islamic law]].

==Examples==

Examples of something considered ''Makruh'' are the use of a great amount of water for the pre-[[Salat|prayer]] [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (ritual washings) known as the ''[[wudu]]'' and ''[[ghusl]]'', the consumption of [[garlic]] before attending the mosque or socializing with others,&lt;ref name=aldin&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Dīn|first1=Mūʼil Yūsuf ʻIzz|title=Islamic Law: From Historical Foundations to Contemporary Practice|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzVVL8zI0sC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Makruh+example&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dUS8U-mvMoWHyATB04GADQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[divorce in Islam|divorce]].&lt;ref name=women-sonbol&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sonbol|editor1-first=Amira El Azhary|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLUgscG6zFYC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=Makruh+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akRWoNKBoP&amp;sig=oTDIqYZkPSSAjM96k2Adx2VhR90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q0a8U5GILNOUyASbxYK4BQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20divorce&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a food which is considered ''Makruh'' for Muslims of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab]] is [[prawns]] (but only for Hanafi Madh'hab).&lt;ref&gt;Lawful to you is the pursuit of water game and its use for food, for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; ….[5:96]..&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, however, shared attitudes within the Hanafi school of whether shrimp are considered water game and are thereby [[halal]]. Hanafis believe that you should refrain from it and eat something else if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|title=Ruling on Shrimp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222206/http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of ''Makruh'' acts in Islam include [[Profanity|swearing]], talking while taking [[wudu]] for prayer, and slaughtering an animal for food where other animals of its kind can see.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60007">'''Mean field particle methods''' are a broad class of ''interacting type'' [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] algorithms for simulating from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation&lt;ref name="kol10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dp13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Del Moral|first=Pierre|title=Mean field simulation for Monte Carlo integration|year=2013 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press|quote=Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466504059|pages=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dp04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dmm00" /&gt; These flows of probability measures can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depends on the distributions of the current random states.&lt;ref name="kol10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolokoltsov|first=Vassili|title=Nonlinear Markov processes|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |pages=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt; A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample a large number of copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled [[empirical measure]]s.  In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods these mean field particle techniques rely on '''sequential interacting samples'''. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the ''samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes)'' interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes. In other words, starting with a chaotic configuration based on independent copies of initial state of the nonlinear Markov chain model, the chaos propagates at any time horizon as the size the system tends to infinity; that is, finite blocks of particles reduces to independent copies of the nonlinear Markov process. This result is called the propagation of chaos property.&lt;ref name="mck67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="as91"/&gt; The terminology "propagation of chaos" originated with  the work of Mark Kac in 1976 on a colliding mean field kinetic gas model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kac|first1=Mark|title=Probability and Related Topics in Physical Sciences|date=1976|publisher=Topics in Physical Sciences.

==Applications==

In [[physics]], and more particularly in [[statistical mechanics]], these nonlinear evolution equations are often used to describe the statistical behavior of microscopic interacting  particles in a fluid or in some condensed matter. In this context, the random evolution of a virtual fluid or a gas particle is represented by [[McKean–Vlasov process|McKean-Vlasov diffusion processes]], [[reaction–diffusion system]]s, or [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann type collision processes]].&lt;ref name="o84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="o89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="o90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gm97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cercignani|first1=Carlo|last2=Illner|first2= Reinhard|last3=Pulvirenti|first3= Mario|title=The Mathematical Theory of Dilute Gases.|journal=Springer|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name indicates, the mean field particle model represents the collective behavior of microscopic particles weakly interacting with their occupation measures. The macroscopic behavior of these many-body particle systems is encapsulated in the limiting model obtained when the size of the population tends to infinity. Boltzmann equations represent the macroscopic evolution of colliding particles in rarefied gases, while McKean Vlasov diffusions represent the macroscopic behavior of fluid particles and granular gases.

In [[computational physics]] and more specifically in [[quantum mechanics]], the ground state energies of quantum systems is associated with the top of the spectrum of Schrödinger's operators. The [[Schrödinger equation]] is the quantum mechanics version of the Newton's second law of motion of classical mechanics (the mass times the acceleration is the sum of the forces). This equation represents the wave function (a.k.a. the quantum state) evolution of some physical system, including molecular, atomic of subatomic systems, as well as macroscopic systems like the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrodinger|first1=Erwin|title=An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and Molecules|journal=Physical Review| date=1926| volume=28|issue=6|pages=1049–1070|doi=10.1103/physrev.28.1049|bibcode = 1926PhRv...28.1049S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation (a.k.a. the heat equation) is given by a Feynman-Kac distribution associated with a free evolution  Markov process (often represented by Brownian motions) in the set of electronic or macromolecular configurations and some potential energy function. The long time behavior of these nonlinear semigroups is related to top eigenvalues and ground state energies of  Schrödinger's operators.&lt;ref name="dp04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dm-esaim03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caffarel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caffarel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dd-soft04"/&gt;  The genetic type mean field interpretation of these Feynman-Kac models are termed Resample Monte Carlo, or Diffusion Monte Carlo methods. These branching type evolutionary algorithms are based on mutation and selection transitions. During the mutation transition, the walkers evolve randomly and independently in a potential energy landscape on particle configurations.  The mean field selection process (a.k.a. quantum teleportation, population reconfiguration, resampled transition) is associated with a fitness function that  reflects the particle absorption in an energy well. Configurations with low relative energy are more likely to duplicate. In molecular chemistry, and statistical physics Mean field particle methods are also used to sample [[Boltzmann distribution|Boltzmann-Gibbs measures]] associated with some cooling schedule, and to compute their normalizing constants (a.k.a. free energies, or partition functions).&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddj06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lelièvre|first1=Tony|last2=Rousset|first2=Mathias|last3=Stoltz|first3=Gabriel|title=Computation of free energy differences through nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics: the reaction coordinate case. |journal=J.

To motivate the mean field simulation algorithm we start with ''S'' a [[Finite set|finite]] or [[countable set|countable state]] space and let ''P''(''S'') denote the set of all probability measures on ''S''. Consider a sequence of [[probability distributions]] &lt;math&gt;(\eta_0, \eta_1, \cdots)&lt;/math&gt; on ''S'' satisfying an evolution equation:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1}=\Phi(\eta_n)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

for some, possibly nonlinear, mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi: P(S) \to P(S).&lt;/math&gt; These distributions are given by vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_n=(\eta_n(x))_{x\in S},&lt;/math&gt;

that satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \leqslant \eta_n(x) \leqslant 1,  \qquad \sum\nolimits_{x\in S}\eta_n(x)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping from the &lt;math&gt;(s-1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[unit simplex]] into itself, where ''s'' stands for the [[cardinality]] of the set ''S''. When ''s'' is too large, solving equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] or computationally very costly. One natural way to approximate these evolution equations is to reduce sequentially the state space using a mean field particle model. One of the simplest mean field simulation scheme is defined by the Markov chain

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_n=\left(\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \cdots, \xi^{(N,N)}_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

on the product space &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt;, starting with ''N'' independent random variables with probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; and elementary transitions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} \left( \left. \xi^{(N,1)}_{n+1}=y^1,\cdots,\xi^{(N,N)}_{n+1}=y^N \right |\xi^{(N)}_n\right)=\prod_{i=1}^N \Phi\left(\eta_n^N\right)\left(y^i\right),&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[empirical measure]]

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^N_n=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N1_{\xi^{(N,j)}_n} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;1_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of the state ''x''.

In other words, given &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_n&lt;/math&gt; the samples &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are independent random variables with probability distribution &lt;math&gt; \Phi\left(\eta_n^N\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The rationale behind this mean field simulation technique is the following: We expect that when &lt;math&gt;\eta_{n}^N&lt;/math&gt; is a good approximation of &lt;math&gt;\eta_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(\eta_n^N\right)&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of &lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(\eta_n\right)=\eta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, since &lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1}^N&lt;/math&gt; is the empirical measure of ''N'' conditionally independent random variables with common probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(\eta_n^N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, we expect &lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1}^N&lt;/math&gt; to be a good approximation of &lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another strategy is to find a collection

:&lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}=\left(K_{\eta_n}(x,y)\right)_{x,y\in S}&lt;/math&gt;

of [[stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;\eta_n\in P(S)&lt;/math&gt; such that

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\sum_{x\in S}\eta_n(x)K_{\eta_n}(x,y)=\Phi(\eta_n)(y)=\eta_{n+1}(y)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This formula allows us to interpret the sequence &lt;math&gt;(\eta_0, \eta_1, \cdots)&lt;/math&gt; as the probability distributions of the random states &lt;math&gt;\left(\overline{X}_0, \overline{X}_1, \cdots \right)&lt;/math&gt; of the nonlinear Markov chain model with elementary transitions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} \left ( \left.\overline{X}_{n+1}=y \right|  \overline{X}_n=x \right )=K_{\eta_n}(x,y), \qquad \text{Law}(\overline{X}_n)=\eta_n.&lt;/math&gt;

A collection of Markov transitions &lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the equation  ({{EquationNote|1}})  is called a McKean interpretation of the sequence of measures &lt;math&gt;\eta_n&lt;/math&gt;.
The mean field particle interpretation of ({{EquationNote|2}})  is now defined by the Markov chain

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_n=\left(\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \cdots, \xi^{(N,N)}_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

on the product space &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt;, starting with ''N'' independent random copies of &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; and elementary transitions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}\left( \left. \xi^{(N,1)}_{n+1}=y^1,\cdots,\xi^{(N,N)}_{n+1}=y^N \right |\xi^{(N)}_n\right)=\prod_{i=1}^N K_{n+1,\eta_n^N}\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y^i\right),&lt;/math&gt;

with the empirical measure

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^N_n=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N1_{\xi^{(N,j)}_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Under some weak regularity conditions&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt; on the mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; for any function &lt;math&gt;f: S\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we have the almost sure convergence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N f\left(\xi^{(N,j)}_n\right)\to_{N\uparrow\infty}E\left(f(\overline{X}_n)\right)=\sum_{x\in S}\eta_n(x)f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

These nonlinear Markov processes and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to time non homogeneous models on general [[measurable space|measurable]] state spaces.&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt;

===Feynman-Kac models===
To illustrate the abstract models presented above, we consider a stochastic matrix &lt;math&gt;M=(M(x,y))_{x,y\in S}&lt;/math&gt; and some function &lt;math&gt;G : S \to (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. We associate with these two objects the mapping

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \Phi : P(S) \to P(S) \\ (\eta_n(x))_{x\in S} \mapsto \left(\Phi(\eta_n)(y)\right)_{y\in S} \end{cases} \qquad \Phi(\eta_n)(y)=\sum_{x\in S} \Psi_{G}(\eta_n)(x)M(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the Boltzmann-Gibbs measures  &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{G}(\eta_n)(x)&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{G}(\eta_n)(x)=\frac{\eta_n(x)G(x)}{\sum_{z\in S}\eta_n(z)G(z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

We denote by &lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}=\left(K_{\eta_n}(x,y)\right)_{x,y\in S}&lt;/math&gt; the collection of stochastic matrices indexed by &lt;math&gt; \eta_n\in P(S)&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}(x,y)=\epsilon G(x) M(x,y)+(1-\epsilon G(x)) \Phi(\eta_n)(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. It is readily checked that the equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) is satisfied. In addition, we can also show (cf. for instance&lt;ref name="dp04"/&gt;) that the solution of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is given by the Feynman-Kac formula

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_n(x) =\frac{E\left(1_x(X_n)\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p)\right)}{E\left(\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p) \right)},&lt;/math&gt;

with a Markov chain &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; with initial distribution &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; and Markov transition ''M''.

For any function &lt;math&gt;f : S\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_n(f):=\sum_{x\in S}\eta_n(x)f(x) =\frac{E\left(f(X_n)\prod_{p=0}^{n-1}G(X_p)\right)}{E\left(\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p)\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;G(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; is the unit function and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;, then we have

:&lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}(x,y)=M(x,y)=\mathbf{P} \left( \left. X_{n+1}=y \right | X_n=x\right), \qquad \eta_n(x) =E\left(1_x(X_n)\right)=\mathbf{P}(X_n=x).&lt;/math&gt;

And the equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) reduces to the [[Chapman-Kolmogorov equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1}(y)=\sum_{x\in S}\eta_n(x)M(x,y) \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \mathbf{P}\left(X_{n+1}=y\right) =\sum_{x\in S} \mathbf{P}(X_{n+1}=y|X_n=x) \mathbf{P}\left(X_n=x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The mean field particle interpretation of this Feynman-Kac model is defined by sampling sequentially ''N'' conditionally independent random variables &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; with probability distribution

:&lt;math&gt;K_{n+1,\eta_n^N}\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\right)=\epsilon G\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right) M\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\right)+\left(1-\epsilon G\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)\right) \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{G\left(\xi^{(N,j)}_n\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^N G\left(\xi^{(N,k)}_n\right)} M\left(\xi^{(N,j)}_n,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, with a probability &lt;math&gt;\epsilon G\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)&lt;/math&gt; the particle &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_n&lt;/math&gt; evolves to a new state &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=y&lt;/math&gt; randomly chosen with the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;M\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_n&lt;/math&gt; jumps to a new location &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,j)}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; randomly chosen with a probability proportional to &lt;math&gt;G\left(\xi^{(N,j)}_n\right)&lt;/math&gt; and evolves to a new state &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=y &lt;/math&gt; randomly chosen with the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;M\left(\xi^{(N,j)}_n, y\right).&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;G(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; is the unit function and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction between the particle vanishes and the particle model reduces to a sequence of independent copies of the Markov chain &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; the mean field particle model described above reduces to a simple [[mutation-selection]] genetic algorithm with fitness function ''G'' and mutation transition ''M''. These nonlinear Markov chain models and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to  time non homogeneous models on general measurable state spaces (including transition states, path spaces and random excursion spaces) and continuous time models.&lt;ref name="kol10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dp04"/&gt;

===Gaussian nonlinear state space models===
We consider a sequence of real valued random variables &lt;math&gt;\left (\overline{X}_0, \overline{X}_1, \cdots \right)&lt;/math&gt; defined sequentially by the equations

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_{n+1}=E\left(a\left(\overline{X}_n\right)\right) b \left (\overline{X}_n \right )+c \left (\overline{X}_n \right )+\sigma W_n&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

with a collection &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; of independent [[Normal distribution|standard Gaussian]] random variables, a positive parameter ''σ'', some functions &lt;math&gt;a,b,c: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt; and some standard Gaussian initial random state &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_0&lt;/math&gt;. We let &lt;math&gt;\eta_n&lt;/math&gt; be the probability distribution of the random state &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt;; that is, for any bounded [[measurable function]] ''f'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;E\left(f(\overline{X}_n)\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}} f(x) \eta_n(dx),&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} \left (\overline{X}_n\in dx \right )=\eta_n(dx)&lt;/math&gt;

The integral is the [[Lebesgue integral]], and ''dx'' stands for an infinitesimal neighborhood of the state ''x''. The [[Markov process|Markov transition]] of the chain is given for any bounded measurable functions ''f'' by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;E\left( \left. f \left (\overline{X}_{n+1} \right ) \right |\overline{X}_n=x\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}} K_{\eta_n}(x,dy) f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;K_{\eta_n}(x,dy)=\mathbf{P} \left ( \left.\overline{X}_{n+1}\in dy\right | \overline{X}_n=x \right )=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp{\left\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(y-\left[b(x)\int_{\mathbf{R}} a(z) \eta_n(dz)+c(x)\right]\right)^2\right\}} dy&lt;/math&gt;

Using the tower property of [[conditional expectation]]s we prove that the probability distributions &lt;math&gt;\eta_n&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the nonlinear equation

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}} \eta_{n+1}(dy) f(y)=\int_{\mathbf{R}}\left[\int_{\mathbf{R}} \eta_n(dx)K_{\eta_n}(x,dy)\right] f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for any bounded measurable functions ''f''. This equation is sometimes written in the more synthetic form

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{n+1} =\Phi\left(\eta_n\right)= \eta_nK_{\eta_n}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\eta_{n+1}(dy)= \left(\eta_nK_{\eta_n}\right)(dy) =\int_{x\in \mathbf{R}}\eta_n(dx)K_{\eta_n}(x,dy)&lt;/math&gt;

The mean field particle interpretation of this model is defined by the Markov chain

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_n=\left(\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \cdots, \xi^{(N,N)}_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

on the product space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N a\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)\right) b\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)+c\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)+\sigma W^i_n\qquad 1\leqslant i\leqslant N
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_0= \left(\xi^{(N,1)}_0, \cdots, \xi^{(N,N)}_0\right), \qquad \left( W^1_n, \cdots, W^N_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

stand for ''N'' independent copies of &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_n; n \geqslant 1,&lt;/math&gt; respectively. For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions ''a'', ''b'', ''c'') we have the almost sure convergence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N f\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_n\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}} f(y) \eta^N_n(dy) \to_{N\uparrow\infty} E\left(f(\overline{X}_n)\right) = \int_{\mathbf{R}}f(y)\eta_n(dy),&lt;/math&gt;

with the empirical measure

:&lt;math&gt; \eta^N_n=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{\xi^{(N,i)}_n}&lt;/math&gt;

for any bounded measurable functions ''f'' (cf. for instance &lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt;). In the above display, &lt;math&gt;\delta_x&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Dirac measure]] at the state ''x''.

===Continuous time mean field models===

We consider a [[standard Brownian motion]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{W}_{t_n}&lt;/math&gt; (a.k.a. [[Wiener Process]]) evaluated on a time mesh sequence &lt;math&gt;t_0=0&lt;t_1&lt;\cdots&lt;t_n&lt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; with a given time step &lt;math&gt;t_n-t_{n-1}=h&lt;/math&gt;. We choose &lt;math&gt;c(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we replace &lt;math&gt;b(x)&lt;/math&gt; and ''σ'' by &lt;math&gt;b(x) \times h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma \times \sqrt{h}&lt;/math&gt;, and we write &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_{t_n}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; the values of the random states evaluated at the time step &lt;math&gt;t_n.&lt;/math&gt; Recalling that &lt;math&gt;\left(\overline{W}_{t_{n+1}}-\overline{W}_{t_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; are independent centered Gaussian random variables with variance  &lt;math&gt;t_n-t_{n-1} = h,&lt;/math&gt; the resulting equation can be rewritten in the following form

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_{t_{n+1}}-\overline{X}_{t_n}=E\left(a\left(\overline{X}_{t_n}\right)\right)b(\overline{X}_{t_n})h+\sigma\left(\overline{W}_{t_{n+1}}-\overline{W}_{t_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

When ''h'' → 0, the above equation converge to the nonlinear diffusion process

:&lt;math&gt;d\overline{X}_{t}=E\left(a\left(\overline{X}_{t}\right)\right)b(\overline{X}_{t})dt+\sigma d\overline{W}_{t}&lt;/math&gt;

The mean field continuous time model associated with these nonlinear diffusions is the (interacting) diffusion process &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_t=\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_t\right)_{1\leqslant i\leqslant N}&lt;/math&gt; on the product space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;d\xi^{(N,i)}_{t}=\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N a\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_t\right)\right)b\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_t\right)+\sigma d\overline{W}_{t}^i\qquad 1\leqslant i\leqslant N&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^{(N)}_0= \left(\xi^{(N,1)}_0, \cdots, \xi^{(N,N)}_0\right), \qquad \left( \overline{W}_{t}^1, \cdots, \overline{W}_t^N\right)&lt;/math&gt;

are ''N'' independent copies of &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{W}_t.&lt;/math&gt; For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions ''a'', ''b'') we have the almost sure convergence

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N f\left(\xi^{(N,i)}_t\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}} f(y) \eta^N_t(dy)\to_{N\uparrow\infty} E\left(f(\overline{X}_t)\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}} f(y) \eta_t(dy)&lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;\eta_t=\text{Law}\left(\overline{X}_{t}\right),&lt;/math&gt; and the empirical measure

:&lt;math&gt; \eta^N_t=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{\xi^{(N,i)}_t}&lt;/math&gt;

for any bounded measurable functions ''f'' (cf. for instance.&lt;ref name="as91"/&gt;). These nonlinear Markov processes and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to interacting jump-diffusion processes&lt;ref name="kol10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dp13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gm92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gm97"/&gt;

'''Microalgae''' or '''microphytes''' are microscopic [[algae]], typically found in [[freshwater]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] systems, living in both the [[water column]] and [[sediment]].&lt;ref name=Thurman /&gt; They are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups. Depending on the species, their sizes can range from a few micrometers (µm) to a few hundred micrometers. Unlike higher plants, microalgae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces. Microalgae, capable of performing [[photosynthesis]], are important for life on earth; they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/microscopic-algae-produce-half-the-oxygen-we-breathe/5041338|title=Microscopic algae produce half the oxygen we breathe|author=|date=25 October 2013|website=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use simultaneously the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. Microalgae, together with bacteria, form the base of the [[food web]] and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them. Microalgae biomass is often measured with [[Chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']] concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production. The standing stock of microphytes is closely related to that of its predators. Without grazing pressures the standing stock of microphytes dramatically decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrush|first1=Simon|last2=Hewitt|first2=Judi|last3=Gibbs|first3=Max|last4=Lundquist|first4=caralyn|last5=Norkko|first5=Alf|title=Functional Role of Large Organisms in Intertidal Communities: Community Effects and Ecosystem Function|journal=Ecosystems|date=2006|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1029–1040|doi=10.1007/s10021-005-0068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biodiversity]] of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource. It has been estimated that about 200,000-800,000 species in many different genera exist of which about 50,000 species are described.&lt;ref name = Flanders&gt;Starckx, Senne (31 October 2012) [http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/place-sun A place in the sun - Algae is the crop of the future, according to researchers in Geel] Flanders Today, Retrieved 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Over 15,000 novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined.&lt;ref name=Cardozo2007 /&gt; Most of these microalgae species produce unique products like [[carotenoid]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[peptide]]s, [[toxin]]s and [[sterol]]s.

The chemical composition of microalgae is not an intrinsic constant factor but varies over a wide range, both depending on species and on cultivation conditions. Some microalgae have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability. A particularly dramatic example is their ability to replace phospholipids with

They provide them with vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the growth of the bivalves which are unable to synthesize it themselves.&lt;ref name=microalgaeifremer /&gt;

In addition, because the cells grow in aqueous suspension, they have more efficient access to water, [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and other nutrients. Microalgae play a major role in nutrient cycling and fixing inorganic carbon into organic molecules.

While [[fish oil]] has become famous for its [[omega-3 fatty acid]] content, fish don't actually produce omega-3s, instead accumulating their omega-3 reserves by consuming microalgae. These omega-3 fatty acids can be obtained in the human diet directly from the microalgae that produce them.

A '''noise weighting''' is a specific amplitude-vs.-[[frequency]] characteristic that is designed to allow subjectively valid measurement of noise. It emphasises the parts of the spectrum that are most important.

Usually, noise means audible noise, in audio systems, broadcast systems or telephone circuits. In this case the [[weighting]] is sometimes referred to as [[Psophometric weighting]], though this term is best avoided because, although strictly a general term, the word Psophometric is sometimes assumed to refer to a particular weighting used in telecommunications.

A major use of noise weighting is in the measurement of residual noise in [[audio equipment]], usually present as hiss or hum in quiet moments of programme material. The purpose of weighting here is to emphasise the parts of the audible spectrum that our ears perceive most readily, and attenuate the parts that contribute less to our perception of loudness, in order to get a measured figure that correlates well with subjective effect. 

The [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] was devised specifically for this purpose, and is widely used in broadcasting, especially in the UK and Europe. [[A-weighting]] is also used, especially in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is only really valid for the measurement of tones, not noise, and is widely incorporated into sound level meters. 

In [[telecommunication]], noise weightings are used by agencies concerned with public telephone service, and various standard curves are based on the characteristics of specific commercial [[telephone]] instruments, representing successive stages of technological development. The [[Channel coding|coding]] of commercial apparatus appears in the nomenclature of certain weightings. The same weighting nomenclature and units are used in military versions of commercial noise measuring sets.

Telecommunication measurements are made in lines terminated either by the measuring set or an instrument of the relevant class.

'''Pesticide application''' refers to the practical way in which [[pesticide]]s, (including [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, or [[nematode]] control agents) are delivered to their ''biological targets'' (''e.g.'' [[Pest (organism)|pest]] organism, [[crop]] or other plant).  Public concern about the use of pesticides has highlighted the need to make this process as efficient as possible, in order to minimise their release into the environment and human exposure (including operators, bystanders and consumers of produce).&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, R.P. (2003) Rational Pesticide Use: spatially and temporally targeted application of specific products.  In: ''Optimising Pesticide Use'' Ed. M. Wilson.  John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK. pp. 129-157&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of pest management by the rational application of pesticides is supremely [[multi-disciplinary]], combining many aspects of [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] with: [[agronomy]], [[engineering]], [[meteorology]], [[socio-economics]] and [[public health]], together with newer disciplines such as [[biotechnology]] and [[information science]].

== Seed treatments ==
[[Seed treatment]]s can achieve exceptionally high efficiencies, in terms of effective dose-transfer to a crop.  Pesticides are applied to the seed prior to planting, in the form of a seed treatment, or [[coating]], to protect against soil-borne risks to the plant; additionally, these coatings can provide supplemental chemicals and [[nutrients]] designed to encourage growth.  A typical seed coating can include a nutrient layer—containing [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]], a [[rhizobia]]l layer—containing [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] and other beneficial [[microorganisms]], and a fungicide (or other chemical) layer to make the seed less vulnerable to pests.

== Spray application ==
One of the most common forms of pesticide application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of mechanical [[sprayer]]s.  Hydraulic sprayers consists of a [[tank]], a [[pump]], a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple nozzles).  Sprayers convert a [[pesticide formulation]], often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid chemical carrier, such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles.  This conversion is accomplished by forcing the spray mixture through a [[spray nozzle]] under pressure.  The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both.   Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to [[pesticide drift|spray drift]], but require more water per unit of land covered.  Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.

===Spraying pre- and post-emergent crops===
[[File:8103 Liquid Terragator.JPG|thumb|right|Large self-propelled agricultural 'floater' sprayer, engaged in pre-emergent pesticide application]]
[[File:1264 Rogator Spraying Corn.JPG|thumb|right|Self-propelled row-crop sprayer applying pesticide to post-emergent corn]]

Traditional agricultural crop pesticides can either be applied pre-emergent or post-emergent, a term referring to the [[germination]] status of the plant.  [[Pre-emergent herbicides|Pre-emergent]] pesticide application, in [[conventional agriculture]], attempts to reduce competitive pressure on newly germinated plants by removing undesirable organisms and maximizing the amount of water, soil nutrients, and sunlight available for the crop.  An example of pre-emergent pesticide application is [[atrazine]] application for [[maize|corn]].  Similarly, [[glyphosate]] mixtures are often applied pre-emergent on agricultural fields to remove early-germinating weeds and prepare for subsequent crops.  Pre-emergent application equipment often has large, wide tires designed to float on soft soil, minimizing both soil compaction and damage to planted (but not yet emerged) crops.  A three-wheel application machine, such as the one pictured on the right, is designed so that tires do not follow the same path, minimizing the creation of ruts in the field and limiting sub-soil damage.

Post-emergent pesticide application requires the use of specific chemicals chosen to minimize harm to the desirable target organism.  An example is [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]], which will injure [[broadleaf]] [[weed]]s ([[dicots]]) but leave behind [[grass]]es ([[monocots]]). Such a chemical has been used extensively on [[wheat]] crops, for example.  A number of companies have also created genetically modified organisms that are resistant to various pesticides.  Examples include [[Glyphosate#Genetically modified crops|glyphosate-resistant soybeans]] and [[Bacillus thuringiensis#Genetic engineering for pest control|Bt maize]], which change the types of formulations involved in addressing post-emergent pesticide pressure.  It is important to also note that even given appropriate chemical choices, high ambient temperatures or other environmental influences, can allow the non-targeted desirable organism to be damaged during application.  As plants have already germinated, post-emergent pesticide application necessitates limited field contact in order to minimize losses due to crop and soil damage.  Typical industrial application equipment will utilize very tall and narrow tires and combine this with a sprayer body which can be raised and lowered depending on crop height.  These sprayers usually carry the label ‘high-clearance’ as they can rise over growing crops, although usually not much more than 1 or 2 meters high.  In addition, these sprayers often have very wide booms in order to minimize the number of passes required over a field, again designed to limit crop damage and maximize efficiency.  In [[industrial agriculture]], spray booms 120 feet (40 meters) wide are not uncommon, especially in prairie agriculture with large, flat fields.  Related to this, [[aerial application|aerial pesticide application]] is a method of [[top dressing]] a pesticide to an emerged crop which eliminates physical contact with soil and crops.

Air Blast sprayers, also known as air-assisted or mist sprayers, are often used for tall crops, such as tree fruit, where boom sprayers and aerial application would be ineffective.  These types of sprayers can only be used where overspray—spray drift—is less of a concern, either through the choice of chemical which does not have undesirable effects on other desirable organisms, or by adequate buffer distance.  These can be used for insects, weeds, and other pests to crops, humans, and animals.  Air blast sprayers inject liquid into a fast-moving stream of air, breaking down large droplets into smaller particles by introducing a small amount of liquid into a fast-moving stream of air.&lt;ref&gt;Waxman, Michael F., (1998) Application Equipment.  In: ''Agrochemical and Pesticide Safety Handbook'' Ed. M. Wilson.  CRC Press, Boca Raton ({{ISBN|978-1-56670-296-6}}) pp. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fogger]]s fulfill a similar role to mist sprayers in producing particles of very small size, but use a different method.  Whereas mist sprayers create a high-speed stream of air which can travel significant distances, foggers use a piston or bellows to create a stagnant area of pesticide that is often used for enclosed areas, such as houses and animal shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dropdata.org/DD/sprayers.htm#Foggers |title=DropData application pages |publisher=Dropdata.org |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spraying inefficiencies ===
[[File:Env contamination1.if.gif|600px|right|Sources of environmental contamination with pesticides]]

In order to better understand the cause of the spray inefficiency, it is useful to reflect on the implications of the large range of [[drop (liquid)#Droplet|droplet]] sizes produced by typical (hydraulic) spray nozzles.  This has long been recognized to be one of the most important concepts in spray application (''e.g''. Himel, 1969&lt;ref&gt;Himel C M (1969)  The optimum drop size for insecticide spray droplets. ''Journal of Economic Entomology'' '''62:''' 919-925.&lt;/ref&gt;), bringing about enormous variations in the properties of droplets.

Historically, dose-transfer to the biological target (''i.e.'' the [[pest (organism)|pest]]) has been shown to be inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Bryce, I.J. (1977)  Crop protection: a consideration of the effectiveness and disadvantages of current methods and of the scope for improvement.  ''Philosophical Transactions Royal Society London B.'' 281: 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, relating "ideal" deposits with biological effect is fraught with difficulty&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, E.C. (1987)  Can we define and achieve optimum pesticide deposits?  ''Aspects of Applied Biology'' '''14:''' 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt;), but in spite of Hislop’s misgivings about detail, there have been several demonstrations that massive amounts of pesticides are wasted by run-off from the crop and into the soil, in a process called endo-drift.  This is a less familiar form of [[pesticide drift]], with exo-drift causing much greater public concern.  Pesticides are conventionally applied using [http://www.dropdata.org/DD/noz_data.htm#hydraulic hydraulic atomisers], either on hand-held sprayers or tractor booms, where formulations are mixed into high volumes of water.

Different droplet sizes have dramatically different dispersal characteristics, and are subject to complex macro- and micro-climatic interactions (Bache &amp; Johnstone, 1992).  Greatly simplifying these interactions in terms of droplet size and wind speed, Craymer &amp; Boyle&lt;ref&gt;Craymer, H.E., Boyle, D.G. (1973)  ''The micrometeorology and physics of spray particle behaviour'' Pesticide Spray Technology Workshop, Emeryville, California, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that there are essentially three sets of conditions under which droplets move from the nozzle to the target.  These are where:
* sedimentation dominates: typically larger (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;µm) droplets applied at low wind-speeds; droplets above this size are appropriate for minimising drift contamination by herbicides.
* turbulent eddies dominate: typically small droplets (&lt;50&amp;nbsp;µm) that are usually considered most appropriate for targeting flying insects, unless an electrostatic charge is also present that provides the necessary force to attract droplets to foliage.  (NB: the latter effects only operate at very short distances, typically under 10&amp;nbsp;mm.)
* intermediate conditions where both sedimentation and drift effects are important.  Most agricultural insecticide and fungicide spraying is optimised by using relatively small (say 50-150&amp;nbsp;µm) droplets in order to maximize “coverage” (droplets per unit area), but are also subject to drift.

====Herbicide volatilisation====
'''Herbicide volatilisation''' refers to [[evaporation]] or [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of a volatile [[herbicide]]. The effect of gaseous chemical is lost at its intended place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants not intended to be affected causing crop damage. Herbicides vary in their susceptibility to volatilisation. Prompt incorporation of the herbicide into the soil may reduce or prevent volatilisation. Wind, temperature, and humidity also affect the rate of volatilisation with humidity reducing in. [[2,4-D]] and [[dicamba]] are commonly used chemicals that are known to be subject to volatilisation&lt;ref name=NYTDOWCorn&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Corn, Resistant to a Weed Killer, Runs Into Opposition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/energy-environment/dow-weed-killer-runs-into-opposition.html|accessdate=April 25, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2012|author=Andrew Pollack}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many others.&lt;ref name=MSUHV&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting the Most from Soil-Applied Herbicides|url=http://scarab.msu.montana.edu/CropWeedSearch/Docs/GettingtheMostfromSoil-AppliedHerbicides.htm|publisher=Montana State University|accessdate=April 25, 2012|author=Fabian Menalled and William E.

=== Improved targeting ===
[[File:Ulvmast1.JPG|thumb|right|The Ulvamast Mk II: a ULV sprayer for [[locust]] control (photo taken in Niger)]]

In the 1970s and 1980s improved application technologies such as controlled droplet application (CDA) received extensive research interest, but commercial uptake has been disappointing.  By controlling droplet size, [[ultra-low volume]] (ULV) or very low volume (VLV) application rates of pesticidal mixtures can achieve similar (or sometimes better) biological results by improved timing and dose-transfer to the biological target (''i.e.'' pest).  No atomizer has been developed able to produce uniform (monodisperse) droplets, but rotary (spinning disc and cage) atomizers usually produce a more uniform droplet size spectrum than conventional hydraulic nozzles (see: [http://www.dropdata.org/DD/sprayers.htm#CDA CDA &amp; ULV application equipment]).  Other efficient application techniques include: banding, baiting, specific granule placement, seed treatments and weed wiping.

CDA is a good example of a rational pesticide use (RPU) technology (Bateman, 2003), but unfortunately has been unfashionable with public funding bodies since the early 1990s, with many believing that all pesticide development should be the responsibility of pesticide manufacturers.  On the other hand, pesticide companies are unlikely widely to promote better targeting and thus reduced pesticide sales, unless they can benefit by adding value to products in some other way.  RPU contrasts dramatically with the promotion of pesticides, and many agrochemical concerns, have equally become aware that product stewardship provides better long-term profitability than high pressure salesmanship of a dwindling number of new “silver bullet” molecules.  RPU may therefore provide an appropriate framework for collaboration between many of the stake-holders in crop protection.

Understanding the biology and life cycle of the pest is also an important factor in determining droplet size.  The [[Agricultural Research Service]], for example, has conducted tests to determine the ideal droplet size of a pesticide used to combat [[Helicoverpa zea|corn earworms]].  They found that in order to be effective, the pesticide needs to penetrate through the corn’s silk, where the earworm’s larvae hatch.  The research concluded that larger pesticide droplets best penetrated the targeted corn silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Quality and Assessment of Equipment===
[[File:WHO compression sprayer test.jpg|thumb|[[IPARC]] houses and carries out the [[World Health Organization]] fatigue test for pressurised equipment: used for indoor residue spraying (IRS) against mosquitoes, other disease vectors and (sometimes) in agriculture]]

Ensuring quality of sprayers by testing and setting of standards for application equipment is important to ensure users get value for money.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, G.A. and Thornhill E.W. (1994) ''Pesticide Application Equipment for use in Agriculture''. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt;  Since most equipment uses various hydraulic nozzles, various initiatives have attempted to classify spray quality, starting with the BCPC system.&lt;ref&gt;Doble, S.J., Matthews, G.A., Rutherford, I. &amp; Southcombe, E.S.E. (1985) A system for classifying hydraulic nozzle and other atomisers into categories of spray quality. ''Proc. for BCPC Conference'',  p. 1125-1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan C M, C R Tuck, M C Butler Ellis, P C H Miller, R Bateman (2010).

===Application methods for household insecticides===
Pest management in the home begins with restricting the availability to insects of three vital commodities: shelter, water and food. If insects become a problem despite such measures, it may become necessary to control them using chemical methods, '''targeting''' the [[active ingredient]] to the particular pest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before spraying wildly at anything that moves, consider more reasoned approach|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/spraying-wildly-anything-moves-consider-more-reasoned-approach|work=reviewjournal.com|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Insect repellent]], referred to as "bug spray", comes in a [[plastic bottle]] or [[aerosol spray|aerosol]] can. Applied to clothing, arms, legs, and other extremities, the use of these products will tend to ward off nearby insects. This is not an insecticide.

Insecticide used for killing [[Pest (animal)|pests]]—most often [[insect]]s, and [[arachnid]]s—primarily comes in an aerosol can, and is sprayed directly on the insect or its nest as a means of killing it. Fly sprays will kill [[house fly|house flies]], [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]], [[ant]]s, [[cockroach]]es and other [[insect]]s and also [[spider]]s. Other preparations are granules or liquids that are formulated with bait that is eaten by insects. For many household pests bait traps are available that contain the pesticide and either pheromone or food baits. Crack and crevice sprays are applied into and around openings in houses such as baseboards and plumbing. Pesticides to control [[termites]] are often injected into and around the foundations of homes.

Active ingredients of many household insecticides include [[permethrin]] and [[tetramethrin]], which act on the nervous system of insects and arachnids.

Bug sprays should be used in well ventilated areas only, as the chemicals contained in the aerosol and most insecticides can be harmful or deadly to humans and pets. All insecticide products including solids, baits and bait traps should be applied such that they are out of reach of wildlife, pets and children.

'''Physics beyond the Standard Model''' ('''BSM''') refers to the theoretical developments needed to explain the deficiencies of the [[Standard Model]], such as the [[origin of mass]], the [[strong CP problem]], [[neutrino oscillation]]s, [[baryon asymmetry|matter–antimatter asymmetry]], and the nature of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=sym-v2-feb-05&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem lies within the [[Quantum field theory|mathematical framework]] of the Standard Model itself: the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of [[general relativity]], to the point where one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known [[spacetime]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] like the [[Big Bang]] and [[black hole]] [[event horizons]]).

Theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through [[supersymmetry]], such as the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) and [[Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as [[string theory]], [[M-theory]], and [[extra dimensions]]. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the "best step" towards a [[Theory of Everything]], can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics]].

==Problems with the Standard Model==
Despite being the most successful theory of particle physics to date, the Standard Model is not perfect.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of "Beyond the Standard Model" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed.

===Phenomena not explained===
The Standard Model is inherently an incomplete theory.  There are fundamental physical phenomena in nature that the Standard Model does not adequately explain:
* ''[[Gravity]]''. The standard model does not explain gravity. The approach of simply adding a [[graviton]] to the Standard Model does not recreate what is observed experimentally without other modifications, as yet undiscovered, to the Standard Model. Moreover, instead, the Standard Model is widely considered to be incompatible with the most successful theory of gravity to date, [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |quote=One can find thousands of statements in the literature to the effect that “general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible”. These are completely outdated and no longer relevant. Effective field theory shows that general relativity and quantum mechanics work together perfectly normally over a range of scales and curvatures, including those relevant for the world that we see around us. However, effective field theories are only valid over some range of scales. General relativity certainly does have problematic issues at extreme scales. There are important problems which the effective field theory does not solve because they are beyond its range of validity. However, this means that the issue of quantum gravity is not what we thought it to be. Rather than a fundamental incompatibility of quantum mechanics and gravity, we are in the more familiar situation of needing a more complete theory beyond the range of their combined applicability. The usual marriage of general relativity and quantum mechanics is fine at ordinary energies, but we now seek to uncover the modifications that must be present in more extreme conditions. This is the modern view of the problem of quantum gravity, and it represents progress over the outdated view of the past."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dark matter]]''. Cosmological observations tell us the standard model explains about 5% of the energy present in the universe. About 26% should be dark matter,{{cn|date=September 2018}} which would behave just like other matter, but which only interacts weakly (if at all) with the Standard Model fields. Yet, the Standard Model does not supply any fundamental particles that are good dark matter candidates.
* ''[[Dark energy]]''. The remaining 69% of universe's energy should be so called dark energy, a constant energy density for the vacuum. Attempts to explain dark energy in terms of [[vacuum energy]] of the standard model lead to a mismatch of 120 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, L. (2009). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo ''A Universe from Nothing'']. AAI Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Neutrino]] masses''. According to the standard model, neutrinos are massless particles. However, [[neutrino oscillation]] experiments have shown that neutrinos do have mass. Mass terms for the neutrinos can be added to the standard model by hand, but these lead to new theoretical problems. For example, the mass terms need to be extraordinarily small and it is not clear if the neutrino masses would arise in the same way that the masses of other fundamental particles do in the Standard Model.
* ''[[Baryon asymmetry|Matter–antimatter asymmetry]]''. The universe is made out of mostly matter. However, the standard model predicts that matter and antimatter should have been created in (almost) equal amounts if the initial conditions of the universe did not involve disproportionate matter relative to antimatter. Yet, no mechanism sufficient to explain this asymmetry exists in the Standard Model.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==== Experimental results not explained ====
No experimental result is accepted as definitively contradicting the Standard Model at the five [[standard deviation|sigma]] level, widely considered to be the threshold of a discovery in particle physics. But because every experiment contains some degree of statistical and systemic uncertainty, and the theoretical predictions themselves are also almost never calculated exactly and are subject to uncertainties in measurements of the fundamental constants of the Standard Model (some of which are tiny and others of which are substantial), it is mathematically expected that some of the hundreds of experimental tests of the Standard Model will deviate to some extent from it, even if there were no new physics to be discovered.

At any given time there are a number of experimental results that are significantly different from the Standard Model expectation, although many of these have been found to be statistical flukes or experimental errors as more data has been collected. On the other hand, any physics beyond the Standard Model would necessarily first manifest experimentally as a statistically significant difference between an experiment and the theoretical prediction.

In each case, physicists seek to determine if a result is a mere statistical fluke or experimental error on the one hand, or a sign of new physics on the other. More statistically significant results cannot be mere statistical flukes but can still result from experimental error or inaccurate estimates of experimental precision. Frequently, experiments are tailored to be more sensitive to experimental results that would distinguish the Standard Model from theoretical alternatives.

Some of the most notable examples include the following:

* ''[[Proton radius puzzle]]'' – the Standard Model makes precise theoretical predictions regarding the atomic radius size of ordinary hydrogen (a proton-electron system) and that of muonic hydrogen (a proton-muon system in which a [[muon]] is behaving as a heavy variant of an electron). However, the measured atomic radius of muonic hydrogen differs significantly from that of the radius predicted by the Standard Model using existing physical constant measurements by what appears to be as many as seven standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Randolf Pohl |author2=Ronald Gilman |author3=Gerald A. Miller |author4=Krzysztof Pachucki |year=2013 |title=Muonic hydrogen and the proton radius puzzle |arxiv=1301.0905 |journal=[[Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part.

The latter is composed from the electronic hydrogenate atom value of 0.8758(77) fm and from a similar value with larger uncertainties determined by electron scattering.|bibcode = 2013ARNPS..63..175P |pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doubts about the accuracy of the error estimates in earlier experiments, which are still within 4% of each other in measuring a truly tiny distance, and a lack of a well motivated theory that could explain the discrepancy, have caused physicists to be hesitant to describe these results as contradicting the Standard Model despite the apparent statistical significance of the result and a lack of any clearly identified possible source of experimental error in the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Proton Radius Puzzle |arxiv=1502.05314 |bibcode=2015PrPNP..82...59C |doi= 10.1016/j.ppnp.2015.01.002 |volume=82 |first=Carl E. |last=Carlson |date=May 2015 |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |pages=59–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of muon'' – the experimentally measured value of muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (muon "g&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2") is significantly different from the Standard Model prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1311.2198|title=The Muon (g&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;2) Theory Value: Present and Future

* ''B meson decay etc.'' – results from a BaBar experiment may suggest a surplus over Standard Model predictions of a type of particle decay ({{nowrap|{{overline|B}} → D&lt;sup&gt;(*)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;τ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;{{overline|ν}}&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;}}). In this, an electron and positron collide, resulting in a [[B meson]] and an antimatter {{overline|B}} meson, which then decays into a [[D meson]] and a [[tau lepton]] as well as a [[tau antineutrino]]. While the level of certainty of the excess (3.4&amp;nbsp;sigma in statistical language) is not enough to claim a break from the Standard Model, the results are a potential sign of something amiss and are likely to affect existing theories, including those attempting to deduce the properties of Higgs bosons.&lt;ref name="BaBar Data Suggests Possible Flaws in the Standard Model June 18 19, 2012"&gt;

===Theoretical predictions not observed===
Observation at [[particle collider]]s of all of the fundamental particles predicted by the Standard Model has been confirmed.  The [[Higgs boson]] is predicted by the Standard Model's explanation of the [[Higgs mechanism]], which describes how the weak SU(2) gauge symmetry is broken and how fundamental particles obtain mass; it was the last particle predicted by the Standard Model to be observed. On July 4, 2012, [[CERN]] scientists using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] announced the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, with a mass of about {{val|126|ul=GeV/c2}}. A Higgs boson was confirmed to exist on March 14, 2013, although efforts to confirm that it has all of the properties predicted by the Standard Model are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;

A few [[hadron]]s (i.e. composite particles made of [[quark]]s) whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model, which can be produced only at very high energies in very low frequencies have not yet been definitively observed, and "[[glueball]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marco Frasca |title=What is a Glueball? |date=March 31, 2009 |url=http://marcofrasca.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/what-is-a-glueball-2/ |website=The Gauge Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. composite particles made of [[gluon]]s) have also not yet been definitively observed. Some very low frequency particle decays predicted by the Standard Model have also not yet been definitively observed because insufficient data is available to make a statistically significant observation.

===Theoretical problems===
Some features of the standard model are added in an [[ad hoc]] way. These are not problems per se (i.e. the theory works fine with these ad hoc features), but they imply a lack of understanding.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These ad hoc features have motivated theorists to look for more fundamental theories with fewer parameters. Some of the ad hoc features are:
* ''[[Hierarchy problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model introduces particle masses through a process known as [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] caused by the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] field. Within the standard model, the mass of the Higgs gets some very large quantum corrections due to the presence of [[virtual particle]]s (mostly virtual [[top quark]]s). These corrections are much larger than the actual mass of the Higgs. This means that the [[bare mass]] parameter of the Higgs in the standard model must be [[fine-tuning|fine tuned]] in such a way that almost completely cancels the quantum corrections.&lt;ref name="Hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/ |title=The Hierarchy Problem |website=Of Particular Significance |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This level of fine-tuning is deemed [[naturalness (physics)|unnatural]] by many theorists.{{who?|date=September 2018}}
* ''Number of parameters''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model depends on 19 numerical parameters. Their values are known from experiment, but the origin of the values is unknown. Some theorists{{who?|date=September 2018}} have tried to find relations between different parameters, for example, between the masses of particles in different [[generation (physics)|generations]].or calculating particle masses, such as in [[Physics_applications_of_asymptotically_safe_gravity#The_mass_of_the_Higgs_boson | asymptotic safety]] scenarios. {{cn|date=September 2018}}
* ''[[Quantum triviality]]''&amp;nbsp;– suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar Higgs particles.  This is sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=David J E Callaway | first=D. J.

* ''[[Strong CP problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– theoretically it can be argued that the standard model should contain a term that breaks [[CP symmetry]]—relating matter to [[antimatter]]—in the [[strong interaction]] sector. Experimentally, however, no such violation has been found, implying that the coefficient of this term is very close to zero.&lt;ref name= "Strong CP problem"&gt;{{cite conference | first = Thomas | last = Mannel | authorlink = | title = Theory and Phenomenology of CP Violation | booktitle = Nuclear Physics B, vol. 167 | volume = 167 | pages = 170–174 | publisher = Elsevier | conference = The 7th International Conference on Hyperons, Charm And Beauty Hadrons (BEACH 2006) | date = 2–8 July 2006 | location = Lancaster | url = https://indico.cern.ch/event/427023/session/6/contribution/43/attachments/912026/1288208/Lancester-Mannel-Proc.pdf

==Grand unified theories==
{{Main|Grand Unified Theory}}
The standard model has three [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]; the [[color charge|colour]] [[SU(3)]], the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]], and the [[weak hypercharge]] [[U(1)]] symmetry, corresponding to the three fundamental forces. Due to [[renormalization]] the coupling constants of each of these symmetries vary with the energy at which they are measured. Around {{val|e=16|u=GeV}} these couplings become approximately equal. This has led to speculation that above this energy the three gauge symmetries of the standard model are unified in one single gauge symmetry with a [[simple group]] gauge group, and just one coupling constant. Below this energy the symmetry is [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to the standard model symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories that unify the standard model symmetries in this way are called [[Grand Unified Theories]] (or GUTs), and the energy scale at which the unified symmetry is broken is called the GUT scale. Generically, grand unified theories predict the creation of [[magnetic monopole]]s in the early universe,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these have been observed, and this absence of observation puts limits on the possible GUTs.

==Supersymmetry==
{{Main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of ''supersymmetric particles'', abbreviated as ''[[superpartner|sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by 1/2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s may not be powerful enough to produce them.

==Neutrinos==
In the standard model, [[neutrino]]s have exactly zero mass. This is a consequence of the standard model containing only [[chirality (physics)|left-handed]] neutrinos. With no suitable right-handed partner, it is impossible to add a renormalizable mass term to the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements however indicated that neutrinos [[neutrino oscillations|spontaneously change flavour]], which implies that neutrinos have a mass. These measurements only give the mass differences between the different flavours. The best constraint on the absolute mass of the neutrinos comes from precision measurements of [[tritium]] decay, providing an upper limit 2&amp;nbsp;eV, which makes them at least five orders of magnitude lighter than the other particles in the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

One approach to add masses to the neutrinos, the so-called [[seesaw mechanism]], is to add right-handed neutrinos and have these couple to left-handed neutrinos with a [[Dirac mass]] term. The right-handed neutrinos have to be [[sterile neutrino|sterile]], meaning that they do not participate in any of the standard model interactions. Because they have no charges, the right-handed neutrinos can act as their own anti-particles, and have a [[Majorana mass]] term. Like the other Dirac masses in the standard model, the neutrino Dirac mass is expected to be generated through the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore unpredictable. The standard model fermion masses differ by many orders of magnitude; the Dirac neutrino mass has at least the same uncertainty. On the other hand, the Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos does not arise from the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore expected to be tied to some energy scale of new physics beyond the standard model, for example the Planck scale.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any process involving right-handed neutrinos will be suppressed at low energies. The correction due to these suppressed processes effectively gives the left-handed neutrinos a mass that is inversely proportional to the right-handed Majorana mass, a mechanism known as the see-saw.&lt;ref name="TASI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of heavy right-handed neutrinos thereby explains both the small mass of the left-handed neutrinos and the absence of the right-handed neutrinos in observations.
However, due to the uncertainty in the Dirac neutrino masses, the right-handed neutrino masses can lie anywhere. For example, they could be as light as keV and be [[dark matter]],&lt;ref&gt;

The mass terms mix neutrinos of different generations. This mixing is parameterized by the [[PMNS matrix]], which is the neutrino analogue of the [[CKM matrix|CKM quark mixing matrix]]. Unlike the quark mixing, which is almost minimal, the mixing of the neutrinos appears to be almost maximal. This has led to various speculations of symmetries between the various generations that could explain the mixing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixing matrix could also contain several complex phases that break CP invariance, although there has been no experimental probe of these. These phases could potentially create a surplus of leptons over anti-leptons in the early universe, a process known as [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]. This asymmetry could then at a later stage be converted in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons, and explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.&lt;ref name="Buchmller" /&gt;

The light neutrinos are disfavored as an explanation for the observation of dark matter, due to considerations of large-scale structure formation in the early universe. Simulations of [[structure formation]] show that they are too hot—i.e. their kinetic energy is large compared to their mass—while formation of structures similar to the galaxies in our universe requires [[cold dark matter]]. The simulations show that neutrinos can at best explain a few percent of the missing dark matter. However, the heavy sterile right-handed neutrinos ''are'' a possible candidate for a dark matter [[weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Preon models==

Several [[preon]] models have been proposed to address the unsolved problem concerning the fact that there are three generations of quarks and leptons. Preon models generally postulate some additional new particles which are further postulated to be able to combine to form the quarks and leptons of the standard model. One of the earliest preon models was the [[Rishon model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harari |first=H. |year=1979 |title=A Schematic Model of Quarks and Leptons |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=83–86|bibcode = 1979PhLB...86...83H |doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(79)90626-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shupe |first=M.

To date, no preon model is widely accepted or fully verified.

==Theories of everything==

===Theory of everything===
{{Main|Theory of everything}}
Theoretical physics continues to strive toward a theory of everything, a theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of any experiment that could be carried out in principle.  In practical terms the immediate goal in this regard is to develop a theory which would unify the Standard Model with [[General Relativity]] in a theory of [[quantum gravity]].  Additional features, such as overcoming conceptual flaws in either theory or accurate prediction of particle masses, would be desired.
The challenges in putting together such a theory are not just conceptual - they include the experimental aspects of the very high energies needed to probe exotic realms.

Several notable attempts in this direction are [[supersymmetry]], string theory, and [[loop quantum gravity]].

===String theory===
{{Main|String theory}}
Extensions, revisions, replacements, and reorganizations of the Standard Model exist in attempt to correct for these and other issues. [[String theory]] is one such reinvention, and many theoretical physicists think that such theories are the next theoretical step toward a true [[Theory of Everything]]. Theories of [[quantum gravity]] such as [[loop quantum gravity]] and others are thought by some to be promising candidates to the mathematical unification of quantum field theory and general relativity, requiring less drastic changes to existing theories.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the numerous variants of string theory, [[M-theory]], whose mathematical existence was first proposed at a String Conference in 1995, is believed by many to be a proper [[Theory of Everything|"ToE"]] candidate, notably by physicists [[Brian Greene]] and [[Stephen Hawking]]. Though a full mathematical description is not yet known, solutions to the theory exist for specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Pg166 bioreactor.jpg|thumb|200px|A pilot plant of a bioreactor]]
A '''pilot plant''' is a pre-commercial production system that employs new production technology and/or produces small volumes of new technology-based products, mainly for the purpose of learning about the new technology. The knowledge obtained is then used for [[design]] of full-scale production systems and commercial products, as well as for identification of further research objectives and support of investment decisions. Other (non-technical) purposes include gaining public support for new technologies and questioning government regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Hellsmark, Johan Frishammar, Patrik Söderholm, Håkan Ylinenpää, The role of pilot and demonstration plants in technology development and innovation policy, Research Policy, Volume 45, Issue 9, November 2016, Pages 1743-1761, ISSN 0048-7333, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2016.05.005.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot plant is a relative term in the sense that pilot plants are typically smaller than full-scale production plants, but are built in a range of sizes.  Also, as pilot plants are intended for learning, they typically are more flexible, possibly at the expense of economy. Some pilot plants are built in [[laboratory|laboratories]] using stock lab equipment, while others require substantial engineering efforts, cost millions of dollars, and are custom-assembled and fabricated from process equipment, instrumentation and piping.   They can also be used to train personnel for a full-scale plant. Pilot plants tend to be smaller compared to demonstration plants.

==Terminology==

A word similar to pilot plant is [[pilot line]].&lt;ref&gt;Pilot Production in Key Enabling Technologies; Crossing the Valley of Death and boosting the industrial deployment of Key Enabling Technologies in Europe,  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO on behalf of the European Commission, DG GROW—Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SME, 2015. {{ISBN|978-92-79-52140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, pilot plants and pilot lines perform the same functions, but 'pilot plant' is used in the context of (bio)chemical and advanced materials production systems, whereas 'pilot line' is used for new technology in general.

==Risk management==
Pilot plants are used to reduce the risk associated with construction of large process plants. They do so in several ways:
*Computer simulations and semi-empirical methods are used to determine the limitations of the pilot scale system. These mathematical models are then tested in a physical pilot-scale plant. Various modeling methods are used for scale-up. These methods include:
**Chemical similitude studies
**Mathematical modeling
**Aspen Plus/Aspen HYSYS modeling
**Finite Elemental Analysis (FEA)
**Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
***These theoretical modeling methods return the following:
****Finalized mass and energy balances
****Optimized system design and capacity
****Equipment requirements 
****System limitations
****The basis for determining the cost to build the pilot module
*They are substantially less expensive to build than full-scale plants.  The [[business]] does not put as much [[Financial capital|capital]] at risk on a project that may be inefficient or unfeasible.  Further, design changes can be made more cheaply at the pilot scale and kinks in the process can be worked out before the large plant is constructed.
*They provide valuable [[data]] for design of the full-scale plant.  Scientific data about reactions, material properties, corrosiveness, for instance, may be available, but it is difficult to predict the behavior of a process of any complexity. Engineering data from other process may be available, but this data can not always be clearly applied to the process of interest.  Designers use data from the pilot plant to refine their design of the production scale facility.

If a system is well defined and the engineering [[parameter]]s are known, pilot plants are not used.  For instance, a business that wants to expand production capacity by building a new plant that does the same thing as an existing plant may choose to not use a pilot plant.

Additionally, advances in [[process simulation]] on computers have increased the confidence of process designers and reduced the need for pilot plants.  However, they are still used as even state-of-the-art simulation cannot accurately predict the behavior of complex systems.

==Scale dependence of plant properties==
As a system increases in size, system properties that depend on quantity of matter (with [[extensive properties]]) may change. The surface area to liquid ratio in a chemical plant is a good example of such a property. On a small chemical scale, in a flask, say, there is a relatively large surface area to liquid ratio. However, if the reaction in question is scaled up to fit in a 500-gallon tank, the surface area to liquid ratio becomes much smaller. As a result of this difference in surface area to liquid ratio, the exact nature of the thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics of the process change in a non-linear fashion. This is why a reaction in a beaker can behave vastly differently from the same reaction in a large-scale production process.

===Other factors===
Other factors that may change during the transformation to a production scale include:
*Reaction kinetics
*Chemical equilibrium
*Material properties
*Fluid dynamics
*Thermodynamics
*Equipment selection
*Agitation
*Uniformity / homogeneity

After data has been collected from operation of a pilot plant, a larger production-scale facility may be built. Alternatively, a demonstration plant, which is typically bigger than a pilot plant, but smaller than a full-scale production plant, may be built to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the process. Businesses sometimes continue to operate the pilot plant in order to test ideas for new products, new feedstocks, or different operating conditions.  Alternatively, they may be operated as production facilities, augmenting production from the main plant.

Recent trends try to keep the size of the plant a small as possible to save costs. This approach is called [[miniplant]] technology. The [[flow chemistry]] takes up this trend and uses [[flow miniplant]] technology for small-scale manufacturing.

==Bench scale vs pilot vs demonstration==
The differences between bench scale, pilot scale and demonstration scale are strongly influenced by industry and application. Some industries use pilot plant and demonstration plant interchangeably. Some pilot plants are built as portable modules that can be easily transported as a contained unit. 
 
For batch processes, in the pharmaceutical industry for example, bench scale is typically conducted on samples 1–20&amp;nbsp;kg or less, whereas pilot scale testing is performed with samples of 20–100&amp;nbsp;kg. Demonstration scale is essentially operating the equipment at full commercial feed rates over extended time periods to prove operational stability.
 
For continuous processes, in the petroleum industry for example, bench scale systems are typically microreactor or CSTR systems with less than 1000 mL of catalyst, studying reactions and/or separations on a once-through basis. Pilot plants will typically have reactors with catalyst volume between 1 and 100 litres, and will often incorporate product separation and gas/liquid recycle with the goal of closing the mass balance. Demonstration plants, also referred to as semi-works plants, will study the viability of the process on a pre-commercial scale, with typical catalyst volumes in the 100 - 1000 litre range. The design of a demonstration scale plant for a continuous process will closely resemble that of the anticipated future commercial plant, albeit at a much lower throughput, and its goal is to study catalyst performance and operating lifetime over an extended period, while generating significant quantities of product for market testing.
 
In the development of new processes, the design and operation of the pilot and demonstration plant will often run in parallel with the design of the future commercial plant, and the results from pilot testing programs are key to optimizing the commercial plant flowsheet. It is common in cases where process technology has been successfully implemented that the savings at the commercial scale resulting from pilot testing will significantly outweigh the cost of the pilot plant itself.

==Steps to creating a custom pilot plant==
Custom pilot plants are commonly designed either for research or commercial purposes. They can range in size from a small system with no automation and low flow, to a highly automated system producing relatively large amounts of products in a day. No matter the size, the steps to designing and fabricating a working pilot plant are the same. They are:

# Pre-engineering - completing a process flow diagram (PFD), basic piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;ID's) and initial equipment layouts. 
# Engineering modeling and optimization - 2D and 3D models are created, using a simulation software to model the process parameters and scale the chemical processes. These modeling software help determine system limitations, non-linear chemical and physical changes, and potential equipment sizing. Mass and energy balances, finalized P&amp;ID's and general arrangement drawings are produced. 
# Automation strategies for the system are developed (if needed). Controls system programming begins and will continue through fabrication and assembly
# Fabrication and assembly - after an optimized design has been determined, the custom pilot is fabricated and assembled. Pilot plants can either be assembled on-site or off-site as modular skids that will be constructed and tested in a controlled environment. 
# Testing - testing of completed systems, including system controls, is conducted to ensure proper system function. 
# Installation and startup - if constructed offsite, pilot skids are installed onsite. After all equipment is in place, full system startup is completed by integrating the system with existing plant utilities and controls. Full operation is tested and affirmed.
# Training - operator training is complete and full system documentation is handed over.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16293">'''Protein quality''' is the [[Digestion#Protein digestion|digestibility]] and quantity of [[essential amino acid]]s for providing the proteins in correct ratios for human consumption. There are various methods that rank the quality of different types of [[protein]], some of which are outdated and no longer in use, or not considered as useful as they once were thought to be. The [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS), which was recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), became the industry standard in 1993. FAO has recently recommended the newer [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]] (DIAAS) to supersede PDCAAS. The dairy industry is in favor of this, because while PDCAAS truncates all protein types that exceed the [[essential amino acid]] (EAA) requirements to 1.0, DIAAS allows a higher than 1.0 ranking: while for example both soy protein isolate and whey isolate are ranked 1.0 according to PDCAAS, in the DIAAS system, whey has a higher score than soy.

==PDCAAS versus DIAAS==
The main limitations of PDCAAS is that it doesn't take into account [[Antinutrient|anti-nutrient]] factors like [[phytic acid]] and [[trypsin inhibitor]]s, which limit the absorption of protein among other nutrients. For this reason, DIAAS is promoted as the superior method and preferable over the PDCAAS. Other older methods like BV, PER, NPU and [[nitrogen balance]] may not reveal much about the amino acid profile and digestibility of the protein source in question, but can still be considered useful in that they determine other aspects of protein quality not taken into account by PDCAAS and DIAAS.

==Protein ranking==
Below follows a table that compares various proteins based on their rankings. Some of these results may differ and vary significantly depending on if it is soybeans or soy protein isolate, and so on. For example, while soybeans have a PDCAAS score of 0.91, many soy protein isolates (though not all) typically get a PDCAAS score of 1.0. Likewise, the amino acid profile may differ from crop to crop depending on the soil, and between different breeds of soy. Generally speaking, however, soybeans rarely outperform whey protein isolate in PDCAAS rankings.

==Amino acid profile==
Below follows a table that compares the complete amino acid profiles of various proteins. The amino acid score is based on the prevalence of the essential amino acids and depends on if they reach sufficient quantity. PDCAAS scores do not take into account the quantity of the non-essential amino acids.

A '''religious community''' is a [[community]] (group of people) who practice the same [[religion]]. The term is used in a wider sense and a different narrower sense. People who define themselves as having a particular religion are considered to be members of the religion's community. 

In the wider sense, the term is used to refer to members of one religion who may live in groups, or near or intermingled with members of other religions. Community members may mix with others in everyday life, but worship separately, typically in a dedicated [[temple]] such as a [[church (building)|church]] or [[mosque]]. One might speak of the Catholic community of [[Belfast]] (a city), or the Jewish community of France (a country). In other cases, a person must be formally accepted by community authorities to become acknowledged as a member. In Israel only couples both from the same officially recognized religious community [[marriage in Israel|may marry]].

The term is also used in a different, narrower sense to mean a group of people of the same religion living together specifically for religious purposes, often subject to formal commitments such as [[religious vows]],  as in a [[monastery]].&lt;ref name="Deegan"/&gt;

== Types of Christian Communities ==

=== Order ===
Orders are Institutes in which solemn vows are made by at least some of the members. All members of these orders are called regulars, and if they are women they are called nuns ("moniales"). Additionally, Orders are typically dated in history as older than Congregations.

=== Congregations ===
A group of people assembled for religious worship. The Catholic [[Congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] in the Roman Curia is the most notable congregation.

=== Clerical ===
These Christian [[Institutes of the Christian Religion|institutes]], in accordance with the intentions of the Founder or by reason of legitimate tradition, are governed by [[Clergy|clerics]], assume the exercise of sacred Orders, and are recognized by the Church as clerical Institutes.

=== Lay ===
Lay, also known as lay affiliates or associates, play an important part in a religious community. Men and women who take part, formally, in a religious community, to make their mission and spirituality, and have great influence on the like of the community are known as lay affiliates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://anunslife.org/blog/nun-talk/the-role-of-lay-associates-in-religious-life}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Canons Regular ===

=== Monastic Orders ===

=== Mendicant Orders ===

=== Clerks Regular ===

=== Clerical Religious Congregations ===

=== Lay Religious Congregations ===

Lay religious communities include groups such as the Hutterites, [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bruderhof|title=Bruderhof - Why Community|date=2012-01-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pBrSi5jld8|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Amish and some Mennonite churches.  Some of these communities are tightly-bound, such as the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hutterites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hutterites/|title=Hutterites|last=Ryan|first=John|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Amish and similar groups tend to be more loosely formed, but still act in a communal way.  All of these communities will claim to be Christ-centred.

The '''Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''SINP''') is an institution of basic research and training in physical and biophysical sciences located in [[Salt Lake City (Bidhan Nagar), Kolkata|Bidhannagar]], [[Kolkata]], India. The institute is named after the famous Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]].

==History==
The Palit Research Laboratory used to be a laboratory under the Department of [[Physics]] in the [[University of Calcutta]]. Meghnad Saha became the Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta in 1938. Realizing the ensuing importance of  [[nuclear physics]], he reorganized the curriculum to include nuclear physics and commissioned some necessary instruments. Soon the necessity of a small-scale cyclotron was felt. Thanks to the help of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and patronage of [[J. R. D. Tata|J.R.D.Tata]], the foundation stone of the Institute of Nuclear Physics was laid at Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Calcutta in 1949. The building was inaugurated in 1950 by [[Irène Joliot-Curie]]. The institute shifted to its new building in  [[Bidhannagar]] in the late 1980s.

==Administration==
SINP is an autonomous research institute under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India .The institute is governed by a governing council headed by the chairman of the atomic energy commission of India, in accordance with a tripartite agreement signed by the [[Government of India]], [[Government of West Bengal]] and the [[University of Calcutta]] in August 1992. The institute is known as a centre for conducting research for doctoral degrees and providing facilities for teaching and research in physical and biological sciences. The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, India (and Secretary, DAE, government of India) chairs the governing council with members comprising three scientists nominated by the DAE, two representatives of the DAE, two nominees of CU, one nominee of Govt. of West Bengal and the Director of the Institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42949">&lt;!-- {{Ancient Near East topics}} rem this until I figure out how to fix it --&gt;
The '''short chronology''' is one of the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronologies of the Near Eastern Bronze and Early Iron Age]], which fixes the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1728–1686 BC and the [[Babylonia#The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology|sack of Babylon]] to 1531 BC.

The absolute [[2nd millennium BC]] dates resulting from this decision have very little support in academia, particularly after more recent research.  The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature and early twenty-first century [[dendrochronology]] has essentially disproved the short chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, S. W.; Kromer, B.; Kuniholm, P. I.; and Newton, M. W. 2001 Anatolian tree-rings and a new chronology for the east Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages. Science 294: 2532-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157144#pone-0157144-g008 Sturt W. Manning ''et al.'', Integrated Tree-Ring-Radiocarbon High-Resolution Timeframe to Resolve Earlier Second Millennium BCE Mesopotamian Chronology, PlosONE July 13 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).

After the so-called "dark age" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619055/Problems_of_Chronology_Mesopotamia_Anatolia_and_the_Syro-Levantine_Region], Schwartz, Glenn, 2008.

In Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C., edited by Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, and Jean M. Evans: 450-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology dichotomy no longer applies from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.

==Early Bronze Age==
Estimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.
For the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.

===Kings of Ebla===
{{Main|Ebla}}

The city-states of Ebla and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern [[Syria]]) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of [[Uruk]] and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the [[Akkadian Empire]]. Pottery seals of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Pepi I]] have been found in the wreckage of the city.

Since Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]], has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like [[Ebla]], [[Tell Brak]], [[Nippur]], [[Susa]] and [[Tell Leilan]]. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. The last king of the empire, Shar-kali-sharri managed to mostly hold things together but upon his death, the empire fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the [[Guti (Mesopotamia)|Guti]].&lt;ref&gt;The Genesis and Collapse of Third Millennium North Mesopotamian Civilization, H.

;Second Dynasty of Lagash
{{Further|Lagash}}

Following the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Shar-kali-sharri]] of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, [[Tirigan]], was defeated, by [[Utu-hengal]], Lagash came under the control of Ur under [[Ur-Namma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gudea and His Dynasty, Dietz Otto Edzard, 1997, University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|0-8020-4187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.

;Kings of Larsa
{{Further|Larsa}}

The chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Hammurabi]], conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several [[Amorite]] [[Isin]]ite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf The Rulers of Larsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306091227/http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}, M.

;First Babylonian Dynasty (Dynasty I)
{{Main|First Babylonian Dynasty}}

Following the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], with Babylon and [[Assyria]] later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of [[Hammurabi]], [[Babylon]] became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by [[Mursili I]] in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc20/kings.html Chronicle of early kings] at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fTelipinuProclamation.html The Proclamation of Telipinu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816012134/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FTelipinuProclamation.html |date=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1st Sealand Dynasty (2nd Dynasty of Babylon)
{{Main|Sealand Dynasty}}

When the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the [[First Dynasty of Babylon]] and the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kirk Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles, Eisenbrauns, 2000 {{ISBN|1-57506-049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the [[Hittites]] in 1531 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W. G.

;Hittite Old Kingdom
{{Main|Hittites}}

The absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of [[Babylon]]. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from [[Aleppo]] to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available [[chronological synchronism]]s are local to the region in and near [[Anatolia]].

;Third Babylon Dynasty (Kassite)
{{Main|Kassites}}
The [[Kassites]] first appeared during the reign of [[Samsu-iluna]] of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] and after being defeated by [[Babylon]], moved to control the city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of [[Babylon]], the Kassites established a new [[Babylonia]]n dynasty. The [[Babylonian king list]] identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Synchronistic Chronicle]] and [[Babylonian Chronicles|Chronicle P]]. The later kings are well attested from ''[[kudurru]]'' [[stele]]s. Relative dating is from sychronisms with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Hittites]].

;Mitanni
{{Main|Mitanni}}
Perhaps because the capital of Mitanni, [[Washukanni]], has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Assyria]]n sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/pdf/6b%20Pharaoh%20and%20his%20Brothers.pdf Pharaoh and his Brothers], S Jakob&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'', Trevor Bryce, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25857-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Assyrian Middle Kingdom
{{Main|Assyria}}
Long a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor [[Mitanni]] by the [[Hittites]], Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals [[Babylon]] and the [[Hittites]] as well as diplomatic exchanges with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], in the [[Amarna letters]]. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various [[Neo-Assyrian]] documents, such as the [[Assyrian king list]], scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier [[Assyria]]n periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early [[Assyria]]n chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.&lt;ref&gt;"Comments on the Nassouhi Kinglist and the Assyrian Kinglist Tradition," J.A.

Beginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of [[Mitanni]], an event which ironically leads to the rise of [[Assyria]].

;Kings of Ugarit
{{Further|Ugarit}}
A client state of [[Mitanni]] and later the [[Hittites]], Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Merneptah]] to the 8th year of [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses III]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. This is roughly the same time that [[Hattusa]] is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Ugaritic Studies'', edited by Wilfred G. E.

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Neo-Hittite}}
The [[Early Iron Age]] (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Brinkman, ''A Political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158–722 B.C.'', Biblical Institute Press, 1968, {{ISBN|88-7653-243-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second Dynasty of Isin

After the fall of the [[Kassite dynasty]] of Babylon to [[Elam]], power
in the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler [[Tiglath-Pileser I]].

;Middle-Assyrian period
{{Further|Assyria}}
After the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.

A '''slide library''' is a library that houses a collection of photographic [[reversal film|slides]], either as a part of a larger [[library]] or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation.  Typically, a "slide library" contains slides depicting [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[architecture]], or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of [[art history]], architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as [[biology]] and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as "Visual Resources Collections," as they may be responsible for all "visual" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images
* 35mm, 8mm film
Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously [[Library catalog|cataloged]] and [[Archive|inventoried]] slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]] slides and placed them online via [[content management systems]]. 

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American [[lantern slide]] collections, developed by [[museum]]s to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: [[DePauw University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Rochester]]. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the [[Mississippi]] was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3"x 4.25".

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2"x2" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==

1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25" x 4.0" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required [[lime light]] which was dirty and dangerous
 
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
 
1888. First perforated film stock developed
 
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
 
1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
 
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
 
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
 
1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
 
1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
 
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
 
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

Analysis of the surgical stress response can be used for evaluation of surgical techniques and comparisons of different anaesthetic protocols. Moreover, they can be performed both in the intraoperative or postoperative period. 
If there is a choice between different techniques for a surgical procedure, one method to evaluate and compare the surgical techniques is to subject one group of patients to one technique, and the other group of patients to another technique, after which the surgical stress responses triggered by the procedures are compared. The technique with the least surgical stress response is considered the best for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=LJ|author2=Rahmani, EY |author3=Al-Haddad, M |author4=Sherman, S |author5=Chiorean, MV |author6=Selzer, DJ |author7=Snyder, PW |author8= Constable, PD |title=Comparison of pain and postoperative stress in dogs undergoing natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, laparoscopic, and open oophorectomy.|journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy|date=Aug 2010|volume=72|issue=2|pages=373–80|pmid=20537637 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2010.01.066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Höglund|first=Odd Viking|title=A resorbable device for ligation of blood vessels : development, assessment of surgical procedures and clinical evaluation|year=2012|isbn=978-91-576-7686-3|url=http://pub.epsilon.slu.se/8589/1/odd_v_hoglund_120210..pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Höglund|first=OV|author2=Olsson, K |author3=Hagman, R |author4=Öhlund, M |author5=Olsson, U |author6= Lagerstedt, AS |title=Comparison of haemodynamic changes during two surgical methods for neutering female dogs.|journal=Research in veterinary science|date=Aug 2011|volume=91|issue=1|pages=159–63|pmid=20888021 |doi=10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kataja|first=J|author2=Chrapek, W |author3=Kaukinen, S |author4=Pimenoff, G |author5= Salenius, JP |title=Hormonal stress response and hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing endovascular vs. conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Surgery|year=2007|volume=96|issue=3|pages=236–42|pmid=17966750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ledowski|first=T|author2=Bein, B |author3=Hanss, R |author4=Paris, A |author5=Fudickar, W |author6=Scholz, J |author7= Tonner, PH |title=Neuroendocrine stress response and heart rate variability: a comparison of total intravenous versus balanced anesthesia.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Dec 2005|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1700–5|pmid=16301244 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000184041.32175.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naitoh|first=T|author2=Garcia-Ruiz, A |author3=Vladisavljevic, A |author4=Matsuno, S |author5= Gagner, M |title=Gastrointestinal transit and stress response after laparoscopic vs conventional distal pancreatectomy in the canine model.|journal=Surgical endoscopy|date=Nov 2002|volume=16|issue=11|pages=1627–30|pmid=12073003 |doi=10.1007/s00464-002-0007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Veenhof, AA;

== Methods ==

Examples of used parameters are [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], [[heart rate variability]], [[photoplethysmography]] and [[skin conductance]]. Essentially, physiologic parameters are measured in order to assess sympathetic tone as a surrogate measure of stress. [[Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring]] can also be used.
Examples of commonly used biomarkers are [[adrenaline]], [[cortisol]], [[interleukin]]s, [[noradrenaline]] and [[vasopressin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höglund|first1=OV|last2=Hagman|first2=R|last3=Olsson|first3=K|last4=Olsson|first4=U|last5=Lagerstedt|first5=AS|title=Intraoperative Changes in Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Plasma Vasopressin, and Urinary Noradrenalin During Elective Ovariohysterectomy in Dogs: Repeatability at Removal of the 1st and 2nd Ovary.|journal=Veterinary surgery : VS|date=Aug 8, 2014|pmid=25130060|doi=10.1111/j.1532-950X.2014.12264.x|volume=43|pages=852–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=JL|last2=Chiche|first2=JD|last3=Canivet|first3=JL|last4=Jacquet|first4=NJ|last5=Legros|first5=JJ|last6=Lamy|first6=ML|title=Hemodynamic changes induced by laparoscopy and their endocrine correlates: effects of clonidine.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=November 1998|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1389–96|pmid=9809953|doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(98)00406-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Loss of nitrogen (urea) was observed already in the 1930s in fracture patients by the Scottish physician [[David Cuthbertson]]. The reason for the patients' catabolic response was not understood at the time, but later attention was turned to the stress reaction caused by the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuthbertson|first=DP|title=The disturbance of metabolism produced by bony and non-bony injury, with notes on certain abnormal conditions of bone.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|year=1930|volume=24|issue=4|pages=1244–63|pmid=16744448|pmc=1254622|doi=10.1042/bj0241244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilmore|first=DW|title=From Cuthbertson to fast-track surgery: 70 years of progress in reducing stress in surgical patients.|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=Nov 2002|volume=236|issue=5|pages=643–8|pmid=12409671|doi=10.1097/00000658-200211000-00015|pmc=1422623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The evolutionary background is believed to be that a wounded animal increases its chance of survival by using stored energy reserves. The stress reaction thus initiates a catabolic state by an increased release of catabolic hormones. Additionally immunosuppressive hormones are also released. 
In a surgery patient, the stress reaction is considered detrimental for wound healing. However, surgical stress reduced mortality from endotoxin shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamei|first1=K|last2=Nimura|first2=Y|last3=Nagino|first3=M|last4=Aono|first4=K|last5=Nakashima|first5=I|title=Surgical stress reduces mortality from endotoxin shock.|journal=Langenbeck's archives of surgery / Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Chirurgie|date=January 2002|volume=386|issue=7|pages=512–7|pmid=11819109|doi=10.1007/s00423-001-0261-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, development of new surgical techniques and anaesthetic protocols aim to minimise the surgical stress reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">In [[computability theory]] and [[mathematical logic]] the '''Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm''' is a [[non-deterministic algorithm]] which provides an [[upper bound]] for the complexity of formulas in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].

The algorithm is named after [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].

==Algorithm==
The Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm for the arithmetical hierarchy consists of the following steps:
# Convert the formula to [[prenex normal form]].
# If the formula is quantifier-free, it is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Otherwise, count the number of alternations of quantifiers; call this ''k''.
# If the first quantifier is [[Existential quantification|∃]], the formula is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If the first quantifier is [[Universal quantification|∀]], the formula is in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15336">In [[computer graphics]], '''texture filtering''' or texture smoothing is the method used to determine the texture color for a [[Texture mapping|texture mapped]] [[pixel]], using the colors of nearby [[Texel (graphics)|texel]]s (pixels of the texture). There are two main categories of texture filtering, magnification filtering and minification filtering.&lt;ref name="glprogramming_chapter09"/&gt; Depending on the situation texture filtering is either a type of [[reconstruction filter]] where sparse [[data]] is interpolated to fill gaps (magnification), or a type of [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] (AA), where texture samples exist at a higher frequency than required for the sample frequency needed for texture fill (minification). Put simply, filtering describes how a texture is applied at many different shapes, size, angles and scales. Depending on the chosen filter algorithm the result will show varying degrees of blurriness, detail, spatial aliasing, temporal aliasing and blocking. Depending on the circumstances filtering can be performed in software (such as a software rendering package) or in hardware for real time or [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] accelerated rendering or in a mixture of both. For most common interactive graphical applications modern texture filtering is performed by [[Texture mapping unit|dedicated hardware]] which optimizes memory access through [[memory cache]]ing and [[Cache prefetching|pre-fetch]] and implements a selection of algorithms available to the user and developer.

There are many methods of texture filtering, which make different trade-offs between [[computation]]al complexity, [[memory bandwidth]] and image quality.

==The need for filtering==
During the texture mapping process, a ''{{visible anchor|texture lookup}}'' takes place to find out where on the texture each pixel center falls. Since the textured surface may be at an arbitrary distance and orientation relative to the viewer, one pixel does not usually correspond directly to one texel. Some form of filtering has to be applied to determine the best color for the pixel. Insufficient or incorrect filtering will show up in the image as [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]] (errors in the image), such as 'blockiness', [[jaggies]], or shimmering.

There can be different types of correspondence between a pixel and the texel/texels it represents on the screen. These depend on the position of the textured surface relative to the viewer, and different forms of filtering are needed in each case. Given a square texture mapped on to a square surface in the world, at some viewing distance the size of one screen pixel is exactly the same as one texel. Closer than that, the texels are larger than screen pixels, and need to be scaled up appropriately - a process known as ''texture magnification''. Farther away, each texel is smaller than a pixel, and so one pixel covers multiple texels. In this case an appropriate color has to be picked based on the covered texels, via ''texture minification''. Graphics [[Application programming interface|APIs]] such as [[OpenGL]] allow the programmer to set different choices for minification and magnification filters.&lt;ref name="glprogramming_chapter09"/&gt;

Note that even in the case where the pixels and texels are exactly the same size, one pixel will not necessarily match up exactly to one texel. It may be misaligned or rotated, and cover parts of up to four neighboring texels. Hence some form of filtering is still required.

==Mipmapping==
[[Mipmap]]ping is a standard technique used to save some of the filtering work needed during texture minification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Lance|title=Pyramidal parametrics|journal=ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics|volume=17|issue=3|year=1983|pages=1–11|issn=00978930|doi=10.1145/964967.801126|url=http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/jchai/CPSC641/p1-williams.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also highly beneficial for [[cache coherency]] - without it the [[memory access pattern]] during sampling from distant textures will exhibit extremely poor locality, adversely affecting performance even if no filtering is performed.

During texture magnification, the number of texels that need to be looked up for any pixel is always four or fewer; during minification, however, as the textured polygon moves farther away potentially the ''entire texture'' might fall into a single pixel. This would necessitate reading '''all''' of its texels and combining their values to correctly determine the pixel color, a prohibitively expensive operation. Mipmapping avoids this by prefiltering the texture and storing it in smaller sizes down to a single pixel. As the textured surface moves farther away, the texture being applied switches to the prefiltered smaller size. Different sizes of the mipmap are referred to as 'levels', with Level 0 being the largest size (used closest to the viewer), and increasing levels used at increasing distances.

==Filtering methods==
This section lists the most common texture filtering methods, in increasing order of computational cost and image quality.

===Nearest-neighbor interpolation===
[[Nearest-neighbor interpolation]] is the simplest and crudest filtering method &amp;mdash; it simply uses the color of the texel closest to the pixel center for the pixel color. While simple, this results in a large number of artifacts - texture 'blockiness' during magnification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Engine Design: Texture Mapping|url=http://webpages.uncc.edu/krs/courses/5010/ged/lectures/texture2.pdf#page=6|at=Texture Magnification |publisher=uncc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aliasing]] and shimmering during minification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Engine Design: Texture Mapping|url=http://webpages.uncc.edu/krs/courses/5010/ged/lectures/texture2.pdf#page=7|at=Texture Minification |publisher=uncc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is fast during magnification but during minification the stride through memory becomes arbitrarily large and it can often be less efficient than MIP-mapping due to the lack of spatially coherent texture access and cache-line reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d4/teaching/ws200708/cg/slides/CG09-Textures+Filtering.pdf#page=28 |title=Computer Graphics: Texture Filtering &amp; Sampling Theory |publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2018-01-14 |at=MipMaps |author=Hendrik Lensch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nearest-neighbor with mipmapping===
This method still uses nearest neighbor interpolation, but adds mipmapping &amp;mdash; first the nearest mipmap level is chosen according to distance, then the nearest texel center is sampled to get the pixel color. This reduces the aliasing and shimmering significantly during minification but does not eliminate it entirely. In doing so it improves texture memory access and cache-line reuse through avoiding arbitrarily large access strides through texture memory during rasterization. This does not help with blockiness during magnification as each magnified texel will still appear as a large rectangle.

===Linear mipmap filtering===
Less commonly used, OpenGL and other APIs support nearest-neighbor sampling from individual mipmaps whilst linearly interpolating the two nearest mipmaps relevant to the sample.

===Bilinear filtering===
[[Bilinear filtering]] is the next step up. In this method the four nearest texels to the pixel center are sampled (at the closest mipmap level), and their colors are combined by [[weighted mean|weighted average]] according to distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.kaust.edu.sa/sites/markushadwiger/Documents/CS380_spring2015_lecture_12.pdf#page=4 |at=Texture Reconstruction: Magnification |title=GPU and GPGPU Programming Lecture 12: GPU Texturing 2 |author=Markus Hadwiger |publisher=[[KAUST]] |date=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes the 'blockiness' seen during magnification, as there is now a smooth gradient of color change from one texel to the next, instead of an abrupt jump as the pixel center crosses the texel boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.kaust.edu.sa/sites/markushadwiger/Documents/CS380_spring2015_lecture_12.pdf#page=9 |at=Texture Anti-Aliasing: MIP Mapping |title=GPU and GPGPU Programming Lecture 12: GPU Texturing 2 |author=Markus Hadwiger |publisher=[[KAUST]] |date=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinear filtering for magnification filtering is common. When used for minification it is often used with mipmapping; though it can be used without, it would suffer the same aliasing and shimmering problems as nearest-neighbor filtering when minified too much. For modest minification ratios, however, it can be used as an inexpensive hardware accelerated weighted texture supersample.

===Trilinear filtering===
[[Trilinear filtering]] is a remedy to a common artifact seen in mipmapped bilinearly filtered images: an abrupt and very noticeable change in quality at boundaries where the renderer switches from one mipmap level to the next. Trilinear filtering solves this by doing a texture lookup and bilinear filtering on the ''two'' closest mipmap levels (one higher and one lower quality), and then [[Linear interpolation|linearly interpolating]] the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d4/teaching/ws200708/cg/slides/CG09-Textures+Filtering.pdf#page=26 |title=Computer Graphics: Texture Filtering &amp; Sampling Theory |publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2018-01-14 |at=MipMapping II |author=Hendrik Lensch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a smooth degradation of texture quality as distance from the viewer increases, rather than a series of sudden drops. Of course, closer than Level 0 there is only one mipmap level available, and the algorithm reverts to bilinear filtering.

===Anisotropic filtering===
[[Anisotropic filtering]] is the highest quality filtering available in current consumer 3D [[graphics processing unit|graphics cards]]. Simpler, "isotropic" techniques use only square mipmaps which are then interpolated using bi– or trilinear filtering. (''Isotropic'' means same in all directions, and hence is used to describe a system in which all the maps are squares rather than rectangles or other quadrilaterals.)

When a surface is at a high angle relative to the camera, the fill area for a texture will not be approximately square. Consider the common case of a floor in a game: the fill area is far wider than it is tall. In this case, none of the square maps are a good fit. The result is blurriness and/or shimmering, depending on how the fit is chosen. Anisotropic filtering corrects this by sampling the texture as a non-square shape. The goal is to sample a texture to match the pixel footprint as projected into texture space, and it should be noted that such a footprint is not always axis aligned to the texture. Further, when dealing with sample theory a pixel is not a little square&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos426/papers/smith95b.pdf |title=A Pixel Is Not A Little Square! (And a Voxel is Not a Little Cube) - Technical Memo 6 |author=[[Alvy Ray Smith]] |publisher=cs.princeton.edu |date=1995-07-17 |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore its footprint would not be a projected square. Footprint assembly in texture space samples some approximation of the computed function of a projected pixel in texture space but the details are often approximate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d4/teaching/ws200708/cg/slides/CG09-Textures+Filtering.pdf#page=20 |title=Computer Graphics: Texture Filtering &amp; Sampling Theory |publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2018-01-14 |at=Anisotropic Filtering |author=Hendrik Lensch}}&lt;/ref&gt; highly proprietary and steeped in opinions about sample theory. Conceptually though the goal is to sample a more correct anisotropic sample of appropriate orientation to avoid the conflict between aliasing on one axis vs. blurring on the other when projected size differs.

In anisotropic implementations, the filtering may incorporate the same filtering algorithms used to filter the square maps of traditional mipmapping during the construction of the intermediate or final result.

===Percentage Closer filtering===
Depth based [[Shadow mapping]] can use an interesting Percentage Closer Filter (PCF) with depth mapped textures that broadens ones perception of the kinds of texture filters that might be applied. In PCF a depth map of the scene is rendered from the light source. During the subsequent rendering of the scene this depth map is then projected back into the scene from the position of the light and a comparison is performed between the projective depth coordinate and the fetched texture sample depth. The projective coordinate will be the scene pixels depth from the light but the fetched depth from the depth map will represent the depth of the scene along that projected direction. In this way a determination of visibility to the light and therefore illumination by the light can be made for the rendered pixel. So this texturing operation is a boolean test of whether the pixel is lit, however multiple samples can be tested for a given pixel and the boolean results summed and averaged. In this way in combination with varying parameters like sampled texel location and even jittered depth map projection  location a post-depth-comparison average or percentage of samples closer and therefore illuminated can be computed for a pixel. Critically, the summation of boolean results and generation of a percentage value must be performed after the depth comparison of projective depth and sample fetch, so this depth comparison becomes an integral part of the texture filter. This percentage can then be used to weight an illumination calculation and provide not just a boolean illumination or shadow value but a soft shadow penumbra result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reeves | first=William T. | last2=Salesin | first2=David H. | last3=Cook | first3=Robert L. | title=Rendering antialiased shadows with depth maps | journal=ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics | publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) | volume=21 | issue=4 | date=1987-08-01 | issn=0097-8930 | doi=10.1145/37402.37435 | pages=283–291 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c84b/f26d73ab6ed258db8b33e87e0cd291c89c43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf |title=Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows |publisher=[[NVIDIA Corporation]] |author=Randima Fernando |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of this is supported in modern hardware where a comparison is performed and a post boolean comparison bilinear filter by distance is applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_depth_texture/ |title=WebGL WEBGL_depth_texture Khronos Ratified Extension Specification |publisher=Khronos.org |date=2014-07-15 |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25208">'''Toxicodynamics''', termed [[pharmacodynamics]] in [[pharmacology]], describes the dynamic interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and its biological effects.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli&gt;Boelsterli, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biological target]], also known as the site of action, can be binding proteins, [[ion channel]]s, [[DNA]], or a variety of other receptors. When a [[toxicant]] enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The [[mechanism of action]] of the toxicant, as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.

Toxicants have been grouped together according to their chemical properties by way of [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]]s (QSARs), which allows prediction of toxic action based on these properties.  [[Endocrine disruptors|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs) and [[carcinogen]]s are examples of classes of toxicants that can act as QSARs. EDCs mimic or block transcriptional activation normally caused by natural [[steroid hormone]]s.  These types of chemicals can act on [[androgen receptor]]s, [[estrogen receptor]]s and [[thyroid hormone receptor]]s.  This mechanism can include such toxicants as [[dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDE) and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs). Another class of chemicals, carcinogens, are substances that cause [[cancer]] and can be classified as [[genotoxic]] or nongenotoxic carcinogens.  These categories include toxicants such as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAHs) and [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

The process of toxicodynamics can be useful for application in environmental [[risk assessment]] by implementing toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models.  TKTD models include phenomenas such as time-varying exposure, carry-over [[toxicity]], organism recovery time, effects of mixtures, and extrapolation to untested [[chemical compound|chemicals]] and [[species]].  Due to their advantages, these types of models may be more applicable for risk assessment than traditional modeling approaches.

== Overview ==

[[File:Diagram showing the conceptual pathway of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.png|thumb|alt=A box model explaining the processes of toxokinetics and toxicodynamics.|A box model explaining the processes of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.]]

While [[toxicokinetics]] describes the changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, [[biotransformation]], distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a [[biological target]] and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity [[binding site]]s increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt;

== Endocrine disruptors ==

EDCs are generally considered to be toxicants that either mimic or block the transcriptional activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones.&lt;ref name=Tabb&gt;Tabb and Blumberg, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals include those acting on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thryoid hormone receptors.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt;

=== Effects of endocrine disruptors ===

Endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere with the [[endocrine system]] in a number of ways including hormone synthesis, storage/release, transport and clearance, receptor recognition and binding, and postreceptor activation.&lt;ref name=Choi&gt;Choi et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In wildlife, exposure to EDCs can result in altered fertility, reduced viability of offspring, impaired hormone secretion or activity and modified reproductive anatomy.&lt;ref name=Guillette&gt;Guillette et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive anatomy of offspring can particularly be affected if maternal exposure occurs.&lt;ref name=Colborn&gt;Colborn et al., 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In females, this includes [[mammary gland]]s, [[fallopian tube]]s, [[uterus]], [[cervix]], and [[vagina]]. In males, this includes the [[prostate]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[epididymitis]] and [[testes]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt; Exposure of fish to EDCs has also been associated with abnormal thyroid function, decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, de-feminization and masculinization of female fish and alteration of [[immune system|immune function]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt;

Endocrine disruption as a [[mode of action]] for [[xenobiotic]]s was brought into awareness by [[Our Stolen Future]] by Theo Colborn.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt; Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Clotfelter et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many toxicants are known EDCs including [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s, [[phytoestrogens]], some industrial/commercial products, and [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name=Choi /&gt; These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.

=== Androgen-receptor mediated ===
Certain toxicants act as endocrine disruptors by interacting with the androgen receptor. DDE is one example of a chemical that acts via this mechanism. DDE is a [[metabolite]] of [[DDT]] that is widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Although production of DDT has been banned in the Western world, this chemical is extremely persistent and is still commonly found in the environment along with its metabolite DDE.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is an [[antiandrogen]], which means it alters the expression of specific androgen-regulated genes, and is an androgen receptor (AR)-mediated mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is a [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] compound which diffuses into the cell and binds to the AR.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Through binding, the receptor is inactivated and cannot bind to the androgen response element on DNA.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; This inhibits the transcription of androgen-responsive genes&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; which can have serious consequences for exposed wildlife. In 1980, there was a spill in [[Lake Apopka]], Florida which released the pesticide dicofol and DDT along with its metabolites.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt; The neonatal and juvenile alligators present in this lake have been extensively studied and observed to have altered [[Blood plasma|plasma]] hormone concentrations, decreased clutch viability, increased juvenile mortality, and morphological abnormalities in the testis and ovary.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt;

=== Estrogen-receptor mediated ===
Toxicants may also cause endocrine disruption through interacting with the estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals have been used as coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties.&lt;ref name=ATSDR&gt;ATSDR&lt;/ref&gt; A purely [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=ATSDR /&gt; PCBs are a [[xenoestrogen]], which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as [[heat shock protein]]s 59, 70, and 90.&lt;ref name=Pait&gt;Pait, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a [[protein dimer|homodimer]] complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the [[chromatin]] and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation.&lt;ref name=Perrin&gt;Perrin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the [[harbor seal]] (Phoca vitulina).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; Similar effects have been found in the [[grey seal]] (Halichoerus grypus), the [[ringed seal]] (Pusa hispida) and the [[California sea lion]] (Zalophys californinus).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and [[stenosis]] were found which led to [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]].&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce [[vitellogenin]].&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; This is often used as a [[biomarker]] for EDCs.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt;

== Carcinogens ==
Carcinogens are defined as any substance that causes cancer. The toxicodynamics of carcinogens can be complex due to the varying mechanisms of action for different carcinogenic toxicants. Because of their complex nature, carcinogens are classified as either genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens.

=== Effects of carcinogens ===
The effects of carcinogens are most often related to human exposures but mammals are not the only species that can be affected by cancer-causing toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;Rand, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have shown that cancer can develop in fish species as well.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; [[Neoplasm]]s occurring in [[Epithelium|epithelial tissue]] such as the [[liver]], gastrointestinal tract, and the [[pancreas]] have been linked to various environmental toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; Carcinogens preferentially target the liver in fish and develop hepatocellular and biliary lesions.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;

=== Genotoxic carcinogens ===
Genotoxic carcinogens interact directly with DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites.&lt;ref name=VanDelft&gt;VanDelft et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  PAHs are widely spread throughout the environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as [[benzo(a)pyrene]], [[benz(a)anthracene]], and Benzofluoranthene, are [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] and responsible for liver [[disease]]s like cancer in wild fish populations.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of [[DNA adduct]]s. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and available for biotransformation.

The biotransformation process can activate the PAH compound and transform it into a diol epoxide,&lt;ref name=Munoz&gt;Munoz and Albores, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which is a very [[reactive intermediate]]. These diol-epoxides [[Covalent bond|covalently bind]] with DNA [[base pair]]s, most often with [[guanine]] and [[adenine]] to form stable adducts within the DNA structure.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt; The binding of diol epoxides and DNA base pairs blocks polymerase replication activity. This blockage ultimately contributes to an increase in DNA damage by reducing repair activity.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt;

Due to these processes, PAH compounds are thought to play a role in the initiation and early promotion stage of [[carcinogenesis]]. Fish exposed to PAHs develop a range of liver [[lesion]]s, some of which are characteristic of [[hepatocarcinogen]]icity.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;

=== Nongenotoxic carcinogens ===
Nongenotoxic, or [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] carcinogens are different and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens since they are not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis does not change the sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt; Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, little is known about the mechanistic pathway.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by [[oxidative stress]], peroxisome proliferation, suppression of [[apoptosis]], alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt;

Carbon tetrachloride  is an example of a probable nongenotoxic carcinogen to aquatic vertebrates. Historically, carbon tetrachloride has been used in pharmaceutical production, petroleum refining, and as an industrial solvent.&lt;ref name=NTP&gt;National Toxicology Program, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its widespread industrial use and release into the environment, carbon tetrachloride has been found in drinking water and therefore, has become a concern for aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rabergh&gt;Rabergh and Lipsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high [[Hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] properties, carbon tetrachloride could potentially be linked to liver cancer. Experimental cancer studies have shown that carbon tetrachloride may cause [[Benign tumor|benign]] and [[Malignancy|malignant]] liver [[tumor]]s to [[rainbow trout]].&lt;ref name=NTP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabergh /&gt; carbon tetrachloride works as a nongenotoxic carcinogen by formulating [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] which induce oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; It has been proposed that once carbon tetrachloride enters the organism, it is metabolized to trichloromethyl and trichloromethyl peroxy radicals by the [[CYP2E1]] [[enzyme]].&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manibusan&gt;Manibusan and Eastmond, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The more reactive radical, trichloromethyl peroxy, can attack [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]] to form [[fatty acid]] free radicals and initiate [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The attack on the cellular membrane increases its permeability, causing a leakage of enzymes and disrupts cellular calcium [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; This loss of calcium homeostasis activates calcium dependent [[degradative enzyme]]s and [[cytotoxicity]], causing hepatic damage.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The regenerative and proliferative changes that occur in the liver during this time could increase the frequency of genetic damage, resulting in a possible increase of cancer.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt;

== Applications ==

Toxicodynamics can be used in combination with toxicokinetics in environmental risk assessment to determine the potential effects of releasing a toxicant into the environment.  The most widely used method of incorporating this are TKTD models.

=== Setup of TKTD models ===
Both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics have now been described, and using these definitions models were formed, where the internal concentration (TK) and damage (TD) are [[simulation|simulated]] in response to exposure.  TK and TD are separated in the model to allow for the identification of properties of toxicants that determine TK and those that determine TD.  To use this type of model, [[parameter]] values for TK processes need to be obtained first.  Second, the TD parameters need to be estimated.  Both of these steps require a large database of toxicity information for [[parameterization]].  After establishing all the parameter values for the TKTD model, and using basic scientific precautions, the model can be used to predict toxic effects, calculate recovery times for organisms, or establish extrapolations from the model to toxicity of untested toxicants and species.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher"&gt;Ashauer and Escher 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al., 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of TKTD models ===
It has been argued that the current challenges facing risk assessments can be addressed with TKTD modeling.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  TKTD models were derived in response to a couple of factors.  One is the lack of time being considered as a factor in toxicity and risk assessment.  Some of the earliest developed TKTD models, such as the [[Critical Body Residue]] (CBR) model and Critical Target Occupation (CTO) model, have considered time as a factor but a criticism has been that they are for very specific circumstances such as reversibly acting toxicants or irreversibly acting toxicants.  Further extrapolation of the CTO and CBR models are [[DEBtox]], which can model sublethal endpoints, and hazard versions of the CTO, which takes into account [[stochastic]] death as opposed to individual [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]].&lt;ref name="Jager et al."&gt;Jager et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another significant step to developing TKTD models was the incorporation of a [[state variable]] for damage.  By using damage as a toxicodynamic state-variable, modeling intermediate recovery rates can be accomplished for toxicants that act reversibly with their targets, without the assumptions of instant recovery (CBR model) or irreversible interactions (CTO model). TKTD models that incorporate damage are the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) and the Threshold Damage Model (TDM).&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt; For what may seem like straightforward [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], a variety of different TKTD approaches exist.  A review of the assumptions and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of each was previously published in the creation of a general unified threshold model of survival (GUTS).&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;

=== Advantages for risk assessment ===

As referenced above, TKTD models have several advantages to traditional models for risk assessments.  The principal advantages to using TKTD models are:&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;

* The consequences of time-varying or repeated [[Chemical exposure|exposures]] can be explained and simulated by the TKTD model.
* Carry-over toxicity as well as delayed effects can be simulated, whether the carry-over toxicity is due to TK or TD or both.&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, TKTD models can quantify risks from pulsed or fluctuating exposures.
* Organism recovery time depends on the time course of TK and TD, which makes the TKTD models suitable for calculating organism recovery time.
* TKTD models have the potential to predict effects of mixtures and also be used as mechanism-based extrapolation to untested toxicants or untested species.
* Linking TKTD models with [[agent-based model|Individual Based Models]] (IBM) may improve risk assessment of toxicants by simulating [[Time|temporal]] aspects as well as [[ecology|ecological]] aspects.

Due to its advantages, TKTD models may be more powerful than the traditional [[dose-response relationship|dose-response]] models because of their incorporation of chemical [[concentration]]s as well as temporal dimensions.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  Toxicodynamic modeling (such as TKTD models) has been shown to be a useful tool for toxicological research, with increasing opportunities to use these results in risk assessment to permit a more scientifically based risk assessment that is less reliable on [[animal testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaauboer 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, these types of models can formalize knowledge about the toxicity of toxicants and organism [[Resistance (ecology)|sensitivity]], create new hypotheses, and simulate temporal aspects of toxicity, making them useful tools for risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;

'''Turkish Space Systems, Integration and Test Centre''' ({{lang-tr|Uzay Sistemleri, Entegrasyon ve Test Merkezi}}) (USET) is a [[spacecraft]] production and testing facility owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Ministry of National Defence]] and operated by [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI). It is located in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The facility's official inauguration took place on May 21, 2015 in presence of [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

Considered as a critical infrastructure, the centre was established within the framework of the [[Göktürk-1]] project, which started in 2009, for the indigenous realization of satellite assembly, as well as for [[qualification testing|qualification]] and [[acceptance testing]] from design to launch phase. It was the product of an agreement between the Turkish Ministry of National Defence and the multinational space services company [[Telespazio]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; Situated within TAI's grounds in the [[Kazan, Ankara|Kazan]] district of [[Ankara Province]], the budgeted cost of the facility is US$100 million.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bksv"/&gt;

USET is a technology centre, at which all satellites up to {{convert|5000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} mass can be assembled and tested in simulated space environmental conditions related to the orbit. Two satellites can be produced and tested at the simultaneously. The centre serves military and civilian institutions.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iix"/&gt;

Development of the [[Turksat (satellite)|Türksat series]] [[communication satellite]]s, starting with [[Türksat 5A]], and Göktürk series [[earth observation satellite]]s, will be carried out by Turkish engineers at this site.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

At the end of November 2014, it was announced that the construction of the facility was completed, and the centre was put into operation. The centre's Class 100,000 clean rooms cover an area of around {{convert|3800|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; It is capable of the assembly, integration and testing of several satellites of type [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and [[Geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO) with a mass up to five tonnes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt; It has a direct connection to the airbase so that a transport by land becomes needless, offering advantages of security, economy and risk management.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

The centre has the following capabilities:
* [[Thermal vacuum chamber|thermal vacuum]] tests,
* [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]]/[[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] tests,
* [[Antenna measurement|compact antenna measurement range]] (CATR) tests,
* [[Photovoltaic systems|solar array]] deployment tests,
* [[vibration]] tests,
* [[mass properties]] measurement,
* [[Acoustics|acoustic]] tests, and
* [[Multi-layer insulation|MLI]] preparation.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt;

The advanced integration and environmental tests of Göktürk-1 is the first project to be carried out in the centre. After completion, the satellite will be sent to the launch site by TUSAŞ.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

A '''visionary environment''' or '''fantasy world''' is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and [[outsider art]].
