Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life, Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science.

This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper."

=== Early life ===
[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house, ul. Św. Ducha (formerly Heiligegeistgasse)]]
Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in the city of Danzig (then part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; present day [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św. Ducha 47), the son of [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|author2=Günter Zöller|author3=Eric F. J. Payne|year=1999|work=Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=xxx | isbn=978-0-521-57766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; both descendants of wealthy German-Dutch [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families.  Both of them weren't very religious,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; supported the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Republicanism|republican]], [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  When Danzig became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1793, Heinrich moved to [[Hamburg]] - a free city with republican constitution, protected by Britain and Holland against Prussian aggression - although his firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained.  [[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.

In 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire.  He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates.  Heinrich gave his son a choice - he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education.  Arthur would later deeply regret his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.  He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by very strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity which he would continue to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also under great pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results.  In fact Heinrich Floris became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, Heinrich Floris died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg.  Although it was possible that his death was accident, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), p. 12. "There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a decent inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children. Arthur Schopenhauer would be entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority.  He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]
Arthur endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother soon moved with his sister Adele to [[Weimar]]—then the centre of [[German literature]]—to enjoy social life among celebrated writers and artists.  Arthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.

After quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Gotha]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha|de|3=Ernestinum Gotha|lt=Gymnasium illustre zu Gotha}}) in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  He left Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the lecturers.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
He moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences.  He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"/&gt;  His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative—and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"/&gt;  Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater.  By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]].  Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there—though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.  It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn’t find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809.  There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but Göttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]].  Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 141-144&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810-11 and he left Göttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;).  He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  During his days at Göttingen, he spent a lot of time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811-12.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.  Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt;—seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 165-169&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attended the lectures of the famous theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] whom he also quickly came to dislike.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  He learned a lot by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and a lot of current scientific literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"/&gt;  He attended philological courses by [[August Böckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 171-174&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early work ===
Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Conrad Ludwig Müller von Gerstenbergk, a civil servant fourteen years younger than her; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.  He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].  He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar.  She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit.  She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the "rubbish" she wrote was totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A. Brockhaus AG|Brockhaus publishing firm]] held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus (1888-1965) later claimed that his predecessors "...saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation."&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{citation |last=Fredriksson |first=Einar H. |contribution=The Dutch Publishing Scene: Elsevier and North-Holland |pages=61–76 |title=A Century of Science Publishing: A Collection of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwWrRYyck6AC&amp;pg=PA61 |editor-last=Fredriksson |editor-first=Einar H. |display-editors=0 |isbn=978-4-274-90424-0 |publisher=IOS Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in [[Leipzig]] for the edification of his new editors.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

Also contrary to his mother's prediction, Schopenhauer's dissertation made an impression on Goethe to whom he sent it as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is doubtful that Goethe agreed with Schopenhauer's philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  Their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero.  They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]].  Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's.  Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements – and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence – soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 247-265&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer – a historian of religion, [[Orientalism|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] – who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]] and put them at par with Plato and Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Although he loved [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts he was more interested in [[Buddhism]] which he came to regard as the best religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  However, his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature, and were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]]. He also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently, and only later realized the similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 274-276&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815. Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl]]
As the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left Weimar and moved to [[Dresden]] in May 1814.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  He continued his philosophical studies, enjoyed the cultural life, socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;  His friends in Dresden were [[Johann Gottlob von Quandt]], [[Friedrich Laun]], [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] and Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl, a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of Schopenhauer's unattractive physical features.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  His criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his main occupation during his stay in Dresden was his seminal philosophical work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 (see {{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recommended to [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]] by Baron Ferdinand von Biedenfeld, an acquaintance of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the publisher accepted his manuscript, Schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in December 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285-289&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1818, while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer left Dresden for a yearlong vacation in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;  He visited [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent winter months in [[Rome]] where he accidentally met his acquaintance [[Karl Witte]] and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in [[Antico Caffè Greco|Caffe Greco]], among them [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]] who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;  He enjoyed art, architecture, ancient ruins, attended plays and operas, continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his affairs supposedly became serious, and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian noblewoman—but despite his mentioning this several times, no details are known and it may have been Schopenhauer exaggerating.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (1991) Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy. Harvard University Press. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship with Johanna and Gerstenbergk also deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  She informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Muhl in Danzig – in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third of his – was near bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  The women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354-356&lt;/ref&gt;  The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Schopenhauer family.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted his friends at universities in Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin and found [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] most attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358-362&lt;/ref&gt;  He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason," p. 1 ([[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]] on Wikisource.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was especially appalled by Hegel's supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were [[Carlsbad Decrees|fired]], while Schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own, Hegel still voted to accept Schopenhauer to the university.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of [[academia]]. A late essay, ''On University Philosophy'', expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

=== Later life ===
After his academic failure he continued to travel extensively, visiting [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Vevey]], [[Milan]] and spending eight months in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before he left for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise Marquet.  The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 408-411&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411-414&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his last visit to the country.  He left for [[Munich]] and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish in order to read some of his favorite authors in their original language.  He liked [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and especially [[Baltasar Gracián]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works.  Few attempts to revive his lectures – again scheduled at the same time as Hegel's – also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than him.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;  His unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of [[monogamy]] but still not advocating [[polygyny]] – instead musing about a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship he called ''tetragamy''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404-408&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an on and off relationship with a young dancer Caroline Richter (she also used surname Medon after one of her ex-lovers).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera. She already had numerous lovers and an out-of-wedlock son, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but it was stillborn).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403-404&lt;/ref&gt;  As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she leaves her young son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin he had a prophetic dream which urged him to escape the city.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;  As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another supernatural experience, an apparition of his dead father and his mother who was still alive.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;  This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].  He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 437-452&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;  He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454-457&lt;/ref&gt;  By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn’t bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;  His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz.  In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''.  In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn’t win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he will win, was enraged by this rejection.  He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy.  Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. 
 
However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenstädt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy.  He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenstädt continued to promote Schopehnauer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 507-508&lt;/ref&gt;   They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;   He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848–49|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered.  He became worried for his own safety and property.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] for restoring order.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans—and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Lunteschütz]]
In 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy.  It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 524&lt;/ref&gt;  The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn’t contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn’t take his philosophy seriously.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;  His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 381-386&lt;/ref&gt; or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;  Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;  His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn’t concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and that some of his ideas shouldn’t be taken literally but instead as metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work.  In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]’s very critical essay.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Lunteschütz]] made a first of his four portraits of him – which Schopenhauer didn’t particularly like – that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;  As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]
He remained healthy in his old age which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 544-545&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 545&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;  The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.  In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;  His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and according to him Schopenhauer was concerned that he won’t be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546-547&lt;/ref&gt;  He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],&lt;ref&gt;Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: "Biographical sketch".&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy'' by H. Zimmern – 1932 – G. Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

=== The world as representation ===
Schopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own:
{{Quotation|My philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither Berkeley nor Malebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can anyone become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the First Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kant had argued the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|nopp=|at=§ 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: "The world is my representation." We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Last sentence of § 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E. Cartwright |author2=Edward E. Erdmann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=xvi–xvii|quote=He had also rehearsed for the first time his physiological arguments for the intellectual nature of intuition [Anschauung, objective perception] in his On Vision and Colours, and he had discussed how his philosophy was corroborated by the sciences in On Will in Nature. ... Like the German Idealists, Schopenhauer is convinced that Kant’s great unknown, the thing in itself, is the weak point of the critical philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1 Criticism of the Kantian philosophy|location=|pages=|translator-last=J. Kemp|quote=With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the law of causality. Both doctrines are true, but their proof is false. They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of perception ===
In November 1813 [[Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich weiß, daß durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, – in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in größern.&lt;/ref&gt; he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.

Kant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G.E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.

The difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is "given" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. Hereby Hume's skepticism is disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, § 4.|location=|pages=|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,—that is, its a priori character—can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process, that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression; and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.

Schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception, the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in § 21.

=== The world as will ===
{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}
Schopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].

{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me "representation") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: "Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: "The world is ''for'' a subject." This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena—an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.&lt;ref name="inveigles"/&gt; He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: "The world is my representation." [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s "''Sublimation''"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''"subject of cognition"'' to a perception that is ''"Pure, will-less, timeless"'' (section 34) where the essence, "ideas", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, "Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.&lt;ref name=Music &gt;{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location='10'|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Schopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]—and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].

{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of "less than two right angles"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his writings,&lt;ref&gt;"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&amp;nbsp;..." ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.

{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&amp;nbsp;...}}

Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.&lt;ref&gt;This comment by Schopenhauer was called "an acute observation" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, "Note on Common Notion 4", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark "was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory". Helmholtz had "maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space" and is therefore "dependent on mechanics".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another", is not rather attacked. For ''"coinciding with one another"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}
This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience." (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)&lt;/ref&gt;

The task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which the phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as good as he can.

What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 66.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.

What motivates the altruist is compassion. The sufferings of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eternal justice ====
Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves at only at the expense of others—the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 2, § 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tormenter and tormented are one. Suffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]

==== Quietism ====
He who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst of a world of suffering is for him like beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt;

Human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.

{{Quotation|The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt;}}

Schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.

=== Psychology ===
Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation: Supplements to the Fourth Book'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveigles&lt;ref name="inveigles"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location='Schopenhauer'|isbn=978-0-19-861248-3|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], guaranteeing the quality of the human race:

{{quote|The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it. What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation'', Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has often been argued that Schopenhauer's thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the [[evolution|theory of evolution]], a claim which seems to have been met with satisfaction by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his [[Descent of Man]] after having read such a claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been noted about [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"Nearly a century before Freud ... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body." Safranski p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and social thought ===

==== Politics ====
[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]
Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should "leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]," and so long as government was thus limited, he would "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats"—i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He declared monarchy as "that which is natural to man" for "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" and disparaged republicanism as "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid "to political affairs of [his] day".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of "minding not the times but the eternities".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, "For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern "white races" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of "[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches" as "belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', "On Ethics," Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly "Jewish" spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments for the history of philosophy", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Punishment ====
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing "beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="twwr62"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again." Plato, "[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should "be an example to other men not to offend". Plato, "[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]", Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].

==== Views on women ====
In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" of reflexive unexamined reverence ("abgeschmackten Weiberveneration")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=Über die Weiber, §369}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that "Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted." He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer "a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy". He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey". The essay does give some compliments, however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain – Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Young2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&amp;pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130–47|jstor=43469632}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], "I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]

Schopenhauer viewed personality and [[intellect]] as being inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.&lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books – Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis: "If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic."&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's anti-[[egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and modern German thought'' by K. Ansell-Pearson – 1991 – Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal welfare ====
{{See also|Animal_rights#Arthur_Schopenhauer|label 1=Arthur Schopenhauer's views on animal rights}}
As a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Gerhardt, "Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno." Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Puryear, [https://philpapers.org/rec/PURSOT "Schopenhauer on the Rights of Animals." ''European Journal of Philosophy'' 25/2 (2017):250-269].&lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection. ''On the Will in Nature'', "Physiology and Pathology".&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

{{quote|Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.|''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19}}
{{quote|Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun "it" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.&lt;ref&gt;"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like...." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable." ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: "Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours&amp;nbsp;..." This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, "whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions." ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Views on pederasty ====
In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that "the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that "by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual interests and affinities===

====[[Indology]]====
[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]

Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' ("The Great Secret"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them "the production of the highest human wisdom", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature "the greatest gift of our century" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813–1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahāvākyas|Mahāvākya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West
Volume 43, Number 2'', pp. 255–278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[taṇhā]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name="David Burton 2004, page 22"&gt;David Burton, "Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study." Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puruṣārtha]] or goals of life in [[Vedānta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:
* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.

However, Buddhist [[nirvāṇa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the "extinguishing" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (born 1945) stated, "It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]]."&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p. 38. Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-932813-35-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to "free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters".&lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
"Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will." (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14–15, 316–21). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin – 2001 – University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;

''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Vol. 21 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magic and occultism====

Some traditions in [[Western esotericism]] and [[parapsychology]] interested Schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories. He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187–8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual. This theory notably parallels [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of magick and its emphasis on human will.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; Given the importance of the Will to Schopenhauer's overarching system, this amounts to "suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer rejected the theory of [[disenchantment]] and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic, which he believed amount to "practical metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoplatonism]], including the traditions of [[Plotinus]] and to a lesser extent [[Marsilio Ficino]], has also been cited as an influence on Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Pure: Modernity, Philosophy, and the One |chapter=Experimental Subversions of Modernity |date=2009 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn=978-1597310949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Schopenhauer had a wide range of interests, from science and opera to occultism and literature.

In his student years Schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy. He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.&lt;ref name="Flute"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}}

Many evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

As a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|240}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Thoughts on other philosophers ==

=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===
Schopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. "Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself."&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy. Note 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/arthur-schopenhauers-handschriftlicher-nachlass-vorlesungen-und-abhandlungen-4993/3|title=Handschriftlicher, Nachlass, Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen.|last=|first=|date=|website=Gutenberg Spiegel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer expressed his regret that Spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of [[scholasticism]] and [[Cartesian philosophy]], and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of the vagueness and wideness of the definitions. It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation" /&gt;

Schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachlaß|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, ''De Emendatione Intellects'', a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
The importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, can hardly be overstated. The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.

In his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of Königsberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant:

{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,

And there thy flight dissolved from view.

Alone I stayed in the crowd below,

Thy word and thy book my only solace. —|sign=|source=}}

Schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a criticism of the Kantian philosophy.

===Post-Kantian school===
The leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]], Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were no philosophers at all, who merely sought to impress the public.

{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.|sign=Appendix to "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real"|source=}}

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] was deemed the most talented of the three, and Schopenhauer wrote that he would recommend his "elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant" concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Freedom of the Will|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's favourite subject of attacks was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], whom he considered unworthy even of Fichte and Schelling. Whereas Fichte was merely a windbag, Hegel was a "stupid and clumsy charlatan". [[Karl Popper]] agreed with this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Open Society and Her Enemies|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Arthur_Schopenhauer_by_Elisabet_Ney.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|Sculpture of Schopenhauer]] by [[Elisabeth Ney]]]]
Schopenhauer had a large posthumous effect and remained the most influential German philosopher until the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860–1900|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0198768715|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ...

Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers, which consisted of [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Paul Deussen]], Lazar von Hellenbach, [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], Ernst Otto Lindner, [[Philipp Mainländer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Olga Plümacher and Agnes Talbert. His legacy shaped the intellectual debate, and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him, [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]], to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly.&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz/&gt; The French writer [[Maupassant]] commented that "to-day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought."&lt;ref&gt;Beside Schopenhauer's Corpse&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include [[Hans Vaihinger]], [[Johannes Volkelt|Volkelt]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]] and [[Otto Weininger|Weininger]].

Schopenhauer was well read amongst physicists, most notably Einstein, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Pauli greatly admired Schopenhauer. ... Pauli wrote sympathetically about extrasensory perception, noting approvingly that "even such a thoroughly critical philosopher as Schopenhauer not only regarded parapsychological effects going far beyond what is secured by scientific evidence as possible, but even considered them as a support for his philosophy".}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ettore Majorana|Majorana]].&lt;ref name=Majorana /&gt; Einstein described Schopenhauer's thoughts as a "continual consolation" and called him a genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|isbn=978-0743264747|location=New York|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|87}} [[Konrad Wachsmann]] recalled: "He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work."&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}

When [[Erwin Schrödinger]] discovered Schopenhauer ("the greatest savant of the West") he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat: How Two Great Minds Battled Quantum Randomness to Create a Unified Theory of Physics|last=Halpern|first=Paul|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-0465040650|location=|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|132}} [[Wolfgang Pauli]] accepted the main tenet of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, that the [[thing-in-itself]] is will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6149849/Schopenhauers_Metaphysics_and_Contemporary_Quantum_Theory|title=Schopenhauers Metaphysics and Contemporary Quantum Theory|last=Raymond B.

But most of all Schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists. [[Richard Wagner]] became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the Schopenhauerian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Magee (2000) 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The admiration was not mutual, and Schopenhauer proclaimed: "I remain faithful to Rossini and Mozart!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism|last=Nicholas Mathew, Benjamin Walton|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].

Under the influence of Schopenhauer [[Leo Tolstoy]] became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self-renunciation. When he read his philosophy he exclaimed "at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. ... It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection."&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's letter to Afanasy Fet on August 30, 1869. "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights as I've never experienced before. I have brought all of his works and read him over and over, Kant too by the way. Assuredly no student has ever learned and discovered so much in one semester as I have during this summer. I do not know if I shall ever change my opinion, but at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. You say he is so-so, he has written a few things on philosophy? What is so-so? It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection. I have started to translate him. Won't you help me? Indeed, I cannot understand how his name can be unknown. The only explanation for this can only be the one he so often repeats, that is, that there is scarcely anyone but idiots in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; He said that what he has written in ''[[War and Peace]]'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/316432|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|last=Thompson|first=Caleb|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}

Other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Afanasy Fet]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans|J.-K. Huysmans]] and [[George Santayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Santayana and Schopenhauer|last=Caleb Flamm|first=Matthew|journal=Transactions of the Charles S.

[[Sergei Prokofiev]], although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism, became fascinated with Schopenhauer after reading ''Aphorisms on the Wisdom of LifeI'' in ''Parerga and ParalipomenaI.'' "With his truths Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sergey Prokofiev and His World|last=Morrison|first=Simon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780691138954|location=|pages=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

[[File:DBP 1988 1357 Arthur Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Commemorative stamp of the Deutsche Bundespost]]

As a teenager, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological [[transcendental idealism]] for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual [[Metaphysical realism|realism]]. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref name="Culture &amp; Value, p.24, 1933–4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Norman. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir. Oxford University Press, 1958, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Bertrand Russell]] had a low opinion on the philosopher, and attacked him in his famous  [[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|''History of Western Philosophy'']] for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite isle of Russell on the foundations of mathematics, the Dutch mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] incorporated the ideas of Kant and Schopenhauer in [[intuitionism]], where mathematics is considered a purely mental activity, instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed. Brouwer was also influenced by Schopenhauer's metaphysics, and wrote an essay on mysticism.

The '''Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care''' International, or '''AAALAC''', is a private, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. The program started in 1965, when leading veterinarians and researchers organized the '''American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care''', or AAALAC. In 1996, AAALAC changed its name to the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International). The name change reflects the organization's growth in other countries, and its commitment to enhancing life sciences and quality animal care around the world. Today, more than 900 organizations worldwide are accredited.

Along with meeting all applicable local and national regulations, AAALAC accredited institutions must also demonstrate that they are achieving the standards outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 1996). The standards in the Guide go above and beyond what is required by law. One book, ''The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' serves as the basic standard represented by AAALAC accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaalac.org/index.cfm AAALAC home page]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guide'' is written by the National Research Council of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

In 2014, [[PETA]] released a study that found AAALAC accredited laboratories had more animal care violations than laboratories not accredited by the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimm|first1=David|title= Animal welfare accreditation called into question

'''Bibliography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βιβλίον ''biblion'', "book" and -γραφία ''-graphia'', "writing"), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of [[book]]s as physical,  cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |title=bibliology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as objects (descriptive bibliography).

== Etymology ==
The word ''bibliographia'' (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for "the intellectual activity of composing books". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Rudolf. ''Bibliographia, an inquiry into its definition and designations''. Translated by Mathilde V. Rovelstad. Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association; Folkestone, Kent, England: Dawson, 1980. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8389-0146-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Bibliography. http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliography in its systematic pursuit of understanding the past and the present through written and printed documents describes a way and means of extracting information from this material. Bibliographers are interested in comparing versions of texts to each other rather than in interpreting their meaning or assessing their significance.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Hardy, M. (2017). Bibliographic enterprise and the digital age: Charles Evans and the making of early American literature. ''American Literary History, 29''(2), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of study ==
Bibliography is a specialized aspect of [[library science]] (or [[library and information science]], LIS) and [[documentation science]]. It was established by a [[Belgian]], named [[Paul Otlet]] (1868-1944), who was the founder of the field of documentation, as a branch of the information sciences,  who wrote about "the science of bibliography."&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). ''Les sciences bibliographiques et la documentation''. Bruxelles, Institut international de bibliographie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). "The science of bibliography and documentation"2. In Rayward, W.B. (trans. and ed.), (1990), ''International organisation and dissemination of knowledge: Selected essays of Paul Otlet''. FID, Amsterdam: Elsevier.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have recently been voices claiming that "the bibliographical paradigm" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). "Arguments for 'the bibliographical paradigm'. Some thoughts inspired by the new English edition of the UDC", Information Research, 12(4) paper colis06. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as [[bibliometrics]], which is today an influential subfield in LIS.

== Branches ==
Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include [[W. W. Greg]], [[Fredson Bowers]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[G. Thomas Tanselle]].

Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and  provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.

Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description.  Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bowers established in his foundational opus, ''The Principles of Bibliographic Description''. The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg's groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer's initial conception and intention in printing.

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers.

D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as "the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include "non-book texts" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gaskell, ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of [[publication]]s in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Terry.

=== Enumerative bibliography ===
[[File:Pn-samara-n-a-2000-11.jpg|thumb|Bibliographer workplace in Russia]]
An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as [[academic journal|journal]] [[article (publishing)|article]]s. Bibliographies range from "works [[citation|cited]]" lists at the end of books and articles, to complete and independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ''A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers'' (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized [[bibliographic database]]s. A [[library catalog]], while not referred to as a "bibliography," is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be [[tertiary source]]s.

Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.

Citation styles vary.

An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements:
* creator(s)
* title
* place of publication
* publisher or printer
* date of publication

An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains:
* creator(s)
* article title
* journal title
* volume
* pages
* date of publication

A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. [[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. [[Reference management software]] may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required.

Bibliographies differ from [[library catalog]]s by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some [[national library|national libraries]] effectively serve as {{illm|National bibliography|de|Nationalbibliografie|lt=national bibliographies}}, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifla.org/node/2216 |work= Ifla.org |title= National Bibliographic Register |accessdate= 1 December 2017 |publisher=[[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] |location=The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/natbib/bibprint.html |work= Help for researchers |title=National bibliographies and books in print |publisher=British Library |accessdate= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive bibliography ===
Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ''Principles of Bibliographical Description''
(1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "[providing] sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents" (124).

==== Descriptive bibliographies as scholarly product ====
Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object:
*Format and Collation/Pagination Statement&amp;nbsp;– a conventional, symbolic formula that describes the book block in terms of sheets, folds, quires, signatures, and pages
:::According to Bowers (193), the format of a book is usually abbreviated in the collation formula:
::::Broadsheet: I° or b.s. or bs.
::::Folio: 2° or fol.
::::Quarto: 4° or 4to or Q° or Q
::::Octavo: 8° or 8vo
::::Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo
::::Sexto-decimo: 16° or 16mo
::::Tricesimo-secundo: 32° or 32mo
::::Sexagesimo-quarto: 64° or 64mo
:::The collation, which follows the format, is the statement of the order and size of the gatherings.
::::For example, a quarto that consists of the signed gatherings:
:::::2 leaves signed A, 4 leaves signed B, 4 leaves signed C, and 2 leaves signed D
::::would be represented in the collation formula:
:::::4°: A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B-C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Binding&amp;nbsp;– a description of the binding techniques (generally for books printed after 1800)
*Title Page Transcription&amp;nbsp;– a transcription of the title page, including rule lines and ornaments
*Contents&amp;nbsp;– a listing of the contents (by section) in the book
*Paper&amp;nbsp;– a description of the physical properties of the paper, including production process, an account of chain-line measurements, and a description of watermarks (if present)
*Illustrations&amp;nbsp;– a description of the illustrations found in the book, including printing process (e.g. woodblock, intaglio, etc.), measurements, and locations in the text
*Presswork&amp;nbsp;– miscellaneous details gleaned from the text about its production
*Copies Examined&amp;nbsp;– an enumeration of the copies examined, including those copies' location (i.e. belonging to which library or collector)

=== Analytical bibliography ===
This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact&amp;nbsp;– such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book&amp;nbsp;– to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence&amp;nbsp;– such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc.&amp;nbsp;– to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.&lt;ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations&amp;nbsp;– and the aetiology of variations&amp;nbsp;– in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text (Bowers 498[1]).

== Bibliographers ==
[[File:Paul Otlet à son bureau.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Otlet]], to work in an office built at his home following the closure of the [[Mundaneum|Palais Mondial]] in June 1937]]
A ''bibliographer'' is a person who describes and lists books and other publications, with particular attention to such characteristics as authorship, publication date, edition, typography, etc. A person who limits such efforts to a specific field or discipline is a subject bibliographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first= Joan M. |year=2010|url= http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx |title=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=abc-clio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographer, in the technical meaning of the word, is anyone who writes about books. But the accepted meaning since at least the 18th century is a person who attempts a comprehensive account—sometimes just a list, sometimes a fuller reckoning—of the books written on a particular subject. In the present, bibliography is no longer a career, generally speaking; bibliographies tend to be written on highly specific subjects and by specialists in the field.

The term ''bibliographer'' is sometimes—in particular subject bibliographer—today used about certain roles performed in libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/bib_bibliographers |title=MLA Field Bibliographers |publisher=mla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bibliographic database]]s.

== Non-book material ==
Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ''bibliography'':
* [[Discography]]&amp;nbsp;– recorded music
* [[Filmography]]&amp;nbsp;–  films
* [[Webography]] (or webliography)&amp;nbsp;– websites (the first use of the word "webliography" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from June 1995)

Arachniography is a term coined by [[NASA]] research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of [[URL]]s about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ''[[arachne]]'' in reference to a spider and its web.&lt;ref name=atlantic2007&gt;{{cite book | author=Staff | page=28 | title=Encyclopedia Of Information Technology | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | year=2007 | isbn=81-269-0752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=D.

[[Image:Борис Гессен.jpg|200px|thumb|right|'''''Boris M. Hessen'''''.]]
'''Boris Mikhailovich Hessen''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Миха́йлович Ге́ссен}}), also '''Gessen''' (August 16, 1893, [[Elisavetgrad]] &amp;ndash; December 20, 1936, [[Moscow]]),&lt;ref&gt;The date of death is given incorrectly in most sources, including the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] web site [http://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-50109.ln-en.dl-.pr-inf.uk-12].  The exact date was determined recently by the Russian society ''[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[physicist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[History of science|historian of science]]. He is most famous for his paper on [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' which became foundational in [[historiography of science]].

==Biography==
Boris Hessen was born to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Elisavetgrad]], in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]]). He studied [[physics]] and [[natural science]]s at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1913—1914) together with his [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium school]] friend [[Igor Tamm]]. He then went to study at the [[St. Petersburg University]] (1914—1917). He enlisted in the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1919 and became a member of the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] (1919—1921). He also continued his physics studies at various places eventually graduating from the Red Professor's Institute in [[Moscow]] in 1928. After working in the institute for two more years, he became a physics professor and the chair of the physics department at the [[Moscow State University]] in 1931. In 1933 he was elected a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1931, Hessen delivered his famous paper ''"The Socio-Economic Roots of Newton's Principia"'' at the Second International Congress of the [[History of science|History of Science]] in [[London]]. This work became foundational in the [[history of science]] and led to modern studies of [[scientific revolution]]s and [[sociology of science]].

From 1934 to 1936 Hessen was a deputy director of the [[Lebedev Physical Institute|Physics Institute]] in Moscow headed by [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov|S.I. Vavilov]]. On August 22, 1936 Hessen  was arrested by the [[NKVD]]. He was secretly tried for [[terrorism]] by a military tribunal together with his [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium school]] teacher A. O. Apirin. They were found guilty on December 20, 1936 and were [[executed by shooting]] on the same day. On April 21, 1956 both Apirin and Hessen were ''[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]'' (posthumously exonerated).

A common misapplication of this attitude involves its attribution to individuals who emote well-thought-out expressions of [[skepticism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Such miscategorization may occur as the result of either inexperience or a belief system in which the innate goodness of man is considered an important tenet or even an irrefutable fact. Thus, contemporary usage incorporates both a form of jaded prudence (when misapplied) and realistic [[criticism]] or skepticism. The term originally derives from the [[ancient Greek philosophers]], the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who rejected all conventions, whether of [[religion]], manners, housing, dress, or decency, instead advocating the pursuit of [[virtue]] in accordance with a simple and idealistic way of life.

By the 19th century, emphasis on the [[ascetic]] ideals and the critique of current civilization based on how it might fall short of an ideal civilization or [[Antipositivism|negativistic]] aspects of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic philosophy]] led the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Modern cynicism is a distrust toward professed [[ethics|ethical]] and social values, especially when there are high expectations concerning [[society]], institutions, and authorities that are unfulfilled. It can manifest itself as a result of frustration, disillusionment, and distrust perceived as owing to organizations, authorities, and other aspects of society.

==Overview==
Modern cynicism has been defined as an attitude of distrust toward claimed ethical and social values and a rejection of the need to be socially involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Luis E.|last=Navia|year=1999|title=The Adventure of Philosophy|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is pessimistic in regards to the capacity of human beings to make correct ethical choices, and one [[antonym]] is [[naiveté]].&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/thesaurus_561570272/cynicism.html|title=Synonym for cynicism (n) – antonym for cynicism (n) – Thesaurus – MSN Encarta |publisher=[[Encarta]]|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cynicism is sometimes regarded as a product of [[mass society]], especially in those circumstances where the individual believes there is a conflict between society's stated motives and goals and actual motives and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey C.|last=Goldfarb|year=1991|title=The Cynical Society: The Culture of Politics and the Politics of Culture in American Life|p=30|publisher=University of Chicago Press|quote=Cynicism promotes and is a product of mass society.

==In politics==
{{US-centric|section|date=November 2014}}
It has been claimed that "healthy skepticism may have given way to corrosive cynicism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]|year=1996|volume=546|issue=1|pp=71–84|doi=10.1177/0002716296546001007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249666213_News_Frames_Political_Cynicism_and_Media_Cynicism|title=News Frames, Political Cynicism, and Media Cynicism|author=J.

Jamieson|last-author-amp=yes|quote=The media framing of political news is implicated in  "activating,  if not creating,  cynicism about campaigns,  policy,  and governance."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynicism regarding government or politics can logically lead to political withdrawal and effective political helplessness. In 2013 conservative politician and political theorist [[William J. Bennett]] warned that America could "crumble from within; that we would become cynical and withdraw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]|date=5 September 2013|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/357656/we-are-not-helpless-william-j-bennett|title=We Are Not Helpless|authorlink=William Bennett|first=William J.|last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible effects===
A 2004 experiment and paper called ''The Effects of Strategic News on Political Cynicism, Issue Evaluations, and Policy Support: A Two-Wave Experiment''  found that the way the news media presents the news can cause political cynicism. The experiment also demonstrated; "a negative relation between efficacy and cynicism suggesting that efficacious citizens were less likely to be cynical about politics". It was found that straight dry, "issues-based" news did not cause political cynicism, but that "Strategic News" and "game news"  did. The latter two types of news presentation emphasize:
{{cquote|...the horse race,  strategy,  and tactics of politics,"..."news coverage of candidate motivations and personalities,  focus on disagreement between parties,  candidates or voters,  and the presence and emphasis on polls in the news,''"  or  "''positioning the electorate as spectators and candidates as performers."&lt;ref&gt;Claes de Vreese,  2004,  (Cited by 98)  ''The Effects of Strategic News on Political Cynicism,  Issue Evaluations,  and Policy Support:  A Two-Wave Experiment'',  The Amsterdam School of Communications Research,  -  An experimentally manipulated television news story about the enlargement of the European Union was produced in a strategy version and an issue-framed version,  which were embedded in an experimental bulletin of a national news program. [http://www.claesdevreese.com/documents/de_Vreese_Mass_Communication_and_society_2004.pdf Results showed that exposure to  "strategic news"  fueled political cynicism and activated negative associations with the political issue.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831232412/http://www.claesdevreese.com/documents/de_Vreese_Mass_Communication_and_society_2004.pdf |date=2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Social cynicism==
Social cynicism results from high expectations concerning society, institutions and authorities: unfulfilled expectations leads to disillusionment, which releases feelings of disappointment and [[betrayal]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Kanter and [[Philip H. Mirvis]], (1989). ''The Cynical Americans - Living and Working in an Age of Discontent and Disillusion.'' San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizations, cynicism manifests itself as a general or specific attitude, characterized by frustration, hopelessness, disillusionment and distrust in regard to economic or governmental organizations, [[Management|managers]] or other aspects of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=L. M.|author2=Bateman, T. S.|year=1997|title=Cynicism in the workplace: Some causes and effects|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=18|pages=449–469|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1379(199709)18:5&lt;449::aid-job808&gt;3.0.co;2-o}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
Cynicism can appear more active in [[depression (mood)|depression]]. In his [[bestselling]] ''[[Critique of Cynical Reason]]'' (1983), [[Peter Sloterdijk]] defined modern cynics as "borderline melancholics, who can keep their symptoms of depression under control and yet retain the ability to work, whatever might happen ... indeed, this is the essential point in modern cynicism: the ability of its bearers to work—in spite of anything that might happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Sloterdijk|first=Peter|last=Sloterdijk|year=1987|title=[[Critique of Cynical Reason]]|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One active aspect of cynicism involves the desire to expose hypocrisy and to point out gaps between [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] and [[Practice (social theory)|practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=Mary|last=Midgley|contribution=The problem of humbug|editor=Kieran, Matthew|year=1998|title=Media Ethics|p=37|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]] allegedly expressed this succinctly: "The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who don't have it".&lt;ref&gt;Attributed in {{cite book|last=Schreier|first=Benjamin|title=The Power of Negative Thinking: Cynicism and the History of Modern American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jw67ZeECiHQC|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2009|page=187|isbn=9780813928203|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey included 622 people who were tested for dementia for a period of 8 years. In that period, 46 people were diagnosed with dementia. "Once researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect dementia risk, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking, people with high levels of cynical distrust were three times more likely to develop dementia than people with low levels of cynicism. Of the 164 people with high levels of cynicism, 14 people developed dementia, compared to nine of the 212 people with low levels of cynicism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cynical?

'''David John Farmer''' is a professor emeritus of [[philosophy]] and public affairs in the [[L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;[http://www.wilder.vcu.edu/faculty/index.html Profile page.]&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his publications on post-traditional governance theory and practice – especially on macro [[public administration]] and [[public policy]]. He has also published on the philosophy and foundations of economics and on the metaphysics of time. Post-traditional conceptual approaches analyzed in his writings include thinking as play, justice as seeking, practice as art, reflexive language, imaginization, anti-administration, [[deterritorialization]], and epistemic pluralism.

The contents of some of the books are indicated under their titles – ''To Kill the King'', ''The Language of Public Administration'', ''Public Administration in Perspective'', and ''Crime Control''. The reference section lists these and others of his works. Dr. Farmer has also contributed to the fields of post-traditional governance theory and practice through many book chapters and articles.&lt;ref name=Resume&gt;[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dfarmer/resume.htm Resume.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Barnstaple, Devonshire, U.K. His father Joseph worked for most of his life in the Research and Development Department of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]].

He began his university education at the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of London]]. He obtained a master's degree in economics from the [[University of Toronto]] and a master's degree in philosophy at the [[University of Virginia]]. He was awarded two Ph.D. degrees. His Ph.D. in Economics is from the [[University of London]] (1984), and his Ph.D. in Philosophy is from the [[University of Virginia]] (1989).

== Career ==
Dr. Farmer’s career has been as a practitioner and as an academic. His practitioner experience included work as a management consultant for the Public Administration Service and for the Jacobs Company, both of Chicago (1965-1971). This management consulting included services to some forty state and local governments, e.g., the states of Illinois and Pennsylvania and cities of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Northampton, Galesburg, Reading, Salt Lake, New Hope, Durham, Oklahoma City, Plymouth, Moberly, Tacoma, Kansas City and Milwaukee. He has also worked as an employee in five governments. This included the City of New York, as director of Operations Management and as Special Assistant to the Police Commissioner in the [[New York City Police Department]] (1971-1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New York Times]] | volume = CXXI | issue = 41, 527 | date = 5 October 1971 | title = 6 Civilian Specialists Join Police as Murphy's Aides | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also included the U.S. Government, as a division director in the National Institute of Justice in the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (1974-1980).  Previous employment included work as an economist and as an administrative analyst for two Canadian provincial governments (Ontario and Saskatchewan).&lt;ref name=Resume /&gt;

Dr. Robert Cunningham (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) wrote that Farmer "sets his ideas on the high road, the big picture, and implications for the future, adhering to the principle that ideas should be explained as simply as possible without distorting the reality..." (Cunningham, 2009, 302).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cunningham | first = Robert | title = Introduction: "To Kill The King" by David John Farmer: a review symposium | journal = Public Administration Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–302 | publisher = Southern Public Administration Education Foundation, Inc.

It described and illustrated the breadth and depth of Dr. Farmer’s iconic contributions to post-traditional public administration theory and practice. In the closing article, Orion White concluded that “David Farmer’s monumental contribution is to have laid the foundation stone from which a new Public Administration culture can be built.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = David Farmer's Body of Work:  A Retrospective and Prospective View | journal = International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–112 | publisher = PrAcademics Press  | url = http://www.pracademics.com/index.php/ijotb/289-ijotb-years/ijotb-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles included those titled “What is Newark?” “Applying Farmer’s Lenses: Two Illustrations,” “Of Rhizomes and Pointillism: David John Farmer’s Influence,” “The Practicality of Poetic Contemplation: A Reflection on David Farmer as a Methodologist,” and “David Farmer’s Body of Work: A Retrospective and Prospective View.&lt;ref name="PrAcademics Press"/&gt;

== Books ==

=== ''To Kill the King'' ===
This 2005 book discusses a post-traditional consciousness that aims to revitalize governance and bureaucracy. ''To Kill the King'' explains such consciousness in terms of three concepts analyzed as thinking as play, justice as seeking, and practice as art. It describes a post-traditional consciousness of governance that can yield improvements in the quality of life for each individual and for future generations. The publisher claims that the book aims to "capture the heart, and enlarge the soul, of reform movements within the study of governance and bureaucracy." O.C. McSwite, formerly of Virginia Tech and George Washington Universities, wrote: "I consider this book to be a major and distinctive contribution to the field of public administration and to the discourse about the future of government in the United States as well" (O.C. McSwite, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;303).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | title = To kill the king: post-traditional governance and bureaucracy | publisher = M.E.

=== ''The Language of Public Administration''===
This book argues that modern public administration theory, although valuable, is limiting as an explanatory and catalytic force in resolving problems about the functioning of public bureaucracy and in transforming public bureaucracy into a more positive force. ''The Language of Public Administration'' (1995) specifies a reflexive language paradigm for public administration thinking. It aims to show how the study and practice of public administration can be reinvigorated. Dr. Alexander Kouzmin (Southern Cross University and University of South Australia) writes that “Unrivalled by peers, Dr. Farmer has a vibrant language of public administration transgressing what is sayable and what is un-sayable (A. Kouzmin, 2011,  p. 803).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kouzmin | first = Alexander | title = Paradigmatic and ontological tensions in U.S. public administration | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 803–807 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02428.x | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02428.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Language of Public Administration'' was listed as one of the candidate books for “great books of public administration, 1990-2010” (Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;890).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meier | first1 =Kenneth J. | last2 = O’Toole, Jr. | first2 = Laurence J. | title = Influence: what kind? and how to know? | journal = [[Administration &amp; Society]] | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 888–893 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0095399712466801 | date = October 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0095399712466801 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780817307844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Language of Public Administration'' has been translated into Chinese and Korean. It was translated into Chinese in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = Public Administration and Public Management Classics | series = Academic Frontier Series | location = China | year = 2005 | language = Chinese | isbn = 9787300070018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean translation was published in 1999 by Pakyoung Publishing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press through Sintack Kang, Seoul National University | location = Seoul, Korea | year = 1995 | language = Korean | isbn = 9788910451402 }}[http://www.paksoungsa.co.kr Publishing company website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Public Administration in Perspective'' ===
The book explains and illustrates how public administration can benefit from epistemic pluralism – just as can any other action or social science discipline, currently operating essentially within its own disciplinary cul-de-sac. ''Public Administration in Perspective'' (2010) explains that epistemic refers to knowing; pluralism refers to more than one way. The book offers an example of a grand strategy of epistemic pluralism. It examines public administration theory and practice from perspectives that include a traditional, a business, an economic, a political, a critical theory, a post-structural, a psychoanalytic, a neuroscience, a feminist, an ethical, and a data lens. It begins by quoting [[Dwight Waldo]]’s claim that “administrative thought must establish a working relationship with every major province in the realm of human learning.” Dr. Breena Coates (California State University, San Bernardino) writes about ''Public Administration in Perspective'' that the “author provides unique and, hitherto, unexplored perspectives from which to view the multiple faces of public administration… The book’s scholarship is compelling and hard to resist… Today in our networked, globalized environment we are more than ever coming to the realization that there is an interdisciplinary basis for understanding truth, and that each discrete branch of knowledge studies a mere subset of particularized knowledge streams” (B.

=== ''Crime Control'' ===
The book presents a comprehensive examination of police resources allocation decision making and documents research indicating opportunities for better utilization of police resources. The publisher of this 1984 book (Crime Control) claims that the book should be read by "those working in the fields of law and society, criminology, sociology, political science, criminal law, and criminal justice."
The former N.Y.P.D. Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy wrote of this book that “In recent years, American policing has benefited greatly from the observations and analyses of scholars and researchers, particularly when they have had on-line experience in police agencies at one or another stage in their careers. David J. Farmer is a scholar who has had such experience, which adds a special dimension to his observations and conclusions” (Patrick V. Murphy, 1984, p. vii.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Murphy | first = Patrick V. | contribution = Foreword | editor-last = Farmer | editor-first = David John | title = Crime control: the use and misuse of police resources | publisher = Springer | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1984 | page = viii | isbn = 9781468447835 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | title = Crime control: the use and misuse of police resources | publisher = Springer | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1984 | isbn = 9781468447835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Deshan Xuanjian''' ({{zh|c=德山宣鑒|w=Te-shan Hsuan-chien}}; [[Pinyin]]: Déshān Xuānjiàn; {{CJKV|j=Tokusan Senkan}}), was a Chinese [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. He was born in Jiannan in what is now [[Sichuan Province]]. He is remembered for hitting his students with a cane to express awakening. Through his student [[Xuefeng Yicun]], he is the ancestor to two of the [[Five Houses of Chán|Five Houses of Zen]], the [[Yunmen Wenyan|Yunmen School]] and the [[Fayan School]]. Earlier in his life he was a scholar focused on the [[Vinaya]], and later he became famous for his knowledge of the [[Diamond Sutra]]. However, a famous [[kōan]] story recorded in the [[Blue Cliff Record]] and [[Shōbōgenzō]] [[Shin fukatoku]] relates an encounter he had with an old woman that convinced him that scriptural study on its own fails to bring about awakening. After this he studied under the Zen teacher [[Longtan Chongxin]]. During the reign of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]], the brief but intense [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] was initiated and Deshan was forced from a thirty year long position in Lizhou into hiding on Mt. Dufu. Afterwards the governor of Wuleng in what is now [[Hunan Province]] asked Deshan to come to live on Mount Virtue, known in Chinese as "''Deshan''", the mountain after which he is named.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{citation|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|pages=230|isbn=9780691157863|publisher=Princeton University Press|place=Princeton|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8270">'''Examination of conscience''' is a review of one's past thoughts, words, actions, and omissions for the purpose of ascertaining their conformity with, or deviation from, the moral law. Among Christians, this is generally a private review; secular intellectuals have, on occasion, published '''autocritiques''' for public consumption. In the [[Catholic Church]] penitents who wish to receive the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|sacrament of penance]] are encouraged to examine their conscience using the [[Catholic doctrine regarding the Ten Commandments|Ten Commandments]] as a guide, or the Beatitudes, or the virtues and vices. A similar doctrine is taught in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, where penitents who wish to receive [[Confession in the Lutheran Church#Private Confession|Holy Absolution]] are also asked to use the [[Ten Commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|Ten Commandments]] as a guide. The process is very similar to the Islamic practice of Muhasaba, or self-reflection.

"The excellence of this practice and its fruitfulness for Christian virtue," preached Pope St. [[Pius X]], "are clearly established by the teaching of the great masters of the spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10haer.htm|title=HAERENT ANIMO|last=|first=|date=|website=www.papalencyclicals.net|at=4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] considered the examination of conscience as the single most important spiritual exercise. In his ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]'' he presents different forms of it in the  particular and general examination (24-43). Of the general examination he writes; "The first point is to give thanks to God our Lord for the favors received" (43). This point has become a highly developed part of [[Ignatian spirituality]] in modern times, and has led to many more positive practices, generally called '''examen of consciousness'''. In twice-daily "examens" one might review the ways God has been present through one to others, and to oneself through others, and how one has responded, and to proceed with one's day with gratitude, more aware of the presence of God in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen/consciousness-examen|title=Consciousness Examen by George Aschenbrenner, SJ - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-05-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marriageretreats.webs.com/exercises/Daily%20Examination%20of%20Consciousness.htm|title=A SIMPLE WAY|website=marriageretreats.webs.com|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loyolapress.com/our-catholic-faith/prayer/personal-prayer-life/different-ways-to-pray/prayerfully-reviewing-your-day-daily-examen|title=Prayerfully Reviewing Your Day: Daily Examen|website=www.loyolapress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, there is a distinction between the '''particular examen''', which aims to change one particular feature or defect in one's behavior, the '''examen of consciousness''', which is a more nuanced reflection, and the general '''examination of conscience''' as used before the sacrament of penance.” This last method is called examination of conscience because it is a review of one’s actions from a moral point of view, reflecting upon one’s responsibility and looking at one’s sins and weaknesses in preparation for repentance, in contrast with the examen of consciousness which does not focus on morality even if sins will emerge during the review of the day.&lt;ref&gt;These forms of the Examination are presented in the chapter [http://marriageretreats.webs.com/Manual/firstbeginning.htm "The method and the First Exercise: existential experience of the history of salvation"] of the [http://marriageretreats.webs.com/manualfortheretreat.htm Spiritual Exercises for Married Couples: Finding Our Way Together with St. Ignatius] - Manual for the Retreat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. in the online text of [http://www.nwjesuits.org/JesuitSpirituality/SpiritualExercises.html The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
Examination of conscience was commanded by the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] to be performed by the faithful each time they received [[Holy Communion]]: "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.... For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged." ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:28-31}}, [[KJV]]). And, as the early Christians received Holy Communion very frequently, examination of conscience became a familiar exercise of their spiritual lives. In many cases, this became a daily practice of the lives of early members of the clergy and those living a monastic life, such as the hermit [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]], who was said to have examined his conscience every night, while St. [[Basil of Caesarea]], St. [[Augustine of Hippo]], St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and founders of religious orders generally made the examination of conscience a regular daily exercise of their followers. Lay members of congregations were encouraged to take up the practice as a salutary measure to advance in virtue.&lt;ref name=Coppens&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05675a.htm  Coppens, Charles. "Examination of Conscience." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 7 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; St. Bernard had taught: "As a searching investigator of the integrity of your own conduct, submit your life to a daily examination. Consider carefully what progress you have made or what ground you have lost. Strive to know yourself. Place all your faults before your eyes. Come face to face with yourself, as though you were another person, and then weep for your faults." &lt;ref&gt;Meditationes piissimae, c. V, de Quotid. sui ipsius exam&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotional examination of conscience is distinct from that required as a proximate preparation for the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]] which is intended specifically to identify all sins requiring repentance. Various more elaborate methods might be used in the examination for confession, using the Ten Commandments of God, the Commandments of the Church, the Seven Capital Sins, the duties of one's state of life, the nine ways of partaking in the sin of others.&lt;ref name="Coppens" /&gt;
[[Image:Ignatius Loyola.jpg|160px|thumb|left|[[Ignatius Loyola]]]]
For the devotional examination the method laid down by St. Ignatius of Loyola in his ''Spiritual Exercises'' contains five points. In the first point, followers thank God for the benefits received; in the second, they ask grace to know and correct our faults; in the third, they pass in review the successive hours of the day, noting what faults they have committed in deed, word, thought, or omission; in the fourth, they ask God's pardon; in the fifth, they purpose amendment.&lt;ref name=Coppens/&gt;{{Better source|reason=The online encyclopedia it references is full of references to itself. Hard to tell if the sourcing is good.|date=June 2018}}

==Autocritique==
Among secular intellectuals, particularly [[Marxists]], the term ''autocritique'', borrowed from [[:fr:autocritique|the French]], is used. This is particularly applied to a public "methodological attempt to step away from themselves through a process of self-objectification," and was popular in France following the [[Algerian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Sueur, James D.; ''Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization'', [[University of Pennsylvania]] press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Morin]]'s questioning of his own motives as a defender of Algeria popularised the term; other well-known examples include [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s anonymous dissection of his own personality and drive in the [[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]].

The '''Faraday paradox''' was a once inexplicable aspect of the reaction between [[nitric acid]] and [[steel]].  Around 1830, the [[England|English]] scientist [[Michael Faraday]] found that diluted nitric acid would attack steel, but concentrated nitric acid would not.  The attempt to explain this discovery led to advances in [[electrochemistry]].

==Passivation==
The key to resolving the paradox is [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. When the acid is concentrated enough, and because concentrated nitric acid is an [[oxidizing agent]], the potential of the metal is raised to the point that a layer of metastable [[Iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] forms on the surface and protects it from further corrosion, even though the [[pH]] is so low that stable Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cannot exist. This explanation is supported by the observation that scratching the surface causes a burst of bubbles. Diluted nitric acid is not as strong an oxidizing agent and hence does not raise the potential of the metal to the extent that metastable Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; forms on the surface. In this case, the metal freely corrodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1806">The '''Florence Nightingale effect''' is a trope where a caregiver develops romantic feelings, sexual feelings, or both for their patient, even if very little communication or contact takes place outside of basic care. Feelings may fade once the patient is no longer in need of care.

==Origin==
The effect is named for [[Florence Nightingale]], a pioneer in the field of nursing in the second half of the 19th century. Due to her dedication to patient care, she was dubbed "The Lady with the Lamp" because of her habit of making rounds at night, previously not done. Her care would forever change the way hospitals treated patients. Most consider Nightingale the founder of modern nursing. There is no record of Florence Nightingale having ever fallen in love with one of her patients. In fact, despite multiple suitors, she never married for fear it might interfere with her calling for nursing. [[Albert Finney]] referred to the effect as the "Florence Nightingale syndrome" in a 1982 interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215822/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20082456,00.html |date=June 21, 1982 |author=Judy Bachrach |title=Albert Finney |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that phrase was used earlier to refer to health workers pursuing non-tangible rewards in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1947902/pdf/canmedaj01592-0104.pdf |page=864 |title=Unions moving into MD offices and clinics |author=David Woods |date=October 19, 1974 |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |work=Canandian Medical Association Journal |volume=111 |issue=8 |pmc=1947902 |pmid=4422568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Software Foundation''' ('''FSF''') is a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] founded by [[Richard Stallman]] on 4 October 1985 to support the [[free software movement]], which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify [[computer software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/about/ |title=Free software is a matter of liberty, not price|publisher=Free Software Foundation| accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the organization's preference for software being distributed under [[copyleft]] ("share alike") terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as with its own [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Copyleft? |url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF was incorporated in [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|US]], where it is also based.&lt;ref name="FSF MACorpRegistry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&amp;UpdateAllowed=&amp;FEIN=042888848|title=FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.

From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write [[free software]] for the [[GNU Project]]. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the [[free software community]].

Consistent with its goals, the FSF aims to use only [[free software]] on its own computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html |title = Linux, GNU, and freedom |accessdate = 2006-12-10 |author = Stallman, Richard M. |authorlink = Richard Stallman |year = 2002 |work = Philosophy of the GNU Project |publisher = GNU Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{cleanup|reason=the timeline of the narrative|date=May 2014}}
The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting [[free software]] development. It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and [[Magnetic tape data storage|tapes]], and employed developers of the free software system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html |title=The GNU Project |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement. The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html |title=Licenses |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the [[GNU]] system, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the [[copyleft]] requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) when [[copyright infringement]] occurs on that software.

From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally,  usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, [[Eben Moglen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 [[Harald Welte]] launched [[gpl-violations.org]].

In late 2001, [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (then executive director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and [[Peter T. Brown]], formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high-profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against [[Linksys]] and OpenTV, became frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Meeker |first = Heather |title = The Legend of Linksys |date= 2005-06-28 |url = http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090419230853/http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml |archivedate = 2009-04-19}} Hosted on the [[Wayback machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Gillmor |first = Dan |title = GPL Legal Battle Coming? |publisher = SiliconValley.com (a division of the [[San Jose Mercury News]]) |date= 2003-05-21 |url = http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030524174013/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |archivedate = 2003-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Turner |first = David |author2=[[Bradley M.

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kennedy |first = Dennis |date= 2004-01-11 |title = A Great Learning Opportunity for Software Lawyers&amp;nbsp;— Upcoming GPL Seminar |url = http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125310/http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 |publisher= [[Slashdot]] |last = Lord |first = Timothy |date= 2003-07-18 |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |title = Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, [[SCO v. IBM|SCO filed suit against IBM]] alleging that IBM's contributions to various [[free software]], including FSF's [[GNU]], violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was [[subpoena]]ed on November 5, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Heise |first = Mark |title = SCO Subpoena of FSF |publisher = Free Software Foundation |date= 2003-11-05 |url = https://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-subpoena.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kuhn |first = Bradley |authorlink = Bradley M. Kuhn |title = The SCO Subpoena of FSF |publisher = Free Software Foundation |date= 2004-05-18 |url = https://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/subpoena.html |accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses |url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 |accessdate = 2008-07-04 |date = 2003-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually taught by [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] and [[Daniel Ravicher]], these seminars offered [[Continuing Legal Education|CLE credit]] and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/press/2004-01-02-nyc-seminars.html |title=FSF To Host Free Software Licensing Seminars and Discussions on SCO v.

In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the [[GNU General Public License]] after significant outside input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GNU General Public License |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html |title=gplv3.fsf.org comments for discussion draft 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, FSF filed a lawsuit against [[Cisco]] for using GPL-licensed components shipped with [[Linksys]] products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Paul |first = Ryan |title = Free Software Foundation lawsuit against Cisco a first |date = 2007-12-13 |publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] |url = https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081211-free-software-foundation-lawsuit-against-cisco-a-first.html |accessdate = 2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Paul |first = Ryan |title = Cisco settles FSF GPL lawsuit, appoints compliance officer |date = 2009-05-21 |publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] |url = https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/05/cisco-settles-fsf-gpl-lawsuit-appoints-compliance-officer.ars |accessdate = 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and ongoing activities==
;The [[GNU Project]]: The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software. The organization developed the [[GNU]] operating system as an example of this.
;GNU licenses: The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).
;GNU Press: The FSF's publishing department, responsible for "publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

;The [[Free Software Directory]]: This is a listing of software packages that have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from [[UNESCO]] for this project. It is hoped{{By whom|date=May 2010}} that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future.
;Maintaining the [[Free Software Definition]]: FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement.
;Project hosting: FSF hosts software development projects on its [[GNU Savannah|Savannah]] website.
;[[h-node]]: An abbreviation for "Hardware-Node", the ''h-node'' website lists [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[device driver]]s that have been verified as compatible with free software. It is user-edited and volunteer supported with hardware entries tested by users before publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdtimes.com/fsf-debian-join-forces-help-free-software-users-find-hardware-need/ FSF and Debian join forces to help free software users find the hardware they need]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.jp/magazine/14/09/11/062900 FSFとDebianがGNU/Linuxハードウェア情報サイトh-node.orgを共同支援]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.h-node.org/ Hardware-Node Database]&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Advocacy]]: FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom, including [[software patent]]s, [[digital rights management]] (which the FSF and others&lt;ref name="Stross NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=STROSS|first=RANDALL|title=Want an iPhone?

[[Defective by Design]] is an FSF-initiated campaign against DRM. It also has a campaign to promote [[Ogg]]+[[Vorbis]], a free alternative to [[proprietary formats]] like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]. FSF also sponsors free software projects it deems "high-priority".
;Annual awards: "[[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]" and "[[Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit]]"
;[[LibrePlanet]] wiki:The LibrePlanet wiki organizes FSF members into regional groups in order to promote free software [[activism]] against [[Digital Rights Management|Digital Restrictions Management]] and other issues promoted by the FSF.

==High priority projects==
[[File:Gnewsensescreenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gNewSense]] is a distribution officially supported by the ''FSF'']]

The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "''there is a vital need to draw the [[free software community]]'s attention''".&lt;ref name="highpriority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/ |title=High Priority Free Software Projects |publisher=Free Software Foundation |authorlink=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF considers these projects "''important because computer users are continually being seduced into using [[non-free software]], because there is no adequate free replacement.''"&lt;ref name="highpriority" /&gt;

Current high priority tasks include [[reverse engineering]] proprietary firmware; reversible debugging in [[GNU Debugger]]; developing [[Transcription (service)|automatic transcription]] and [[video editing software|video editing]] software, [[Coreboot]], drivers for [[network routers]] and creating replacements for [[Skype]], [[Google Earth]], [[OpenDWG]] libraries, [[BitTorrent Sync]] and [[Oracle Forms]].&lt;ref name="highpriority" /&gt;

Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the [[Free Java implementations]], [[GNU Classpath]], and [[GNU Compiler for Java]], which ensure compatibility for the Java part of [[OpenOffice.org]], and the [[GNOME]] desktop environment (see [[Java (Sun)#Licensing|Java: Licensing]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/changelog&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort has been criticized by [[Michael Larabel]] for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTAwMTY |title=The Sad State Of FSF's High Priority Projects |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |quote=''Long story short, being on the Free Software Foundation's high priority list really doesn't mean much with some of these "important" projects not even being actively developed or even discussed.''|first=Michael |last=Larabel |authorlink=Michael Larabel |publisher=[[Phoronix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTA5MDk |title=Many FSF Priority Projects Still Not Progressing|date=2012-04-22|accessdate=2014-12-29|quote=''Most of the projects are basically not going anywhere. Many of them at the time were not really advancing in their goals, haven't had releases in a while, or coding hasn't even started. It's been more than a half-year and still there's no significant work towards clearing many of projects from the FSF list.

==Hardware endorsements (RYF)==
{{See also|Coreboot|Libreboot}}
The FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom" (RYF) hardware certification program. To be granted certification, a product must use 100% Free Software, allow user installation of modified software, be free of [[Backdoor (computing)|back doors]] and conform with several other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/criteria |title=Respects Your Freedom hardware certification requirements |publisher=Free Software Foundation |date=Jan 27, 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |author=Josh Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, a total of 27 products have been granted the certification, including three [[laptop]]s, a [[3D printer]], a [[wireless router]], and three [[USB]] interface [[wireless adapter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom|title=Respects Your Freedom hardware product certification |publisher=Free Software Foundation |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2015 |author=Gay, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 27 certified products are:
* The [[Libreboot]] X200 laptop
* The Libreboot X60 laptop (formerly known as the Gluglug X60)
* [[Aleph Objects, Inc.]] LulzBot 3D printers
* The [[ThinkPenguin]] TPE-NWIFIROUTER Wireless-N Broadband Router
* The ThinkPenguin TPE-N150USB Wireless N USB
* The ThinkPenguin TPE-N150USBL Wireless USB adapter
* The [[Tehnoetic]] wireless USB adapter for GNU/Linux-libre (TET-N150)
* The Taurinus X200 laptop by [[Libiquity]]

==Structure==
===Board===
{{update section|date=May 2014}}

The FSF's [[board of governors]] includes amongst themselves professors at leading universities, senior engineers, and founders. A few high-profile activists, and software businessmen are admitted as well. Currently on the board there is one high-profile activist, and one world-class, software-campaign strategist (Windows 95, ''et al.''). There was once a majorly contributing programmer (Mono and Gnome) and businessman who lost favor badly. Founders are also major software developers of the free software in the GNU Project.

[[William John Sullivan|John Sullivan]] is the current FSF executive director. Previous members that occupied the position were [[Peter T. Brown]] (2005–2010) and [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (2001–2005).

Current board members:

* [[Geoffrey Knauth]], senior software engineer at SFA, Inc. (served since October 23, 1997)
* [[Henry Poole (technologist)|Henry Poole]], founder of [[CivicActions]], a government digital services firm (served since December 12, 2002)
* [[Richard Stallman]], founding president, launched the [[GNU project]], author of the [[GNU General Public License]] (served as president since inception)
* [[Gerald Jay Sussman]], professor of [[computer science]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (served since inception)

Those documents further indicate that the 2000 annual meeting occurred on July 28, 2000; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007&lt;ref&gt;Moglen announced his intention to resign in his blog ({{cite web|url=http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/blog/organizations/SFLC/Transition.html|title=And Now ... Life After GPLv3|last=Moglen|first=Eben|authorlink=Eben Moglen|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2007-08-11}}). The resignation likely occurred at the 2007 annual meeting of the directors; the exact date of that meeting is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;!--I know he announced on [[April 23]], but when did his term actually end? Bkuhn responds: There are no third-party sources for that yet, but I've added a link to what we know. --&gt;

===Voting===
The FSF Articles of Organization state that the [[board of directors]] are elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|Article II, Sec. 1 - Number, Election and Qualification: The present members of the corporation shall constitute the voting members. Thereafter the voting members annually at its annual meeting shall fix the number of voting members and shall elect the number of voting members so fixed. At any special or regular meeting, the voting members then in office may increase the number of voting members and elect new voting members to complete the number so fixed; or they may decrease the number of voting members, but only to eliminate vacancies caused by the death, resignation, removal or disqualification of one or more voting members.|Amended By-laws, Nov. 25, 2002|Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bylaws say who can vote for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|In addition to the right to elect Directors as provided in the bylaws and such other powers and rights as may be vested in them by law, these Articles of Organization or the bylaws, the Voting Members shall have such other powers and rights as the Directors may designate.|Amended By-laws, Nov. 25, 2002|Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board can grant powers to the Voting Membership.&lt;ref name="maaa"/&gt;

===Employment===
At any given time, there are usually around a dozen employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board |title = Meet the staff of the Free Software Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, work at the FSF headquarters in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink = https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm |title = Certificate of Change of Principal Office |publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts |date= 2005-05-26 |url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2005/0526/000000000/4122/200516698270_1.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
On November 25, 2002, the FSF launched the FSF Associate Membership program for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The site member.fsf.org first appears in the Internet Archive in December 2002, and that site lists the date of the launch as 25 November 2002. {{cite web |title = FSF Membership Page, as of 2002-12-20 |publisher = The Internet Archive |date= 2002-12-20 |url = http://member.fsf.org/ |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021220112452/http://member.fsf.org/ |archivedate = 2002-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (FSF executive director, 2001–2005) launched the program and also signed up as the first Associate Member&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn has an FSF-generated member link that identifies him as the first member on his web page. {{cite web |title = Homepage of Bradley M. Kuhn |publisher = Bradley M. Kuhn |date= 2008-01-05 |url = http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn |accessdate = 2008-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associate members hold a purely honorary and funding support role to the FSF.&lt;ref name="maaa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/fsf-amended-bylaws-current.pdf | title=Amended Bylaws | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===
[[Eben Moglen]] and [[Dan Ravicher]] previously served individually as [[pro bono]] legal counsel to the FSF. After forming the [[Software Freedom Law Center]], Eben Moglen continued to serve as the FSF's general counsel until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-announces-change-in-general-counsel|title=FSF announces change in general counsel — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software|website=www.fsf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
Most of the FSF funding comes from patrons and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html|title=About the GNU Project|last=Stallman|first=Richard|work=Gnu Project|publisher=FSF|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue streams also come from free-software-related compliance labs, job postings, published works, and a [[web store]]. FSF offers speakers and seminars for pay, and all FSF projects accept donations.

Revenues fund free-software programs and campaigns, while cash is invested conservatively in [[socially responsible investing]]. The financial strategy is designed to maintain the Foundation's long-term future through economic stability.

The FSF is a tax-exempt organization and posts annual IRS Form 990 filings online.&lt;ref name="IRS Form 990"&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Free Software Foundation IRS Form 990|url=http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/Form990_FY2014.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized FSF for using [[GPLv3]] as a weapon in the fight against [[Digital rights management|DRM]]. Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=à 21:00 |url=http://linuxfr.org/nodes/85904/comments/1230981 |title=Original version |publisher=LinuxFr.org |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at ''[[Linux Magazine]]'', criticized the [[Defective by Design]] campaign by the FSF as "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Party of Gno.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 |url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSF responded to this criticism by saying "that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns", and "that if one is taking an ethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2011/fall/in-defense-of-negativity In defense of negativity — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software]. https://www.fsf.org.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2563">'''Haplography''' (from Greek: haplo- 'single' + -graphy 'writing'), also known as '''lipography''', is a [[scribal error|scribal]] or [[typographical error]] where a letter or group of letters that should be written twice is written once. It is not to be confused with [[haplology]], where a phoneme is omitted to prevent two similar sounds from occurring consecutively: the former is a textual error, while the latter is a phonological process. 

In English, a common haplographical mistake is the rendering of consecutive letters between morphemes as a single letter. Many [[commonly misspelled words]] have this form. For example, ''misspell'' is often misspelled as ''mispell''. The etymology of the word misspell is the affix "mis-" plus the root "spell", their bound morpheme has two consecutive s's, one of which is often erroneously omitted. The opposite of haplography is [[dittography]]. 

Other examples of words liable to be written haplographically in different languages are: German ''rollladen'' ("shutters", from ''roll'' + ''laden'') which requires an uncommon sequence of three ''l''-s and is often spelt ''rolladen'', or Arabic ''takyīf'' تكييف ("air conditioning"), which would require a sequence of two semivowels ''y'' (one as a true semivowel, and another as a device to mark long ''ī'') and is often spelt as ''takīf'' تكيف, with only one.

The term ''haplography'' is commonly used in the field of [[textual criticism]] to refer to the phenomenon of a scribe's, copyist's or translator's inadvertently skipping from one word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on in the text, and omitting everything in between.&lt;ref&gt;This usage can be seen at {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fnBj3_hJOXIC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first1=David Noel |last1=Freedman |first2=Shawna Dolansky |last2=Overton |chapter=Omitting the omissions: the case for haplography in the transmission of the biblical texts |title="Imagining" Biblical Worlds: studies in spatial, social and historical constructs in honor of James W.

'''Haptic communication''' is a branch of [[nonverbal communication]] that refers to the ways in which people and animals communicate and interact via the sense of touch. [[Touch]] or haptics, from the ancient Greek word ''[[Haptic technology|haptikos]]'' is extremely important for communication; it  is vital for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Tiffany. “The Importance of Touch.” ''Karger Gazette'', misc.karger.com/gazette/67/Field/art_4.htm. Accessed 25 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of touch  allows one to experience different sensations such as: pleasure, pain, heat, or cold.  One of the most significant aspects of touch is the ability to convey and enhance [[physical intimacy]]. The sense of  [[touch]] is the fundamental component of haptic communication for [[interpersonal relationships]]. Touch can be categorized in many terms such  as positive, playful, control, ritualistic, task-related or unintentional. It can be both [[Human sexual behavior|sexual]] ([[kissing]] is one example that some perceived as sexual), and [[Platonic love|platonic]] (such as [[hug]]ging or a [[Handshake]]).

Touch is the earliest sense to develop in the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Pediatrix Medical Group, editor. “How Babies' Sense Develop.” 2015, {{doi|10.4324/9781315665566}}. Accessed 11 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of an [[Infants|infant's]] haptic senses and how it relates to the development of the other senses such as [[Visual perception|vision]] has been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3691193 |jstor=1130683 |year=1987 |last1=Schanberg |first1=Saul M. |title=Sensory deprivation stress and supplemental stimulation in the rat pup and preterm human neonate |journal=Child Development |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1431–47 |last2=Field |first2=Tiffany M. |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb03856.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Crystal. “The Sense of Touch and How It Affects Development.” ''The Sense of Touch and How It Affects Development'', 14 May 2009, serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/crystal-leonard/sense-touch-and-how-it-affects-development. Accessed 11 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to infants, in chimpanzees the sense of touch is highly developed. As newborns they see and hear poorly but cling strongly to their mothers. [[Harry Harlow]] conducted a controversial study involving [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]] and observed that monkeys reared with a "terry cloth mother", a wire feeding apparatus wrapped in softer [[Terrycloth|terry cloth]] which provided a level of tactile stimulation and comfort, were considerably more emotionally stable as adults than those with a mere wire mother. For his experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed surrogate mother and a wire surrogate mother which held a bottle with food. It turns out that the rhesus monkeys spent most of their time with the terry cloth mother, over the wire surrogate with a bottle of food, which indicates that they preferred touch, warmth, and comfort over sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Michael Baker|title=Harlow's Studies on Dependency in Monkeys|date=2010-12-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrNBEhzjg8I|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strike (attack)|Striking]], pushing, pulling, pinching, [[kick]]ing, [[strangling]] and hand-to-hand [[fighting]] are forms of touch in the context of [[physical abuse]]. In a sentence like "I never touched him/her" or "Don't you dare to touch him/her" the term touch may be meant as [[euphemism]] for either physical abuse or sexual touching.  The word '''touch''' has many other [[metaphor]]ical uses. One can be [[emotion]]ally touched, referring to an action or object that evokes an emotional response. To say "I was touched by your letter" implies the reader felt a strong emotion when reading it. It usually does not include [[anger]], [[disgust]] or other forms of emotional rejection unless used in a [[sarcastic]] manner. Stoeltje (2003) wrote about how Americans are ‘losing touch’ with this important communication skill. During a study conducted by [[University of Miami]] School of Medicine, Touch Research Institutes, American children were said to be more aggressive than their French counterparts while playing at a playground. It was noted that French women touched their children more often than the American parents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Categories==
Heslin outlines five haptic categories:&lt;ref&gt;Heslin, R. (1974, May) Steps toward a taxomony of touching. Paper presented to the annual meeting of the Midwestern Psychological Association, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Functional/professional : expresses task-orientation
; Social/polite:  expresses ritual interaction
; Friendship/warmth : expresses idiosyncratic relationship
; Love/intimacy : expresses emotional attachment
; Sexual/arousal : expresses sexual intent

The intent of a touch is not always exclusive and touching can evolve to each one of Heslin’s categories.

===Functional/professional===
Managers should know the effectiveness of using [[touch]] while communicating to subordinates, but need to be cautious and understand how touch can be misunderstood. A hand on the shoulder for one person may mean a supportive gesture, while it could mean a sexual advance to another person. Working with others and using touch to communicate, a manager needs to be aware of each person’s touch tolerance.

Henley’s (1977) research found that a person in [[Power (social and political)|power]] is more likely to touch a subordinate, but the subordinate is not free to touch in kind. Touch is a powerful nonverbal communication tool and this different standard between a superior and subordinate can lead to confusion whether the touch is motivated by dominance or intimacy according to Borisoff and Victor.&lt;ref&gt;Borisoff, D., &amp; Victor, D.A. (1989). Conflict management: A communication skills approach. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walton&lt;ref&gt;Walton, D. (1989), Are you communicating? You can’t manage without it, New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishing.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in his book that touching is the ultimate expression of closeness or confidence between two people, but not seen often in business or formal relationships. Touching stresses how special the message is that is being sent by the initiator. "If a word of praise is accompanied by a touch on the shoulder, that’s the gold star on the ribbon," wrote Walton.

===Social/polite===
Moving from one haptic category to another can become blurred by [[culture]]. There are many areas in the United States where a touch on the [[wiktionary:forearm#Noun|forearm]] is accepted as socially correct and polite. However, in the Midwest, this is not always an acceptable behavior.

The initial connection to another person in a professional setting usually starts off with a touch, specifically a [[handshake]]. A person's handshake can speak volumes about them and their personality. Chiarella (2006) wrote an article for [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine]] explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ from person to person and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the [[verbal communication]].

Jones explained communication with touch as the most intimate and involving form which helps people to keep good relationships with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03637758509376094 |title=A naturalistic study of the meanings of touch |journal=Communication Monographs |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=19–56 |year=2009 |last1=Jones |first1=Stanley E. |last2=Yarbrough |first2=A. Elaine }}&lt;/ref&gt; His study with Yarbrough covered touch sequences and individual touches.

Touch sequences fall into two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates. The majority of these touches are considered positive. [[Strategic]] touching is a series of touching usually with an ulterior or hidden motive thus making them seem to be using touch as a game to get someone to do something for them.

More common than the sequential touches are the individual or single touches. They must be read by using the total context of what was said, the nature of the relationship and what kind of social setting was involved when the person was touched.

Yarbrough designed a blueprint for how to touch. She designated the different body areas as to whether they are 'touchable' or not. Non-vulnerable body parts (NVBP) are the hand, arm, shoulder and upper back, and vulnerable body parts (VBP) are all other body regions.

[[Civil inattention]] is defined as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1963). Behavior in public places, New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be so crowded that they 'touch' another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect those around them.

===Friendship/warmth===
It is more acceptable for women to touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched. Whitcher and Fisher conducted a study to see whether [[therapeutic touch]] to reduce [[anxiety]] differed between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whitcher S. J., Fisher J. D. | year = 1979 | title = Multidimensional reaction to therapeutic touch in a hospital setting | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 87–96 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.1.87}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nurse was told to touch patients for one minute while the patients looked at a pamphlet during a routine preoperative procedure. Females reacted positively to the touch, whereas males did not. It was surmised that males equated the touch to being treated as inferior or dependent.

Touching among family members has been found to affect the behavior of those involved. Various factors are at work within a family setting. As a child grows older, the amount of touching by the parent decreases.

Boys distance themselves from their parents at an earlier age than girls. There is more touching with the same sex parent than with cross-sex parents.

A study of nonverbal communication on how men 'converse' in bars shows that women like men to touch, but it is their touching of other men that intrigues them. The men who are touching others are perceived as having a higher status and [[social power]] than those that aren't touching others.

The study found that women were more receptive to men who demanded the most social space, and that when a woman comes into a bar, men will move their drinks far apart to signal to her that they have space in their 'domain' for them.

===Love/intimacy===
{{main|Physical intimacy}}
;Healthy touch
The primary nonverbal behavior that has the biggest effect on [[interpersonal relationships]] is touch.

The amount of touching increases as a relationship moves from impersonal to personal.

Three areas of public touch between couples have been studied: the amount of touch between a couple in the initial stages of a romantic relationship, how much touching goes on between the couple and the extent of touching with the amount of touch men and women displayed and who initiated the touch and when they initiated it.

Public touch can serve as a ‘tie sign’ that shows others that your partner is “taken”.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1977), Manwatching : A field guide to human behavior. New York: Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt; When a couple is holding hands, putting their arms around each other, this is a ‘tie sign’ showing others that you are together. The use of ‘tie signs’ are used more often by couples in the dating and courtship stages than between their married counterparts according to Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burgoon, J. K.]], Buller, D. B., &amp; Woodall, W. G. (1996), Nonverbal communication: The unspoken dialogue (2nd ed.), New York: McGraw-Hill.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown a difference between the sexes on who touches when. In the initial stages of a relationship, men often follow socially prescribed [[gender role]]s. Patterson indicated that men fulfilling this social role would touch more and after initial touch in casual relationships and as the relationship became more intimate during serious dating or [[marriage]] relationships, women would touch more.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, M. L. (1988). Functions of nonverbal behavior in close relationships. In S. W. Duck (Ed.), Handbook of personal relationships. New York: Springer-Verlag.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American culture still dictates that men ‘make the first move’ in the context of a dating relationship.

Touching between married couples may help maintain good health. In a study by [[University of Virginia]] psychologist Jim Coan, women under stress showed signs of immediate relief by merely holding their husband’s hand. This seemed to be effective when the woman was part of a satisfying marriage.

;Violence
Touching in intimate relationships may also be violent at times.  McEwan and Johnson categorize violent touch in relationships into two categories: intimate terrorism and common couple violence.&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, B., and Johnson, S.L. Relational Violence: The Darkest Side of Haptic Communication. The Nonverbal Communication Reader. Ed. L.K. Guerrero and M.L. Hall. 3rd ed. Long Grove, IL: Waveland P, 2008. 232-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intimate terrorism is characterized by a need to control or dominate a relationship, escalation over time, high frequency and severity. Common couple violence, on the other hand, is often a result of minor conflict.  Common couple violence is less frequent and severe, and does not escalate over time.  There are two major differences between intimate terrorism and common couple violence.  Common couple violence comes in episodes rather than escalating over time. One study in 1999 by Geiser gave further evidence to this notion and reported that in fact males are significantly more likely to engage in nonverbal aggression and violence.  Persons seeking help with violent intimate relationships may contact the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] or [http://www.preventviolence.net The National Violence Prevention Network].

According to Givens (1999), the process of nonverbal communication or negotiation is to send and receive messages in an attempt to gain someone’s approval or love. [[Courtship]], which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication gestures to tell each other to come nearer and nearer until we touch. Essential signals in the path to intimacy include facial nuzzles, kissing and caressing each other.

Courtship has five phases which include the attention phase, recognition phase, conversation phase, touching phase, and the love-making phase. Haptics takes place more during the last two phases.

The touching phase:&lt;br /&gt;
''First touch'': Is likely to be more “accidental” than premeditated by touching a neutral body part and where the recipient either accepts the touch or rejects it through body movement.

''Hugging'': The embrace is the most basic way of telling someone that you love them and possibly need them too.

''Intention to touch'': A nonverbal communication haptic code or cue is the intention behind it. Reaching your hand across the table to a somewhat unknown person is used as a way to show readiness to touch.

''Kissing'': Moving in concert by turning heads to allow for the lips to touch is the final part of the fourth stage of courtship, the kiss.

The final phase, love-making, which includes [[Touch|tactile]] stimulation during foreplay known as the light or protopathic touch. Any feelings of fear or apprehension may be calmed through other touching like kissing, nuzzling, and a gentle massage.

==Meanings==
Touch research conducted by Jones and Yarbrough (1985) revealed 18 different meanings of touch, grouped in seven types: Positive affect (emotion), playfulness, control, ritual, hybrid (mixed), task-related, and accidental touch.

===Positive affect===
These touches communicate positive emotions and occur mostly between persons who have close relationships. These touches can be further classified as support, [[Gratitude|appreciation]], [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]], [[sexual interest]] or intent, and [[affection]]. Research has shown that hugging can reduce levels of the stress hormone [[cortisol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/d3gzba/the-life-of-the-skin-hungry-can-you-go-crazy-from-a-lack-of-touch The Life of the Skin-Hungry: Can You Go Crazy from a Lack Of Touch?] ''VICE''. Published 8 November 2016. Retrieved 14 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Support'': Serve to nurture, reassure, or promise protection. These touches generally occur in situations which either virtually require or make it clearly preferable that one person show concern for another who is experiencing distress.

''Appreciation'': Express gratitude for something another person has done.

''Inclusion'': Draw attention to the act of being together and suggest psychological closeness.

''Sexual'': Express physical attraction or sexual interest.

''Affection'': Express generalized positive regard beyond mere acknowledgment of the other.

===Playful===
These touches serve to lighten an interaction. These touches communicate a double message since they always involve a play signal, either verbal or nonverbal, which indicates the behavior is not to be taken seriously. These touches can be further classified as [[affection]]ate and [[aggressive]].

''Playful affection'': Serve to lighten interaction. The seriousness of the positive message is diminished by the play signal. These touches indicate teasing and are usually mutual.

''Playful aggression'': Like playful affection these touches are used to serve to lighten interaction, however, the play signal indicates aggression. These touches are initiated, rather than mutual.

===Control===
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110926-F-RN211-071.jpg|thumb|An Afghan police officer pats a child on the head.]]
These touches serve to direct the behavior, attitude, or feeling state of the recipient. The key feature of these touches is that almost all of the touches are initiated by the person who attempts influence. These touches can be further classified as [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]], attention-getting, and announcing a response.

''Compliance'': Attempts to direct behavior of another person, and often, by implication, to influence attitudes or feelings.

''Attention-getting'': Serve to direct the touch recipient’s perceptual focus toward something.

''Announcing a response'': Call attention to and emphasize a feeling state of initiator; implicitly requests affect response from another.

===Ritualistic===
These touches consist of [[greeting]] and [[:wikt:departure|departure]] touches. They serve no other function than to help make transitions in and out of focused interaction.

''Greeting'': Serve as part of the act of acknowledging another at the opening of an encounter.

''Departure'': Serve as a part of the act of closing an encounter

===Hybrid===
These touches involve two or more of the meanings described above. These touches can be further classified as greeting/affection and departure/affection.

''Greeting/affection'': Express affection and acknowledgement of the initiation of an encounter

''Departure/affection'': Express affection and serve to close an encounter

===Task-related===
These touches are directly associated with the performance of a task. These touches can be further classified as:
* ''Reference to [[Human physical appearance|appearance]]'': Point out or inspect a body part or artefact referred to in a verbal comment about appearance
* ''Instrumental ancillary'': Occur as an unnecessary part of the accomplishment of a task
* ''Instrumental [[intrinsic]]'': Accomplish a task in and out of itself i.e., a helping touch.

===Accidental===
These touches are perceived as unintentional and have no meaning. They consist mainly of brushes.
Research by Martin in a retailing context found that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively, resulting in the Accidental Interpersonal Touch effect &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/662038 |title=A Stranger's Touch: Effects of Accidental Interpersonal Touch on Consumer Evaluations and Shopping Time |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=174–84 |year=2012 |last1=Martin |first1=Brett A. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The amount of touching that occurs within a culture is largely based on the relative [[High context culture|high context]] or [[Low context culture|low context]] of the culture.

=== High contact ===
In a high contact culture, many things are not verbally stated but are express through physical touch. For instance, [[Cheek kissing]] is very common method of greeting in the [[Latin America]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, but among  European individuals it is an uncommon form of greeting. Different cultures have different [[display rules]], the degree with which emotions are expressed. Cultural  display rules also affect the degree to which individuals share their personal space, gaze and physical contact during interactions.  In a  High contact culture, such as South America, Latin America, Southern Europe, Africa, Russia, Middle East and others, people tend to share more physical contact. High contact  cultures communicate through long gazes, long hugs, and share a decrease in [[proxemics]].&lt;ref name="McCornack2017"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Choices and Connections, An Introduction to Communication |last=McCornack |first=Steven |publisher=Bedford |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-319-04352-0 |pages=141–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Low contact ===
Low contact cultures such as: The United States, Canada, Northern Europe, Australia &amp; New Zealand and Asia  prefers infrequent touching, larger physical distance, indirect body orientations (during interaction) along with little share gazes.&lt;ref name="McCornack2017" /&gt; In the [[Culture of Thailand#Customs|Thai culture]], kissing a friend on the cheek is less common than in the Latin Americas. Remland and Jones (1995) studied groups of people communicating and found that in England (8%), France (5%) and the Netherlands (4%), touching was rare compared to the Italian (14%) and Greek (12.5%) sample.&lt;ref&gt;Remland, M, Jones, T, &amp; Brinkman, H 1995, 'Interpersonal Distance, Body Orientation, and Touch: Effects of Culture, Gender, and Age', Journal of Social Psychology, 135, 3, pp. 281-297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal differences===
Frequency of touch also varies significantly between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, one of which examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone was touching more frequently than normal it would be necessary to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a kiss on the cheek is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).

==Emotion and touch==
Recently, researchers have shown that touch communicates distinct emotions such as anger, fear, happiness, sympathy, love, and gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hertenstein M. J., Keltner D., App B. Bulleit, Jaskolka A. | year = 2006 | title = Touch communicates distinct emotions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 528–533 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the accuracy with which subjects were capable of communicating the emotions were commensurate with facial and vocal displays of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hertenstein M. J., Verkamp J., Kerestes A., Holmes R. | year = 2006 | title = The communicative functions of touch in humans, non-human primates and rats: A review and synthesis of the empirical research | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = | pages = 5–94 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.1.5-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] has been linked to touch deprivation in adults and research has established associations between touch deprivation and eating disorders. Men have been found more likely to suffer from touch deprivation than women due to stronger social prohibitions against same-sex touching among adult males.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-touch-deprivation-674477 What is touch deprivation?] ''enotes''.

==Etymology and meaning==
Īśvarapraṇidhāna is a Sanskrit compound word composed of two words ''īśvara'' (ईश्वर) and ''praṇidhāna'' (प्रणिधान).  ''Īśvara'' (sometimes spelled Īshvara) literally means "owner of best, beautiful", "ruler of choices, blessings, boons", or "chief of suitor, lover". Later religious literature in Sanskrit broadens the reference of this term to refer to God, the Absolute [[Brahman]], True Self, or Unchanging Reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktDevaUnicode&amp;key=Izvara Izvara] ईश्वर, Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; ''Praṇidhāna'' is used to mean a range of senses including, "laying on, fixing, applying, attention (paid to), meditation, desire, prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monier-Williams|first1=Monier|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktDevaUnicode&amp;key=praNidhAna|website=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a religious translation of Patanjali's Eight-Limbed Yoga, the word ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' means committing what one does to a Lord, who is elsewhere in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] defined as a special person (puruṣa) who is the first teacher (paramaguru) and is free of all hindrances and karma. In more secular terms, it means acceptance, teachability, relaxing expectations, adventurousness.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patanjali|title=Patanjalayogaśāstra|url=http://sarit.indology.info/exist/apps/sarit/works/p%C4%81ta%C3%B1jalayoga%C5%9B%C4%81stra.s%C5%AB.1.24.html?action=search#1.3.4.2.26.2.4|ref=PYS1.24|location=YS 1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
===Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali===
''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is mentioned in the [[Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]] as follows:&lt;ref name=pys/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|'''शौच संतोष तपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः''' ॥23॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.23&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This transliterates as, "[[Shaucha|Śauca]], [[Santosha|Santoṣa]], [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]], [[Svādhyāya]] and Īśvarapraṇidhāna are the Niyamas". This is the second limb in Patañjali's eight limb [[Raja yoga|Yoga]] philosophy is called ''niyamas'' which include virtuous habits, behaviors and ethical observances (the "dos").&lt;ref&gt;N Tummers (2009), Teaching Yoga for Life, {{ISBN|978-0736070164}}, page 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y Sawai (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270048 The Nature of Faith in the Śaṅkaran Vedānta Tradition], Numen, Vol. 34, Fasc. 1 (Jun., 1987), pages 18-44&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali use the term ''Īśvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Patañjali defines ''Īśvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n33/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|क्लेश कर्म विपाकाशयैःपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष '''ईश्वरः''' ॥२४॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy adds the characteristics of ''Īśvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Īśvarapraṇidhāna is listed as the fifth [[niyama]] by Patañjali. In other forms of yoga, it is the tenth niyama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/776 The Practice of Surrender] Yoga Journal (August 28 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, the [[Niyamas]] are the "do list" and the [[Yamas]] are the "don't do" list, both part of an ethical theory for life.

===Īśvara as a metaphysical concept===
Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Īśvara''. These commentaries range from defining Īśhvara from a "personal god" to "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Whicher explains that while Patañjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patañjali's concept of Īśvara in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Desmarais states that Īśvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=mmd&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patañjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is investing, occupying the mind with this metaphysical concept. Yogasutra does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (''[[Bhakti]]''), nor does it give Īśvara characteristics typically associated with a deity. In yoga sutras it is a logical construct, states Desmarais.&lt;ref name=mmd/&gt; 

In verses I.27 and I.28, yogasutras associate Īśvara with the concept ''Pranava'' (प्रणव, ॐ) and recommends that it be repeated and contemplated in one of the limbs of eight step yoga.&lt;ref name=mmd132&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patañjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 132-136&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as a means to begin the process of dissociating from external world, connecting with one's inner world, focusing and getting one-minded in [[Raja yoga|Yoga]].&lt;ref name=mmd132/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Yogasutra I.28 and I.29; {{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=33|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n41/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whicher states that Patañjali's concept of Īśvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism. Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, prefer to explain the term ''Īśvara'' as the "Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings".&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt; However, in the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, and extensive literature of Yoga school of Hinduism, Īśvara is not a Supreme Ruler, Īśvara is not an [[ontology|ontological]] concept, rather it has been an abstract concept to meet the [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] needs for human beings accepting Yoga philosophy as a way of life.&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]] (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Īśvara as a deity===
''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' has been interpreted to mean the contemplation of a deity in some sub-schools of Hinduism. Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools, and its texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, {{ISBN|978-0415462327}}, pages 242-243, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] movement considers Krishna as the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710492}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]] movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Rk Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, {{ISBN|978-8171417803}}, pages 5-6, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] of Ramanuja and [[Dvaita|Dvaita Vedanta]] of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the ''Prakriti'' (material world) and ''Purusa'' (soul, spirit). In all these sub-schools, ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is the contemplation of the respective deity.

Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in Īśvara concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of "personal God" where the "ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed".&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 37-39, 401-403, 498-503&lt;/ref&gt; ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'', or contemplation of Īśvara as a deity is useful, suggests Zaehner, because it helps the individual become more like Īśhvara. Riepe, and others,&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; state that the literature of Yoga school of Hinduism neither explicitly defines nor implicitly implies, any creator-god; rather, it leaves the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Īśvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of "deity of one's choice" or "formless [[Brahman]] (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)".&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, {{ISBN|978-0836206111}}, pages 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1966), Hinduism, Oxford University Press, 1980 edition: pages 126-129, Reprinted in 1983 as {{ISBN|978-0198880127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need and purpose of Īśvara, whatever be the abstraction of it as "special kind of Self" or "personal deity", is not an end in itself, rather it is a means to "perfect the practice of concentration" in one's journey through the eight limbs of Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Woods (1914, Reprinted in 2003), [https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/48/mode/2up Yoga system of Patanjali], Harvard University Press, pages 48-59, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73/&gt;

===Īśvara as pure consciousness===
Larson suggests Īśvara in ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' can be understood through its chronological roots. [[Raja yoga|Yoga]] school of Hinduism developed on the foundation of [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism. In the non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school, ''Purusa'' is a central metaphysical concept, and envisioned as "pure consciousness". Further, ''Purusa'' is described by Samkhya school to exist in a "plurality of pure consciousness" in its epistemological theory (rather than to meet the needs of its ontological theory).&lt;ref name=ianw80&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Iyer (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali defines ''Īśhvara'' as a "special Purusa" in verse I.24, with certain characteristics. Īśhvara, then may be understood as one among the plurality of "pure consciousness", with characteristics as defined by Patanjali in verse I.24.&lt;ref name=ianw80/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 32-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Īśvara as spiritual but not religious===
Van Ness, and others,&lt;ref&gt;B Pradhan (2014), Yoga: Original Concepts and History. In Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Springer Switzerland, {{ISBN|978-3-319-09104-4}}, pages 3-36&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the concepts of Īśvara, Īśvara-pranidhana and other limbs of Yoga may be pragmatically understood as "spiritual but not religious".&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Van Ness (1999), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27944075 Yoga as Spiritual but not Religious: A pragmatic perspective], American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 1999), pages 15-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff (2011), Yoga - Philosophy for Everyone: Bending Mind and Body, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0470658802}}, Foreword by John Friend and Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean''' (or '''Joanny''') '''Bricaud''' (February 11, 1881, [[Neuville-sur-Ain]], [[Ain]] – February 24, 1934), also known as '''Tau Jean II''', was a [[France|French]] student of the [[occult]] and [[esoteric]] matters. Bricaud was heavily involved in the French [[Gnosticism in modern times|neo-Gnostic]] movement. He was consecrated a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] bishop on July 21, 1913 by bishop Louis-Marie-François Giraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parareligion.ch/hoeller.htm Ecclesia Gnostica Position Paper Concerning the Thelemite or Crowleyan Gnostic Churches] by [[Stephan A. Hoeller]] (written in the early 1980s)&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Patriarch]] of the ''[[Église Gnostique Universelle]]'' ([[French language|French]] for "Universal Gnostic Church") and a central figure in the various lines of the [[apostolic succession]] of subsequent Gnostic churches, as well as a spiritual heir of [[Jules Doinel]] (Valentinus II). From 1916 he was head of the [[Martinism|''Ordre Martiniste'']]. He was a friend of the [[occultist]]s [[Papus]] and [[August Vandekerkhove]].

'''John Gough''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ɒ|f}}; 17 January 1757 – 28 July 1825) was a blind English natural and experimental philosopher who is known for his own investigations as well as the influence he had on both [[John Dalton]] and [[William Whewell]].

==Life==
John Gough was born in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]], on 17 January 1757, the eldest child of Nathan Gough (d. 1800) and his wife, Susannah (1731–1798). Gough's father was a wool dyer and shearman dyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gough | first = Thomas | contribution = John Gough | editor-last = Nicholson | editor-first = Cornelius | title = The Annals of Kendal | volume = | pages = 355&amp;ndash;368 | edition = 2 | publisher = Whitaker and Company | place = London | year = 1861 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G78HAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=annals+of+kendal#PPR1,M2 }}. - See preface for authorship of the article.&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother was the eldest daughter of John Wilson, a prosperous farmer with an estate on the west bank of [[Windermere]]. Nathan and Susannah Gough had three sons and four daughters, one of whom died in infancy. The family belonged to the [[Society of Friends]], whose communities flourished in [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] during this period. Before he was three years old, Gough was attacked by [[smallpox]] and lost his sight. In his childhood he expended much effort in developing his sense of touch and hearing, and appears to have been especially eager to learn to recognize animals by touch.

In 1778 at the age of twenty-one, Gough became a resident pupil of John Slee, a mathematical master at [[Mungrisedale]], [[Cumberland]]. Gough stayed at Mungrisedale for eighteen months, following the traditional curriculum up to the elementary principles of calculus. Returning home he took up calculus, with his second sister, Dorothy Gough (b. 1768), acting as his reader. From around 1782 to 1790 he enjoyed the acquaintance of [[John Dalton]], a cousin of George Bewley and also a lakeland [[Quaker]], who had come to Kendal to take up a position in Bewley's school.  Dalton assisted Gough by reading, writing, and making calculations and diagrams on his behalf. In return Dalton, who later became one of the most eminent figures in nineteenth-century science, was tutored by Gough in Latin and Greek.  Dalton later referred to Gough as a "prodigy in scientific attainments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Dalton, John | title = Meteorological Observations and Essays | year = 1834| edition = 2 | publisher = Harrison and Crosfield | location = Manchester | pages = xvi | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ot8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Meteorological+observations+and+essays#PPP16,M2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800 at the parish church of Kendal, Gough married Mary (d. 1858), daughter of Thomas Harrison of Crosthwaite, Cumberland. On their marriage they moved to [[Middleshaw, Cumbria|Middleshaw]] in the hamlet of [[Old Hutton]].  John and Mary Gough had nine children, one of whom, Thomas Gough (1804{{spaced ndash}}1880) became a surgeon in Kendal.

In 1812 Gough had a house, which he named Fowl Ing, built for himself and his family on the south-west slope of Benson Knot, a hill 2 miles north-east of Kendal. At about the same time he began to act as a private tutor of mathematics to a select group of pupils from northern England, whom he prepared for university. The subsequent fame of his students superseded his own celebrity. A number of them went on to achieve high distinction in the mathematical [[tripos]], and subsequently in the hierarchies of university and church. One of Gough's first students was [[William Whewell]], who was with him in 1812 and later described Gough as "a very extraordinary person."&lt;ref&gt;See page 6 of {{Citation | author = Douglas, Stair | title = The Life and Selections from the Correspondence of William Whewell, D.D. Late Master of Trinity College Cambridge | year = 1881 | publisher = C. Kegan Paul and Company | location = London | url = https://books.google.com/?id=q0YOAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+life+of+William+Whewell#PPA6,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1823, John Gough suffered repeated attacks of epilepsy.  He died on 28 July 1825, leaving his wife and seven of their children. He was buried in the parish churchyard of Kendal.

==Career==
[[Image:Gough1.GIF|thumb|right|200px|Gough's paper on [[rubber]]]]

Gough had wide-ranging scientific interests. He published papers in natural history, mechanics, mathematics, chemistry, and experimental physics.  One of his most interesting pieces of work was an investigation into the properties of [[natural rubber]] or [[Caoutchouc]]. He was the first to describe the heat released when a rubber band is quickly stretched, the heat being detected by the lips to which the band is pressed. When stretched rubber is heated, it contracts, a reversal of the normal behaviour of materials when heated. Gough published these results, and others, in a letter to the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]] in 1804.  King has written&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = King | title = Note in Memory of Blind John Gough | journal = American Journal of Physics | year = 1953 | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 231&amp;ndash;232 | doi = 10.1119/1.1933400 | postscript = . | bibcode = 1953AmJPh..21..231K }}&lt;/ref&gt; that through Dalton, Gough exerted an indirect influence years later on [[James Joule]], who undertook his own investigations into rubber, elasticity, and energy changes, and specifically referred to Gough's earlier studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Joule, James Prescott | title = The Scientific Papers of James Joule | year = 1884 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | location = London | pages = 428&amp;ndash;440 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UR5WAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=joule%27s+scientific+papers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect eventually became known as the [[Gough–Joule effect]].

Gough's most substantive enquiry was "An investigation of the method whereby men judge by the ear of the position of sonorous bodies relative to their own persons", which appeared in 1802  during an ongoing controversy with another former Quaker, the noted natural philosopher [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], over the nature of [[compound sounds]].

'''Ján Kollár''' (29 July 1793 in [[Mošovce]] (Mosóc), [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], now [[Slovakia]] &amp;ndash; 24 January 1852 in [[Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire]]) was a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] writer (mainly poet), archaeologist, scientist, politician, and main ideologist of [[Pan-Slavism]].

== Life ==
He studied at the Lutheran Lyceum in [[Pressburg]] (Pozsony, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], now [[Bratislava]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petro|first=Peter|title=A History of Slovak Literature|publisher=Mcgill Queens's University Press|year=1995|page=66|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovakia]]). In 1817 he enrolled in the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auty|first=Robert|date=1952-01-01|title=Jan Kollár, 1793-1852|jstor=4204405|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=31|issue=76|pages=74–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attendance at the [[Wartburgfest]] (18 October 1817) has since been credited as being a formative experience with regards to his views on [[Pan-Slavism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auty|first=Robert|date=1952-01-01|title=Jan Kollár, 1793-1852|jstor=4204405|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=31|issue=76|pages=74–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auty|first=Robert|date=1952-01-01|title=Jan Kollár, 1793-1852|jstor=4204405|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=31|issue=76|pages=74–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of his adult life as a chaplain to the populous but poor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yrxrO0lC0YC|title=The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History|last=Sayer|first=Derek|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069105052X|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovaks|Slovak]] [[Lutheran]] community in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AY_MVaCeXXoC|title=History of Slovak Literature|last=Petro|first=Peter|date=1997-05-13|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773514027|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Kingdom of Hungary]], today part of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]). From 1849, he was a professor of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[archeology]] at the [[University of Vienna]], and several times he also acted as a counselor to the Austrian government for issues around the [[Slovaks]]. He entered the [[Slovak Uprising 1848–49|Slovak national movement]] in its first phase.

His [[museum]] (since 1974) in Mošovce was installed in the former [[granary]], which was the only masoned part of Kollár's otherwise wooden birth-house. The rest of the house burned down in a fire on 16 August 1863. In 2009 was built a replica of the original Kollár's birth-house, which is now a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=muzeum&amp;ix=mjk|title=Múzeum Jána Kollára Mošovce /* Jan Kollar Museum Mosovce /Muzeum.SK - múzeum, galéria, hrad, zámok/|last=http://www.decus.sk/|first=All: Decus s.r.o., URI:|website=www.muzeum.sk|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
He worked out a conception of Slav reciprocity. He admitted 4 standard languages: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czechoslovak language|Czechoslovak]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]].

==Works==
Besides writing poetry he also wrote technical literature.

* Slávy Dcera (1824; The daughter of Sláva), collection of two (37 and 39 [[sonnet]]s) cycles

In this work he worked out the conception of Slavic reciprocity. He expressed his feelings to a woman but this love had transformed to a love to his homeland. The main thematics of this work are:
•love 
•patriotism

It is divided into 5 chapters and it has a foreword.

Předzpěv (Prelude)&lt;br/&gt;
The author expressed his fears that the Slovaks will disappear from the face of Europe like other Slavic tribes before. He asked the Slovaks to ask for help from the Russian nation.

1. Sála   &lt;br/&gt;
This part contains love sonnets. Kollár glorifies his love Mína, depicting her as an ideal of a Slavic maid, the daughter of goddess Sláva.

2. Labe, Rén, Vltava&lt;br/&gt;
In these parts, the author takes us to places where Slavic tribes lived before. He is disappointed because these areas belong to foreign countries now.

3. Dunaj&lt;br/&gt;
The author arrives to Slovakia, disillusioned by the poverty of this area. He is highly disappointed and longs for death.

4. Léthé

5. Acheron&lt;br/&gt;
Mína becomes a fairy and takes the author to Slavic heaven and hell.

'''Lewis Mumford''' (October 19, 1895&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1990) was an American historian, [[Sociology|sociologist]], philosopher of technology, and [[Literary criticism|literary critic]]. Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir [[Patrick Geddes]] and worked closely with his associate the British sociologist [[Victor Branford]].

Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Clarence Stein]], [[Frederic Osborn]], [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund N. Bacon]], and [[Vannevar Bush]].

== Life ==

Mumford was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], New York and graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/instadv/quest/cityascommunity.html |title=City As Community: The Life And Vision Of Lewis Mumford |first=Robert |last=Wojtowicz |journal=Quest |publisher=[[Old Dominion University]] |date=Jan 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[City College of New York]] and [[The New School|The New School for Social Research]], but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/mumfordl|title=Mumford, Lewis|last=Sorensen|first=Lee (ed)|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of ''[[The Dial]]'', an influential [[modernist]] literary journal. He later worked for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.

Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. ''The Golden Day'' contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s American [[transcendentalist]] authors and ''Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision'' effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of [[Herman Melville]]. Soon after, with the book ''The Brown Decades'', he began to establish himself as an authority in American architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.

In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and [[mass communication]] to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], [[Louis Sullivan]] and Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1963, Mumford received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=Oct 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/chronology_lm.htm|title=Chronology of Mumford's Life|publisher=Lewis Mumford Center|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary [[British honours system|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1976, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1986, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;

He served as the architectural critic for ''The New Yorker'' magazine for over 30 years. His 1961 book, ''[[The City in History]]'', received the [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1962/&gt;

Lewis Mumford died at the age of 94 at [[Lewis Mumford House|his home]] in [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia, New York]] on January 26, 1990.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; Nine years later it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. His wife Sophia died in 1997, at age 97.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 2 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas ==

In his book ''The Condition of Man'', published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as "organic humanism".  The term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature's threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford's respect for human "nature", that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and technics in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.

Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex.  He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information "pooling" in the world as humanity moved into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumford | first = Lewis| title = Enough Energy for Life &amp; The Next Transformation of Man [MIT lecture transcript] | journal = CoEvolution Quarterly| volume = 1| issue = 4| pages = 19–23| publisher = POINT Foundation | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's choice of the word "technics" throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[:wikt:τέχνη#Ancient Greek|tekhne]]'', which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the "wishes, habits, ideas, goals" as well as "industrial processes" of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'', "other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics."

===Megatechnics===
In ''[[The Myth of the Machine]] Vol II: The Pentagon of Power'' (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford [[Critique of technology|criticizes the modern trend of technology]], which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics", fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[installment plan|installment buying]], non-functioning and defective designs, [[planned obsolescence]], and frequent [[planned obsolescence (business)|superficial "fashion" changes]]. "Without constant enticement by advertising," he writes, "production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year."

He uses his own [[refrigerator]] as an example, reporting that it "has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use."

===Biotechnics===
[[File:Mumford3.jpg|thumb|Pentagon of Power picture and a quote from it.]]
Mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability.  The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity.  Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically.  Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'', and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., ''Bladerunner''). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pentagon of Power'' p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of "megatechnics." While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.

In Mumford's understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.

Thus Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve "livability." Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls "plenitude"; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue "for its own sake."

Alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward "qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair." The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.

Mumford's critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford's work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: "livability," a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, [[Patrick Geddes]].

Mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of ''The Pentagon of Power'', written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of "organic humanism," in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics.  It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.

It is true that Mumford's writing privileges the term "biotechnics" more than the "biotechnic society." The reason is clear in the last sentence of ''The Pentagon of Power'' where he writes, "for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out." Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them "coffins"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., he published a critical review of [[Process and Reality]]: "Metaphysics and Art. Review of Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, by Alfred North Whitehead; Essays in Philosophy, edited by Thomas Vernor Smith and William Kelley Wright; The Philosophic Way of Life, by T.V. Smith." ''The New Republic'', December 18, 1929: 117–118, reprinted in Alan Van Wyk and [[Michel Weber]] (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279954/Creativity_and_Its_Discontents._The_Response_to_Whiteheads_Process_and_Reality Creativity and Its Discontents. The Response to Whitehead's Process and Reality]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2009, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnics versus monotechnics===
A key idea, introduced in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934) was that technology was twofold:
* ''Polytechnic'', which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
* ''Monotechnic'', which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.

Mumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being "monotechnic" in their reliance on cars. [[Automobile]]s become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as [[walking]], bicycle and [[public transit]], because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a "ritual sacrifice" the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.

===Three epochs of civilization===
Also discussed at length in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):
:* ''Eotechnic'' (the [[middle ages]])
:* ''Paleotechnic'' (the time of the [[industrial revolution]]) and
:* ''Neotechnic'' (later, present-day)

===Megamachines===
Mumford also refers to large [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizations as ''megamachines''—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's [[stage theory]] of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] [[nuclear powers]]—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the [[Kremlin]] and [[the Pentagon]], respectively. The builders of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the armies of the [[World War]]s are prior examples.

He explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged [[pharaoh]]s and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from [[ancient Egypt]] to [[Nazi Germany]].

Necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous [[bureaucracy]] of humans which act as "servo-units", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the [[assembly line]], or instant, global, [[wireless]], communication and [[remote control]], can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of [[Adolf Eichmann]], the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of [[the Holocaust]]. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as "Eichmanns".

===The clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution===

One of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] was developed by monks in the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole [[Industrial Revolution]], contrary to the common view of the [[steam engine]] holding the prime position, writing: "The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ...."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. ''Technics and Civilization''. London: Routledge, 1934. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban civilization===
''[[The City in History]]'' won the 1962 U.S. [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1962&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 "National Book Awards – 1962"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of [[urban sprawl]], Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While [[pessimist]]ic in tone, Mumford argues that [[urban planning]] should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.

Mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the "ideal city," and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.

Mumford wrote critically of [[urban culture]] believing the city is "a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, ''The Culture of Cities,'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared "metropolitan finance," urbanisation, politics, and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Mumford wrote: "The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community."&lt;ref&gt;City Reader
 edited by Richard T. LeGates, Frederic Stout, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburbs====
Suburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis.  ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects'' (New York, 1961), p.464; quoted in {{cite crabgrass}}, pp.155–156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion and Spirituality ===
Mumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manouchehrifar|first=Babak|date=2018-11-08|title=Is Planning 'Secular'?

&lt;blockquote&gt;The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/246342365|title=Faith for living|last=1895-1990.|first=Mumford, Lewis,|date=1940|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|oclc=246342365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence ==

Mumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  "polytechnics", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Richard. ''The Value of Voluntary Simplicity''. Pendle Hill, 1936, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amory Lovins]], [[J. Baldwin]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Colin Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Influences: Voices of Creative Dissent''. Green Books, 1991, pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.

Mumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like [[Barry Commoner]] and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Derek. ''Green History'', Routledge, 1994, pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramachandra Guha]] noted his work contains "some of the earliest and finest thinking on [[bioregionalism]], anti-nuclearism, [[biodiversity]], alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guha, Ramachandra &amp; Martinez-Alier, J. (1997) ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South''. London: Earthscan (1997). For other works on Mumford's ecological and environmental thought, see: David Pepper ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996; Max Nicolson, ''The New Environmental Age'', Cambridge University Press, 1989; and BA Minteer, ''The Landscape of Reform: Civic Pragmatism and Environmental Thought in America'' MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including [[Berenice Abbott]]'s photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Peter. "Becoming Documentary: Berenice Abbott's Photographs, 1925–1939," PhD dissertation, Boston University, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford was an inspiration for [[Ellsworth Toohey]], the antagonist in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Walter (1998). "[http://reason.com/archives/1998/02/01/the-writerly-rand The Writerly Rand]", Reason.com, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">A '''limit situation''' ({{lang-de|Grenzsituation}}) is any of certain situations in which a human being is said to have differing experiences from those arising from ordinary situations.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Bowden (1993), p334&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was developed by [[Karl Jaspers]], who considered fright, guilt, finality and suffering as some of the key limit situations arising in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;T, Fuchs ed, ''Karl Jasper's Philosophy and Psychopathology'' (2013) p.. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encounters==
Encounters with limit situations unsettle us, break us out of our inauthentic identifications, remove us from the social bond, and force us to come alive and find new ways of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hart, ''Who One Is'' (2009) p. 11-3 and p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;  They can be compared to the similarly generative experience of the sense of bewilderment in [[Zen]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Wolfe, ''Laden Choirs'' (2015) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] considered the limit situation to provide a revelatory encounter with the [[Other (philosophy)|other]];&lt;ref&gt;M. Portocarrera et al eds., ''Hermeneutic Rationality'' (2012) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; while facing the anxiety arising from the foreknowledge of death can equally prove a growth opportunity arising from a limit situation.&lt;ref&gt;I. Tammmelo, ''Justice and Doubt'' (2013) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic frame==
[[Psychoanalysis]] can be seen as a structured limit situation,&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (CUP 2007) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; the psychoanalytic framework in particular providing an experience of finality and limits that can empower growth.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith, ''Hidden Conversations'' (1991) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third world politics==
[[Paulo Freire]] adapted the existential notion of limit situation to the [[Third World]], seeing the constraints of underdevelopment as a limit situation on humanity,&lt;ref&gt;R. Rivera, ''A Study of Liberation Discourse'' (2004) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a possible frontier point for increasing (in overcoming) one's human stature.&lt;ref&gt;J. Irwin, ''Paulo Freire's Philosophy of Education'' (2012) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Linguistic film theory was proposed by [[Stanley Cavell]]&lt;ref name=Dualist/&gt; and it is based on the philosophical tradition begun by [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The theory itself is said to mirror aspects of the activity of Wittgenstein's own philosophising (e.g. Wittgenstein's thought experiments) as films are viewed capable of engaging the audience in a therapeutic process of 'dialogue' and even investigate the [[Absurdity|absurd]] and the limits of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film as Philosophy: Essays in Cinema after Wittgenstein and Cavell|last=Read|first=Rupert|last2=Goodenough|first2=Jerry|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=9781403997951|location=New York|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell's framework is seen as a distinctive way of approaching film and [[philosophy]] since question of style - the finding of words adequate to our aesthetic experience - is central to the understanding of the meaning of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|date=2017|title=Stanley Cavell on the Magic of the Movies|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/film.2017.0034|journal=Film-Philosophy|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=114–132|doi=10.3366/film.2017.0034|issn=1466-4615|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ideas involved the position that "if one thinks of a grammar as a machine for generating sentences, then perhaps one will wish to speak of the camera and its film as a machine for generating idioms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film|last=Cavell|first=Stanley|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=067496196X|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Alan Walker''', Ph.D. is a full Professor of Philosophy at [[New Mexico State University]], where he occupies the Richard L. Hedden Endowed Chair in Advanced Philosophical Studies. Prior to his professorship at NMSU Prof. Walker taught at [[McMaster University]] in the department of philosophy and the [[McMaster Arts and Science|Arts &amp; Science Programme]]. He is the author of ''Happy-People Pills for All'' (Oxford: Blackwell Press, 2013). Walker founded and was president of the former nonprofit organization [http://www.wiserearth.org/organization/view/d0e7a7f9ad2520117b5c83db30f1b625 Permanent End International] (2003–2007), which had been devoted to ending [[hunger]], [[illiteracy]] and [[environmental degradation]] through the dissemination of modular aquaponics systems for farming. He serves on the editorial board of the [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] and on the board of directors of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Diane Relke, ''Drones, Clines and Alpha Babes: Retrofitting Star Trek's Humanism, Post 9/11'' (University of Calgary Press, 2006), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former board member of the non-profit organization [[Humanity+|Humanity Plus]] (formerly World Transhumanist Association).

Professor Walker is a [[consequentialist]] who argues that humans have a responsibility to perfect themselves in the realm of morality and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]], ''[[Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future]].'' (Westview Press, 2004), pp. 256-7.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written extensively about the ethics of using technology to enhance human capabilities (including advocacy of superlongevity and [[biohappiness]]);&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tandy, ''Death and Anti-Death, Volume 3: Fifty Years after Einstein, One Hundred Fifty Years after Kierkegaard.'' (Palo Alto: Ria University Press, 2005), pp. 347-374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Agar]], ''Liberal Eugenics: In Defense of Human Enhancement'' (Oxford: Blackwell Press, 2004), p. 16, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; about the possibility of [[Moral bioenhancement | enhancing virtue]] genetically, through both genetic modification and the cultivation of humans with larger brains and a better understanding of moral reasoning;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben]], ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age.'' (New York: Times, Books, 2004), p. 255-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and about the moral obligations that humans may have toward [[artificially intelligent beings]] in the future. He also co-authored an influential piece about the nexus between [[transhumanism]] and religion, with [[Heidi A Campbell|Heidi Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]], "Perfect Humans or Trans-humans?" in [[Celia Deane-Drummond]] and Peter Scott, eds., ''Future Perfect?''

==Life==
He was born on 11 November 1564&lt;ref name="PWN"&gt;{{cite web |title=Śmiglecki Marcin, Encyklopedia PWN |url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Smiglecki-Marcin;3984159.html |publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] |website=encyklopedia.pwn.pl|accessdate=23 August 2018 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lwów]] (Leopolis) in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]). He used the surname Lwowczyk, or Leopolitanus, and later adopted the name Smiglecius (after the town of [[Śmigiel|Smigle]], from which his family originated). He attended the Jesuit school in [[Pułtusk]] and until 1586 studied in [[Rome]], where he joined the Jesuit order in 1581. His education was financed by the prominent Polish statesman [[Jan Zamojski]]. He obtained a master's degree in philosophy and a doctor's degree in theology at the [[Vilnius_University#Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Academy of Vilnius]], and taught philosophy and theology there.&lt;ref name=Roncalia/&gt; 

In 1599 he took part in a public disputation with the Protestants [[Marcin Janicki]] and [[Daniel Mikołajewski]]. It was recorded by Martin Gratian Gertich.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund de Schweinitz, ''History of the Church Known as the Unitas Fratrum Or the Unity of the Brethren'' (1885), note p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent the last 20 years of his life teaching in the colleges of Pułtusk, [[Poznań]], [[Kraków]] and [[Kalisz]]. He died in Kalisz on 26 or 28 July 1618.&lt;ref name=Roncalia&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roncaglia |first1=Gino |title=Smiglecius on  entia rationis |url=http://dspace.unitus.it/bitstream/2067/460/1/Smiglecius_on_entia_rationis.pdf|pages=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWN"/&gt; 

==Publications==
His major works include:&lt;ref name=Roncalia/&gt;
*''De fenore et contractu redimibili, censibus, communi quaestu, conductionibus, locationibus et monopolio brevis doctrina'', first published in [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''O Lichwie'' (On [[Usury]]) (Vilnae, 1596)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roncalia/&gt; 
*''Nodus Gordius sive de Vocatione Ministrorum disputatio'' (Cracoviae, 1609)
*''Nova monstra novi Arianismi'' (Nissae, 1612)  
*''Logica'' (Ingolstadt, 1618)

==The ''Logica''==
Marcin Śmiglecki's "Logica", first published in 1618 in [[Ingolstadt]], was reprinted several times, in particular at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1634, 1638, and 1658,&lt;ref name=Roncalia/&gt; being used there as a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/visite/vilnius/knygos/knygos/logika/migle/anglu/emmigle.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It harked back to [[Gregory of Rimini]], discussing [[mental proposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Ashworth, ''Traditional Logic'', pp. 160-1 in Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; As a textbook author his reputation survived in the satirical poem ''The Logicians Refuted'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:The Logicians Refuted]]&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to both [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]]. [[Samuel Johnson]], writing in 1751 as a fictitious correspondent in ''[[The Rambler]]'',  claimed that as a student he "slept every night with Smiglecius on my pillow."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/worksofsamueljoh05johniala/worksofsamueljoh05johniala_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
In a live controversy of the time, Smiglecius sided with [[Benedictus Pereyra]] against [[Giuseppe Biancani]]. The issue was the status of [[mathematical proof]] in physics, where Pereyra denied mathematics an essential status.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Mancosu, ''Philosophy of Mathematics and Mathematical Practice in the Seventeenth Century'' (1996), p. 13 and p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9253">'''Model-dependent realism''' is a view of scientific inquiry that focuses on the role of [[scientific model]]s of phenomena.&lt;ref name=Koonin/&gt; It claims reality should be interpreted based upon these models, and where several models overlap in describing a particular subject, multiple, equally valid, realities exist. It claims that it is meaningless to talk about the "true reality" of a model as we can never be ''absolutely'' certain of anything. The only meaningful thing is the [[explanatory power|usefulness of the model]].&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; The term "model-dependent realism" was coined by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]] in their 2010 book, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]''.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

==Overview==
Model-dependent realism asserts that all we can know about "reality" consists of networks of ''world pictures'' that explain ''observations'' by connecting them by ''rules'' to concepts defined in ''models''. Will an ultimate [[theory of everything]] be found? Hawking/Mlodinow suggest it is unclear:
{{quote|In the history of science we have discovered a sequence of better and better theories or models, from Plato to the classical theory of Newton to modern quantum theories. It is natural to ask: Will this sequence eventually reach an end point, an ultimate theory of the universe, that will include all forces and predict every observation we can make, or will we continue forever finding better theories, but never one that cannot be improved upon? We do not yet have a definitive answer to this question...&lt;ref name=Sequence/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 8}}

A ''world picture'' consists of the combination of a set of observations accompanied by a conceptual model and by rules connecting the model concepts to the observations. Different world pictures that describe particular data equally well all have equal claims to be valid. There is no requirement that a world picture be unique, or even that the data selected include all available observations. The universe of all observations at present is covered by a ''network'' of overlapping world pictures and, where overlap occurs; multiple, equally valid, world pictures exist. At present, science requires multiple models to encompass existing observations:
{{quote|Like the overlapping maps in a Mercator projection, where the ranges of different versions overlap, they predict the same phenomena. But just as there is no flat map that is a good representation of the earth's entire surface, there is no single theory that is a good representation of observations in all situations&lt;ref name=Mercator/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 9}} Where several models are found for the same phenomena, no single model is preferable to the others within that domain of overlap.

==Model selection==
{{see also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
While not rejecting the idea of "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", model-dependent realism suggests that we cannot know "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", but only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models. The view of models in model-dependent realism also is related to the [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] approach to modern science, that a concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality (a matter possibly impossible to establish). A model is a good model if it:&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt;
#Is elegant
#Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements
#Agrees with and explains all existing observations
#Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.
"If the modifications needed to accommodate new observations become too baroque, it signals the need for a new model." &lt;ref name=Baroque/&gt; Of course, an assessment like that is subjective, as are the other criteria.&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; According to Hawking and Mlodinow, even very successful models in use today do not satisfy all these criteria, which are aspirational in nature.&lt;ref name=Failure/&gt;

[[File:Martin Van Maele - La Grande Danse macabre des vifs - 01.jpg|thumb|Mooning can be used to express disrespect.]]
'''Mooning''' is the act of displaying one's bare [[buttocks]] by removing clothing, e.g., by lowering the backside of one's [[trousers]] and [[underpants]], usually bending over, whether also exposing the genitals or not. Mooning is used in the English-speaking world &lt;!-- see Talk:Mooning#geographic distribution --&gt; to express [[protest]], [[Contempt|scorn]], [[disrespect]], or provocation, or can be done for [[shock value]], [[fun]], or as a form of [[exhibitionism]]. 

Some jurisdictions regard mooning to be [[indecent exposure]], sometimes depending on the context.

==Word history==
''[[Moon]]'' has been a common shape metaphor for the [[buttocks]] in English since 1743, and the verb ''to moon'' has meant "to expose to (moon)light" since 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nester |first=Daniel |title=How to be Inappropriate |publisher=Counterpoint Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1593762537}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--, long before they were combined in US student slang in the verb(al expression) mooning "to flash the buttocks" in 1968. --&gt; As documented by McLaren, "'mooning', or exposing one's butt to shame an enemy ... had a long pedigree in peasant culture" throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and in many nations.&lt;ref name="McLaren"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trials of Masculinity: Policing Sexual Boundaries, 1870-1930|first=Angus |last=McLaren |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHTeeteHH1UC&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Mooning" is also defined as "wandering idly" and "romantically pining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=moon&amp;searchmode=term |title=Moon |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the practice of mooning was widespread by the 19th century, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the use of "moon" and "mooning" to describe the act to student slang of the 1960s, when the gesture became increasingly popular among students at universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|title=Mooning: A History|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/06/27/mooning_a_history_when_did_people_start_baring_their_butts_as_an_insult_.html|work=browbeat: Slate's culture blog|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012|author=Forrest Wickman|date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal position related to mooning varies between [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]]; some consider it [[indecent exposure]], while others classify it as legal self expression.

==In various countries and cultures==

===Australia===
====Victoria====
In 2016, mooning in a public place in Victoria was made a criminal offence/something for which one could be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|num_act|caoa201647o2016349|Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
'''Whakapohane''' is the [[Māori people|Māori]] practice of baring one's buttocks with the intent to offend. It symbolises the birthing act and renders the recipient ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)#Noa|noa]]'' ("base").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She stood on the [[marae]] (sacred area) and the chief of the [[Te Arawa]] tribes, [[Mita Taupopoki]], objected telling her that she must get off ''his'' marae as she was a woman. She stood her ground and when he had finished his objections she defended her position. 

She said that she was descended from a prior-born ancestor than the chief. She was not on ''his'' marae; she was on ''her'' marae. She exposed her genitals, telling the chief that that was where he came from. Those assembled were asked to gainsay her speech but no one came forward. The Maori gesture of Whakapohane had countered the argument that was aimed at her.&lt;ref name="Salmond2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Salmond|title=Tears of Rangi: Experiments Across Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXUsDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT526|date=24 July 2017|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=978-1-77558-923-5|pages=526–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[File:mooning.jpg|thumb|right|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a "mass mooning" in May 1995. This demonstration was in protest of [[censorship in the United States|censorship in the American media]].]]

In January 2006, a [[Maryland]] [[State court (United States)|state]] [[circuit court]] determined that mooning is a form of artistic expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of [[freedom of speech|speech]].&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301509.html |work=Washington Post |title=Mooning Deemed 'Disgusting' but No Crime in Md. |last=Londoño |first=Ernesto |page=B01 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|page=B6|title=Judge rules 'mooning' is not illegal in Md.|date=January 6, 2006|publisher=[[Delaware News-Journal|The News Journal]], redistributed from the [[Associated Press]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court ruled that [[indecent exposure]] relates only to exposure of the genitals, adding that even though mooning was a "disgusting" and "demeaning" act to engage in, and had taken place in the presence of a minor, "If exposure of half of the buttocks constituted indecent exposure, any woman wearing a [[Thong (clothing)|thong]] at the beach at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] would be guilty."&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

Defense attorneys had cited a case from 1983 of a woman who was arrested after protesting in front of the [[United States Supreme Court building|U.S. Supreme Court building]] wearing nothing but a cardboard sign that covered the front of her body. In that case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] had ruled that indecent exposure is limited to a person's genitalia. No review of the case by a higher court took place since prosecutors dropped the case after the ruling.

In California, an appellate court found in December 2000 that mooning does not constitute indecent exposure (and, therefore, does not subject the defendant to [[sex offender]] registration laws) unless it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct was sexually motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/85/937.html|title=In re Dallas W.

*In 80 AD, [[Flavius Josephus]] recorded the first known incident of mooning.

'''Mu'an''' ({{zh|t=木庵性瑫|p=Mù'ān Xìngtāo}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]] '''Mokuan Shōtō''') (1611–1684) was a [[China|Chinese]] [[Zen|Chan]] monk who followed his master [[Yinyuan Longqi]] to [[Japan]] in 1654.

[[File:Portrait of Muan Kita chobei Inscription by Muan Triptych hanging scrolls color on paper Kobe City Museum.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Muyan.]]

Together they founded the [[Obaku (school of Buddhism)|Ōbaku]] [[Zen]] school and [[Mampuku-ji]], the school's head temple at [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] in 1661.  In 1664, Muyan succeeded his master as chief of the temple and in 1671 established another temple called [[Zuishō-ji]] at [[Shirokane]], [[Edo]]. He is honored as one of the [[Ōbaku no Sanpitsu]].

{{Rights |Distinctions}}
'''Natural and legal rights''' are two types of [[rights]]. Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and so are universal and [[alienation (property law)|inalienable]] (they cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws). Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given [[legal system]] (they can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws).

The concept of [[natural law]] is related to the concept of natural rights. Natural law first appeared in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommen, Heinrich A., ''The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social Philosophy'' trans. Thomas R. Hanley, O.S.B., Ph.D. (B. Herder Book Co., 1947 [reprinted 1959] ), p.. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to by [[Roman philosopher]] [[Cicero]]. It was subsequently alluded to in the [[Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Catholic philosopher]]s such as [[Albert the Great]] and his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]]. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of natural laws was used to challenge the [[divine right of kings]], and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[government]] – and thus legal rights – in the form of [[classical republicanism]]. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

The idea of [[human rights]] is also closely related to that of natural rights: some acknowledge no difference between the two, regarding them as synonymous, while others choose to keep the terms separate to eliminate association with some features traditionally associated with natural rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter. ''Rights''. Palgrave Macmillan, 1994, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights, in particular, are considered beyond the authority of any government or [[Intergovernmental organizations|international body]] to dismiss. The 1948 [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is an important [[legal instrument]] enshrining one conception of natural rights into international [[soft law]]. Natural rights were traditionally viewed as exclusively [[negative rights]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, the imperative "not to harm others" is said to be justified by natural law, but the same is not true when it comes to providing protection against harm&lt;/ref&gt; whereas human rights also comprise positive rights.&lt;ref&gt;See James Nickel, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/ Human Rights], 2010. The claim that "..all human rights are negative rights.." is rejected, therefore human rights also comprise positive rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Even on a natural rights conception of human rights, the two terms may not be synonymous.

The proposition that [[Animal rights|animals have natural rights]] is one that gained the interest of philosophers and legal scholars in the 20th century and into the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights "Animal Rights"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007; Dershowitz, Alan. ''Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights'', 2004, pp. 198–99; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-257091/animal-rights "Animal Rights: The Modern Animal Rights Movement"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea that certain rights are natural or inalienable also has a history dating back at least to the [[Stoics]] of [[late Antiquity]] and [[Thomism|Catholic law]] of the early [[Middle Ages]], and descending through the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to today.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The existence of natural rights has been asserted by different individuals on different premises, such as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' philosophical reasoning or religious principles. For example, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed to derive natural rights through reason alone. The United States Declaration of Independence, meanwhile, is based upon the "[[self-evident]]" truth that "all men are … endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights".&lt;ref name="us-doi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html |title=America's Founding Documents &amp;#124; National Archives |website=Archives.gov |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, different philosophers and statesmen have designed different lists of what they believe to be natural rights; almost all include the right to [[life]] and [[liberty]] as the two highest priorities. [[H. L. A. Hart]] argued that if there are any rights at all, there must be the right to liberty, for all the others would depend upon this. [[T. H. Green]] argued that “if there are such things as rights at all, then, there must be a right to life and liberty, or, to put it more properly to free life.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation'', T. H. Green, 1883, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] emphasized "life, liberty and property" as primary. However, despite Locke's influential defense of the [[right of revolution]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] substituted "pursuit of happiness" in place of "property" in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

===Ancient===
[[Stephen Kinzer]], a veteran journalist for ''The New York Times'' and the author of the book ''All The Shah's Men'', writes in the latter that:

{{quote|The Zoroastrian religion taught Iranians that citizens have an inalienable right to enlightened leadership and that the duty of subjects is not simply to obey wise kings but also to rise up against those who are wicked. Leaders are seen as representative of God on earth, but they deserve allegiance only as long as they have ''farr'', a kind of divine blessing that they must earn by moral behavior.}}

The [[Stoics]] held that no one was a slave by nature; slavery was an external condition juxtaposed to the internal freedom of the soul (''sui juris''). [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote:

{{quote|It is a mistake to imagine that slavery pervades a man's whole being; the better part of him is exempt from it: the body indeed is subjected and in the power of a master, but the mind is independent, and indeed is so free and wild, that it cannot be restrained even by this prison of the body, wherein it is confined.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De beneficiis'', III, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of fundamental importance to the development of the idea of natural rights was the emergence of the idea of natural human equality. As the historian A.J. Carlyle notes: "There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by [[Cicero]] and Seneca.... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlyle |first=A.J. |title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West |year=1903 |location=Edinburgh |volume=1 |pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that "the idea of the equality of men is the profoundest contribution of the Stoics to political thought" and that "its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McIlwain |first=Charles H. |title=The Growth of Political Thought in the West: From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages |year=1932 |location=New York |pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero argues in [[De Legibus]] that "we are born for Justice, and that right is based, not upon opinions, but upon Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), book 1, section 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
One of the first Western thinkers to develop the contemporary idea of natural rights was French theologian [[Jean Gerson]], whose 1402 treatise ''De Vita Spirituali Animae'' is considered one of the first attempts to develop what would come to be called modern natural rights theory.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572–1651'' (1993), pp. 25-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries later, the Stoic doctrine that the "inner part cannot be delivered into bondage"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, David Brion. ''The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture.'' Cornell University Press, 1966, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; re-emerged in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] doctrine of liberty of conscience. [[Martin Luther]] wrote:

{{quote|Furthermore, every man is responsible for his own faith, and he must see it for himself that he believes rightly. As little as another can go to hell or heaven for me, so little can he believe or disbelieve for me; and as little as he can open or shut heaven or hell for me, so little can he drive me to faith or unbelief. Since, then, belief or unbelief is a matter of every one's conscience, and since this is no lessening of the secular power, the latter should be content and attend to its own affairs and permit men to believe one thing or another, as they are able and willing, and constrain no one by force.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Concerning Secular Authority'', 1523.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

17th-century [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. Preservation of the natural rights to life, liberty, and property was claimed as justification for the rebellion of the American colonies. As [[George Mason]] stated in his draft for the ''[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]'', "all men are born equally free," and hold "certain inherent natural rights, of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity."&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier,''American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence.'' New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1993, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 17th-century Englishman, [[John Lilburne]] (known as ''Freeborn John''), who came into conflict with both the monarchy of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and the [[military dictatorship]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] governed republic, argued for level human basic rights he called "''[[freeborn]] rights''" which he defined as being rights that every human being is born with, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or by human law.

The distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was introduced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. In his ''Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue'' (1725), Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence, stating: “For wherever any Invasion is made upon unalienable Rights, there must arise either a perfect, or external Right to Resistance. . . . Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments.” Hutcheson, however, placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights, declaring that “there can be no Right, or Limitation of Right, inconsistent with, or opposite to the greatest publick Good."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hutcheson, ''An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue in Two Treatises'' (Indianapolis, 2004), pp. 192, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his ''A System of Moral Philosophy'' (1755), based on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] principle of the liberty of conscience. One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment (e.g., about religious questions) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is "unalienable." Hutcheson wrote: "Thus no man can really change his sentiments, judgments, and inward affections, at the pleasure of another; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart. The right of private judgment is therefore unalienable."&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheson, Francis. ''A System of Moral Philosophy''. London, 1755, pp. 261–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Enlightenment|German Enlightenment]], [[Hegel]] gave a highly developed treatment of this inalienability argument. Like Hutcheson, Hegel based the theory of inalienable rights on the ''de facto'' inalienability of those aspects of personhood that distinguish persons from things. A thing, like a piece of property, can in fact be transferred from one person to another. According to Hegel, the same would not apply to those aspects that make one a person:

{{quote|The right to what is in essence inalienable is imprescriptible, since the act whereby I take possession of my personality, of my substantive essence, and make myself a responsible being, capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life, takes away from these characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else. When I have thus annulled their externality, I cannot lose them through lapse of time or from any other reason drawn from my prior consent or willingness to alienate them.&lt;ref&gt;Georg W. F. Hegel, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Right'', T.M. Knox, trans., New York: Oxford University Press, 1967 (1821), section 66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In discussion of [[social contract]] theory, "inalienable rights" were said to be those rights that could not be surrendered by citizens to the sovereign. Such rights were thought to be ''natural rights'', independent of positive law. Some social contract theorists reasoned, however, that in the [[state of nature|natural state]] only the strongest could benefit from their rights. Thus, people form an implicit [[social contract]], ceding their natural rights to the authority to protect the people from abuse, and living henceforth under the legal rights of that authority.

Many historical apologies for slavery and illiberal government were based on explicit or implicit voluntary contracts to alienate any "natural rights" to freedom and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Philmore, J. 1982. The Libertarian Case for Slavery: A Note on Nozick. ''Philosophical Forum''. XIV (Fall 1982): 43–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''de facto'' inalienability arguments of Hutcheson and his predecessors provided the basis for the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] to argue not simply against involuntary slavery but against any explicit or implied contractual forms of slavery. Any contract that tried to legally alienate such a right would be inherently invalid. Similarly, the argument was used by the democratic movement to argue against any explicit or implied social contracts of subjection (''pactum subjectionis'') by which a people would supposedly alienate their right of self-government to a sovereign as, for example, in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. According to [[Ernst Cassirer]],

{{quote|There is, at least, one right that cannot be ceded or abandoned: the right to personality...They charged the great logician [Hobbes] with a contradiction in terms. If a man could give up his personality he would cease being a moral being. … There is no ''pactum subjectionis'', no act of submission by which man can give up the state of free agent and enslave himself. For by such an act of renunciation he would give up that very character which constitutes his nature and essence: he would lose his humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst. ''The Myth of the State''. Yale University Press, 1963, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These themes converged in the debate about American Independence. While Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, [[Richard Price]] in England sided with the Americans' claim "that Great Britain is attempting to rob them of that liberty to which every member of society and all civil communities have a natural and unalienable title."&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;Price, Richard. ''Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty''. 1776, Part I. Reprinted in: Peach, Bernard, (Ed.) ''Richard Price and the Ethical Foundations of the American Revolution''. [[Duke University]] Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Price again based the argument on the ''de facto'' inalienability of "that principle of spontaneity or self-determination which constitutes us agents or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly ours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause."&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;{{rp|67–68}} Any social contract or compact allegedly alienating these rights would be non-binding and void, wrote Price:

{{quote|Neither can any state acquire such an authority over other states in virtue of any compacts or cessions. This is a case in which compacts are not binding. Civil liberty is, in this respect, on the same footing with religious liberty. As no people can lawfully surrender their religious liberty by giving up their right of judging for themselves in religion, or by allowing any human beings to prescribe to them what faith they shall embrace, or what mode of worship they shall practise, so neither can any civil societies lawfully surrender their civil liberty by giving up to any extraneous jurisdiction their power of legislating for themselves and disposing their property.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;{{rp|78–79}}}}

Price raised a furor of opposition so in 1777 he wrote another tract that clarified his position and again restated the ''de facto'' basis for the argument that the "liberty of men as agents is that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess."&lt;ref&gt;Price, Richard. ''Additional Observations on the Nature and Value of Civil Liberty.'' Reprinted in: Peach, Bernard, (Ed.) ''Richard Price and the Ethical Foundations of the American Revolution''. Duke University Press, 1979, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism'', [[Staughton Lynd]] pulled together these themes and related them to the slavery debate:

{{quote|Then it turned out to make considerable difference whether one said slavery was wrong because every man has a natural right to the possession of his own body, or because every man has a natural right freely to determine his own destiny. The first kind of right was alienable: thus Locke neatly derived slavery from capture in war, whereby a man forfeited his labor to the conqueror who might lawfully have killed him; and thus Dred Scott was judged permanently to have given up his freedom. But the second kind of right, what Price called "that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess," was inalienable as long man remained man. Like the mind's quest for religious truth from which it was derived, self-determination was not a claim to ownership which might be both acquired and surrendered, but an inextricable aspect of the activity of being human.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism''. Vintage Books, 1969, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, in America, [[Thomas Jefferson]] "took his division of rights into alienable and unalienable from Hutcheson, who made the distinction popular and important",&lt;ref&gt;Garry Wills, 1979. ''Inventing America.'' New York: [[Random House|Vintage Books]], p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], famously condensed this to:

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...}}

In the 19th century, the movement to abolish slavery seized this passage as a statement of constitutional principle, although the U.S. constitution recognized and protected slavery. As a lawyer, future [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] argued before the Supreme Court in the case of [[John Van Zandt]], who had been charged with violating the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], that:

{{quote|The law of the Creator, which invests every human being with an inalienable title to freedom, cannot be repealed by any interior law which asserts that man is property.}}

The concept of inalienable rights was criticized by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Edmund Burke]] as groundless. Bentham and Burke, writing in 18th century Britain, claimed that rights arise from the actions of government, or evolve from tradition, and that neither of these can provide anything ''inalienable''. (See Bentham's [http://www.ditext.com/bentham/bentham.html "Critique of the Doctrine of Inalienable, Natural Rights"], and Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''). Presaging the shift in thinking in the 19th century, Bentham famously dismissed the idea of natural rights as "nonsense on stilts". By way of contrast to the views of British nationals Burke and Bentham, the leading American revolutionary scholar [[James Wilson]] condemned Burke's view as "tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=James |editor=Robert Green McCloskey |title=The Works of James Wilson |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= |location=Cambridge, Mass. |volume=2 |pages=586–89 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signers of the Declaration of Independence deemed it a "self-evident truth" that all men "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights".
In ''[[The Social Contract]]'', [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] claims that the existence of inalienable rights is unnecessary for the existence of a [[constitution]] or a set of laws and rights. This idea of a [[social contract]]{{spaced ndash}}that rights and responsibilities are derived from a consensual contract between the government and the people{{spaced ndash}}is the most widely recognized alternative.

One criticism of natural rights theory is that one cannot draw norms from facts.&lt;ref name="Finnis"&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Law &amp; Natural Rights |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Finnis, John |year=2011 |location=Oxford |pages=23–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objection is variously expressed as the [[is-ought problem]], the [[naturalistic fallacy]], or the [[appeal to nature]]. [[G.E. Moore]], for example, said that [[ethical naturalism]] falls prey to the naturalistic fallacy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Some defenders of natural rights theory, however, counter that the term "natural" in "natural rights" is contrasted with "artificial" rather than referring to [[nature]]. [[John Finnis]], for example, contends that [[natural law]] and natural rights are derived from self-evident principles, not from speculative principles or from facts.&lt;ref name="Finnis" /&gt;

There is also debate as to whether all rights are either natural or legal. Fourth president of the United States [[James Madison]], while representing Virginia in the House of Representatives, believed that there are rights, such as [[trial by jury]], that are [[social rights]], arising neither from [[natural law]] nor from [[positive law]] (which are the basis of natural and legal rights respectively) but from the [[social contract]] from which a government derives its authority.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of the Bill of Rights in Congress, 1789 Jun 8, Jul 21, Aug 13, 18–19; Annals 1:424-50, 661–65, 707–17, 757–59, 766.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Hobbes====
{{Main article|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) included a discussion of natural rights in his moral and [[political philosophy]]. Hobbes' conception of natural rights extended from his conception of man in a "state of nature". Thus he argued that the essential natural (human) right was "to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own judgement, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

Hobbes sharply distinguished this natural "liberty", from natural "laws", described generally as "a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving his life; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may best be preserved." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

In his natural state, according to Hobbes, man's life consisted entirely of liberties and not at all of laws – "It followeth, that in such a condition, every man has the right to every thing; even to one another's body. And therefore, as long as this natural Right of every man to every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man... of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily allow men to live." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

This would lead inevitably to a situation known as the "[[bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]", in which human beings kill, steal and enslave others in order to stay alive, and due to their natural lust for "Gain", "Safety" and "Reputation". Hobbes reasoned that this world of chaos created by unlimited rights was highly undesirable, since it would cause human life to be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". As such, if humans wish to live peacefully they must give up most of their natural rights and create moral obligations in order to establish political and [[civil society]]. This is one of the earliest formulations of the theory of government known as the [[social contract]].

Hobbes objected to the attempt to derive rights from "[[natural law]]," arguing that law ("lex") and right ("jus") though often confused, signify opposites, with law referring to obligations, while rights refer to the absence of obligations. Since by our (human) nature, we seek to maximize our well being, rights are prior to law, natural or institutional, and people will not follow the laws of nature without first being subjected to a sovereign power, without which all ideas of [[Ethics|right and wrong]] are meaningless – "Therefore before the names of Just and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants..., to make good that Propriety, which by mutual contract men acquire, in recompense of the universal Right they abandon: and such power there is none before the erection of the Commonwealth." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan]]''. 1, XV)

This marked an important departure from medieval natural law theories which gave precedence to obligations over rights.

====John Locke====
{{Main article|John Locke}}
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[John Locke]], ''"[[Life]], [[Liberty]], [[Estate (law)|Estate]]'' ([[property]])"]]
John Locke (1632 – 1704) was another prominent Western philosopher who conceptualized rights as natural and inalienable. Like Hobbes, Locke believed in a natural right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]]. It was once conventional wisdom that Locke greatly influenced the [[American Revolutionary War]] with his writings of natural rights, but this claim has been the subject of protracted dispute in recent decades. For example, the historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson’s use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Harvey |first=Ray Forrest |title=Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism |year=1937 |location=Chapel Hill, N.C. |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the eminent&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IR3HlZ9IQuEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Law+as+culture+and+culture+as+law:+essays+in+honor+of+John+Phillip+Reid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X260ecQgxo&amp;sig=A-CqdA9td0uZGU-ZXR8ZvlacxpI&amp;hl=ko&amp;ei=fiT3S8fUHY3vcMiH1OYL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Law As Culture and Culture As Law: Essays in Honor of John Phillip Reid]  Books.google.co.kr. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; legal historian John Phillip Reid has deplored contemporary scholars’ "misplaced emphasis on John Locke," arguing that American revolutionary leaders saw Locke as a ''commentator'' on established constitutional principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Reid |first=John Phillip |title=Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority To Tax |year=1987 |location=Madison, Wis. |pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Reid |first=John Phillip |title=Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Rights |year=1986 |location=Madison, Wis. |pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Pangle]] has defended Locke's influence on the Founding, claiming that historians who argue to the contrary either misrepresent the classical republican alternative to which they say the revolutionary leaders adhered, do not understand Locke, or point to someone else who was decisively influenced by Locke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pangle |first=Thomas L. |authorlink=Thomas Pangle |title=The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of John Locke |year=1988 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position has also been sustained by Michael Zuckert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=The Natural Rights Republic: Studies in the Foundation of the American Political Tradition |year=1996 |location=South Bend, Ind. |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=Natural Rights and the New Republicanism |year=1998 |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=Launching Liberalism: On Lockean Political Philosophy |year=2002 |location=Lawrence |publisher=University Press of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Locke there are three natural rights:
* Life: everyone is entitled to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kunze |first1=Fred |title=A Biography of John Locke |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/biographies/john-locke/ |website=American History from revolution to reconstruction and beyond |publisher=GMW – University of Groningen |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liberty: everyone is entitled to do anything they want to so long as it doesn't conflict with the first right.
* Estate: everyone is entitled to own all they create or gain through gift or trade so long as it doesn't conflict with the first two rights.

In developing his concept of natural rights, Locke was influenced by reports of society among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], whom he regarded as "natural peoples" who lived in a state of liberty and "near perfect freedom", but not license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ratical.org/many_worlds/6Nations/EoL/chp4.html |title=Chp 4: Ennobling `Savages', Native America in European natural-rights philosophy, "Exemplar Of Liberty" |website=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also informed his conception of [[social contract]].

The social contract is an agreement between members of a country to live within a shared system of laws. Specific forms of government are the result of the decisions made by these persons acting in their collective capacity. Government is instituted to make laws that protect these three natural rights. If a government does not properly protect these rights, it can be overthrown.

====Thomas Paine====
{{Main article|Thomas Paine}}
[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[Thomas Paine]]]]

Thomas Paine (1731–1809) further elaborated on natural rights in his influential work ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), emphasizing that rights cannot be granted by any charter because this would legally imply they can also be revoked and under such circumstances they would be reduced to privileges:

{{quote|It is a perversion of terms to say that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect – that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those rights, in the majority, leave the right, by exclusion, in the hands of a few. … They...consequently are instruments of injustice.

The fact therefore must be that the individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right, entered into a compact with each other to produce a government: and this is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right to exist.}}

=== American individualist anarchists ===
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]While at first [[American individualist anarchists]] adhered to natural rights positions, later in this era led by [[Benjamin Tucker]], some abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[Egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said there were only two rights: "the right of might" and "the right of contract".{{Citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=}} He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, "In times past... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off.... Man's only right to land is his might over it."&lt;ref name="Ref_ac"&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wendy McElroy:
{{quote|In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 |title=Literature of Liberty, Autumn 1981, vol. 4, No. 3 – Online Library of Liberty |website=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several periodicals were "undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism, including ''I'' published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of ''Liberty''); ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]], and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad" /&gt; Among those American anarchists who adhered to egoism include [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[James L. Walker]], [[Victor Yarros]] and E.H. Fulton.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad" /&gt;

===Contemporary===
Many documents now echo the phrase used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The preamble to the 1948 United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] asserts that rights are inalienable: "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." Article 1, §&amp;nbsp;1 of the [[California Constitution]] recognizes inalienable rights, and articulated ''some'' (not all) of those rights as "defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and [[privacy]]." However, there is still much dispute over which "rights" are truly natural rights and which are not, and the concept of natural or inalienable rights is still controversial to some.

[[Erich Fromm]] argued that some powers over human beings could be wielded only by God, and that if there were no God, no human beings could wield these powers.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm (1973), ''The Revolution of Hope: Toward a Humanized Technology'', New York: Bantam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political philosophies continuing the [[classical liberal]] tradition of natural rights include [[libertarianism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], and include amongst their canon the works of authors such as [[Robert Nozick]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Ayn Rand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html Individual Rights – Ayn Rand Lexicon]. Aynrandlexicon.com. Retrieved 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Murray Rothbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp |title=The Ethics of Liberty &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A libertarian view of inalienable rights is laid out in Morris and Linda Tannehill's ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', which claims that a man has a right to ownership over his life and therefore also his property, because he has invested time (i.e. part of his life) in it and thereby made it an extension of his life. However, if he initiates force against and to the detriment of another man, he alienates himself from the right to that part of his life which is required to pay his debt: "Rights are ''not'' inalienable, but only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right – no one else can take a man's rights from him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Market for Liberty |chapter=Man and Society |page=11 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various definitions of inalienability include non-relinquishability, non-salability, and non-transferability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Libertarian Theory of Inalienability |author=Block, Walter |publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies |volume=17 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2003 |pages=39–85 |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/17_2/17_2_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been recognized by libertarians as being central to the question of [[voluntary slavery]], which [[Murray Rothbard]] dismissed as illegitimate and even self-contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/2459#ixzz0nx4DiTmB |title=A Crusoe Social Philosophy &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephan Kinsella]] argues that "viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent with – indeed, implied by – the libertarian [[non-aggression principle]]. Under this principle, only the initiation of force is prohibited; [[defensive force|defensive]], [[restitutive]], or [[retaliatory force]] is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_4.pdf |title=Inalienability and Punishment: A Reply to George Smith &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various philosophers have created different lists of rights they consider to be natural. Proponents of natural rights, in particular Hesselberg and [[Rothbard]], have responded that reason can be applied to separate truly [[axiom]]atic rights from supposed rights, stating that any principle that requires itself to be disproved is an axiom. Critics have pointed to the lack of agreement between the proponents as evidence for the claim that the idea of natural rights is merely a political tool.

Hugh Gibbons has proposed a descriptive argument based on human biology. His contention is that Human Beings were other-regarding as a matter of necessity, in order to avoid the costs of conflict. Over time they developed expectations that individuals would act in certain ways which were then prescribed by society (duties of care etc.) and that eventually crystallized into actionable rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/pilj/vol13no2/documents/13-2GibbonsArticle.pdf |title=De Sciuridae Et Homo Sapiens: The Origin Of Rights And Duties |format=PDF |website=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inference of [[natural deduction]] is a '''normal form''', according to [[Dag Prawitz]], if no formula occurrence is both the principal premise of an elimination rule and the conclusion of an introduction rule.

'''''Oppenheimer v Cattermole''''' [1976] AC 249 is a judicial decision of the English courts relating to whether [[English law]] should refuse to recognise [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi era laws]] relating to the appropriation of Jewish property.  The courts considered the question whether the Nazi law was so iniquitous that it should refuse to recognise it as law, thus raising the ''connection between the concepts of law and morality''".&lt;ref&gt;Meyerson, Denise, Essential Jurisprudence, Routledge, Cavendish, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The respondent, Frederick Cattermole, was HM Inspector of Taxes.

In the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], [[Geoffrey Cross, Baron Cross of Chelsea|Lord Cross of Chelsea]] famously held:

{{Cquote|a law of this sort constitutes so grave an infringement of [[human rights]] that the courts of this country ought to refuse to recognise it as a law at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Oppenheimer v Cattermole'' [1975] AC 249 at 278&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
Mr Meier Oppenheimer "was born in Germany in 1896. He qualified there as a teacher and for some 20 years from 1919 to 1939 he taught at a Jewish orphanage in Bavaria. He was detained for a short time at [[Dachau concentration camp|the concentration camp at Dachau]], but soon after his release he left Germany in 1939 for England and has resided here ever since. In 1948 he applied for naturalisation and became a naturalised British subject. In 1953 the German authorities determined to make compensation to the employees of Jewish religious communities. They awarded the taxpayer a pension from 1 October 1952. In 1961 he became 65 and they awarded him a second pension. Both pensions were payable out of the public funds of Germany."&lt;ref&gt;http://uniset.ca/naty/maternity/oppenheimer1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The pensions were as compensation for the injustice which had been done to him.

The question for the courts was whether Oppenheimer was liable to pay English income tax on his two pensions. This depended on his nationality. If he was a national of the United Kingdom only, the tax was payable. If, on the other hand he had dual nationality of both the UK and Germany, then he was exempt of English income tax. This stemmed from the double taxation conventions concluded between the UK and Germany, later incorporated into English law. 

In 1968, the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] decided that the 1941 decree was void ''ab initio'', but that decision had no retrospective effect. Mr Oppenheimer became entitled to apply for reinstatement as a German national and did so, with the status being granted automatically. He subsequently benefited from the dual nationality provision in the double taxation agreement, so the case only covered his status and pension from 1953-54 to 1967-68.

==The decision at first instance==
The case was first determined by the UK Special Commissioners for income tax,{{efn|"Commissioners for the special purposes of the Income Tax Acts", appointed under Section 4 of the Taxes Management Act 1970}} who decided that Oppenheimer was only British, and not also German, and therefore had to pay tax on his pensions. Their decision was based on a [[nationality Law of the German Empire and States|1913 German law]], when there were no complications of the countries being at war, which stated that a German lost their German nationality if they acquired a foreign nationality without permission.

The commissioners found it unnecessary to decide the case on another German law of 1941, which decreed that a Jew in Germany lost his German nationality as soon as he left Germany. It is important to note that under Art. 116 (2) of the post-war German Constitution, any victim of the 1941 decree was entitled to resume his German citizenship by applying to the German authorities. This he had not done.

Oppenehimer submitted on his UK nationality form that he was German at the time of being nationalised in 1948.

{{cquote|At a meeting of the Commissioners for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts held on 19th January 1970 Meier Oppenheimer (hereinafter called "the Appellant") appealed against assessments to income tax in the sum of £800 for each of the years 1953-54 to 1967-68 inclusive.|source=Oppenheimer v Cattermole (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) (1971-1977) 50 TC 159}}

{{notelist}}

==Judgment by Goulding J==
The administrative decision by the Special Commissioners for income tax was then decided by [[Irvine Goulding|Goulding J]], who determined in Oppenheimer’s favour; he was declared to have both nationalities, and did not need to pay tax on his pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Goulding J Chancery Division Oppenheimer v Cattermole (Inspector of Taxes) [1972] 2 All ER 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Goulding agreed with the argument of counsel for Oppenheimer that the 1913 German Act had no effect as he had already lost his nationality with the 1941 Act which was effective only on Jews.  This then created the option by English law that he was also German, a legal fiction.  The logic behind this is the subject of an article written by the legal commentator J. G. Merrills, the Edward Bramley Professor of Law at Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;The International and Comparative Law Quarterly. Vol. 23, No. 1, Jan., 1974. One Nationality or Two? Page 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment in the Court of Appeal==
The decision by Goulding J was appealed by the Special Commissioners for income tax, and was heard in the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], by Lord Denning M.R ([[Master of the Rolls]])., Buckley and Orr L.JJ. They decided in favour of the Special Commissioners, and so Oppenheimer now had orders to pay tax on his pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer v Cattermole and Notham v Cooper Transcript [1972] EWCA Civ J0720-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lord Denning's view when Oppenheimer assumed his United Kingdom nationality in 1948 it was impossible for him to retain his German nationality because nationality and allegiance go hand in hand and a person cannot owe allegiance to two countries which are at war with each other.

Lord Denning stated that it was for English law to determine the nationality in this case. He also made reference to Russell J. in ''Stoeck v. Public Trustee'' [1921] 2 Ch. 67, 82:"Whether a person is a national of a country must be determined by the municipal law of that country. Upon this I think all text writers are agreed." Lord Cross of Chelsea, see below, did not agree with this assessment.

==Judgment in the House of Lords==
The court of final appeal in 1976 was the House of Lords, and the case was heard by Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone, Lord Hodson, Lord Pearson, Lord Cross of Chelsea and Lord Salmon. The appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;http://uniset.ca/naty/maternity/oppenheimer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer v Cattermole and Nothman v Cooper [1976] AC 249; [1972] 3 WLR 815; [1975] 2 WLR 347; (1975) 72 ILR 446&lt;/ref&gt;

All Lords agreed with Lord Cross of Chelsea who ordered in the following terms:

{{quote|"That this case be and the same is hereby remitted back to the Commissioners for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts for further consideration, and with a direction that they amend the case stated by finding on further consideration of the evidence already adduced and on consideration of any further evidence the parties may adduce and taking into account any relevant decisions of the German courts and their necessary implications and any other provision of German law (a) whether for the purposes of German municipal law the appellant was deprived of his German citizenship by the decree of November 25, 1941; (b) if the appellant was not deprived of his German citizenship by the said decree whether for the purposes aforesaid he was deprived of German citizenship by the German Nationality Law of July 22, 1913, on being naturalised a British subject on May 24, 1948, and taking into account his oath of allegiance on June 4, 1948; (c) if the appellant was deprived of German citizenship by the said decree or by the said German nationality law at any time prior to the assessment years whether (i) his German citizenship was reinstated or deemed to be reinstated by the constitution of the Federal Republic or by any legislation or judicial decision or under any other provision of German law, or (ii) his German citizenship would have been reinstated at any time before or during the relevant years of assessment if he had applied for German citizenship under article 116 of the Grundgesetz ['Basic Law'] 1949. And it is further ordered, that the said commissioners do report the amended case to this House."&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer v Cattermole [1976] AC 249&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Precedents applied==
In all hearings it was contended on behalf of Oppenheimer that on the authority of ''Rex v Home Secretary, ex parte L.'' [1945] 1 K.B. 7, and ''Lowenthal v Attorney General'' [1948] 1 All E.R. 295, Oppenheimer's purported loss of German citizenship under the decree of 1941 could not be recognised by English courts and that irrespective of German law, under English law he remained a German national after 25 November 1941 on the grounds that English law did not recognise a change of nationality by a decree of a foreign enemy state in wartime, and English law would not give effect, as far as it related to matters in England, to a penal and confiscatory decree of a foreign country.  It was thus a decision based on a mixture of public policy and morality.

==Outcome==
"... the decision turned ultimately upon an issue which the English courts treat as a question of fact, namely the appellant's nationality in German law."&lt;ref&gt;International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol 4, No 24, Oct 1975, page 617. Oppenheimer v. Cattermole - The Curtain Falls; Merrills, J. G. Senior Lecturer in Law, Sheffield University&lt;/ref&gt;

"... the House (of Lords) took the unusual step of remitting the case to the special commissioners for further consideration".&lt;ref&gt;International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol 4, No 24, Oct 1975, page 617. ''Oppenheimer v. Cattermole - The Curtain Falls''; Merrills, J. G. Senior Lecturer in Law, Sheffield University&lt;/ref&gt;

After the special commissioners heard evidence from Dr Cohn and Dr Jacques (with special experience in German law), "The House of Lords final decision was that on the new evidence in relation to German law, and in particular the provisions of Article 116 (2) of the Basic German Law of 1949, as subsequently interpreted by the German courts, Mr. Oppenheimer must be taken to have lost his German nationality in 1949, and since he had not taken the steps open to him under that article to resume his German nationality, he was a British but not a German national during the relevant period, and as such was subject to United Kingdom tax."&lt;ref&gt;International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol 4, No 24, Oct 1975, page 617. Oppenheimer v. Cattermole - The Curtain Falls; Merrills, J. G. Senior Lecturer in Law, Sheffield University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Oppenheimer confirms the English courts' tendency to take their international law from textbooks instead of from the primary sources. Yet there is no shortage of material from which principles of customary international law relating to non-discrimination and deprivation of nationality might be derived. A review by the House of Lords of some of this material would have been welcome, as both a clear demonstration of the grounding of the decision in contemporary ideals and as a contribution to the development of customary international law… The work relied on in Oppenheimer was the second edition of Wolff's ''Private International Law'', published in 1950.''|source=''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', Vol 4, No 24, Oct 1975, page 617. Oppenheimer v. Cattermole - The Curtain Falls; Merrills, J. G. Senior Lecturer in Law, Sheffield University}}

==Some of the key issues==
* When to use English law when it is also necessary to consider foreign municipal law.
* Considering nationality in a time of war (security and the enemy aliens rule).
* Assessing the legitimacy of laws that do not meet peremptory norms of international law.
* Whether it is public policy (from English perspective) to not accept German law, or that the German law of 1941 was "penal and confiscatory".  The public policy being that of wisdom to allow potential enemy aliens to adopt new nationalities in time of war, as they may then be well placed to engage in war in the heart of English territory.,&lt;ref&gt;The Weekly Law Reports, 12 May 1972. Page 1048. Chancery Division. Goulding J.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Making judicial determinations when there is little in precedent as guidance, and when that which is present is contradictory.  Goulding J wrote, "Here I am once more walking in unlighted ways, and have to do the best I can without authoritative guidance."&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 2 All ER 529&lt;/ref&gt;
* The analogy of nationality to property.

'''Sir Peter Frederick Strawson''' [[British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|ɔː|s|ən}}; 23 November 1919&amp;nbsp;– 13 February 2006), usually cited as '''P. F. Strawson''', was an English philosopher.  He was the [[Waynflete Professorship|Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] at the [[University of Oxford]] ([[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]) from 1968 to 1987. Before that, he was appointed as a college lecturer at [[University College, Oxford]], in 1947, and became a tutorial fellow the following year, until 1968. On his retirement in 1987, he returned to the college and continued working there until shortly before his death. His portrait was painted by the artists [[Muli Tang]] and [[Daphne Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bill Sykes, Peter Strawson, George Cawkwell and Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann | first=Daphne | last=Todd | authorlink=Daphne Todd | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/bill-sykes-peter-strawson-george-cawkwell-and-hartmut-pog223892 | work=[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/ Your Paintings] | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | accessdate=23 January 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320075009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/bill-sykes-peter-strawson-george-cawkwell-and-hartmut-pog223892 | archivedate=20 March 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died, the obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that, "Oxford was the world capital of philosophy between 1950 and 1970, and American academics flocked there, rather than the traffic going the other way. That golden age had no greater philosopher than Sir Peter Strawson."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/15/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries ''The Guardian'' – Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201211753/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/15/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |date=1 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Strawson was born in [[Ealing]], west London, and brought up in [[Finchley]], north London, by his parents, both of whom were teachers. He was educated at [[Christ's College, Finchley]], followed by [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].

==Philosophical work==
Strawson first became well known with his article "On Referring" (1950), a criticism of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[theory of descriptions]] (see also [[Definite description]]s) that Russell explained in the famous "[[On Denoting]]" article (1905).

In philosophical methodology, there are (at least) two important and interrelated features of Strawson's work that are worthy of note.&lt;ref&gt;P.F. Strawson, ''Individuals''&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the project of a 'descriptive' metaphysics, and the second is his notion of a shared conceptual scheme, composed of concepts operated in everyday life. In his book ''Individuals'' (1959), Strawson attempts to give a description of various concepts that form an interconnected web, representing (part of) our common, shared, human conceptual scheme. In particular, he examines our conceptions of basic [[particular]]s, and how they are variously brought under general spatio-temporal concepts. What makes this a metaphysical project is that it exhibits, in fine detail, the structural features of our thought about the world, and thus precisely delimits how we, humans, think about reality.

Strawson was made a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1960 and Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1969 to 1970. He was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]], in 1977, for services to philosophy.

==Personal life==
After serving as a captain in the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] during [[World War II]], Strawson married Ann Martin in 1945. They had four children, including the philosopher [[Galen Strawson]]. He lived in Oxford all his adult life and died in hospital on 13 February 2006 after a short illness.  P. F. Strawson was elder brother to [[Major General John Strawson]].

'''Peter Richard Haddow Forrest''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|FAHA}} (born 1948) is an Australian [[philosopher]].

== Early life and education ==
Forrest was born in 1948 in [[Liverpool]], England, and was educated at [[Ampleforth College]]. His undergraduate work was at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], in mathematics, and he gained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree in mathematics from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=75403 P.R.H. Forrest in Mathematics Genealogy Project].&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Australia he gained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in philosophy at the [[University of Tasmania]], then in 1984 a PhD degree at the [[University of Sydney]], where he was influenced by philosophers [[David Stove]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]]. He was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] from 1987 to 2010.

== Academic career ==
In the [[philosophy of religion]], Forrest's books ''God Without the Supernatural'' and ''Developmental Theism'' defend a speculative view of God which resembles traditional [[theism]] in regarding God as an entity beyond the world, having creative powers, but also takes God not to violate natural laws and to develop from a state of pure power to a state of pure love.

In the [[philosophy of time]], Forrest defends the [[growing block universe|growing block]] theory, according to which the present and the past are real, but not the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forrest |first=Peter |year=2004 |title=The Real but Dead Past: A Reply to Braddon-Mitchell |journal=Analysis |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=358–362 |doi=10.1093/analys/64.4.358 |issn=1467-8284 |jstor=3328947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].

He is married, with four children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36015">'''Quantitative structure–activity relationship''' models ('''QSAR''' models)  are [[regression analysis|regression]] or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences and engineering. Like other regression models, QSAR regression models relate a set of "predictor" variables (X) to the potency of the [[response variable]] (Y), while classification QSAR models relate the predictor variables to a categorical value of the response variable.

In QSAR modeling, the predictors consist of physico-chemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals; the QSAR response-variable could be a [[biological activity]] of the chemicals. QSAR models first summarize a supposed relationship between [[chemical structure]]s and [[biological activity]] in a data-set of chemicals.

A QSAR has the form of a [[mathematical model]]:
* Activity = ''f''(physiochemical properties and/or structural properties) + error

The error includes [[model error]] ([[bias of an estimator|bias]]) and observational variability, that is, the variability in observations even on a correct model.

== SAR and the SAR paradox ==

The basic assumption for all molecule based [[hypotheses]] is that similar molecules have similar activities. This principle is also called Structure–Activity Relationship ([[Structure–activity relationship|SAR]]). The underlying problem is therefore how to define a ''small'' difference on a molecular level, since each kind of activity, e.g. [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] ability, [[biotransformation]] ability, [[solubility]], target activity, and so on, might depend on another difference. Good examples were given in the [[bioisosterism]] reviews by Patanie/LaVoie&lt;ref name="pmid11848856"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patani GA, LaVoie EJ | title = Bioisosterism: A Rational Approach in Drug Design | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 3147–3176 | date = Dec 1996 | pmid = 11848856 | doi = 10.1021/cr950066q }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Nathan | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bioisosteres in Medicinal Chemistry | date = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | isbn = 978-3-527-33015-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, one is more interested in finding strong [[Trend estimation|trends]]. Created [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] usually rely on a [[finite set|finite]] number of chemical data. Thus, the [[Induction (philosophy)|induction principle]] should be respected to avoid [[Overfitting|overfitted]] hypotheses and deriving overfitted and useless interpretations on structural/molecular data.

The ''SAR paradox'' refers to the fact that it is not the case that all similar molecules have similar activities.

=== Fragment based (group contribution) ===

Analogously, the "partition coefficient"—a measurement of differential solubility and itself a component of QSAR predictions—can be predicted either by atomic methods (known as "XLogP" or "ALogP") or by [[group contribution method|chemical fragment methods]] (known as "CLogP" and other variations). It has been shown that the [[partition coefficient|logP]] of compound can be determined by the sum of its fragments; fragment-based methods are generally accepted as better predictors than atomic-based methods.&lt;ref name="pmid17597897"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson SJ, Hattotuwagama CK, Holliday JD, Flower DR | title = On the hydrophobicity of peptides: Comparing empirical predictions of peptide log P values | journal = Bioinformation | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 237–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17597897 | pmc = 1891704 | doi = 10.6026/97320630001237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragmentary values have been determined statistically, based on empirical data for known logP values. This method gives mixed results and is generally not trusted to have accuracy of more than ±0.1 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Prediction of physicochemical parameters by atomic contributions |vauthors=Wildman SA, Crippen GM | doi = 10.1021/ci990307l | year = 1999 | journal = J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. | pages = 868–873 | volume = 39 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group or Fragment based QSAR is also known as GQSAR.&lt;ref name="Ajmani_2008"/&gt; GQSAR allows flexibility to study various molecular fragments of interest in relation to the variation in biological response. The molecular fragments could be substituents at various substitution sites in congeneric set of molecules or could be on the basis of pre-defined chemical rules in case of non-congeneric sets.  GQSAR also considers cross-terms fragment descriptors, which could be helpful in identification of key fragment interactions in determining variation of activity.&lt;ref name="Ajmani_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ajmani S, Jadhav K, Kulkarni SA | title = Group-Based QSAR (G-QSAR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lead discovery using Fragnomics is an emerging paradigm. In this context FB-QSAR proves to be a promising strategy for fragment library design and in fragment-to-lead identification endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manoharan P, Vijayan RS, Ghoshal N | title = Rationalizing fragment based drug discovery for BACE1: insights from FB-QSAR, FB-QSSR, multi objective (MO-QSPR) and MIF studies | journal = Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 843–64 | date = Oct 2010 | pmid = 20740315 | doi = 10.1007/s10822-010-9378-9 | bibcode = 2010JCAMD..24..843M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced approach on fragment or group-based QSAR based on the concept of pharmacophore-similarity is developed.&lt;ref name ="Kumar_2013"/&gt; This method, pharmacophore-similarity-based QSAR (PS-QSAR) uses topological pharmacophoric descriptors to develop QSAR models. This activity prediction may assist the contribution of certain pharmacophore features encoded by respective fragments toward activity improvement and/or detrimental effects.&lt;ref name="Kumar_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prasanth Kumar S, Jasrai YT, Pandya HA, Rawal RM | title = Pharmacophore-similarity-based QSAR (PS-QSAR) for group-specific biological activity predictions | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–69 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24266725 | doi = 10.1080/07391102.2013.849618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D-QSAR ===

The acronym '''3D-QSAR''' or '''3-D QSAR''' refers to the application of [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]] calculations requiring three-dimensional structures of a given set of small molecules with known activities (training set). The training set needs to be superimposed (aligned) by either experimental data (e.g. based on ligand-protein [[crystallography]]) or molecule [[superimposition]] software. It uses computed potentials, e.g. the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], rather than experimental constants and is concerned with the overall molecule rather than a single substituent. The first 3-D QSAR was named Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) by Cramer et al. It examined the steric fields (shape of the molecule) and the electrostatic fields&lt;ref name="isbn0-582-38210-6"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Leach AR | title = Molecular modelling: principles and applications | edition = | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J | year = 2001  | pages =  | isbn = 0-582-38210-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were correlated by means of [[partial least squares regression]] (PLS).

The created data space is then usually reduced by a following [[feature extraction]] (see also [[dimensionality reduction]]). The following learning method can be any of the already mentioned [[machine learning]] methods, e.g. [[support vector machine]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-262-19509-7"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Vert JP,  Schölkopf B, Tsuda K | title = Kernel methods in computational biology | edition = | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2004  | isbn = 0-262-19509-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach uses [[multiple-instance learning]] by encoding molecules as sets of data instances, each of which represents a possible molecular conformation. A label or response is assigned to each set corresponding to the activity of the molecule, which is assumed to be determined by at least one instance in the set (i.e. some conformation of the molecule).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dietterich TG, Lathrop RH, Lozano-Pérez T | title = Solving the multiple instance problem with axis-parallel rectangles | journal = Artificial Intelligence | volume = 89 | issue = 1–2 | year = 1997 | pages = 31–71 | doi = 10.1016/S0004-3702(96)00034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2011 the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) patent has dropped any restriction on the use of GRID and partial least-squares (PLS) technologies.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

=== Chemical descriptor based ===

In this approach, descriptors quantifying various electronic, geometric, or steric properties of a molecule are computed and used to develop a QSAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caruthers JM, Lauterbach JA, Thomson KT, Venkatasubramanian V, Snively CM, Bhan A, Katare S, Oskarsdottir G | title = Catalyst design: knowledge extraction from high-throughput experimentation | journal = J. Catal. | year = 2003 | volume = 216 | pages = 3776–3777 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9517(02)00036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is different from the fragment (or group contribution) approach in that the descriptors are computed for the system as whole rather than from the properties of individual fragments. This approach is different from the 3D-QSAR approach in that the descriptors are computed from scalar quantities (e.g., energies, geometric parameters) rather than from 3D fields.

An example of this approach is the QSARs developed for olefin polymerization by [[half sandwich compound]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid17348648"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manz TA, Phomphrai K, Medvedev G, Krishnamurthy BB, Sharma S, Haq J, Novstrup KA, Thomson KT, Delgass WN, Caruthers JM, Abu-Omar MM | title = Structure-activity correlation in titanium single-site olefin polymerization catalysts containing mixed cyclopentadienyl/aryloxide ligation | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 129 | issue = 13 | pages = 3776–7 | date = Apr 2007 | pmid = 17348648 | doi = 10.1021/ja0640849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Organometallics2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manz TA, Caruthers JM, Sharma S, Phomphrai K, Thomson KT, Delgass WN, Abu-Omar MM | title = Structure–Activity Correlation for Relative Chain Initiation to Propagation Rates in Single-Site Olefin Polymerization Catalysis | journal = Organometallics | year = 2012 | volume = 31 | pages = 602–618 | doi = 10.1021/om200884x | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling ==

In the literature it can be often found that chemists have a preference for [[partial least squares]] (PLS) methods,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} since it applies the [[feature extraction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]] in one step.

=== Data mining approach ===

Computer SAR models typically calculate a relatively large number of features. Because those lack structural interpretation ability, the preprocessing steps face a [[feature selection]] problem (i.e., which structural features should be interpreted to determine the structure-activity relationship). Feature selection can be accomplished by visual inspection (qualitative selection by a human); by data mining; or by molecule mining.

A typical [[data mining]] based prediction uses e.g. [[support vector machine]]s, [[decision tree]]s, [[artificial neural network]]s for [[inductive reasoning|inducing]] a predictive learning model.

[[Molecule mining]] approaches, a special case of [[structured data mining]] approaches, apply a similarity matrix based prediction or an automatic fragmentation scheme into molecular substructures. Furthermore, there exist also approaches using [[Maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem|maximum common subgraph]] searches or [[graph kernel]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-58519-8"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gusfield D | title = Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences: computer science and computational biology | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1997 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-521-58519-8 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2397-X"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Helma C | title = Predictive toxicology | edition = | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Washington, DC | year = 2005  | isbn = 0-8247-2397-X | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matched molecular pair analysis===
{{main article|Matched molecular pair analysis}}

Typically QSAR models derived from non linear [[machine learning]] is seen as a "black box", which fails to guide medicinal chemists.

== Evaluation of the quality of QSAR models ==

QSAR modeling produces predictive [[statistical model|model]]s derived from application of statistical tools correlating [[biological activity]] (including desirable therapeutic effect and undesirable side effects) or physico-chemical properties in QSPR models of chemicals (drugs/toxicants/environmental pollutants) with descriptors representative of [[molecular geometry|molecular structure]] or [[molecular property|properties]]. QSARs are being applied in many disciplines, for example: [[risk assessment]], toxicity prediction, and regulatory decisions&lt;ref name="Tong_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong W, Hong H, Xie Q, Shi L, Fang H, Perkins R | title = Assessing QSAR Limitations – A Regulatory Perspective | journal = Current Computer-Aided Drug Design | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 195&amp;ndash;205 |date=April 2005 | pmid =  | doi = 10.2174/1573409053585663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|lead optimization]].&lt;ref name="pmid13677480"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dearden JC | title = In silico prediction of drug toxicity | journal = Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design | volume = 17 | issue = 2-4 | pages = 119–27 | year = 2003 | pmid = 13677480 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025361621494 | bibcode = 2003JCAMD..17..119D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining a good quality QSAR model depends on many factors, such as the quality of input data, the choice of descriptors and statistical methods for modeling and for validation. Any QSAR modeling should ultimately lead to statistically robust and predictive models capable of making accurate and reliable predictions of the modeled response of new compounds.

For validation of QSAR models, usually various strategies are adopted:&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-30044-9"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Wold  S, Eriksson L | editor = Waterbeemd, Han van de | title = Chemometric methods in molecular design | edition = | publisher = VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 1995 | origyear = | pages = 309&amp;ndash;318 | chapter = Statistical validation of QSAR results | quote = | isbn = 3-527-30044-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# internal validation or [[iterative cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] (actually, while extracting data, cross validation is a measure of model robustness, the more a model is robust (higher q2) the less data extraction perturb the original model);
# external validation by splitting the available data set into training set for model development and prediction set for model predictivity check;
# blind external validation by application of model on new external data and
# data randomization or Y-scrambling for verifying the absence of chance correlation between the response and the modeling descriptors.

The success of any QSAR model depends on accuracy of the input data, selection of appropriate descriptors and statistical tools, and most importantly validation of the developed model. Validation is the process by which the reliability and relevance of a procedure are established for a specific purpose; for QSAR models validation must be mainly for robustness, prediction performances and [[applicability domain]] (AD) of the models.&lt;ref name = "Tropsha_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gramatica_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chirico_Gramatica_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy K | title = On some aspects of validation of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship models | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1567–77 | date = Dec 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2.12.1567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some validation methodologies can be problematic. For example, ''leave one-out'' cross-validation generally leads to an overestimation of predictive capacity. Even with external validation, it is difficult to determine whether the selection of training and test sets was manipulated to maximize the predictive capacity of the model being published.

Different aspects of validation of QSAR models that need attention include methods of selection of training set compounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leonard  JT, Roy K | title = On selection of training and test sets for the development of predictive QSAR models | journal = QSAR &amp; Combinatorial Science | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages =  235–251| year = 2006 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1002/qsar.200510161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; setting training set size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy PP, Leonard JT, Roy K | title = Exploring the impact of size of training sets for the development of predictive QSAR models | journal = Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–42 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and impact of variable selection&lt;ref name="pmid17933600"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Put R, Vander Heyden Y | title = Review on modelling aspects in reversed-phase liquid chromatographic quantitative structure-retention relationships | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta | volume = 602 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–72 | date = Oct 2007 | pmid = 17933600 | doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2007.09.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  for training set models for determining the quality of prediction.

== Application ==

=== Chemical ===

One of the first historical QSAR applications was to predict [[boiling point]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-85626-454-7"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Rouvray DH, Bonchev D | title = Chemical graph theory: introduction and fundamentals | edition = | publisher = Abacus Press | location = Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-85626-454-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known for instance that within a particular [[chemical classification|family]] of [[chemical compound]]s, especially of [[organic chemistry]], that there are strong [[correlation]]s between structure and observed properties. A simple example is the relationship between the number of carbons in [[alkanes]] and their [[boiling point]]s. There is a clear trend in the increase of boiling point with an increase in the number carbons, and this serves as a means for predicting the boiling points of [[higher alkanes]].

A still very interesting application is the [[Hammett equation]], [[Taft equation]] and [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa prediction]] methods.&lt;ref name="RMC_2013"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fraczkiewicz | first = R | title = In Silico Prediction of Ionization | encyclopedia = Reference Module in Chemistry, Molecular Sciences and Chemical Engineering [Online] | editor-last = Reedijk | editor-first = J | volume = vol. 5 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-409547-2.02610-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological ===

The biological activity of molecules is usually measured in [[assay]]s to establish the level of inhibition of particular [[signal transduction]] or [[metabolic pathway]]s. [[Drug discovery]] often involves the use of QSAR to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific [[biological target|targets]] and have low [[toxicity]] (non-specific activity).  Of special interest is the prediction of [[partition coefficient]] log ''P'', which is an important measure used in identifying "[[druglikeness]]" according to [[Lipinski's Rule of Five]].

While many quantitative structure activity relationship analyses involve the interactions of a family of molecules with an [[enzyme]] or [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] binding site, QSAR can also be used to study the interactions between the [[structural domain]]s of proteins.

It is part of the [[machine learning]] method to reduce the risk for a SAR paradox, especially taking into account that only a finite amount of data is available (see also [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|MVUE]]). In general, all QSAR problems can be divided into [[Coding (social sciences)|coding]]&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-29913-0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Timmerman H, Todeschini R, Consonni V, Mannhold R, Kubinyi H | title = Handbook of Molecular Descriptors | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2002 | isbn = 3-527-29913-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===

(Q)SAR models have been used for [[risk management]]. QSARS are suggested by regulatory authorities; in the [[European Union]], QSARs are suggested by the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] regulation, where "REACH" abbreviates "Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals".

The chemical descriptor space whose [[convex hull]] is generated by a particular training set of chemicals is called the training set's [[applicability domain]]. Prediction of properties of novel chemicals that are located outside the applicability domain uses [[extrapolation]], and so is less reliable (on average) than prediction within the applicability domain. The assessment of the reliability of QSAR predictions remains a research topic.

The QSAR equations can be used to predict biological activities of newer molecules before their synthesis.

Examples of machine learning tools for QSAR modeling include:&lt;ref name="pmid25448759"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lavecchia A | title = Machine-learning approaches in drug discovery: methods and applications | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–31 | date = Mar 2015 | pmid = 25448759 | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2014.10.012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3123040.v1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radomir Č. Đorđević – Pule''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Радомир Ч. Ђорђевић – Пуле) (born 17 November 1940 in [[Brod (Crna Trava)|Brod]] (Belčine) in [[Crna Trava]]) is a retired professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Belgrade]].

== Biography ==
Đorđević – Pule completed his secondary school in [[Belgrade]], where he also obtained his undergraduate degree in philosophy. After graduation, he was elected assistant at the Institute of Social Sciences before joining academia on 1 October 1965 at the [[:sh:Fizički fakultet Univerziteta u Beogradu|Faculty of Physics in Belgrade]], where he spent his entire working life. Additionally, he taught philosophy at the [[:sh:Deseta beogradska gimnazija|Tenth Grammar School in Belgrade]] (1964), the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy (1971), the Faculty of Philology (1981-1985), the Land Forces Military Academy (1976-1978), the Faculty of Sciences at the University of [[Kragujevac]] (first as a teaching assistant for a short period of time and then, in the late eighties and early nineties as a professor). Aside from the modules Introduction to [[Philosophy]] and the [[Philosophy of Science]], he held a special course of lectures in Philosophy of the Slavs at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of [[Montenegro]] in [[Nikšić]] (2001-2004). He was the head of both the Department of Physics Education Methodology and the Department of History and Philosophy of Physics in the period 1985-2003.&lt;ref&gt;Prirodno-matematički fakultet - 40. godina Prirodno-matematičkog fakulteta u Beogradu, period od 1977. do 1987. godine, Beograd 1989. str. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; During the preparation of his Ph.D. thesis, he went on a study visit to Poland. He completed his Ph.D. at the Faculty of Philosophy in Nis on the topic ''The Role of Hypotheses in Science'' (1980).

[[File:Radomir Djordjevic kongres.jpg|thumb|right|10th Congress of Yugoslavian Physicists&lt;br&gt;[[Vrnjačka Banja]], 27–29 March 2000]]
He participated in numerous national and international philosophical and scientific symposia, conferences and events. He was the founder of Interfaculty Professional Seminars ''Slavica'' (Serbian Cyrillic: Славика), which operated from 1995 to 1999 at the Faculty of Science, and was then the editor of the cycle of events ''Russian Philosophical Thought and the Problems of the Modern World'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Руска философска мисао и проблеми савременог света'') organized at the [http://www.ruskidom.rs/sr/ Russian House] in Belgrade, held for fifteen years. He was a member of the editorial board of journals such as ''The Dialectics'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Дијалектика''), ''The Literature'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Књижевност''), and ''The Young Physicist'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Млади физичар''). Moreover, he was the Vice President of the [http://www.srpskofilozofskodrustvo.org.rs/ Serbian Philosophical Society] in several mandates and today he is a member of the Executive Committee of the aforementioned professional association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srpskofilozofskodrustvo.org.rs/&lt;/ref&gt; He was an associate of [http://www.radiobeograd.rs/ Radio Belgrade] for almost a quarter of a century and long-term associate of other programs of this radio station and certain television stations. He is also a researcher in the field of the history of the Serbian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/200132796/Radomir-Djordjevic-Filosofija-u-Srbiji-u-Prvoj-Polovini-XX-Veka-Panoramski-Pregled&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/200132846/Radomir-Djordjevic-Osvrti-Slobodan-Zunjic-Istorija-Srpske-Filosofije&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his contributions, he received three plaques from the Russian Cultural Centre in Belgrade, a plaque of appreciation from the Serbian Physical Society for contributions to the work of the journal ''The Young Physicist'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Млади физичар''), and two plaques for the contribution to the ''Vlasina Meetings'' (Serbian Cyrillic: ''Власински сусрети''). His bibliographical work in the period 2006-2014 will be published in the appendix of his book ''The Philosophical Debate'' With Responses to the Works of the Author (Serbian Cyrillic: Философске расправе, са одзивима на радове аутора), which is in preparation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5646">'''Richard Crakanthorpe''' (1567–1624) was an English clergyman, remembered both as a logician and as a religious controversialist.
 
His logical works still had currency in the eighteenth century, and there is an allusion in the novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:s: Tristram Shandy/Chapter 1]], as Crackenthorp.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a logician he was conservative, staying close to [[Aristotle]] and the ''[[Organon]]'', and critical of the fashion for [[Ramism]] and its innovations. His ''Logicae'' was a substantial work, and was referred to by [[Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article on Crakanthorpe, pp. 220-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crakanthorpe was, says [[Anthony à Wood]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;a great canonist, and so familiar and exact in the fathers, councils, and schoolmen, that none in his time scarce went before him. None have written with greater diligence, I cannot say with a meeker mind, as some have reported that he was as foul-mouthed against the papists, particularly M. Ant. de Dominis, as Prynne was afterwards against them and the prelatists.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Crakanthorpe, Richard|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==
He was born at or near [[Little Strickland|Strickland]] in [[Westmorland]], and was baptised in 1568 in the nearby village of [[Morland, Cumbria|Morland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6587 ‘Crakanthorpe, Richard (bap. 1568, d. 1624)’] A. P. Cambers. [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004.  Subscrfiption or UK public library membership required [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6587, accessed 2 Feb 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of sixteen was admitted as a student at [[Queen's College, Oxford]]. According to Anthony à Wood he was first a "poor serving child", then a tabardar, and at length in 1598 became a fellow of that college. Crakanthorpe seems to have been much influenced by [[John Rainolds]], and became conspicuous among the Puritan party at Oxford  as a disputant and  preacher. Wood describes him as a "zealot among them", and as having formed a coterie in his college of men of similar opinions, disciples of Rainolds. He was selected to accompany [[Ralph Eure, 3rd Lord Eure]] as his chaplain, with [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]], on a 1602 diplomatic mission to the [[Emperor Rudolph II]] and the [[King of Denmark]].&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Following {{cite DNB|wstitle=Morton, Thomas (1564-1659)|volume=39|no-icon=1}}; the details there are clearer than in the article on Crakanthorpe, where Eure is as Lord Evers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crakanthorpe preached an "Inauguration Sermon" at [[Paul's Cross]] on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603; and became chaplain to [[Thomas Ravis]], [[Bishop of London]], and chaplain in ordinary to the king. He was also admitted, early in 1605, on the presentation of [[Sir John Leverson]], to the rectory of [[Black Notley]], near [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] in [[Essex]]. Sir John had had three sons at Queen's College, and had become acquainted with Crakanthorpe.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1617, succeeding [[John Barkham]], Crakanthorpe was presented to the rectory of [[Paglesham]] by the Bishop of London. He had before this taken his degree of D.D. and been incorporated at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= CRKP612R|name=Crackanthorpe, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Black Notley, and was buried in the chancel of the church there on 25 November 1624. King James, to whom he was well known, said, somewhat unfeelingly, that he died for want of a bishopric.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Works==

His ''Inauguration Sermon'' was  published in 1608. In 1616 he published a treatise in defence of the [[Emperor Justinian]] the emperor, against [[Cardinal Baronius]]. Other works were: ''Introductio in Metaphysicam'', Oxford, 1619; ''Defence of Constantine, with a Treatise of the Pope's Temporal Monarchy'', London 1621; ''Logicae libri quinque de Predicabilibus, Praedicamentis'', London. 1622; ''Tractatus de Providentiâ Dei'', Cambridge, 1622.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

The ''Defensio Ecclesiae Anglicanae'', Crakanthorpe's best-known controversial work, was not published till after his death, when it was given to the world (1625) by his friend John Barkham, who also preached his funeral sermon. [[Marcantonio de Dominis]], the Roman Catholic [[Archbishop of Spalatro]], came to England as a convert to the [[Church of England]], having published his reasons in a book called ''Consilium Profectionis'' (Heidelberg and London 1616). After about six years' residence in England he returned to Rome, and published a retractation (''Consilium Reditus''). A perfect storm of vituperation broke out against him. Crakanthorpe answered in his ''Defensio Ecclesiae'', taking the retractation  sentence by sentence, and pouring out a stream of invective. The first edition was full of errors; it was edited at Oxford in 1847. Several other works written by him of anti-Catholic controversy were published after his death.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5638">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Textual tradition of ''The Tale of Genji''}}
''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' is one of the best-known works of [[classical Japanese literature]], and the number of manuscript copies of it is very large. It was originally written by [[Murasaki Shikibu]], a lady-in-waiting at the [[Heian period|Heian]] court, at the beginning of the eleventh century, but the earliest extant manuscript was copied by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] roughly two centuries later.

== Overview ==
''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' was copied extensively in the pre-modern era.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} The scholar {{illm|Kikan Ikeda|ja|池田亀鑑}} once performed an extensive study of 300 manuscript copies of the work,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} and even counting only manuscripts copied before the end of the [[Muromachi period]] in the mid-16th century the number comes to roughly 100.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

The earliest of these surviving copies, dating from the early [[Kamakura period]],{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} are the ''{{illm|Aobyōshi-bon|ja|青表紙本}}'' produced by [[Fujiwara no Teika]]{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} and the ''{{illm|Kawachi-bon|ja|河内本}}'' produced by [[Minamoto no Mitsuyuki]] and his son [[Minamoto no Chikayuki|Chikayuki]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:源親行|ja]])&lt;/small&gt;.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

== Early copying ==
[[Murasaki Shikibu Nikki|Murasaki's diary]] records that by the winter of 1008 ''Genji'' was already in circulation,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} and so must have already begun to be copied and distributed at this time.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} Because of the circumstances of copying of ''[[monogatari]]'' literature, which were treated as light entertainments for court ladies,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} numerous errors crept into these early copies,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} and as those copies were copied the errors multiplied exponentially.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} Entire chapters began to be added to the work, coming to around 60 chapters rather than the 54 that became the standard.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

=== Kamakura editors ===
Fujiwara no Teika, according to his diary the ''[[Meigetsuki]]'', was robbed on the [[Japanese calendar|16th day of the second month]] of 1225,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} and his copy of ''Genji'' was one of the items that were stolen.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} Teika had apparently been working on editing a "true version" of ''Genji'' (possibly the surviving ''Aobyōshi-bon'') since the eleventh month of the previous year,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} but in his diary he bemoaned the many variations between the various manuscripts in circulation.{{efn|尋求所々、雖見合諸本、猶狼藉未散不審}}{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

Chikayuki, who began his editing of the ''Kawachi-bon'' in 1236,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} similarly wrote of the variations between the manuscripts he had available to him.{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

=== Lost manuscripts ===
The texts that were available to the early Kamakura editors may have included:
*the ''Nijō no Sochi Korefusa-bon'' (二条帥伊房本);{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}
*the ''Reizei no Chūnagon Tomotaka-bon'' (冷泉中納言朝隆本);{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}
*the ''Horikawa no Sadaijin Toshifusa-bon'' (堀川左大臣俊房本);{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}
*the ''{{illm|Ju-Ichi-i Reishi-hon|ja|従一位麗子本源氏物語}}'';{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}
*the ''Hosshōji Kanpaku-bon'' (法性寺関白本);{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}
*the ''Gojō no Sanmi Shunzei-bon'' (五条三位俊成本);{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

and at least thirteen other manuscripts whose names are known,{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}} as well one copy that was supposedly produced by [[Fujiwara no Yukinari]].{{sfnm|1a1=Akiyama|1a2=Abe|1a3=Shinohara|1y=1983|1p=433}}

'''The Audience Engine''' is an [[open-source]], customizable suite of fundraising tools for public radio being developed by the Congera Corporation, a subsidiary of [[WFMU|WFMU Radio]]. It was conceived by and is being developed under the supervision of [[Ken Freedman]], WFMU general manager, and Liz Berg, the station's assistant general manager.

The platform is based on WFMU's own successful model of fundraising and listener-community relations, a project that began development in 1998&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjTWFBNn1rA Video: Ken Freedman's Open Source Marriage of Audio, Music &amp; Radio], The Berkman Center for Internet and Society, May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and now helps WFMU raise 70% of its annual $2.5 million operating budget via its website using crowdfunding technology. The developers explain that "by pairing [[online content]], real-time [[playlist]] information, [[social media]], and community interaction tools directly with [[crowdfunding]] campaigns, WFMU has not only built a positive and intelligent [[online community]], but also a sustainable model that can be adopted by other organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audienceengine.net|title=Audience Engine - An open source toolkit for media and democracy|author=|date=|website=www.audienceengine.net|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides radio, Audience Engine has potential usage for online television and journalism. The goal is to "enable organizations ... to build audiences and become self sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewire.co.uk/news/32186/wfmu-building-open-source-audience-engine "WFMU building open source audience engine,"] ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Flanagan, of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', wrote, "The philosophy underlying Audience Engine's development is the same that's kept WFMU going: experimentation and independence. The tech tumult of the past two decades has resulted in long-established business models, whether [[classified ads]] or subscriptions, being destroyed without any replacements for those models waiting in the wings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6648509/wfmu-wants-to-change-how-media-talks-to-its-audiences-and-raises-money-for Flanagan, Andrew, "WFMU Wants to Change How Media Talks to Its Audiences and Raises Money — For Free," [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], July 29, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman says that Audience Engine can "address the problems of [[Old media|legacy media]] dealing with new media platforms. It's much more difficult for legacy institutions to make that transition."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Flanagan, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of Audience Engine's appeal is its fundraising capabilities. "Audience Engine comes with a set of tools that integrates crowdfunding-inspired donation tools throughout a publisher's site, with on and off-site widgets for donations as well as gift reward management, and a full suite of analytics underlying it all for that publisher to gain insight on what is and isn't raising money," noted Flanagan.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Freedman observed that "[[Kickstarter]] did a great job of borrowing or stealing the concept of the [[pledge drive]], and vastly improved it as well. Public media hasn't borrowed it back yet! That's what we're trying to do."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although aimed primarily towards small and mid-sized stations, larger public radio stations such as [[WBUR]] and [[WNYC]] are exploring the platform's possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.org/2015/11/at-debut-audience-engine-offers-crm-and-pledge-drive-tools/ Kalish, Jon, "At debut, Audience Engine offers CRM and pledge-drive tools,"] Current.org, November 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform was publicly debuted at a launch event held at New York's Civic Hall, on November 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Kalish, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/145630272 Ken Freedman introduces the concept behind Audience Engine at Civic Hall], November 5, 2015 (video)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==

The platform is being built in modular [[Api|API]]s that utilize [[JavaScript]] and [[XML]] feeds, but will include modules that integrate into [[Drupal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drupal.org/node/2224195 Freedman, Ken, "Seeking Software Architect For WFMU's Audience Engine Platform,"] Drupal.org, March 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which is used by many small news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/wfmu-wants-to-build-open-tools-to-help-radio-stations-and-others-raise-money-and-build-community/ Lichterman, Joseph, "WFMU wants to build open tools to help radio stations (and others) raise money and build community,"] NiemanLab, July 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Users could adapt aspects of the system to their own needs and use as many or as few modules as they deem necessary. “We’re trying to make it modular," said Freedman, "so people can just pick and choose and use pieces of it until hopefully they’re comfortable with using the entire thing."&lt;ref&gt;Lichterman, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Audience Engine's philosophy is to retain the listener's or reader's attention on the station website, rather than redirect them to external social media. "Community based radio stations have to start thinking about online platforms that don’t effectively abandon discussion and networking to [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Reddit]], or [[LinkedIn]], and the rest of the usual suspects," said Matthew Lasar at ''Radio Survivor''. "[O]nce your listeners and/or website readers are off to Twitter/Facebook-land, they’re all but gone. They’re not commenting on your [[podcast]] or [[Streaming media|stream]] or blog post in your house. They’re far far away, helping [[Mark Zuckerberg]] bring in that advertisement and audience data cash."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2015/07/30/keeping-your-listeners-with-you-inside-wfmus-audience-engine/ Lasar, Matthew, "Keeping Your Listeners with You: Inside WFMU’s Audience Engine,"] ''Radio Survivor'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

“The problem for the content producer,” said Freedman, “is that when they send their audiences to off-site destinations, these giant [[data mining]] operations skim off critical information that should be the lifeblood of the digital producer – information that should be sustaining the artist or producer, not the big data enterprises.”&lt;ref&gt;Lasar, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman amplified this in a 2018 interview for ''[[Radio World]]'', in which he said, "Digital technology is much more difficult and expensive than traditional broadcasting, with constantly changing platforms, operating systems, and security and privacy considerations. Many [[legacy media]] organizations have opted to utilize large advertising platforms such as Facebook to address this problem, but this is a short-sighted strategy. Radio broadcasters should not send their audiences to third-party platforms, who will mine metrics from those audiences for their own benefit, leaving broadcasters bereft of the metrics that would benefit them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/0002/keeping-up-with-digital-technology-a-challenge-for-small-broadcasters/340977 Vernon, Tom, "Keeping Up With Digital Technology a Challenge for Small Broadcasters,"] ''[[Radio World]]'', January 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Radio World]]'' described the Audience Engine dashboard as featuring "a responsively designed social content page for radio and news sites, engineered for live, positive audience feedback and created with self-sustaining crowdfunding in mind. Both Web and mobile pages have a built-in, interactive second screen, with incentives for positive contributions, and tools for stopping disruptive behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/article/wfmu-keeps-audience-discussions-in-house/277365 Vernon, Tom, "WFMU Keeps Audience Discussions In-House,"] ''Radio World'', October 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The project’s first module, a [[crowdfunding]] [[Application software|app]] called Mynte, is scheduled to launch in 2018.

Besides WFMU, [[early adopters]] of Audience Engine include [[WWOZ]]-FM, a New Orleans-based jazz and blues station; [[WSOU]]-FM ([[Seton Hall University]]), and [[WPRB]]-FM ([[Princeton University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development team==

Early development of Audience Engine was undertaken by [[Bocoup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bocoup.com|title=Web Platform Consulting - Bocoup|author=|date=|website=bocoup.com|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a developer of open-source web technologies which has collaborated with [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Walmart]], [[eBay]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.org/2015/06/wfmus-audience-engine-aims-to-make-public-media-sustainable/ Schneider, Henry, "WFMU’s Audience Engine aims to help make public media sustainable,"] Current.org, June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Bocoup's involvement ended in January 2016, and the project was turned over to a team of independent developers under the supervision of WFMU.

[[WordPress]] developers Joey Dehnert and Andrew Nealon at InsertCulture helped develop the foundation of Audience Engine’s web platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201092536/http://www.insertculture.com:80/|title=InsertCulture - Media Strategy &amp; Research|author=|date=1 February 2013|via=archive.org|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audience Engine has received $500,000 in grant money over several years from the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation]] to undertake development of the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://localnewslab.org/2014/07/15/why-dodge-supports-wfmus-audience-engine-and-what-it-means-for-community-journalism/ de Aguiar, Molly, "Why Dodge Supports WFMU's Audience Engine and What it Means for Community Journalism,"] ''The Local News Lab'', July 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/145638677 Molly DeAguiar of the Dodge Foundation discusses the potential impact of Audience Engine for local journalism, Civic Hall], November 5, 2015 (video)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew expression '''Torat Eretz Yisrael''' (literally "Law of the Land of Israel") refers to all Jewish teachings regarding the ''Land of Israel'' ("Eretz Yisrael"), in particular those written from or conforming to a [[Religious Zionism|religious-Zionist]] point of view.

Such teachings are for example the works of Rabbi [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]], the first religious-Zionist Chief Rabbi of the modern-day State of Israel. Today, it lives on in the works and teachings of rabbis like [[David_Bar-Hayim#Eretz_Yisrael|David Bar-Hayim]], amongst others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2919">[[Image:New Vincenzo Botta picturehistory com prod 4245 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Vincenzo Botta, circa 1860]]
'''Vincenzo Botta''' (November 11, 1818 [[Cavallermaggiore]] - October 5, 1894 [[New York City]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born politician and professor of [[philosophy]], and later, in the [[United States]], of [[Italian language]] and [[Italian literature|literature]].

==Biography==
Botta was educated at the [[University of Turin]], and became professor of philosophy there. In 1849 he was elected to the [[Sardinia]]n parliament, and in 1850 commissioned, in association with Dr. Parola, another deputy, to examine the educational system of [[Germany]]. Their report on the German universities and schools was published at the expense of the government.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Botta, Vincenzo|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, he met [[Anne Lynch Botta|Anne Lynch]], a writer from the [[United States]] then traveling in Europe.&lt;ref name="Botta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picturehistory.com/find/p/4245/mcms.html(image|title=Vincenzo Botta|work=Picture History|accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
