He soon after became a member of [[Al Snow]]'s [[The J.O.B. Squad|J.O.B. Squad]]. In mid-1998, he competed in the WWF's [[WWF Brawl For All|Brawl for All]] tournament, replacing [[Ken Shamrock]].

On June 10, 2005, 2 Cold Scorpio wrestled at the ECW reunion event ''[[Hardcore Homecoming#An Extreme Reunion|Hardcore Homecoming]]'', defeating [[Kid Kash]].&lt;ref name="Canoe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Reviews/2005/12/20/1361661.html|author=Lacroix, C.|title=Have a jolly Hardcore Homecoming Christmas|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=2007-05-16|date=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canoe3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/11/1082775.html|author=Kapur, B.|title=Hardcore Homecoming a memorable night|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=2007-05-16|date=2005-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During a Ring of Honor's ''Straight Shootin'' interview in 2004, Scaggs admitted to hard drug use while he was in ECW and WWF, but it had been significantly accelerated during his stint in WWF due to the fact that he was simply making more money and thus had the opportunity to use more. Scaggs regretted his covert lifestyle at the time, and wondered  that if he had admitted to WWF and himself that he had a problem, his career might have lasted longer in WWF. He also admitted to have kicked his hard drug use several years ago, although still actively using marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodward|first=Buck|title=LOOKING AT ROH'S 'STRAIGHT SHOOTIN' WITH 2 COLD SCORPIO'|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=5778|accessdate=September 26, 2015|publisher=PWInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 14, 2016, Scaggs joined a class action lawsuit against WWE, litigated by Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against them, alleging that "he is suffering from multiple symptoms of repetitive traumatic brain injuries and is undergoing neurological care."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">'''Al-Mahdi Ahmad bin Yahya''' (1363? – 1436) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who briefly held the imamate in 1391–1392.

Ahmad bin Yahya was a 12th-generation descendant of the Zaidi imam [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]] (d. 1012), and was born in either 1363 or 1373.&lt;ref&gt;The filiation was: ad-Da'i Yusuf - al-Qasim - Yahya - Ali - al-Hajjaj - al-Mufaddal - al-Mansur - al-Mufaddal - al-Murtada - Ahmad al-Jawad - al-Murtada - Yahya - al-Mahdi Ahmad.&lt;/ref&gt; He was very well educated and a prolific writer in various subjects. In 1391, the old imam [[al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din]] died, leaving only young offsprings. The [[qadi]] ad-Dawwari temporarily took care of the administration in the Zaidi domains of highland Yemen, in the name of an-Nasir's sons. However, the Zaidi [[ulema]] assembled in the Jamal ad-Din Mosque in [[San'a]] and appointed Ahmad bin Yahya imam under the name al-Mahdi Ahmad. This step was not accepted by ad-Dawwani, who immediately appointed the deceased imam's son [[al-Mansur Ali bin Salah ad-Din]]. Al-Mahdi Ahmad and his followers withdrew from San'a to Bayt Baws, and for one year the two imams fought each other for supremacy. In 1392, al-Mahdi Ahmad was captured by al-Mansur Ali's forces and imprisoned. In 1399 the ex-imam escaped with the help of sympathetic prison guards. He lived a private life until his death from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1436.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. V. Leiden 1986, p. 1241.&lt;/ref&gt; While he lacked the administrative or military skills necessary for a [[Zaydiyyah]] imam, al-Mahdi Ahmad left a considerable amount of writings in [[dogmatics]], [[logic]], [[poetry]], [[grammar]] and [[law]]. For example, he authored a theological-legal encyclopedia, ''Al-Bahr al-zahhar''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschicte der arabischen Litteratur'', Vol I. Leiden 1943, pp. 238-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
'''Battery''' is a criminal [[Offence (law)|offense]] involving the unlawful physical acting upon a threat, distinct from [[assault]] which is the act of creating apprehension of such contact.

Battery is a specific [[common law]] misdemeanor, although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person, and may be a [[misdemeanor]] or a felony, depending on the circumstances. Battery was defined at common law as "any unlawful and or unwanted touching of the person of another by the aggressor, or by a substance put in motion by him."&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{Citation

|pages=117–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, battery is now governed by [[statute]]s, and its severity is determined by the law of the specific jurisdiction.

== Generally ==
Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that:

# an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and
# the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching.

Under the US [[Model Penal Code]] and in some jurisdictions, there is battery when the actor acts recklessly without specific intent of causing an offensive contact. Battery is typically classified as either simple or aggravated. Although battery typically occurs in the context of physical altercations, it may also occur under other circumstances, such as in medical cases where a doctor performs a non-consented medical procedure.

== Specific countries ==
=== Canada ===

Battery is not defined in the Canadian Criminal Code. Instead, the Code has an  offense of assault, and assault causing bodily harm.

=== England and Wales ===
Battery is a [[common law]] offence within England and Wales.

As with the majority of offences in the UK, it has two elements:
* [[Actus Reus]]: The defendant unlawfully touched or applied force to the victim
* [[Mens Rea]]: The defendant [[Intention (criminal law)|intended]] or was [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to the unlawful touch or application of force

This offence is a crime against autonomy, with more violent crimes such as [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|ABH]] and [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]] being punishable under the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]].

As such, even the slightest of touches can amount to an unlawful application of force. However, it is assumed that everyday encounters (such as making contact with others on public transportation) are consented to and not punishable.&lt;ref&gt;Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 ALL ER 374 (QBD)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much confusion can come between the terms 'assault' and 'battery'. While in everyday use the term assault may be used to describe a physical attack, this is indeed a battery. An assault is causing someone to apprehend that you will commit a battery. This issue is so prevalent that the crime of sexual assault&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Offences Act 2003, Section 3 &lt;www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3&gt; accessed 10 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; would be better labelled a sexual battery. This confusion stems from the fact that both assault and battery can be referred to as common assault.

There is no separate offence for a battery relating to domestic violence, however the introduction of the crime of "controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship" in [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/section/76/enacted Section 76] of the [[Serious Crime Act 2015]], has given rise to new sentencing guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overarching Principles: Domestic Abuse|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/6.4143_SC_Domestic_Abuse_Paper_WEB.pdf |publisher=Sentencing Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; that take into account significant aggravating factors such as abuse of trust, resulting in potentially longer sentences for acts of battery within the context of domestic violence.

==== Whether it is a statutory offence ====

In DPP v. Taylor, DPP v. Little,&lt;ref&gt;DPP v. Taylor, DPP v. Little [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 Cr App R 28&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that battery is a statutory offence, contrary to [https://web.archive.org/web/20090907131325/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=2116678 section 39] of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. This decision was criticised in Haystead v. DPP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/181.html |title=Haystead v Chief Constable of Derbyshire [2000&amp;#93; EWHC QB 181 (12 May 2000) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Divisional court expressed the ''[[obiter]]'' opinion that battery remains a common law offence.

Therefore, whilst it may be a better view that battery and assault have statutory penalties, rather than being statutory offences, it is still the case that until review by a higher court, DPP v Little is the preferred authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith &amp; Hogan|title=Criminal Law|year=2008|publisher=OUP|page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mode of trial and sentence ====

In England and Wales, it is a usually tried as a [[summary offence]] under section 39 of [[Criminal Justice Act 1988|The Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. However, where section 40 applies, it can be an additional charge on an [[indictment]].

It is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.

See [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/common_assult/ Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual] for case law on sentencing.

=== Russia ===
There is an offence which could be (loosely) described as battery in Russia. Article 116&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/popular/ukrf/10_24.html#p1236 |title=ПРЕСТУПЛЕНИЯ ПРОТИВ ЖИЗНИ И ЗДОРОВЬЯ - Уголовный кодекс РФ (УК РФ) от 13 June 1996 N 63-ФЗ \ Консультант Плюс |publisher=Consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Russian Criminal Code]] provides that battery or similar violent actions which cause pain are an offence.

=== Scotland ===
There is no distinct offence of battery in [[Scotland]]. The offence of [[Assault#Scotland|assault]] includes acts that could be described as battery.

=== United States ===
In the United States, '''criminal battery''', or simple battery, is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful or offensive contact, including sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] Garner, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[common law]], simple battery is a misdemeanor. The [[prosecutor]] must prove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# an unlawful application of force
# to the person of another
# resulting in either bodily injury or an offensive touching.

The common-law elements serve as a basic template, but individual jurisdictions may alter them, and they may vary slightly from state to state. 

Under modern statutory schemes, battery is often divided into grades that determine the severity of punishment. For example:
* '''Simple battery''' may include ''any'' form of non-consensual harmful or insulting contact, regardless of the injury caused.  Criminal battery requires ''intent'' to inflict an injury on another.
* '''Sexual battery''' may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another. At least in Florida, "Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object": See section 794.011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=794.011  Sexual Battery Unspecified|url=http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/QualifyingOffenses.jsp#1130|website=offender.fdle.state.fl.us/|publisher=Florida Department of Law Enforcement|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Family-violence battery''' may be limited in its scope between persons within a certain degree of relationship: statutes for this offense have been enacted in response to increasing awareness of the problem of [[domestic violence]].
* '''Aggravated battery''' generally is seen as a serious offense of [[felony]] grade. Aggravated battery charges may occur when a battery causes serious bodily injury or permanent disfigurement. As successor to the common law crime of [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], this is sometimes subsumed in the definition of [[assault|aggravated assault]]. In Florida, Aggravated Battery is the ''intentional'' infliction of great bodily harm and is a second degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statute on Aggravated Battery|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.045.html|publisher=Florida Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas battery that ''unintentionally'' causes great bodily harm is considered a third degree felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statute on Felony Battery|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.041.html|publisher=Florida Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kansas ====

In the state of [[Kansas]] battery is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Statutes, Sec. 21-5413. Battery; aggravated battery; battery against certain persons; aggravated battery against certain persons|url=http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/statute/021_000_0000_chapter/021_054_0000_article/021_054_0013_section/021_054_0013_k/|website=Kansas Legislature|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Battery.
:(a) Battery is:
:(1)   Intentionally or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or
:(2)   intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner.

==== Louisiana ====

The law on battery in [[Louisiana]] reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUBPART B. ASSAULT AND BATTERY  (WITH RELATED OFFENSES)|url=http://legis.la.gov/lss/lss.asp?doc=78437|website=legis.la.gov/|publisher=Louisiana State Legislature|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:§&amp;nbsp;33.  Battery defined
:Battery is the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another.

== Jurisdictional differences ==

In some jurisdictions, battery has recently been constructed to include directing bodily secretions (i.e., spitting) at another person without their permission. Some of those jurisdictions automatically elevate such a battery to the charge of aggravated battery. In some jurisdictions, the charge of criminal battery also requires evidence of a mental state (''[[mens rea]]''). The terminology used to refer to a particular offense can also vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as New York, refer to what, under the common law, would be battery as assault, and then use another term for the crime that would have been assault, such as menacing.

== Distinction between battery and assault ==

The [[Actus reus|overt behavior]] of an assault might be Person A advancing upon Person B by chasing after them and swinging a fist toward their head. The overt behavior of battery might be A actually striking B.

Battery requires (1) a volitional act that (2) results in a harmful or offensive contact with another person and (3) is committed for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact or under circumstances that render such contact substantially certain to occur or with a reckless disregard as to whether such contact will result. Assault is an attempted battery or the act of intentionally placing a person in apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact with their person.

In some places, assault is the threat of violence against another while aggravated assault is the threat with the clear and present ability and willingness to carry it out. Likewise, battery is undesired touching of another, while aggravated battery is touching of another with or without a tool or weapon with attempt to harm or restrain.

Blondi stayed with Hitler even after his move into the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' located underneath the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] on 16 January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony | authorlink=Antony Beevor |title=Berlin: The Downfall 1945|publisher=Viking-Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-670-03041-5|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was reportedly very fond of Blondi, keeping her by his side and allowing her to sleep in his bed in the bunker. According to Hitler's secretary [[Traudl Junge]], this affection was not shared by [[Eva Braun]], Hitler's companion, who preferred her two [[Scottish Terrier]] dogs named Negus and Stasi.

Blondi played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Dogs like Blondi were coveted as "{{lang|de|germanische Urhunde}}", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria (2000).

''Hitler: A Biography'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co. pp. 951–952.&lt;/ref&gt; To verify the capsules' potency, Hitler ordered Dr. [[Werner Haase]] to test one on Blondi, who died as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian.

==Other dogs==
During his military service in [[World War I]], Hitler rescued a stray white [[Fox Terrier]] named "Fuchsl". Hitler had great affection for the dog, and, when he was not on duty at the front, he would spend much of his free time playing with the dog in the barracks. Hitler was profoundly distraught when he lost him.&lt;ref name=Hubris&gt;{{cite book | last =Kershaw | first =Ian | authorlink =Ian Kershaw | year=1998 | isbn=0-393-320359 | title=Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris | publisher=Penguin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Giblin, James |author2=Payne, Robert | title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler | year=2000 | publisher=New York, Praeger [1973] | location= | isbn=0-395-90371-8 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been given a German Shepherd before named "Prinz" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |title=Berlin: The Downfall 1945|publisher=Viking-Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-670-03041-5 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also owned a German Shepherd called "Muckl".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=von Schirach, Baldur | authorlink=Baldur von Schirach | title=Ich glaubte an Hitler | year=1967 | publisher=Mosaik Verlag | location= | isbn= | page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Blondi, Hitler had two German Shepherd dogs, a mother [born 1926] and daughter [born ca. 1930] – both named Blonda. In some photos taken during the 1930s the younger Blonda is incorrectly labeled as Blondi&lt;ref name="Abbyk"/&gt; (in most cases photograph descriptions were written later).

In May 1942, Hitler bought another young German Shepherd "from a minor official in the post office in [[Ingolstadt]]"&lt;ref&gt;Goebbels' Diary, 30 May 1942: "'' He [Hitler] has bought himself a young German Shepherd dog called "Blondi" which is the apple of his eye. It was touching listening to him say that he enjoyed walking with this dog so much, because only with it could he be sure that [his companion] would not start talking about the war or politics. One notices time and time again that the Führer is slowly but surely becoming lonely. It is very touching to see him play with this young German Shepherd dog. The animal has grown so accustomed to him that it will hardly take a step without him. It is very nice to watch the Führer with his dog. At the moment the dog is the only living thing that is constantly with him. At night it sleeps at the foot of his bed, it is allowed into his sleeping compartment in the special train and enjoys a number of privileges...that no human would ever dare to claim. He bought the dog from a minor official in the post office in Ingolstadt.''"&lt;/ref&gt; to keep Blondi company. He called her Bella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Irving | first=David John Cawdell | authorlink=David John Cawdell Irving | title=Hitler's war | year=1977 | publisher=Viking Press | location=New York | isbn=0-670-37412-1 | page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Traudl Junge]], Eva Braun was very fond of her two [[Scottish Terrier]] dogs named Negus and Stasi. She usually kept them away from Blondi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Junge | first = Traudl | authorlink = Traudl Junge | year = 2003 | title = [[Until the Final Hour|Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary]] | publisher = [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] | location = London | isbn = 978-0-297-84720-5 | page = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Blondi and other dogs==
During the course of 29 April 1945, Hitler learned of the death of his ally [[Benito Mussolini]] at the hands of [[Italian partisans]]. This, along with the fact the Soviet Red Army was closing in on his location, strengthened Hitler in his resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be captured. That afternoon, Hitler expressed doubts about the cyanide capsules he had received through [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2008). ''Hitler: A Biography'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co. pp. 951–953. {{ISBN|0-393-06757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, Hitler regarded Himmler as a traitor. To verify the capsules' contents, Hitler—who already intended to have Blondi killed so that she did not fall into the hands of the Russians&lt;ref&gt;Gitta Sereny, Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;—ordered Dr. [[Werner Haase]] to test one on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2008). ''Hitler: A Biography'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co. p. 952. {{ISBN|0-393-06757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler became completely inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=O'Donnell | first=James | authorlink=James P. O'Donnell | title=The Bunker: The History of the Reich Chancellery Group | year=1978 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | location=Boston | isbn=0-395-25719-0 | page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report commissioned by [[Joseph Stalin]] and based on eyewitness accounts, Hitler's dog-handler ''[[Feldwebel]]'' [[Fritz Tornow]] took Blondi's pups and shot them in the garden of the bunker complex on 30 April, after Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. He also killed Eva Braun's two dogs, Frau [[Gerda Christian]]'s dogs, and his own [[dachshund]]. Tornow was later captured by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Eberle, Henrik and Uhl, Matthias, ed. (2005). ''The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin'', New York: PublicAffairs, p. 273. {{ISBN|1-58648-366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's nurse, [[Erna Flegel]], said in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Luke. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/02/artsandhumanities.secondworldwar "Hitler's nurse breaks 60 years of silence"], ''The Guardian'', May 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[battle in Berlin]] ended, the remains of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring Wulf) were discovered in a shell crater by a unit of [[SMERSH]], the Soviet counter-intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |title=Berlin: The Downfall 1945|publisher=Viking-Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0670030415|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the autopsy, both dogs were shot and Blondi was killed by poison. Some sources say that Wolf was killed with the other puppies in the Chancellery garden (see {{Cite book | last=Moorhouse | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Moorhouse | title=Killing Hitler: The Plots, The Assassins, and the Dictator Who Cheated Death | year=2007 | publisher=Bantam | location= | isbn=0-553-38255-1 | page=323}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The dog thought to be Blondi was exhumed and photographed by the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Le Tissier, Tony (1992). ''Berlin Then and Now'', After the Battle.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cazador''' was a [[steamboat]] built 1848 in [[France]] and bought 1851 by the [[Chilean Navy]] for the transport of military and cargo along the coast of Chile.

On 30 January 1856 ''Cazador'' sailed off [[Talcahuano]] bound for [[Valparaíso]] at 11:30 AM carrying the 2nd Company of the Battalion ''Maipo'' and their families. In addition, she carried supplies, horses and guns. She sailed 6 miles from the coast at 9 kn.

At 20:00 the ship was driven on reef off Point Carranza, 10&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Constitución, Chile|Constitución]].

The sinking of the ''Cazador'' resulted in the greatest single-incident maritime loss of life in the history of Chile.&lt;ref name="Urrutia2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos López Urrutia|title=Historia de La Marina de Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_539D0ObYwC|date=29 February 2008|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-615-18574-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree on the number rescued and final death toll. The ship's captain, Ramón Cavieses, in his report gives 23 rescued and 307 dead,&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [http://es.scribd.com/doc/105319496/Tragedias-Maritimas-de-Importancia-en-Chile Tragedias marítimas de importancia en Chile], retrieved on 31 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but author Carlos Lopéz Urrutia gives 400 dead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10984">'''Chayben Abou-Nehra''' (1974 – 21 December 2008), also referred to as '''Ben Bou-Nahra''', was a [[Belize]]an businessman. He had a variety of business activities, including as a 10% shareholder in [[Miles Tropical Energy]], which had various petroleum concessions off the coast near [[Dangriga]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20110218"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=10907|first=Adele|last=Ramos|title=Front men, or partners in petroleum?|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2011-02-18|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a controversial figure both in life and in death. Charged with manslaughter after killing a man in September 2005, he absented himself from Belize at a time when the charges were upgraded to murder, returned when the charges were downgraded to manslaughter, and then walked free in 2007 when witnesses against him refused to testify. Late the following year he was found dead in his hotel room of a gunshot wound, in what may have been a suicide.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=7925|first=Rowland A.|last=Parks|title=Abou-Nehra shot dead – post-mortem controversy|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Shawn Copious==

===Shooting and charges===
On 17 September 2005 at roughly 3:30 AM, Abou-Nehra returned to his home in King's Park, [[Belize City]] to find 23-year-old Shawn Copious in his yard.&lt;ref name="News520050915"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/10734|title=Suspected burglar shot dead by King’s Park resident|work=News 5 Belize|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abou-Nehra claims Copious advanced on him in a threatening manner. Abou-Nehra had a licensed [[9mm caliber|9mm]] pistol on his person, which he drew and fired at Copious six times, killing him. Police found a large meat [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] on Copious' person. Copious had previously had numerous run-ins with the law, with a conviction for theft and at the time of his death also standing trial for charges of [[handling stolen goods]]. Abou-Nehra had earlier that year been accused of shooting a man at [[BTL Park]], but no charges were filed in that incident.&lt;ref name="News720050919"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=2221&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Intruder Killed by Businessman; Was it Justified?|work=7 News Belize|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copious' stepfather Lawrence Mejia spoke with Abou-Nehra after Copious' death, and described him as "a really good man" who showed remorse for the killing and offered what help he could to the family, but expressed confusion that his stepson's injuries were not just limited to a gunshot wound but also consisted of broken teeth, hands, and nose.&lt;ref name="News520050915"/&gt;  Abou-Nehra offered [[Belizean dollar|BZ$]]3,000 to Copious' mother Caroline Copious to pay the burial expenses.&lt;ref name="News720050919"/&gt;

Police held Abou-Nehra for 48 hours, but at the time regarded the killing as a [[justifiable homicide|justifiable]] [[use of force]] and did not file charges. However, in July 2006 police charged him with manslaughter; he was represented by attorneys Kareem Musa and Ellis Arnold in his first court appearance, at which his bail was set at BZ$10,000 and he was given a September court date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=4287&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Ben Abou-Nahra Charged for Killing Shawn Copious|work=7 News Belize|date=2006-07-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more detail about the circumstances of Copious' death came to light, specifically the fact that he had been shot in the back from five feet away, then-Senior Crown Counsel [[Cheryl-Lynn Vidal|Cheryl-Lynn Branker-Taitt]] wrote to Criminal Investigations Bureau chief [[Chester Williams (police officer)|Chester Williams]] to recommend that Abou-Nehra be charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=8993|title=DPP Kirk Anderson Wanted To Charge Ben Bou-Nehra For Murder|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, [[Director of Public Prosecutions (Belize)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Kirk Anderson (lawyer)|Kirk Anderson]] instructed Commissioner of Polize [[Gerald Westby]] to charge Abou-Nehra with murder.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5654|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title=Chayben Abou-Nehra indicted for manslaughter in death of Shawn Copius|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-05-15|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time Abou-Nehra had already departed Belize, according to his attorney [[Dickie Bradley]] for purposes of receiving medical care.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070508"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=1403&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Abou-Nehra Murder Charge Dropped to Manslaughter|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then failed to show up for his [[arraignment]] hearing in January 2007, at which the complaint of murder was supposed to have been read. A note purporting to be from a doctor in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] stated that Abou-Nehra was medically incapable of travelling. In May 2007, he was finally indicted on charges of manslaughter rather than murder. He came before Judge [[Troadio Gonzalez]], who ordered that the case be traversed to the following month's court session due to the large backlog of defendants with charges even older than Abou-Nehra's. His bail was set at BZ$10,000.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"/&gt;

===Walks free due to police refusal to testify===
After Anderson stepped down, the new DPP [[Lutchman Sooknandan]] reduced Abou-Nehra's charges back to manslaughter.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"/&gt; In July, Sooknandan had to issue a declaration of ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' because the [[crown counsel]] assigned to the case, Cecil Ramirez, had been suspended from practicing law in 2002 and 2003, leading to a question of whether he could legally work for the Office of the DPP. However, Sooknandan said that Abou-Nehra could be re-arrested on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=7422&amp;frmsrch=1|title=DPP Withdraws Manslaughter Charge Against Abou-Nehra|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abou-Nehra came to trial on manslaughter charges again in October. However, three police officers called as witnesses claimed they could not identify him, and the signed record of the caution statement given to Abou-Nehra went missing. Justice [[Adolph Lucas]] had no choice but to [[jury instructions|direct the jury]] to find Abou-Nehra not guilty of manslaughter. He berated the witnesses as "worthless and wicked", while Sooknandan described the police's conduct as creating "the most shameful miscarriage of justice" he had ever seen. Belizean law prohibits [[double jeopardy]], meaning that there was no possibility of a further trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=7903&amp;frmsrch=1|title=DPP Defends Handling of Abou-Nehra Case|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-07-31|accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6195|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title='Worthless and wicked!'|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, two of the witnesses Darius Ramos and Anthony Poloni, both constables, were charged with perjury and contradicting previous evidence; they pleaded not guilty. The DPP declined to charge the third witness, former Inspector Clement Cacho, who by then had been demoted to sergeant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6216|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title=Constables Darius Ramos, 46, and Anthony Polonio, 45, charged in Chay Abou-Nehra acquittal|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal police tribunal later found that Ramos, Polonio, and Cacho had committed an "Act to the Prejudice of Good Order and Discipline against the Department".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanpedrodaily.com/1-24-08.html|title=Police panel finds three forgetful cops guilty|work=San Pedro Daily|date=2008-01-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacho was reduced in rank and given half-pay, but later filed suit in the [[Supreme Court of Belize|Supreme Court]] against the police department and in 2010 was awarded reinstatement and back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=17656|title=Clement Cacho Is Back|work=7 News Belize|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 2008, Abou-Nehra was on holiday up country in [[Cayo District]] with his fiancée, 22-year-old Evita Bedran, the granddaughter of late hotel magnate [[Escander Bedran]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt; They went to a disco in [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]] a few miles away, where he got into an altercation.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/2991|title=Ben Bou-Nahra dead: Murder or Suicide?|work=News 5 Belize|date=2008-12-22|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His shirt stained with blood, he then returned with Bedran to [[San Ignacio (town)|San Ignacio town]] and went to their hotel, the [[San Ignacio Resort Hotel]] owned by Bedran's family, in order to get a new set of clothes.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=12935|title=Ben Bou-Nahra Killed with a Bullet to the Head. Suicide or Homicide?|work=7 News Belize|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After changing, he got into another altercation, this time with a security guard at the hotel. Another security guard attempted to calm the two, and got himself [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] by Abou-Nehra for his trouble, receiving a laceration to the head requiring four stitches. The two security guards filed a police report against Abou-Nehra, while Abou-Nehra himself returned to his room. By the time police arrived at the hotel, Abou-Nehra was laid out on the floor of his hotel room with a gunshot wound.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;

Abou-Nehra was taken first to San Ignacio's [[Loma Luz Hospital]], and then [[Belize City]]'s [[Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital]], where he was declared dead at 7 AM the following morning. His family expressed suspicion that he would have committed suicide, and requested to have their own [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] observe the autopsy at KNMH. Pathologist [[Mario Estradaban]] declined comment.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt; He was survived by a daughter Madison, as well as his mother Maria and sister Rachelle.&lt;ref name="Amandala20110218"/&gt;

'''Computational sustainability''' is a broad field that attempts to optimize societal, economic, and environmental resources using methods from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computational-sustainability.org/|title=www.computational-sustainability.org|website=www.computational-sustainability.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainability]] in this context is the ability to produce enough energy for the world to support its biological systems.  Using the power of computers to process large quantities of information, decision making algorithms allocate resources based on real-time information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unknown|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf?ip=73.234.206.61&amp;id=1562174&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E6D218144511F3437&amp;CFID=594460368&amp;CFTOKEN=33596010&amp;__acm__=1458873213_60e5758f5509c54d6c6abc8c305ffbc8|doi=10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are widespread. [[Smart grid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s implement renewable resources and storage capabilities to control the production and expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compsust.net/|title=CompSustNet: Home|website=www.compsust.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent transportation system]] analyze road conditions and relay information to drivers so they can make smarter decisions based on real time traffic information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero-ibanez|first=J. A.|last2=Zeadally|first2=S.|last3=Contreras-Castillo|first3=J.|date=2015-12-01|title=Integration challenges of intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicle, cloud computing, and internet of things technologies|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7368833|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=22|issue=6|pages=122–128|doi=10.1109/MWC.2015.7368833|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. [[Data collection]] can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a [[mobile app]], like [[Waze]], to report its whereabouts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44160-2_5|title=Transportation Systems: Monitoring, Control, and Security|last=Timotheou|first=Stelios|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Christos G.|last3=Polycarpou|first3=Marios M.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783662441596|editor-last=Kyriakides|editor-first=Elias|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|pages=125–166|language=en|editor-last2=Polycarpou|editor-first2=Marios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders.  Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their [[smart card]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at stations and online.  APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones.  Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are.  [[Ramp meter]]s regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups.  Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road.  Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers ability to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/shift-to-constant-connectivity.html|title=The Shift to Constant Connectivity|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Maps]] uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/how-google-tracks-traffic/|title=How Google Tracks Traffic|website=www.ncta.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars communicate with their manufacturers to remotely install software updates when new features are added or bugs are being patched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/wireless-updates-to-core-automotive-functions-could-spell-privacy-troubles/|title=Your next car will update itself while you sleep, and maybe watch you too|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tesla Motors]] even uses these updates to increase their cars efficiency and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11378880/Tesla-software-update-did-your-car-just-get-faster.html|title=Tesla software update: did your car just get faster?|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections give ITS a means to accurately collect information and even relay that information to drivers with no other infrastructure needed.

Future ITS systems will aid in car communication with not just the infrastructure, but with other cars as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Utilities ==
The [[electrical grid]] was designed to send consumers electricity from [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] for a monthly fee based on usage. Homeowners are installing [[solar panel]]s and large batteries to store the power created by these panels.  A [[smart grid]] is being created to accommodate the new energy sources.  Rather than just electricity being sent to a household to be consumed by the various appliances in the home, electricity can flow in either direction.  Additional sensors along the grid will improve information collection and decreased downtime during power outages. These sensors can also relay information directly to consumers about how much energy they're using and what the costs will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/fa14-solar-power-on-the-rise.html#.VwbE4hMrKu4|title=Solar Power on the Rise|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynn Marie Messer''' (June 4, 1962 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] woman who was last seen alive during the early hours of July 8, 2014, in the [[Bloomsdale, Missouri]] farmhouse she shared with her husband. Her disappearance generated national news coverage. On November 1, 2016, her remains were found on the edge of the farm where she had lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/medical-examiner-confirms-body-found-in-st-genevieve-county-is/article_e5d5a4a5-7aca-5b7e-bdc1-08334694b92b.html|title=Medical examiner confirms body found in St. Genevieve County is that of Lynn Messer|website=STLtoday.com|date=2016-11-04|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance ==
At approximately 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 8, 2014, Kerry Messer woke up to find that his wife Lynn wasn't in bed beside him.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themissouritimes.com/11550/wife-of-capitol-pro-life-lobbyist-still-not-found/|title=Wife of Capitol lobbyist missing - The Missouri Times|date=2014-07-14|website=The Missouri Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked around the house for her, noticing that Lynn's personal belongings - including her ID, passport, wallet, cell phone, car keys, and the walking boot she used to help protect her broken toe - were all still in the house.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/mystery-missing-missouri-farm-wife|title=Eight Months Later, Mystery of Missing Missouri Farm Wife Continues|website=People.com|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry checked the areas around their farm where Lynn would normally be as well as the gravel pathways and roads leading to their farmhouse, and began checking locations beyond the farm that morning before his son called the sheriff's office.  After 10 months of cooperation and over 40 in-person and telephone visits with law enforcement, they refused to share where they were in the investigation. The last known communication Lynn had with anyone other than her husband Kerry was a phone call she made at 11:30pm on the night of July 7.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailyjournalonline.com/news/local/missing-and-crimes/unsolved-missing/lynn-messer-missing-for-more-than-two-months/article_e50b4ef5-4f72-59f0-9cf8-b7cb3ac3553d.html|title=Lynn Messer missing for more than two months|last=573-518-3617|first=Renee Bronaugh|website=Daily Journal Online|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
Police quickly classified Lynn as an "endangered person," given the fact that she had a broken toe at the time and left without her walking boot, leading police to speculate that she found herself in physical danger. Local police, professional Search and Rescue, K-9 Teams, highway patrol, and the FBI were called in to locate her.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Search dogs picked up a [[Trail pheromone|scent trail]] leading away from the farmhouse on the day Lynn disappeared, but later that day Kerry asked his son Abram to move their herd of cows to a different field, which destroyed the scent trail.&lt;ref name=scent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dailyjournalonline.com/suspicions-run-high-within-the-messer-family/article_2c82dce2-f2f0-5c94-8da8-52e2c6edb87e.html|title=Suspicions run high within the Messer family|first=Renee|last=Bronaugh|date=November 12, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2018|work=Daily Journal Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messer farmhouse was meticulously searched on the first day and on later dates by both local and federal authorities. No evidence indicated any harm or wrongdoing by her husband Kerry, or any indication of a break-in or struggle of any kind, leading police to believe that she hadn't been abducted.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2015/07/07/one-year-later-more-questions-in-case-of-missing-mo-woman/|title=One Year Later: More Questions In Case Of Missing Mo. Woman|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the police nor Kerry believed that Lynn had decided to run away from home; she hadn't taken any personal belongings with her, she appeared to enjoy her marriage and family life, and she had recently been discussing exciting future plans such as holidays and Bible classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/521651/Lynn-Messer-s-sudden-disapearence-similar-Gone-Girl|title=Mystery of the real life Gone Girl|last=Thompson|first=Paul|date=2014-10-11|website=Express.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four days of intensive searching, the local Sheriff said he was convinced that Lynn was not on the farm. The official search was suspended and law enforcement supported the family as they continued searching. One of Lynn's sons and one of her brothers-in-law took over directing volunteer search teams for the next 125 days, expending thousands of man-hours in the search.

It was later revealed that Lynn had left a note prior to her disappearance, but the note's contents have yet to be released to the public. Kerry Messer had provided it to the Sheriff's personnel, but said only that "It was some kind of note of finality, but I don't know what that means and to this day I don't understand it."
He has said also that "the first line was an apology (...). It was an 'I'm sorry to put you through this… I love you from the bottom of my heart.'" Kerry Messer explained that the note reveals "some conflicts she was going through.", although he has not explicitly stated that there was an intention of suicide in the note.&lt;ref name=New&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2016/07/07/new-clues-missing-ste-genevieve-woman/|title=New clues: Missing Ste. Genevieve Woman Lynn Messer|last=Killeen|first=Kevin|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Messer's son, Abram Messer, said that his mother had tried to kill herself one time: "After I asked her several times about it, she said 'I went out to the barn to kill myself, and I shot the cats instead.'" &lt;ref name="New"/&gt;

In the first four days, law enforcement directed the search of the farm and key surrounding areas. From that point, friends and family organized the search parties beyond the farm to try to find Lynn. However, all efforts proved unsuccessful. In the months following Lynn's disappearance, over {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} of land were searched, missing posters were posted in Ste. Genevieve county and its surrounding counties, and a Facebook page was set up in order to try and find her.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Police sorted through tips provided by members of the public, including many possible sightings that proved to be mistaken identity, but none of the tips provided any useful leads.

As hunting season approached, Kerry created a new not-for-profit educational program, "Support The Hurting", urging hunters, hikers, and other outdoor enthusiasts to be on the lookout for anything suspicious in the woods. His new educational approach was to promote a simple three-step approach to report unusual items which hunters and others might typically ignore. The three-step rule is:  "Don't Touch, Document Location, Report to Local Law Enforcement".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

==Discovery of body==
On November 1, 2016, bones were discovered on the Messer Farm about a mile from the house.&lt;ref name=rene&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailyjournalonline.com/news/local/new-details-emerge-on-messer-case/article_e425b16d-f888-508e-9fde-eae312fecfac.html|title=New details emerge on Messer case|first=Renee|last=Bronaugh|work=Daily Journal Online|date=March 24, 2017|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were immediately believed to be the remains of Lynn Messer because of glasses and artificial hips found with them, and shortly afterwards they were positively identified as her by means of dental records.&lt;ref name="Fox2 News story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Held|first=Kevin S.|title=Authorities say skeletal remains belong to missing Ste.

Her remains were examined by Dr. Mary Case. According to Jason Schott, Ste.

[[File:Digimon Mini.jpg|thumb|right|A Digital Monster model (mini Version 2).]]
The '''[[Digimon|Digital Monster]]'''{{ref|JPN|JPN}} is a [[digital pet]] released in 1997 by [[Bandai]]. This pet was a masculine counterpart to the [[Tamagotchi]], which, despite having fans of both genders, was deemed more appropriate for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelmood.com/digimon.htm |title=Digimon Tamagotchi |publisher=Pixelmood |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spawned the [[Digimon]] franchise. It was similar to earlier [[virtual pets]] with the distinctions of being a fighting pet that could connect with others like it.

The original Digital Monster model that released in 1997 sold {{formatnum:14 million}} units worldwide, including {{formatnum:13 million}} in Japan and {{formatnum:1 million}} overseas, up until March 2004.&lt;ref name=new-digimon-for-2005&gt;{{citar web|language=english|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-05-25/new-digimon-for-2005|title=New ''Digimon'' for 2005|data=25 de maio de 2004|publicado=[[Anime News Network]]|acessodata=23 de março de 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, more than {{formatnum:24 million}} Digital Monster units were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bandai Unveils New Digimon Virtual Pets |url=http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives-nov30/ |work=Anime News Service |date=November 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The Digimon game consist of the following functions:
* Checking the pet's status (age, weight, strength, hunger and energy stats)
* Feeding the Digimon. The meat increased the pet's fullness, and the vitamin increased its strength and energy.
* Training the Digimon to lose weight and increase strength.
* Battle mode. Once activated, the owner could link up to another owner's Digimon and begin a battle. 
* Cleaning up the Digimon's droppings. Leaving droppings uncleaned for too long would cause the Digimon to become ill.
* Toggling the light. If the Digimon fell asleep and the light was never turned off, its overall condition (an unviewable stat) would decrease, and its chances of a high-power evolution would decrease.
* Healing the Digimon. If the Digimon got sick or injured in battle, it would have to be fixed before it could battle again.

==Device Operation==
The original Digimon Device has three buttons and one reset button. The buttons are located to the right of the screen. The top "A" button scrolls through the icons and options on the screens. The middle "B" button activates the selected function. The bottom "C" button cancels out whatever is on the screen. Pressing "A" and "C" simultaneously toggles the sound. The reset button could only be pressed with a pen or other sharp object.

==Changes for US market==
When the v-pet was brought to the US, elements such as the "Megalithic Mainframe" were added to soften the concept of death (thus Digimon cannot die, but instead return to a fictional world). Devimon was renamed Darkmon because of censorship and the Japanese-related reference in Monzaemon's name was removed in favor of Teddymon.

==Digimon Pendulums==

===Original Pendulum series===
In 1998, [[Bandai]] released a follow-up virtual pet series known as Pendulums which features higher evolution levels and is the first to introduce the Jogress function which enable combination between certain type of  digimons. The pendulum is used to count the number of times the device has been shaken. Five versions of the Digimon Pendulum were released which is Nature Spirit for version 1, Deep Savers for version 2, Nightmare Soldier for version 3, Wind Guardian for version 4 and finally Metal Empire for version 5. Each of these being followed by a .5 version which contained a slightly-altered character lineup. A Version 0 representing Virus Busters was also later released.

===Pendulum Progress series===
Pendulum Progress was the successor of the original Pendulum series. There are three in total; the Pendulum Progress is an upgrade similar to the Tamagotchi Connection. The character lineup on each is expanded and it retains the pendulum feature that became a series standard; it also has the ability to have the current monster fight a computer monster in battle as opposed to linking up with another device.

===Pendulum X series===
The successor of the Pendulum Progress, the Pendulum X series, was released in 2003. It combined the RPG elements of the Digivice games with the standard pet-raising. Unlike its predecessors, the Pendulum X line was accompanied by a story titled {{nihongo|'''''Digimon Chronicle'''''|デジモンクロニクル|Dejimon Kuronikuru}}, which was told mostly through prose text interspersed with short, non-sequitur six-page manga comics printed in the booklets. There were four "chapters", one sold with each progressive version of the Pendulum X. 

====Plot====
In this storyline, the Digital World is controlled by an intelligent computer named [[Yggdrasil]]. [[Digimon]] have multiplied so much that Yggdrasil is unable to handle the load and the Digital Hazard occurs. This leads to the creation of the "New Digital World", which consists of three layers known as Urd (past), Versandi (present), and Skuld (future). Yggdrasil then lets loose the Project Ark as well as the X Program to eliminate any Digimon it no longer wants. However, some Digimon adapt by obtaining a program called the X-Antibody, which strengthens them, changes their appearances, and immunizes them against the X Program. Yggdrasil sends in the thirteen [[Royal Knights]] to keep order in the Digital World. After that, three human boys, Kouta, Yuuji, and Shinji, find their ways into the Digital World and meet their respective partner Digimon, Dorumon, Ryuudamon and Omnimon X. Kouta and Yuuji resist Yggdrasil and the Royal Knights, while Shinji sides with the computer and the thirteen Digimon.

==Digimon Mini==
The Digimon Mini is modeled similarly to the original pets but at a much smaller size. The character set has been minimized and functions are limited. For example, there is no status screen to view the Digimon's hunger. The player must simply feed it when it is hungry.

The Mini also uses the three-prong connector; it is thus compatible with the Pendulum X, the Digimon Accelerator, and the Digimon iC. The third Mini updates the character roster, expanding the available Digimon from 13 to 18.

==WonderSwan==
Digital Monster Ver. WonderSwan is a Japanese handheld version of the original Digimon pet for the [[WonderSwan]]. It includes all of the original Digimon from the first four virtual pet devices and the first pendulum device. In this game the player can have up to eight different Digimon with them at a time. It has computer-controlled opponents to battle with. The game has the ability to connect to another WonderSwan through a special link cable. It can also hook up to the original pets through a Digimon "dock N rock" connector.

'''''Diplopora oregonensis''''' is a species of algae in the genus ''[[Diplopora]]'' in the family [[Diploporaceae]].  It is a unique species of marine [[Dasycladaceae|dasycladacean]] algae from the [[Triassic]] period.  It was discovered by George Stanley of the University of Montana, with findings published in the 1980s.  It is the oldest known green algae from the United States, dated some 200 million years in age. It was obtained from sands and [[shale]]s of the [[Wallowa Mountains#Geology|Wallowa]] volcanic archipelago, more specifically the [[Hurwal Formation]] in eastern [[Oregon]].  The strata of this formation developed from geologic processing of [[limestone]] deposits.  The deposits were produced along the floors of lagoons of an ancient shallow ocean.&lt;ref name="Oregon fossils"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orr|first1=Elizabeth L.|last2=Orr|first2=William N.|title=Oregon fossils|date=2009|publisher=Oregon State University Press|location=Corvallis|isbn=9780870715730|edition=2nd|pages=7–8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.umt.edu/paleontology/browse.cfm?field=taxonname&amp;value=Diplopora%20oregonensis |title=The University of Montana Paleontology Center|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Erik Flügel |author2=Baba Senowbari-Daryan |author3=George D.

Their discovery by Galileo Galilei supported one bundle of hypotheses concerning the nature of the Solar System, which the papal authorities denied in favour of a different bundle.]]
[[File:Galileantelescope 2.png|thumb|The geometrical optic functioning of the Galilean telescope does not lend itself to the creation of fictitious images. The following illustrations by Galileo accordingly refute one of the two alternative bundles of hypotheses]]

The '''Duhem–Quine thesis''', also called the '''Duhem–Quine problem''', after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], is that it is impossible to test a [[scientific hypothesis]] in isolation, because an [[empirical method|empirical]] test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions (also called ''auxiliary assumptions'' or ''auxiliary hypotheses''). In recent decades the set of associated assumptions supporting a thesis sometimes is called a ''bundle of hypotheses''.

==The substance of the thesis==
The Duhem–Quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Duhem-Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct; for example, that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate. For instance, as evidence against the idea that the [[Earth]] is in motion, some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. Later theories of physics and astronomy, such as [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[relativistic mechanics]] could account for such observations without positing a fixed Earth, and in due course they replaced the static-Earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions.

Although a bundle of hypotheses (i.e. a hypothesis and its background assumptions) ''as a whole'' can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test, the Duhem–Quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle.  One solution to the dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept the background assumptions as true (e.g. explanatory scientific theories together with their respective supporting evidence) we will have rational—albeit nonconclusive—reasons for thinking that the theory under test probably is wrong in at least one respect if the empirical test fails.

==Example from Galilean astronomy== 
The pioneering work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the application of the [[telescope]] to astronomical observation met with rejection from influential sceptics. They denied the truth of his most startling reports, such as that there were [[Galileo Galilei|mountains on the moon]] and [[satellite]]s around Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, Galileo. Sidereus nuncius. 1610. [https://archive.org/details/Sidereusnuncius00Gali]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular some prominent philosophers, most  notoriously [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], refused to look through the telescope, arguing in effect that the instrument might have introduced [[Artifact (error)|artefacts]] producing illusions of mountains or satellites invisible to the unencumbered eye. To neglect such possibilities amounted to [[underdetermination]] in which argument for optical artefacts could be urged as being of merit equal to arguments for observation of new celestial effects, whether the latter were more parsimonious or not. On a similar principle in modern times a prevalent view is that [[Marcello Truzzi#.22Extraordinary claims.22|extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof]].

In the early 17th century the modern version&lt;ref name="Harding1976"/&gt; of the Duhem–Quine thesis had not been formulated, but commonsense objections to such elaborate and ad hoc implicit auxiliary assumptions certainly could be urged. To begin with, the mechanism of the (Galilean) telescopes had been explained in terms of [[geometrical optics]] and the nature of the objects that they imaged was consistent; for example a distant lake would not resemble a tree when seen through a telescope. The behaviour of telescopes on Earth denied any basis for arguing that they could create systematic artefacts in the sky, such as apparent satellites that behaved in the predictable manner of Jovian moons. Evidence also offered no basis to suggest that they could present yet other, more elaborate artefacts, fundamentally different from the satellites, such as Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination. 

In practice of course, the [[Galileo affair|politics and theology]] of the day trumped common sense, but the nature of the controversy was a clear example of how different bundles of (usually implicit) auxiliary assumptions could support mutually inconsistent hypotheses concerning a single topic. In terms of either version of the Duhem–Quine thesis it therefore is necessary to study the defensibility of the auxiliary assumptions together with the primary hypotheses if one is to select the most viable working hypotheses.

==Pierre Duhem==
As popular as the Duhem–Quine thesis may be in [[philosophy of science]], in reality [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] stated very different theses.  Duhem believed that ''only in the field of [[physics]]'' can a single individual hypothesis not be isolated for testing.  He says in no uncertain terms that experimental theory in physics is not the same as in fields like [[physiology]] and certain branches of [[chemistry]]. Also, Duhem's conception of "theoretical group" has its limits, since he states that not all concepts are connected to each other logically. He did not include at all ''a priori'' disciplines such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] within the theoretical groups in physics, since they cannot be tested.

== Willard Van Orman Quine ==
{{See also|Confirmation holism}}
Quine, on the other hand, in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", presents a much stronger version of [[underdetermination]] in science.  His theoretical group embraces ''all'' of human knowledge, including mathematics and logic. He contemplated the entirety of human knowledge as being one unit of empirical significance.   Hence all our knowledge, for Quine, would be [[epistemological]]ly no different from [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Greek gods]], which were posited in order to account for experience.

Quine even believed that logic and mathematics can also be revised in light of experience, and presented [[quantum logic]] as evidence for this.  Years later he retracted this position; in his book ''Philosophy of Logic'', he said that to revise logic would be essentially "changing the subject". In classic logic, connectives are defined according to [[truth value]]s. The connectives in a multi-valued logic, however, have a different meaning than those of classic logic. As for [[quantum]] logic, it is not even a logic based on truth values, so the logical connectives lose the original meaning of classic logic. Quine also notes that [[deviant logic]]s usually lack the simplicity of classic logic, and are not so fruitful.

Others tested how [[organic molecule]]s react when subjected for a prolonged period of time to unfiltered [[Insolation|solar light]].

==Objectives==
EXPOSE has several objectives, specific to each experiments, but all linked to the [[astrobiology]] domain. Their collective objective is to better understand the nature and evolution of [[organic matter]] present in extraterrestrial environments and their potential implications in astrobiology. These experiments mostly study molecules of cometary interest in order to understand the results of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta
mission]], the chemistry of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] ([[Cassini–Huygens]] mission), or the organic chemistry of the Martian environment ([[Mars Science Laboratory]] and [[ExoMars]] project).&lt;ref&gt;[http://popups.ulg.ac.be/0037-9565/index.php?id=4689&amp;file=1 Photochemical studies in low Earth orbit for organic compounds related to small bodies, Titan and Mars. Current and future facilities]. ''Bulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège'', H. Cottin, K. Saiagh, D. Nguyen, T. Berger, et al. Vol. 84, 2014, p. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevance===
With the experiments onboard of the EXPOSE facilities, various aspects of astrobiology were investigated that could not be sufficiently approached by use of laboratory facilities on ground. The chemical set of experiments is designed to reach a better understanding of the role of interstellar, cometary and planetary chemistry in the [[origin of life]]. Comets and meteorites are interpreted as exogenous sources of prebiotic molecules on the early Earth. All data achieved from the astrobiological experiments on both EXPOSE missions will add to the understanding of the origin and [[evolution]] of [[life|life on Earth]] and on the possibility of its distribution in space or origin elsewhere.&lt;ref name='Rabbow'/&gt;

Data obtained from the studies on complex organics of cometary interest will support the interpretation of ''in-situ'' data obtained from the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta mission]] after landing on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014, and samples analyzed by the ''[[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]]'' and ''[[ExoMars]]'' rovers on Mars. Finally the chemical experiments will contribute to the understanding of the chemical processes on Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and possible analogies to the prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth.&lt;ref name='Rabbow'/&gt;

The biology experiments used the full extraterrestrial spectrum of solar UV radiation and suitable cut-off filters to study both, the role of the [[ozone layer]] in protecting our [[biosphere]] and the likelihood of resistant terrestrial microorganisms ([[extremophiles]])  to survive in outer space. The latter studies will provide experimental data to the [[lithopanspermia]] hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Dirk Sep2014"/&gt; and they will provide basic data to [[planetary protection]] issues. To get better insight into the [[Life on Mars#Habitability|habitability of Mars]], one set of samples was exposed to simulated Martian conditions (UV-radiation climate, pressure, atmosphere), with and without a protective cover of simulated [[Martian soil]].&lt;ref name="Dirk Sep2014"/&gt; The biological test samples selected are hardy representatives of various branches of life.&lt;ref name='Rabbow'/&gt;

==General mission description==
There were three EXPOSE experiments completed between 2008 and 2015: '''EXPOSE-E''', '''EXPOSE-R''' and '''EXPOSE-R2'''. &lt;br&gt;
The EXPOSE-E was launched on February 7, 2008 on board the [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] and was mounted on the ISS European module ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'' to the [[European Technology Exposure Facility]] (EuTEF). EXPOSE-R was launched to the ISS on November 26, 2008 from Baikonur in Kazakhstan on board of a [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress capsule]]&lt;!--http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMAVT9WYNF_index_0.html --&gt; and was mounted on the ISS Russian module ''Zevzda''. EXPOSE-R2 was launched

EXPOSE-E provided accommodation in three exposure trays for a variety of astrobiological test samples that were exposed to selected space conditions: either to space vacuum, solar electromagnetic radiation at &gt;110&amp;nbsp;nm and cosmic radiation (trays 1 and 3) or to simulated Martian surface conditions (tray 2). The different experiments consisted in exposing solid molecules, gas mixtures or biological samples to the solar [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation, [[cosmic rays]], [[Vacuum#Outer space|vacuum]] and temperature fluctuations of outer space as the ISS repeatedly passed between areas of direct [[sunlight]] and the cold darkness of Earth's shadow.&lt;ref name='home'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exposure_experiments_installed_outside_International_Space_Station | title = Exposure experiments installed outside International Space Station | accessdate = 2013-07-08 | date = 11 March 2009 | publisher = European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the exposition period, EXPOSE-E was brought back to the ground in September 2009 as part of the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] mission [[STS-128]].  EXPOSE-R was brought back in 2011 by a [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]]. From the landing site in Kazakhstan, the trays were returned via Moscow and distributed to scientists for further analysis in their laboratories.

EXPOSE-R2 was launched on 24 July 2014, exposure was finished on April 2015, and was returned to Earth in early 2016 where it is still undergoing analyses.

;PROCESS
The search for organic molecules at the surface of [[Mars]] is a top priority of Mars exploration space missions. Therefore, a key step in interpretation of future data collected by these missions is to understand the preservation of organic matter in the Martian environment. A 1.5-year exposure to Mars-like surface UV radiation conditions in space resulted in complete degradation of the organic compounds ([[glycine]], [[serine]], [[phthalic acid]], phthalic acid in the presence of a mineral phase, and [[mellitic acid]]). Their half-lives were between 50 and 150 h for Martian surface conditions.&lt;ref name='process'/&gt;

To understand the chemical behavior of organic molecules in the space environment, [[amino acid]]s and a [[dipeptide]] in pure form and embedded in meteorite powder were exposed to space conditions for 18 months; the samples were returned to Earth and analyzed in the laboratory for reactions caused by solar UV and [[cosmic radiation]].  The results show that resistance to irradiation is a function of the chemical nature of the exposed molecules and the wavelengths of the UV light. The most altered compounds were the dipeptide, [[aspartic acid]], and [[aminobutyric acid]]. The most resistant were [[alanine]], [[valine]], [[glycine]], and [[aminoisobutyric acid]]. The results also demonstrate the protective effect of meteorite powder, which reemphasizes the importance of exogenic contribution to the inventory of prebiotic organics on early Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The PROCESS Experiment: Exposure of Amino Acids in the EXPOSE-E Experiment on the International Space Station and in Laboratory Simulations | journal = Astrobiology | date = May 2012 | author1 = M.

Bacterial [[endospore]]s of the highly UV-resistant ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' strain MW01 were exposed to [[low-Earth orbit]] and simulated Martian surface conditions for 559 days.

Spore-forming bacteria are of particular concern in the context of [[planetary protection]] because their tough endospores may withstand certain sterilization procedures as well as the harsh environments of outer space or planetary surfaces. To test their hardiness on a hypothetical mission to Mars, spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' 168 and ''[[Bacillus pumilus]]'' SAFR-032 were exposed for 1.5 years to selected parameters of space.  It was clearly shown that solar extraterrestrial UV radiation (λ ≥110&amp;nbsp;nm) as well as the Martian UV spectrum (λ ≥200&amp;nbsp;nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few survivors were recovered from spores exposed in monolayers. Spores in multilayers survived better by several orders of magnitude. All other environmental parameters encountered did little harm to the spores, which showed about 50% survival or more. The data demonstrate the high chance of survival of spores on a Mars mission, if protected against solar irradiation. These results will have implications for planetary protection considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Resistance of Bacterial Endospores to Outer Space for Planetary Protection Purposes—Experiment PROTECT of the EXPOSE-E Mission | journal = Astrobiology | date = May 2012 | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 445–456| doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0737 | url = http://online.liebertpub.com/action/showMultipleAbstracts?markall=on&amp;articleAction=%2Faction%2FshowMultipleAbstracts&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2012.0831&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0760&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0777&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0743&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0759&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0773&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0755&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0756&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0737&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0739&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0748&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0738&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0772&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0736&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0744&amp;href=%2Ftoc%2Fast%2F12%2F5&amp;title=Astrobiology+%282012%29 | accessdate = 2013-07-09 | bibcode=2012AsBio..12..445H | pmid=22680691 | pmc=3371261 | last1 = Horneck | first1 = G | last2 = Moeller | first2 = R | last3 = Cadet | first3 = J | last4 = Douki | first4 = T | last5 = Mancinelli | first5 = RL | last6 = Nicholson | first6 = WL | last7 = Panitz | first7 = C | last8 = Rabbow | first8 = E | last9 = Rettberg | first9 = P | last10 = Spry | first10 = A | last11 = Stackebrandt | first11 = E | last12 = Vaishampayan | first12 = P | last13 = Venkateswaran | first13 = KJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mutagen]]ic efficiency of space was also studied in spores of ''Bacillus subtilis'' 168.

A comparative protein analysis ([[proteomics]]) of ''[[Bacillus pumilus]]'' SAFR-032 spores indicated that proteins conferring resistant traits ([[superoxide dismutase]]) were present in higher concentration in space-exposed spores when compared to controls. Also, the first-generation cells and spores derived from space-exposed samples exhibited elevated ultraviolet-C resistance when compared with their ground control counterparts.

Cryptoendolithic microbial communities and epilithic lichens have been considered as appropriate candidates for the scenario of [[lithopanspermia]], which proposes a natural interplanetary exchange of organisms by means of rocks that have been impact ejected from their planet of origin. A 1.5 years exposure experiment in space was performed with a variety of rock-colonizing eukaryotic organisms. Selected organisms are known to cope with the environmental extremes of their natural habitats. It was found that some —but not all— of those most robust microbial communities from extremely hostile regions on Earth are also partially resistant to the even more hostile environment of outer space, including high vacuum, temperature fluctuation, the full spectrum of extraterrestrial solar electromagnetic radiation, and cosmic [[ionizing radiation]].

The plausibility that life was imported to Earth from elsewhere was tested by subjecting plant seeds to 1.5 years of exposure to solar UV, solar and galactic cosmic radiation, temperature fluctuations, and space vacuum outside the International Space Station. Of the 2100 exposed wild-type ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' (tobacco) seeds, 23% produced viable plants after being returned to Earth. Germination was delayed in seeds shielded from solar light, yet full survival was attained, which indicates that longer space travel would be possible for seeds embedded in an opaque matrix. The team conclude that a naked, seed-like entity could have survived exposure to solar UV radiation during a hypothetical transfer from Mars to Earth, and even if seeds do not survive, components (e.g., their DNA) might survive transfer over cosmic distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Survival of Plant Seeds, Their UV Screens, and nptII DNA for 18 Months Outside the International Space Station | journal = Astrobiology | date = May 2012 | author1 = David Tepfer | author2 = Andreja Zalar, and Sydney Leach | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 517–528| doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0744 | url = http://online.liebertpub.com/action/showMultipleAbstracts?markall=on&amp;articleAction=%2Faction%2FshowMultipleAbstracts&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2012.0831&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0760&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0777&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0743&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0759&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0773&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0755&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0756&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0737&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0739&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0748&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0738&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0772&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0736&amp;doi=10.1089%2Fast.2011.0744&amp;href=%2Ftoc%2Fast%2F12%2F5&amp;title=Astrobiology+%282012%29 | accessdate = 2013-07-09 | bibcode=2012AsBio..12..517T | pmid=22680697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R3D measured [[ionizing radiation|ionizing]] and [[non-ionizing radiation]] as well as [[cosmic radiation]] reaching the biological samples located on the EXPOSE-E. Due to errors in data transmission or temporary termination of EXPOSE power, not all data could be acquired. Radiation was not constant during the mission. At regular intervals of about 2 months, low or almost no radiation was encountered. The radiation dose during the mission was 1823.98 MJ m−2 for PAR, 269.03 MJ m−2 for UVA, 45.73 MJ m−2 for UVB, or 18.28 MJ m−2 for UVC. Registered sunshine duration during the mission was about 152 days (about 27% of mission time).

==EXPOSE-R==
Expose-R (‘R’ stands for its mounting on the '''R'''ussian module Zvezda) was mounted by Russian cosmonaut's extravehicular activity on March 11, 2009 and the exposure to outer space conditions continued for 682 days until January 21, 2011, when it was brought back to Earth by the last ''Discovery Shuttle'' flight STS 133 on March 9, 2011.  EXPOSE-R was equipped with three trays housing eight experiments and 3 radiation dosimeters. Each tray was loaded with a variety of biological organisms including [[Spermatophyte|plant seeds]] and [[spores]] of [[Endospore|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[fern]]s that were exposed to the harsh space environment for about one and a half years. The ROSE (Response of Organisms to Space Environment) group of experiments are under the coordination of the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) and has been composed of scientists from different European countries, from USA and from Japan.&lt;ref name='Rabbow'/&gt; In its 8 experiments of biological and chemical content, more than 1200 individual samples were exposed to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiations, vacuum, cosmic rays or extreme temperature variations. In their different experiments, the involved scientists are studying the question of life's origin on Earth and the results of their experiments are contributing to different aspects of the [[evolution]] and distribution of life in the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cospar-assembly.org/abstractcd/OLD/COSPAR-10/abstracts/data/pdf/abstracts/F35-0023-10.pdf EXPOSE-R on mission on the ISS].

Pictures acquired during the spacewalk #27 on the final day of exposure indicated that many of the 75 small windows had turned brown. The brown film was clearly a deposit which had precipitated inside the windows during the spaceflight. The appearance of the brown film turned out to depend on two prerequisites: solar irradiation and vacuum.&lt;ref name='contamination'&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FIJA%2FIJA14_01%2FS1473550414000536a.pdf&amp;code=767b1aeb1eea5ce39ea5704c1f57a0b3 |title=Window contamination on Expose-R |authors=R.

The brown film contained hydrocarbons, so an inventory was made of materials contained inside Expose-R that could possibly have delivered the contaminating volatiles.&lt;ref name='contamination'/&gt;

The true chemical identity was not established, but their origin may have been substances added to adhesives, plastics and printed circuit boards.
&lt;ref name='contamination'/&gt;

Since not all the windows developed a contaminating brown film, some experiments were effectively exposed:
*'''AMINO''' 
**Exposure of [[methane]]: It studies the whole chain of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) photo-degradation, as initiated by vacuum and solar ultraviolet irradiation in the [[Atmosphere of Titan]].  Methane consumption leads to the formation of [[Alkane|saturated hydrocarbons]], with no apparent influence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The AMINO experiment: methane photolysis under Solar VUV irradiation on the EXPOSE-R facility of the International Space Station |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=January 2015 |last=Carrasco |first=Nathalie |last2=Cottina |first2=Hervé |last3=Cloix |first3=Mégane |last4=Jérome |first4=Murielle |last5=Bénilana |first5=Yves |volume=14 |issue=Special Issue 1 |pages=79–87 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000238 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FIJA%2FIJA14_01%2FS1473550414000238a.pdf&amp;code=3b95e1680c4eee139a5cdd4ecca8b84c |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-08 |bibcode = 2015IJAsB..14...79C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Exposure of [[aminoacids]]: amino acids and a [[dipeptide]] in pure form and embedded in meteorite powder were exposed to outer space. The results confirm that resistance to irradiation is a function of the chemical nature of the exposed molecules and of the wavelengths of the UV light. They also confirm the protective effect of a coating of meteorite powder. The most altered compounds were the dipeptides and [[aspartic acid]] while the most robust were compounds with a [[Aliphatic compound|hydrocarbon chain]]. The analyses document several products of reactions taking place after UV exposure in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The AMINO experiment: exposure of amino acids in the EXPOSE-R experiment on the International Space Station and in laboratory |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=January 2015 |last=Bertrand |first=Marylène |last2=Chabina |first2=Annie |last3=Colasa |first3=Cyril |last4=Cadènea |first4=Martine |last5=Chaputa |first5=Didier |volume=14 |issue=Special Issue 1 |pages=89–97 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000354 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FIJA%2FIJA14_01%2FS1473550414000354a.pdf&amp;code=d1fe8057c64b17b39ea5e022a6df2e32 |format=PDF  |accessdate=2015-05-08 |bibcode = 2015IJAsB..14...89B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results demonstrate the high inactivating potential of extraterrestrial UV radiation as one of the most harmful factors of space, especially UV at λ&gt;110&amp;nbsp;nm. The UV-induced inactivation is mainly caused by photodamaging of the [[DNA]], as documented by the identification of the spore photoproduct 5,6-dihydro-5(α-thyminyl)thymine. The data disclose the limits of lithopanspermia for spores located in the upper layers of impact-ejected rocks due to access of harmful extraterrestrial solar UV radiation, and confirms its protection when sheltered by meteorite material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The SPORES experiment of the EXPOSE-R mission: ''Bacillus subtilis'' spores in artificial meteorites |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=January 2015 |last=Panitz |first=Corinna |last2=Horneck |first2=Gerda |last3=Rabbow |first3=Elke |last4=Petra Rettberg |first4=Petra |last5=Moeller |first5=Ralf |volume=14 |issue=Special Issue 1 |pages=105–114 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000251 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;pdftype=1&amp;fid=9520646&amp;jid=IJA&amp;volumeId=14&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=9520642 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-08 |bibcode = 2015IJAsB..14..105P }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, spores of the fungus ''[[Trichoderma longibrachiatum]]'' were exposed, and about 30% of the spores in vacuum survived the space travel, if shielded against insolation. However, in most cases no significant decrease was observed for spores exposed in addition to the full spectrum of solar UV irradiation. As the spores were exposed in clusters, the outer layers of spores may have shielded the inner part. The results give some information about the likelihood of lithopanspermia. In addition to the parameters of outer space, time in space seems to be one of the limiting parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Survival of Spores of Trichoderma longibrachiatum in Space: data from the Space Experiment SPORES on EXPOSE-R |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=January 2015 |last=Neuberger |first=Katja |last2=Lux-Endrich |first2=Astrid |last3=Panitz |first3=Corinna |last4=Horneck |first4=Gerda |volume=14 |issue=Special Issue 1 |pages=129–135 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000408 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;pdftype=1&amp;fid=9520651&amp;jid=IJA&amp;volumeId=14&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=9520647 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-09 |bibcode = 2015IJAsB..14..129N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of BIOMEX will be relevant for space-proven biosignature definition and for building a [[biosignature]] data base.
:The secondary scientific objective of BIOMEX is to analyze to what extent selected terrestrial [[extremophile]]s are able to survive in space and to determine which interactions between biological samples and selected minerals (including terrestrial, Moon- and Mars analogs) can be observed under space and Mars-like conditions. BIOMEX contains numerous chambers that are filled with biomolecules and organisms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, lichens and mosses.&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2014"/&gt; The samples will spend up to one and a half years outside the space station, and the organisms will be monitored with temperature sensors and dosimeters, which monitor radiation exposure. Scientists will continuously monitor the survival of the organisms and the stability of important cellular components like membrane lipids, pigments, proteins, and DNA.&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2014"/&gt; These investigations could thus enhance the chances of detecting organic traces of life on Mars.&lt;ref name='de Vera 2012'/&gt; At the completion of the experiment, BIOMEX samples will be returned to Earth for study. BIOMEX is led by Jean-Pierre de Vera, from the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR), together with a team from 27 institutes in 12 countries.

*The second major experiment is called ''Biofilm Organisms Surfing Space'' ('''BOSS''').&lt;ref name='R2'/&gt; The hypothesis to be tested is that "microorganisms grown as biofilms, hence embedded in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances, are more tolerant to space and Martian conditions compared to their planktonic counterparts."&lt;ref name='R2'/&gt; Two of the organisms being exposed are ''[[Deinococcus geothermalis]]'' and ''[[Chroococcidiopsis]]''.

*The light-protective [[carotenoid]] pigments (present in photosynthetic organisms such as plants, algae, cyanobacteria and in some bacteria and archaea) have been classified as high priority targets for [[biosignature]] models on Mars due to their stability and easy identification by [[Raman spectroscopy]]. In this experiment, the light-protective carotenoids in two organisms (''cyanobacterium Nostoc sp.'' and the green alga cf. ''Sphaerocystis sp''.) were still detectable at relatively high levels after being exposed for 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.3697B BIOMEX on EXPOSE-R2: First results on the preservation of Raman biosignatures after space exposure].

'''Francis '''"'''Earl'''"''' Devore''' (December 2, 1889 in [[Macksville, Kansas]] &amp;ndash; November 12, 1928) was an [[United States|American]] [[racecar driver]]. Devore and fellow driver [[Norman Batten]] were aboard the [[SS Vestris|SS ''Vestris'']] when it sank. He is credited with saving the lives of his wife, and Batten's wife. Both Batten and Devore were lost at sea. Reports indicate that Devore was eaten by a shark in the icy waters.

It was created by American sculptor [[Lorado Taft]] in 1909.

==History==
The monument commemorates Dexter Graves, who in 1831 led a group of thirteen families from Ohio to settle in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Lanctot. Barbara, ‘’A Walk Through Graceland Cemetery: A Chicago Architecture Foundation Walking Tour'', A Chicago Architecture Foundation Walking Tour, Chicago, IL, 1992 P. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Graves died in 1844, 75 years before the statue's creation and 16 years before Graceland Cemetery was founded. His body was presumably relocated from its original resting place at the old City Cemetery (the present site of Lincoln Park).&lt;ref name="mysteriouschicago.com"&gt;http://mysteriouschicago.com/the-strange-history-of-eternal-silence-gracelands-statue-of-death/&lt;/ref&gt; The will of Graves' son Henry, who died in 1907, provided $250,000 in funds for the monument and another $40,000 intended to commemorate Henry's favorite race horse, Ike Cook. The Cook monument was to stand alongside a drinking fountain for horses in Washington Park.&lt;ref name="mysteriouschicago.com"/&gt; The horse monument never materialized, despite the construction of a model; instead, in 1920, another Taft piece, ''[[Fountain of Time]]'', was built in its place and features a hooded figure similar to the one in ''Eternal Silence''.&lt;ref name="mysteriouschicago.com"/&gt;

Ada Bartlett Taft's 1946 book ''Lorado Taft; Sculptor and Citizen'' lists ''Eternal Silence'' as one of the artist's most important works.&lt;ref name=nrhp3&gt;Kiefer, et al., pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Images of ''Eternal Silence'' have been used in other artworks, including those by [[Claes Oldenburg]].&lt;ref name=nrhp3/&gt; One [[folklore|folktale]] claims that looking into the eyes of the statue's hooded figure causes the viewer to see a vision of his or her own death.&lt;ref name=bielski/&gt;

The '''fear of ghosts''' in many human [[culture]]s is based on beliefs that some [[ghost]]s may be malevolent towards people and dangerous (within the range of all possible attitudes, including mischievous, benign, indifferent, etc.). It is related to [[fear of the dark]].

The fear of ghosts is sometimes referred to as '''phasmophobia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phasmophobia|title=Phasmophobia. (n.d.). Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition|accessdate=2008-10-21|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and erroneously [[spectrophobia]], the latter being an established term for fear of mirrors and one's own reflections.

==Typical character==
The fear of ghosts is widespread even in post-industrial societies. Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] wrote:&lt;ref name=morris&gt;"God and the Philosophers", edited by [[Thomas V. Morris]] (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-510119-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8KEKhOdzTtgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22fear+of+ghosts%22#PPA39,M1 p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...I am perfectly aware that the fear of ghosts is contrary to science, reason and religion. If I were sentenced to spend a night alone in a graveyard, &lt;...&gt; I should already know that twigs would snap and the wind moan and that there would be half-seen movements in the darkness. And yet, after I had been frog-marched into the [[graveyard]], I should feel a thrill of fear every time one of these things happened..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many traditional accounts, ghosts are often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance, or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or [[doppelgänger]] is a related omen of death.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hole (1950) ''Haunted England'': 13-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fears of ghosts among various cultures==

===Wari'===
[[Wari']], an [[Amazon rainforest]] [[tribe]], believe that the spirits of dead people may appear as scaring [[Ghost|specters]] called ''jima''. The jima is said to grab a person with very strong, cold and poisonous hands and try to pull the person's spirit away.&lt;ref&gt;"Consuming Grief", by Beth A. Conklin ( 2001) {{ISBN|0-292-71236-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qp9nTxZAnboC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=%22fear+of+ghosts%22 p. 161, "Ghost Fears and Dissociation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papuans===
A 19th-century missionary describes the fear of ghosts among [[Papuans]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead", by [[James George Frazer]] (1913), [ p. 305] in [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"That a great fear
of ghosts prevails among the Papuans is intelligible. Even
by day they are reluctant to pass a grave, but nothing
would induce them to do so by night. For the dead
are then roaming about in their search for ''[[Uncaria gambier|gambier]]'' and
[[tobacco]], and they may also sail out to sea in a [[canoe]].
Some of the departed, above all the so-called ''Mambrie'' or
heroes, inspire them with especial fear. In such cases for
some days after the burial you may hear about sunset a
simultaneous and horrible din in all the houses of all the
villages, a yelling, screaming, beating and throwing of sticks;
happily the uproar does not last long: its intention is to
compel the ghost to take himself off: they have given him
all that befits him, namely, a grave, a funeral banquet, and
funeral ornaments; and now they beseech him not to thrust
himself on their observation any more, not to breathe any
sickness upon the survivors, and not to kill them or "fetch"
them, as the Papuans put it."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Japanese===
[[Onryō]] (怨霊) is a  [[Japan]]ese ghost (''[[yurei]]'') who is able to return to the physical world in order to seek [[Revenge|vengeance]]. While male onryō can be found, mainly in [[kabuki]] theatre, the majority are women, powerless in the physical world, they often suffer at the capricious whims of their male lovers. In death they become strong. [[Goryō]] are [[Onryō|vengeance ghosts]] from the [[aristocracy|aristocratic classes]], especially those who have been [[martyred]].

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Ghosts in Malay culture}}

==Literature and arts==
Fear of ghosts, their vengeance and mischief is a common base for a plot in the [[ghost story]] literary genre and in [[ghost movies]].
In cartoons and comics, [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper's]] efforts to make friends is hampered by humans, animals and even inanimate objects irrationally panicking, screaming and running away at the sight of him.  It may be said that the characters Shaggy and Scooby from the TV and movie franchise ''Scooby-Doo'' suffer from phasmophobia, with the added joke that the ghosts they encountered were usually [[criminal]]s masquerading as ghosts, specifically preying on people's phasmophobia as a cover for their criminal activities.

The expedition was undertaken in retaliation for the [[Rover incident]], in which the ''Rover'', an American [[barque|bark]], had been wrecked and its crew massacred by aboriginal [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] warriors in March 1867. A [[United States Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marine]] [[company (military unit)|company]] landed in southern Formosa and attempted to advance into the native village. The natives deployed a significant amount of [[guerrilla warfare]], which they ambushed, skirmished, disengaged and retreated repeatedly. Eventually the Marines ceased their pursuit when their commander was killed, and retreated back to their ship due to fatigue and heat exhaustion. The event is regarded as a failure in United States naval history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greendragonsociety.com/Military_History/Taiwan_Formosa_page.htm http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2010/12/rover-incident-of-1867.html http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2010_12_01_archive.html {{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 23, 1867 |title=Search Results THE PIRATES OF FORMOSA. - Official Reports of the Engagement of The United States Naval Forces with the Savages of the Isle.  |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/08/24/80237849.pdf |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Washington |access-date= }}{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 24, 1867 |title=THE PIRATES OF FORMOSA.; Official Reports of the Engagement of the United States Naval Forces with the Savages of the Isle. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F137B93C6AB1783D85F438684F9 |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date= }}{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 14, 1867 |title=European Intelligence: Garibaldi at Sienna Preparing to March Upon Rome Rumored Resignation of Omar Pasha as Turkish Commander in Crete Adjustment of the Difficulties Between Prussia and Denmark Bombardment of the Island of Formosa by American Ships of War CHINA Conflict Between United States Ships-of-War and the Pirates of the Island of Formosa Mexican Dollars Coined During the Reigh of Maximilian Uncurrent ITALY Garibaldi at Sienna Preparing for the Attack on Rome PRUSSIA Prebable Settlement of the Difficulties Between Prussia and Denmark CANDIA Rumored Resignation of Omar Pasha as Commander of the Turkish Forces Who Case of the Ship Anna Kimball Satisfactorily Settied IRELAND Sentence of the Fenian Capt.

==Background==
{{main|Rover incident}}
[[File:USS Hartford painting.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An 1864 painting of {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}}.]]
On 12 March 1867, the United States [[cargo ship|merchantman]] ''Rover'' was sailing off [[Oluanpi]], [[Formosa]] when she wrecked on an uncharted reef and began drifting out to sea. Her crew of over two dozen safely made it ashore but were attacked and killed by the Paiwanans. The [[Royal Navy]] ship {{HMS|Cormorant||6}} reached the "Koalut country" on March 26,{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=115}} discovered the fate of the ''Rover'' and informed the American [[East India Squadron|East India Station]]. Squadron commander [[Rear Admiral]] [[Henry H. Bell]] ordered [[Commander]] [[John Carson Febiger|John C. Febiger]] in the newly commissioned [[gunboat]] {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}} to proceed from [[Foochow]] to the island for an investigation of the incident.

Upon arrival [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] authorities assured Commander Febiger that the attack was carried out by warriors of a village that did not practice respect of the nation's laws. With this information, ''Ashuelot'' returned and notified Rear Admiral Bell. The American consul to Amoy, [[Charles William Le Gendre|C. W. Le Gendre]], had spent the month of April trying to establish communication with the tribes but the Koaluts remained hostile.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}}

At this point, diplomatic pressure proved a failure. After a delay of three months and "a good deal of red tapeism in Washington", a punitive expedition was decided on.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}} Bell, with the [[screw sloop|screw]] [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Wyoming|1859|2}} and his [[flagship]] {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}} left [[Shanghai]] in June for southern Formosa.

==Expedition==
The passing from Shanghai to Formosa was uneventful, the two Americans warships arriving off the southeastern coast on 13 June 1867. The sloops anchored a half-mile off the shore and made preparations for landing. A total of 181 officers, sailors and marines were landed by boat. They were commanded by Commander [[George Belknap|George E. Belknap]] of ''Hartford'' and seconded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]]. When on land the company was broken up into two forces, one commanded by Belknap and the other by Mackenzie. Captain [[James Forney]] directed the marines, twenty of whom were deployed as skirmishers in the front of the columns. Their objective was to defeat the aboriginals decisively and to capture their village. Formosa is a [[tropical]] island, very hot and humid in the summer, with mountainous jungle on the east and plains in the west. This made the march through the jungle difficult for the Americans who wore heavy uniforms designed for keeping men warm at sea.
[[File:Henry H Bell.jpg|righ|150px|thumb|''Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell'']]

After marching for nearly an hour, the Formosans attacked with [[musket]]s from concealed positions on top of a hill directly in front of the American columns. Though difficult to see, the U.S. expedition later reported that the Formosan warriors wore colorful [[face paint]] and were armed with spears and some firearms. Lieutenant MacKenzie's force engaged first by immediately charging the Formosan ambush but the natives fled before the Americans had time to climb the hill. The expedition continued further and was ambushed again so once more the Americans charged and captured the position but without inflicting losses on the enemy. As the expedition continued on to the village, the Formosans ambushed the Americans several times but did not actually hit them.

It was not until the last action that the first and only American casualty was sustained: the warriors fired a volley and a musket ball hit Lieutenant Mackenzie, mortally wounding him. After the volley the Formosans retreated again but the Americans chose not to pursue. By this time, after six hours of marching, several men had either grown delirious or passed out from the heat so the expedition returned to the ship.

==Aftermath==
When they arrived back at shore, the sailors and marines boarded their ships and then sailed back to China having failed to complete their objectives. Formosan casualties were minimal if any; no bodies were found by the Americans.

Admiral Bell and other American officers stated in their reports that the only way to make the region safe would be to drive out the natives and put the area under control of a powerful ally.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}} American diplomat [[Charles Le Gendre|C.W. Le Gendre]] persuaded [[Governor General]] Liu of Foochow to send his own expedition to Formosa. He also requested that Rear Admiral Bell send a gunboat in support of the operation but this was denied. Le Gendre took command of the Chinese troops and left Foochow for southern Formosa on 25 July 1867. In September, Le Gendre arrived at Taiwanfu (the capital city, modern-day [[Tainan]]) to announce the object of his visit and take delivery of the Amoy viceroy's promises of assistance. According to his report,{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=117-122|ps=: reproduction of Le Gendre's report}} Le Gendre marched to the tribal capital and negotiated a treaty ([[:zh:南岬之盟|南岬之盟]]) with Chief [[Tauketok]] (also Tokitok; [[:zh:卓杞篤|卓杞篤]]) to assure the safe conduct of shipwrecked sailors throughout the Paiwan chiefdom.

Attacks on wrecked merchant ships by Formosan natives did however continue. The [[Mudan Incident of 1871]], where 54 shipwrecked [[Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyūan]] sailors were captured and beheaded at the southeastern tip of Formosa, resulted in the [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874]] in which the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military campaigned against the Paiwanans. The Japanese succeeded in engaging the Paiwanan warriors in battle and received compensation from the Qing government for the massacre. From late 1867-early 1868, Bell was appointed commander of the new [[Asiatic Squadron]] and while supporting the [[Opening of Japan]], he anchored off [[Osaka]] to increase pressure on the Japanese government to open [[Hyogo]] on 1 January 1868 as previously scheduled. On 11 January, in attempts to force the Japanese at [[Kobe]] to comply with American merchant trade, rear-Admiral Bell was killed along with all but three of the men after their vessel was overturned.

: ''See also [[Halifax gibbet]], a kind of guillotine.''
[[File:Gallows at Caxton Gibbet.jpg|thumb|The reconstructed [[gallows]]-style gibbet at [[Caxton Gibbet]], in [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]]]]
A '''gibbet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|b|ɪ|t}} is any instrument of public execution (including [[guillotine]], [[decapitation|executioner's block]], [[Impalement|impalement stake]], [[gallows|hanging gallows]], or related [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]]), but '''gibbeting''' refers to the use of a gallows-type structure from which the dead or dying bodies of criminals were hung on public display to deter other existing or potential criminals. Occasionally the gibbet was also used as a method of execution, with the criminal being left to die of exposure, thirst and/or starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Pettifer|first=Ernest|title=Punishments of Former Days|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Winchester|year=1992|isbn=978-1-8-72870-05-2|page= 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''gibbet'' may also be used to refer to the practice of placing a criminal on display within a gibbet.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Ed., Oxford University. Electronic CD edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is also called "hanging in chains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/gibbeting.htm |last=Gallagher |first=Rob |title=Gibbeting |accessdate=2 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122104241/http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/gibbeting.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanging of William Kidd.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], who was tried and executed for piracy, hanging in chains]]
[[File:Fomfr cage.jpg|thumb|upright|A gibbet with a [[Mannequin|dummy]] inside]]

Gibbeting was a [[common law]] punishment, which a judge could impose in addition to execution. This practice was regularised in England by the [[Murder Act 1751]], which empowered judges to impose this for murder. It was most often used for [[traitor]]s, [[murderer]]s, [[highwayman|highwaymen]], [[pirates]], and sheep stealers and was intended to discourage others from committing similar offences. The structures were therefore often placed next to public highways (frequently at crossroads) and waterways.

Exhibiting a body could backfire against a monarch, especially if the monarch was unpopular. The rebels Henry of Montfort and Henry of Wylynton, enemies of [[Edward II]], were [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn]] and hanged before being exhibited on a gibbet near [[Bristol]]. However, the people made relics of these bloody and mutilated remains out of respect and later used the relics in violent protest. Miracles were even reported at the spot where the bodies were hanging.&lt;ref name="Jusserland"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jusserland | first = J. J. | year = 1891 | title = English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages | publisher = T. Fisher Unwin | location = London | pages = 342–343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the intention was deterrence, the public response was complex. [[Samuel Pepys]] expressed disgust at the practice. There was Christian objection that prosecution of criminals should end with their death. The sight and smell of decaying corpses was offensive and regarded as "pestilential", so it was seen as a threat to public health.

[[Pirate]]s were sometimes executed by hanging on a gibbet erected close to the low-water mark by the sea or a tidal section of a river. Their bodies would be left dangling until they had been submerged by the tide three times. In [[London]], [[Execution Dock]] is located on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in [[Wapping]]; after tidal immersion, particularly notorious criminals' bodies could be hung in cages a little farther downstream at either [[Cuckold's Point]] or [[Greenwich peninsula|Blackwall Point]], as a warning to other waterborne criminals of the possible consequences of their actions (such a fate befell Captain [[William Kidd]] in May 1701). There were objections that these displays offended foreign visitors and did not uphold the reputation of the law, though the scenes even became gruesome tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Hanging in Chains By Albert Hartshorne, pp. 73–75, {{ISBN|0-554-81481-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-554-81481-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variants ===
In some cases, the bodies would be left until their clothes rotted or even until the bodies were almost completely decomposed, after which the bones would be scattered.

In cases of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], the body of the criminal was cut into four or five portions, with the several parts often gibbeted in different places.

[[File:Corciano-door-tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Hanging cage at the main gate to [[Corciano]], [[Province of Perugia]], Italy]]
So that the public display might be prolonged, bodies were sometimes coated in [[tar]] or bound in chains. Sometimes, body-shaped iron cages were used to contain the decomposing corpses. For example, in March&amp;nbsp;1743 in the town of [[Rye, East Sussex]], Allen Grebell was murdered by John Breads. Breads was imprisoned in the Ypres Tower and then hanged, after which his body was left to rot for more than 20&amp;nbsp;years in an iron cage on Gibbet Marsh. The cage and Breads' [[human skull|skull]] are still kept in the town hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeakeshouse.com/Rye_Area_and_Tourist_Information.htm |title=Rye area and tourist information |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112035918/http://www.jeakeshouse.com/Rye_Area_and_Tourist_Information.htm |archive-date=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the cage variation is the gibbet iron, on display at the [[Atwater Kent Museum of Philadelphia|Atwater Kent Museum]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. {{anchor|ThosWilkinson}}The cage, created in 1781, was intended to be used to display the body of convicted pirate Thomas Wilkinson, so that sailors on passing ships might be warned of the consequences of piracy; Wilkinson's planned execution never took place, so the gibbet was never used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sellin, T. |year=1955 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4343&amp;context=jclc |title=The Philadelphia Gibbet Iron |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=11–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an iron cage used to string up bodies on a gibbet can still be seen in the Westgate Museum at [[Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.southernlife.org.uk/|magazine=Southern Life |title=Latest News around the World |accessdate=21 March 2018 |location=Winchester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical examples ==

=== Antiquity ===
The [[Old Testament]] ([[Torah]]) law forbids gibbeting beyond sundown of the day that the body is hanged on the tree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] 21:22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Public [[crucifixion]] with prolonged display of the body after death can be seen as a form of gibbeting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger]], Dialogue, Ad Marciam, De consolatione, 6.20.3&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbeting was one of the methods said by [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]] to have been used by [[Boudica]]'s army in the massacre of [[Roman Britain|Roman settlers]] in the destruction of [[Camulodunum]] (Colchester), [[Londinium]] (London) and [[Verulamium]] (St. Albans) in AD 60–61.

=== Bermuda ===
Being a seafaring nation in the 17th and 18th centuries, [[Bermuda]] inherited many of the same customs as England, including the gibbet. Located in [[Smith's Parish, Bermuda|Smith's Parish]] at the entrance to Flatt's Inlet is [[Gibbet Island, Bermuda|Gibbet Island]], which was used to hang the bodies of escaped slaves as a deterrent to others. The small island was used for this purpose because it was not on the mainland and therefore satisfied the superstitious beliefs of locals who did not want gibbets near their homes.

=== Canada ===
[[File:Gibbet of La Corriveau (NYPL) (cropped-2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|The gibbet in which [[Marie-Josephte Corriveau|Corriveau]] was exhibited after her execution, the "cage" of La Corriveau|alt=gibbet]]
[[Marie-Josephte Corriveau]] (1733–1763), better known as "La Corriveau", is one of the most popular figures in Québécois folklore. She lived in New France, was sentenced to death by a British court martial for the murder of her second husband, and was hanged for it, and her body was hung in chains. Her story has become legendary in [[Quebec]], and she is the subject of numerous books and plays.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy used Hangman's Beach on McNab's Island in Halifax Harbour to display the hanged bodies of deserters, in order to deter the crews of passing warships.

=== Colony of New South Wales ===
A rocky outcrop not far into [[Port Jackson]] - originally called Mat-te-wan-ye in the local [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal language]], later renamed Rock Island by Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] but today known as Pinchgut Island, and the location of [[Fort Denison]] - was a gibbeting site. It took its name after a convict Thomas Hill was sentenced to a week on the rock in iron chains sustained by only bread and water; the conditions literally pinched his gut, hence the name. The rock was levelled in the 1790s, and a gibbet installed in 1796. Francis Morgan, transported for life to New South Wales after being convicted of murder in 1793, killed again in 1796 and was hung in chains on Pinchgut in November 1796. His dead body, later a skeleton, remained on display on the island for four years.&lt;ref name="Smith-27Oct2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Tom |title=This Island off the Coast of Sydney Holds a Terrifying Secret |url=https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/australia/articles/this-island-off-the-coast-of-sydney-holds-a-terrifying-secret/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Culture Trip |date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hinrichtung Joseph Süss 2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Execution of Joseph Süss]]
The body of [[Oliver Cromwell]] was gibbeted after his death, after monarchists disinterred it during the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/BitsandPieces.htm|title=Bits and Pieces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]], who led the rebellion against [[Henry VIII]] known as [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], was hanged in chains in 1537.

=== Germany ===
The leaders of the [[Anabaptist]] movement in [[Münster Rebellion|Münster]] were executed in 1536, and their dead bodies were gibbeted in iron cages hanging from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church, and the cages are still on display there today. Similarly, following his execution by hanging in 1738, the corpse of Jewish [[financier]] [[Joseph Süß Oppenheimer]] was gibbeted in a human-sized bird cage that hung outside of [[Stuttgart]] on the so-called Pragsattel (the public execution place at the time) for six years, until the inauguration of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]], who permitted the hasty burial of his corpse at an unknown location.

=== Iran ===
In 838, [[Babak Khorramdin]] had his hands and feet cut off and was then gibbeted alive while sewn into a cow's skin with the horns at ear level to crush his head gradually as the skin dried out.&lt;ref&gt;''The golden age of Islam'' by Maurice Lombard, p. 152, {{ISBN|1-55876-322-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55876-322-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
On 4 February 1820 six British pirates were hanged on their vessel in the middle of the harbour at [[Valetta]]. Thereafter their bodies were hung in gibbets erected at the bastions of [[Fort Ricolli]]. Lieutenant Hobson of {{HMS|Spey|1814|6}}, in the [[ship's tender|tender]] ''Frederick'', had apprehended them and their vessel in the harbour at Smyrna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=upenn_main&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS51922275&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "Ship News."

=== United States ===
While still under British rule [[Bird Island (Massachusetts)|Bird Island]] and [[Nix's Mate]] island in [[Boston Harbor]] were used for gibbeting pirates and sailors executed for crimes in Massachusetts. Their bodies were left hanging as a warning to sailors coming into the harbor and approaching Boston.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Day Life in the Massachusetts Bay Colony'' by George Francis Dow&lt;/ref&gt; About 1755 a slave named [[Mark Codman|Mark]] was hanged and gibbeted in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]]; twenty years later [[Paul Revere]] passed the remains of Mark on his famous ride.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeLombard |first1=Jeannine Marie | last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=In the Shadow of the Gallows: Race, Crime, and American Civic Identity |url= |location= |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=81 |isbn=978-0812206333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence, a gang of Cuban pirates was gibbeted in New York ca. 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional series of United States public documents, vol. 936. 35th Congress, 1st session. Misc. doc. #207., Memorial of Lawrence Kearney..., Pg. 3. Published 2012 by US Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last recorded gibbetings ==

=== Afghanistan ===
The January 1921 issue of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' contains two photographs of gibbet cages, referenced as "man-cages," in use in Afghanistan. Commentary included with the photograph indicates that the gibbet was a practice still in active use. Persons sentenced to death were placed alive in the cage and remained there until some undefined time weeks or months after their deaths. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpich |first1=Frederick |title=Every-day Life in Afghanistan |journal=The National Geographic Magazine |date=January 1921 |volume=XXXIX|issue=1 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqo7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In 1837, five years after the practice had ceased in England, the body of John McKay was gibbeted near the spot where he had murdered Joseph Wilson near [[Perth, Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.mq.edu.au/sctas/html/1837cases/RvMcKay,1837.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035000/http://www.law.mq.edu.au/sctas/html/1837cases/RvMcKay,1837.htm |date=21 August 2011 |title=Archived }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of Wilson passed the spot and, horrified by the spectacle of McKay's rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it. The place where this occurred was just to the right (when travelling towards Launceston, not to be confused with the private road with the same name) on the Midlands Highway on the northern side of Perth. It is the last case of gibbetting in a British colony.

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:Combe jibbet jan 7 2007 128.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Combe Gibbet]], a replica gibbet in [[Berkshire]]]]
The [[Murder Act 1751]] stipulated that "in no case whatsoever shall the body of any murderer be suffered to be buried";&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Dr D. R. Johnson, [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy1.html Introductory Anatomy], Centre for Human Biology, (now renamed [http://www.fbs.leeds.ac.uk/ Faculty of Biological Sciences], [[Leeds University]]), Retrieved 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the cadaver was either to be publicly dissected or left "hanging in chains".&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; The use of gibbeting had been in decline for some years before it was formally repealed by statute in 1834. In Scotland, the final case of gibbeting was that of Alexander Gillan in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bennet|first=Rachel|title=Gibbeting Alexander Gillan|publisher=Leicester University|series=Harnessing the power of the criminal corpse|url=http://www.criminalcorpses.com/case-alexander-gillan}} Retrieved 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The last two men gibbeted in England were William Jobling and James Cook, both in 1832. Their cases are good examples of the changing attitudes toward the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gatrell|first=V A C|title=The Hanging Tree: Execution and the English People, 1770-1868|pages=268–269|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-285332-5|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Jobling was a miner hanged and gibbeted for the murder of Nicholas Fairles, a [[colliery]] owner and local [[magistrate]], near [[Jarrow]], [[Durham, England|Durham]]. After being hanged, the body was taken off the rope and loaded into a cart and taken on a tour of the area before arriving at Jarrow Slake, where the crime had been committed. Here, the body was placed into an iron gibbet cage. The cage and the scene were described thus:

{{quotation|The body was encased in flat bars of iron of two and a half inches in breadth, the feet were placed in stirrups, from which a bar of iron went up each side of the head, and ended in a ring by which he was suspended; a bar from the collar went down the breast, and another down the back, there were also bars in the inside of the legs which communicated with the above; and crossbars at the ankles, the knees, the thighs, the bowels the breast and the shoulders; the hands were hung by the side and covered with pitch, the face was pitched and covered with a piece of white cloth.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The gibbet was a foot in diameter with strong bars of iron up each side. The post was fixed into a one-and-a-half-ton stone base sunk into the Slake.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/durham.html |title=Durham prison |publisher=Capitalpunishmentuk.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was soon removed by fellow miners and given a decent burial.

James Cook was a bookbinder convicted of the murder of his creditor Paas, a manufacturer of brass instruments, in [[Leicester]]. He was executed on Friday, 10 August 1832, in front of Leicester prison. Afterwards:
{{quotation|The head was shaved and tarred, to preserve it from the action of the weather; and the cap in which he had suffered was drawn over his face. On Saturday afternoon his body, attired as at the time of his execution, having been firmly fixed in the irons necessary to keep the limbs together, was carried to the place of its intended suspension.}}
His body was to be displayed on a purpose-built gallows 33&amp;nbsp;ft high in Saffron Lane near the Aylestone Tollgate. According to ''The Newgate Calendar'':
{{quotation|Thousands of persons were attracted to the spot, to view this novel but most barbarous exhibition; and considerable annoyance was felt by persons resident in the neighbourhood of the dreadful scene. Representations were in consequence made to the authorities, and on the following Tuesday morning instructions were received from the Home Office directing the removal of the gibbet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng614.htm|title=The Newgate Calendar - JAMES COOK|author=|date=|website=www.exclassics.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the practice of gibbeting had been abandoned by 1834 in Britain, during the British Raj of India in 1843, [[Charles James Napier]] threatened to have such structures built in parallel to any attempt to practice [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], the ritualized burning of widows, to execute the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;Napier, William.

[[International tax]] law distinguishes between an estate tax and an inheritance tax—an estate tax is assessed on the assets of the deceased, while an inheritance tax is assessed on the legacies received by the estate's beneficiaries. However, this distinction is not always observed; for example, the UK's "inheritance tax" is a tax on the assets of the deceased, and strictly speaking is therefore an estate tax. 

For historical reasons, the term '''death duty''' is still used colloquially (though not legally) in the UK and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

==Varieties of inheritance and estate taxes ==

Inheritance tax was introduced with effect from 18 March 1986.

===History (succession duty)===
'''Succession duty''', in the [[England|English]] fiscal system, is "a [[tax]] placed on the gratuitous acquisition of property which passes on the death of any person, by means of a transfer from one person (called the predecessor) to another person (called the successor)". In order properly to understand the present state of the English law it is necessary to describe shortly the state of affairs prior to the Finance Act 1894 — an act which effected a considerable change in the duties payable and in the mode of assessment of those duties.

The [[Succession Duty Act 1853]] was the principal act that first imposed a succession duty in England. By that act a duty varying from 1% to 10% according to the degree of [[consanguinity]] between the predecessor and successor was imposed upon every succession which was defined as "every past or future disposition of property by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act to any other person in possession or expectancy". The property which is liable to pay the duty is in realty or leasehold estate in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and personalty—not subject to legacy duty—which the beneficiary claims by virtue of English, Scottish, or Irish law. Personalty in England bequeathed by a person domiciled abroad is not subject to succession duty. Successions of a husband or a wife, successions where the principal value is under £100, and individual successions under £20, are exempt from duty. [[Leasehold]] property and personalty directed to be converted into real estate are liable to succession, not to legacy duty.

Special provision is made for the collection of duty in the cases of joint tenants and where the successor is also the predecessor. The duty is a first charge on property, but if the property be parted with before the duty is paid the liability of the successor is transferred to the alienee. It is, therefore, usual in requisitions on title before conveyance, to demand for the protection of the purchaser the production of receipts for succession duty, as such receipts are an effectual protection notwithstanding any suppression or misstatement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed or any insufficiency of such assessment. The duty is by this act directed to be assessed as follows: on personal property, if the successor takes a limited estate, the duty is assessed on the principal value of the [[annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] or yearly income estimated according to the period during which he is entitled to receive the annuity or yearly income, and the duty is payable in four yearly instalments free from interest. If the successor takes absolutely he pays in a lump-sum duty on the principal value. On real property the duty is payable in eight half-yearly instalments without interest on the capital value of an annuity equal to the annual value of the property. Various minor changes were made. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 exempted personal estates under 300. The [[Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888]] charged an additional 1% on successions already paying 1% and an additional 11% on successions paying more than 1%. By the [[Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889]], an additional duty of 1% called an "estate duty" was payable on successions over 10,000.

The Finance Acts 1894 and 1909 effected large changes in the duties payable on death. As regards the succession duties they enacted that payment of the estate duties thereby created should include payment of the additional duties mentioned above. Estates under £1,000 (£2,000 in the case of widow or child of deceased) are exempted from payment of any succession duties. The succession duty payable under the Succession Duty Act 1853 was in all cases to be calculated according to the principal value of the property, i.e., its selling value, and though still payable by instalments interest at 3% is chargeable. The additional succession duties are still payable in cases where the estate duty is not charged, but such cases are of small importance and in practice are not as a rule charged.

==United States==
{{Main article|Estate tax in the United States}}
{{confusing|date=June 2017}}
The [[United States]] imposed a succession duty by the [[War Revenue Act of 1898]] on all legacies or distributive shares of personal property exceeding $10,000. This was a tax on the privilege of succession, and devises and land distributions of land were unaffected. The duty ran from 75 cents on the $100 to $5 on the $100, if the legacy or share in question did not exceed $25,000. On those over that value, the rate was multiplied 11 times on estates up to $100,000, twofold on those from $100,000 to $200,000, 21 times on those from $500,000 to a $1 million, and threefold for those exceeding a million.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} This statute was upheld as constitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Many of the states also impose succession duties, or [[transfer tax]]es; generally, however, on [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] and remote successions; sometimes progressive, according to the amount of the succession. The state duties generally touch real estate successions as well as those to personal property. If a citizen of state ''A'' owns registered bonds of a corporation chartered by state ''B'', which he has put for safe keeping in a deposit vault in state ''C'', his estate may thus have to pay four succession taxes, one to state ''A'', to which he belongs and which, by legal fiction, is the seat of all his personal property; one to state ''B'', for permitting the transfer of the bonds to the legatees on the books of the corporation; one to state ''C'', for allowing them to be removed from the deposit vault for that purpose; and one to the United States.

The different U.S. states all have other regulations regarding inheritance tax:
** [[Louisiana]]: abolished inheritance tax in 2008, for deaths occurring on or after 1 July 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rev.louisiana.gov/sections/individual/estate.aspx|title=Individuals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[Utah]]: abolished inheritance tax in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.utah.gov/miscellaneous|title=USTC - USTC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[U.S. states]] impose inheritance or estate taxes (see [[Estate tax in the United States#Inheritance tax at the state level|inheritance tax at the state level]]):

* [[Indiana]]: abolished the state inheritance on December 31, 2012&lt;ref name=Indiana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dor/3807.htm|title=DOR: Inheritance Tax Information|accessdate=|date=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iowa]]: Inheritance is exempt if passed to a surviving spouse, parents, or grandparents, or to children, grandchildren, or other "lineal" descendants. Other recipients are subject to inheritance tax, with rates varying depending on the relationship of the recipient to the deceased.&lt;ref name=Iowa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowa.gov/tax/educate/78517.html|title=Iowa Department of Revenue: Iowa Taxes|accessdate=|date=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kentucky]]: The inheritance tax is a tax on a beneficiary's right to receive property from a decedent's estate. It is imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the beneficiary:
** Transfers to "Class A" relatives (spouses, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings) are exempt
** Transfers to "Class B" relatives (nieces, nephews, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, aunts, uncles, and great-grandchildren) are taxable
** Transfers to "Class C" recipients (all other persons) are taxable at a higher rate.&lt;ref name="Kentucky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revenue.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6D844DC9-B300-4EE7-963E-DB141FC0AED6/0/guide_2003.pdf |title=A Guide to Kentucky Inheritance and Estate Taxes: General Information |publisher=Kentucky Revenue Cabinet |date=March 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kentucky imposes an estate tax in addition to its inheritance tax.&lt;ref name="Kentucky" /&gt;
* [[Maryland]]
* [[Nebraska]] 
* [[New Jersey]]: New Jersey law puts inheritors into different groups, based on their family relationship to the deceased person:
** Class A beneficiaries are exempt from the inheritance tax. They includes the deceased person’s spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner parent, grandparent, child (biological, adopted, or mutually acknowledged), stepchild (but not stepgrandchild or great-stepgrandchild), grandchild or other lineal descendant of a child
** Class B was deleted when New Jersey law changed
** Class C includes the deceased person’s: brother or sister, spouse or [[Same-sex unions in the United States|civil union]] partner of the deceased person's child, surviving spouse or civil union partner of the deceased person's child. The first $25,000 inherited by someone in Class C is not taxed. On amounts exceeding $25,000, the tax rates are: 11% on the next $1,075,000, 13% on the next $300,000, 14% on the next $300,000, and 16% for anything over $1,700,000
** Class D includes everyone else. There is no special exemption amount, and the applicable tax rates are: 15% on the first $700,000, and 16% on anything over $700,000
** Class E includes the State of New Jersey or any of its political subdivisions for public or charitable purposes, an educational institution, church, hospital, orphan asylum, [[Public libraries in North America|public library]], and other nonprofits. These beneficiaries are exempt from inheritance tax.
* [[Oklahoma]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* [[Pennsylvania]]: Inheritance tax is a flat tax on the value of the decedent's taxable estate as of the date of death, less allowable funeral and administrative expenses and debts of the decedent. Pennsylvania does not allow the six month after date of death alternate valuation method that is available at the federal level. Transfers to spouses exempt; transfers to grandparents, parents, or lineal descendants are taxed at 4.5%. Transfers to siblings are taxed at 12%. Transfers to any other persons are taxed at 15%. Some assets are exempted, including [[life insurance]] proceeds. The inheritance tax is imposed on both residents and nonresidents who owned real estate and tangible personal property in Pennsylvania at the time of their death. The Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (Form Rev-1500) must be filed within nine months of the date of death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/inheritance_tax/11414
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tennessee]]&lt;ref&gt;Tenn. Code Ann. 67-8-303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other taxation applied to inheritance ==
In some [[jurisdictions]], when assets are transferred by inheritance, any unrealized increase in asset value is subject to [[capital gains tax]], payable immediately. This is the case in [[Canada]], which [[taxation in Canada|has no]] inheritance tax.

When a jurisdiction has both capital gains tax and inheritance tax, inheritances are generally exempt from capital gains tax.

In some jurisdictions, like Austria, death gives rise to the local equivalent of '''[[gift tax]]'''. This was the UK model before the Inheritance Tax in 1986 was introduced, when estates were charged to a form of gift tax called Capital Transfer Tax. Where a jurisdiction has both gift tax and inheritance tax, it is usual to exempt inheritances from gift tax. Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of gift taxes, by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death. The UK, for example, subjects "lifetime chargeable transfers" (usually gifts to [[Trust law|trusts]]) to inheritance tax.

===Ancient Rome===
{{See also|List of Roman taxes}}
No inheritance tax was recorded for the [[Roman Republic]], despite abundant evidence for [[Legal history of wills|testamentary law]]. The ''[[vicesima hereditatium]]'' ("twentieth of inheritance") was levied by Rome's first emperor, [[Augustus]], in the last decade of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gardner, "Nearest and Dearest: Liability to Inheritance Tax in Roman Families," in ''Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World'' pp. 205, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," pp. 205, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a [[Women in Ancient Rome|Roman woman]] remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," p. 214; see further Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 19–20, and Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family in Italy" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mos maiorum|Roman social values]] on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#25.5 55.25.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of [[Trajan]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax revenues went into a fund to pay military retirement benefits (''[[aerarium militare]]''), along with those from a new sales tax (''[[centesima rerum venalium]]''), a 1 tax% on goods sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," p. 205; Graham Burton, "Government and the Provinces," in ''The Roman World'' (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 428; Peter Michael Swan, ''The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History Books 55–56 (9 B.C–A.D. 14)'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance tax is extensively documented in sources pertaining to [[Roman law]], [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, "Liability to Inheritance Tax," p. 205. A 2nd-century AD [[epitaph]] for a Roman of [[equestrian order|equestrian rank]], for instance, lists ''[[Procurator (Roman Empire)|procurator]]'' of the 5 percent inheritance tax on his [[cursus honorum|career résumé]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 10.482).&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of three major [[indirect tax]]es levied on Roman citizens in the [[Roman province|provinces]] of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton, "Government and the Provinces," p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James William Edward Bartley''' (baptised 28 May 1902&lt;ref&gt;''England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975''&lt;/ref&gt; – 21 September 1939) was an English professional [[association football|football]]er of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. J. W. E.

Bartley was born in [[Coseley]], [[Staffordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;''1911 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; the son of George and Eliza Bartley. In 1916, during the First World War, his father died in [[Mesopotamia]] of wounds received while serving with the [[North Staffordshire (Prince of Wales's) Regiment]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''UK, Soldiers Died in the Great War, 1914-1919''&lt;/ref&gt; Bartley joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] from [[Bilston Town F.C.|Bilston United]] in 1926. He made his debut for the club in September of the same year against [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] and played in the next three matches, but was then out of the team for six months.  He returned to the team in April 1927 against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] and played five more times that season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Brown  | first = Tony|title = The Definitive Gillingham F.C.: A Complete Record  | publisher = Soccerdata  | year = 2003  | isbn = 1-899468-20-X   | page =40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but played only once in 1927–28 and twice in 1928–29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Brown  | first = Tony|title = The Definitive Gillingham F.C.: A Complete Record  | publisher = Soccerdata  | year = 2003  | isbn = 1-899468-20-X   | page =41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Brown  | first = Tony|title = The Definitive Gillingham F.C.: A Complete Record  | publisher = Soccerdata  | year = 2003  | isbn = 1-899468-20-X   | page =4q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartley had a further run of eight games in the Gillingham team in September and October 1929, but after two further games later that season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Brown  | first = Tony|title = The Definitive Gillingham F.C.: A Complete Record  | publisher = Soccerdata  | year = 2003  | isbn = 1-899468-20-X   | page =43}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left to join Canterbury Waverley.&lt;ref name="triggs40"&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger|last= Triggs|title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club|publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd |year=2001|isbn=0-7524-2243-X|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartley later ran a pub, the Good Intent, in Gillingham. In September 1939, "after a period of indifferent health", he died unexpectedly at age 37, the same age his father died. He was survived by a widow and two children.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

'''Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan''' (18 December 1934 – disappeared 8 November 1974), commonly known as '''Lord Lucan''', was a British [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] who disappeared after being suspected of murder. He was an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] aristocrat, the eldest son of [[George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan]] by his mother, Kaitlin Dawson. An [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuee]] during the Second World War, Lucan returned to attend [[Eton College]], and then from 1953 to 1955 served with the [[Coldstream Guards]] in [[West Germany]]. He developed a taste for gambling and, skilled at [[backgammon]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]], became an early member of the [[Clermont Club#Clermont Club|Clermont Club]]. Although his losses often exceeded his winnings, he left his job at a London-based [[merchant bank]] and became a professional gambler. He was known as '''Lord Bingham''' from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.

Once considered for the role of [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] in the cinematic adaptations of [[Ian Fleming]]'s novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced [[Offshore powerboat racing|power boats]] and drove an [[Aston Martin]]. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, by whom he had three children. When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46&amp;nbsp;[[Lower Belgrave Street]], in London's [[Belgravia]], to a property nearby. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children. This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his life and personal finances.

On the evening of 7&amp;nbsp;November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned to death in the basement of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed [[Ford Corsair]] to a friend's house in [[Uckfield]], East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], its interior stained with blood and its [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] containing a piece of bandaged [[lead pipe]] similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.

Within Britain, there has been continuing interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported sightings have been made in various countries around the world; none have been substantiated. Despite a police investigation and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found. He was presumed deceased [[in chambers]] on 11 December 1992&lt;ref name="ladylucan"&gt;[http://www.ladylucan.co.uk/index1.htm Countess of Lucan: setting the record straight]&lt;/ref&gt; and declared [[Declared death in absentia|legally dead]] in October 1999;&lt;ref name="bbc1999"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/487211.stm Lord Lucan 'officially dead'] BBC, 1999-10-27&lt;/ref&gt; a death certificate was issued in 2016.

==Early life and education==
Richard John Bingham was born on 18&amp;nbsp;December 1934 at 19&amp;nbsp;Bentinck Street, [[Marylebone]], London, the second child and elder son of [[George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan]], an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer, and his wife Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson. A blood clot found in her lung forced his mother to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known,&lt;!-- this to help the reader – not cited --&gt; was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid&lt;!-- Lucy Sellers --&gt;. Aged three years, he attended a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|pre-prep school]] in [[Tite Street]] with his elder sister Jane, but in 1939, with war approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of [[Wales]]. The following year, joined by their younger siblings Sally and Hugh, the Lucan children travelled to [[Toronto]], moving shortly thereafter to [[Mount Kisco, New York]]. They stayed for five years with multi-millionairess [[Marcia Brady Tucker]]; John was enrolled at [[The Harvey School]] and spent summer holidays away from his siblings at a summer camp in the [[Adirondack Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Davenport-Hines | first = Richard | title = Bingham, (Richard) John, 7th earl of Lucan (b. 1934, d. in or after 1974) | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75967?docPos=2 | publisher = oxforddnb.com | date = January 2011 | accessdate = 10 June 2012 | edition = online | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/75967 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the U.S., John and his siblings lived in grandeur and wanted for nothing, but on their return to England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|wartime Britain]]. [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#World War II|Rationing]] was still in force, their former home at [[Cheyne Walk]] had been bombed, and the house at 22&amp;nbsp;[[Eaton Square]] had had its windows blown out. Despite the family's noble ancestry,{{refn|Lucan's ancestry contains many royal connections. His grandmother was a [[lady-in-waiting]] to the [[Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein|Duchess of Albany]] and could count [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]], among her friends. His great-aunt was a [[Woman of the Bedchamber|woman-of-the-bedchamber]] to [[Mary of Teck]]. His grandfather, [[George Bingham, 5th Earl of Lucan]], was [[Lord-in-waiting]] to King [[George V]]. The family is also linked to the family of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} the 6th Earl and his wife were [[agnosticism|agnostics]] and [[History of the socialist movement in the United Kingdom|socialists]] and preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended [[Sunday school]], preferring to give them a traditional childhood.&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Eton College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Other Old Etonians | url = http://www.etoncollege.com/OtherOEs.aspx | publisher = etoncollege.com | accessdate = 11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John developed a taste for gambling. He supplemented his pocket money with income from [[Bookmaker|bookmaking]], placing his earnings into a "secret" bank account, and regularly left the school's grounds to attend [[Horseracing in Great Britain|horse races]]. According to his mother his academic record was "far from creditable",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he became Captain of Roe's House, before leaving in 1953 to undertake his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]]. He became a [[Second lieutenant#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|second lieutenant]] in his father's regiment, the [[Coldstream Guards]], and was stationed mainly in [[Krefeld]], West Germany. While there, he also became a keen [[poker]] player.&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
On leaving the army in 1955, Lucan joined a London-based merchant bank, [[William Brandt's Sons and Co]]., on an annual salary of £500.&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan" /&gt; In 1960 he met Stephen Raphael, a rich stockbroker who was a skilled [[backgammon]] player.{{refn|Raphael's wife, Eve, later became godmother to Lucan's first child, Frances.&lt;ref name="Moorepp5354" /&gt;|group=nb}} They holidayed together in the [[Bahamas]], went water-skiing, and played golf, backgammon and poker.&lt;ref name="Moorepp5354"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucan became a regular gambler and an early member of [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)|John Aspinall]]'s [[Clermont Club#Clermont Club|Clermont gaming club]], located in [[Berkeley Square]]. He often won at games of skill like bridge and backgammon, but he also accumulated huge losses. On one occasion he lost £8,000, or about two-thirds of the money he received annually from various family trusts. On another disastrous night at a casino he lost £10,000. That time his [[stockbroker]] uncle by marriage, [[John Bevan (British Army officer)|John Bevan]], helped him to pay the debt, and Lucan repaid his uncle two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucan left Brandt's in about 1960, shortly after he had won £26,000 playing [[Baccarat (card game)#Chemin de fer|chemin de fer]].&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague had been promoted before him, and he protested and then gave up his job, saying "why should I work in a bank, when I can earn a year's money in one single night at the tables?"&lt;ref name="Ransonp24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled to the United States, where he played golf, raced powerboats, and drove his [[Aston Martin]] around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane, and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents' home in [[St&amp;nbsp;John's Wood]] and into a flat in [[Park Crescent, London|Park Crescent]].&lt;ref name="Moorepp5556"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
Lucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma. Her father had died in a car accident while she was still very young, following which the family had moved to South Africa. Her mother remarried, and when her new step-father became manager of a hotel in [[Guildford]], the family returned to England. Along with her sister, Christina, she was educated at [[St&amp;nbsp;Swithun's School, Winchester]], and after displaying a talent for art she went on to study at an art college in [[Bournemouth]]. The two sisters later shared a flat in London, where Veronica worked as a model and later as a secretary. Christina's marriage to the wealthy William Shand Kydd (half-brother to [[Peter Shand Kydd]], stepfather to [[Princess Diana|Diana Spencer]], later Princess of Wales) introduced her to London [[high society (group)|high society]], and it was at a golf-club function in the country that Veronica and Lucan first met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lower and upper levels of 46 Lower Belgrave Street (June 2012).jpg|thumb|upright|46 [[Lower Belgrave Street]] in London's [[Belgravia]] district]]

News of their engagement appeared in ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspapers on 14&amp;nbsp;October 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two were married at [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church|Holy Trinity Church, Brompton]] on 20&amp;nbsp;November. After a ceremony attended by [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]] (one of whose ladies-in-waiting had been a relative of Lady Lucan), but by few other prominent members of high society,&lt;ref&gt;ITV interview 2017 with Lady Lucan, a guest was overheard to say: "there's no one here"&lt;/ref&gt; the couple honeymooned in Europe, travelling first class on the [[Orient Express]]. Lucan's already embattled finances were given a welcome boost by his father, who provided him with a [[marriage settlement]] designed to finance a larger family home and any future additions to the Lucan family. Lucan repaid some of his creditors and purchased 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street, Belgravia, redecorating it to suit Veronica's tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the wedding, on 21&amp;nbsp;January 1964, the 6th&amp;nbsp;Earl of Lucan died of a [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a reputed £250,000 inheritance,{{refn|"The former Lord Lucan was reputed to have inherited one-quarter of a million pounds along with his title and clearly, for all to see, had the money to indulge an expensive range of sporting passions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Lucan acquired his father's titles: [[Earl of Lucan]]; Baron Lucan of [[Castlebar]]; Baron Lucan of Melcombe Lucan and [[List of baronetcies in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia|Baronet Bingham of Castlebar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife became the Countess of Lucan. Their first child, Frances, was born on 24&amp;nbsp;October 1964, and early the next year they employed a nanny, Lillian Jenkins, to look after her. Lucan tried to teach Veronica about gambling and traditional pursuits like hunting, shooting, and fishing. He bought her golf lessons; she later gave up the sport.&lt;ref name="Ransonpp1618"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucan's daily routine consisted of breakfast at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, coffee, dealing with the morning's letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and took his [[Doberman Pinscher]] for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into [[black tie|evening dress]], the earl typically spent the remainder of the day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have "£2m in the bank", claiming that "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays, and security for the future would give myself and a lot of other people a lot of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, "luxuriant guardsman's moustache," and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular.&lt;ref name="ODNBLucan" /&gt; His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin [[convertible (car)|drophead coupé]], drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing [[offshore powerboat racing|powerboats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=16–18,&amp;nbsp;189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1966 he unsuccessfully [[screen test]]ed for a part in ''[[Woman Times Seven]]'', prompting him to decline a later offer from film producer [[Cubby Broccoli]] to screen test him for the role of [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a professional gambler&lt;ref name="Moorepp5556" /&gt; he was undoubtedly a skilled player, once rated amongst the world's top ten backgammon competitors. He won the [[St&amp;nbsp;James's Club]] tournament and was Champion of the West Coast of America. He gained the moniker "Lucky" Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he was anything but lucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968 he paid more in race entry fees than he received in winnings.&lt;ref name="Ransonpp1618" /&gt; Despite some arguments over money, his wife remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at [[Savile Row]] tailors and various [[Knightsbridge]] shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the births of [[George Bingham, Lord Bingham|George]] (1967) and [[Lady Camilla Bloch|Camilla]] (1970), she suffered [[post-natal depression]]. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in [[Hampstead]], where she refused to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=77–78,&amp;nbsp;81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of anti-depressants. In July 1972 the family holidayed in [[Monte Carlo]], but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, paying for Lucan's gambling addiction, and Veronica's weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a small property in Eaton Row.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation===
Some months later Lucan moved again, to a larger rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street. Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the marriage was custody of his children. In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, he began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private investigators to perform the same task. Lucan also canvassed doctors, who explained that his wife had not "gone mad", but was suffering from depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucan told his friends that nobody would work for Veronica (she sacked the children's long-term nanny, Lillian Jenkins, in December 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the series of nannies employed in the house, one, 26-year-old Stefanja Sawicka, was told by Veronica that Lucan had hit her with a cane and had, on one occasion, pushed her down the stairs. The countess apparently feared for her safety and told Sawicka not to be surprised "if he kills me one day."&lt;ref name="Ransonpp3839"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawicka's time at the Lucan household ended late in March 1973. While with two of the children near [[Grosvenor Place (London)|Grosvenor Place]], she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made [[Ward (law)|wards of court]] and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day.&lt;ref name="Ransonpp3839" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for &lt;!-- 11&amp;nbsp; --&gt;June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the [[Priory Clinic]] in [[Roehampton]]. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments ''[[in camera]]'', on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Sir Stanley Rees | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1378212/Sir-Stanley-Rees.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 14 December 2000 | accessdate = 19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus began a bitter dispute between the two, involving many of their friends and Veronica's own sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucan again began to watch his wife's movements. He recorded some of their telephone conversations with a small [[Sony]] tape recorder and played excerpts to any friends prepared to listen; he also told them—and his bank manager—that Lady Lucan had been "spending money like water".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to pay her £40 a week and may have cancelled their regular food order with [[Harrods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He delayed payment to the milkman and—knowing that Veronica was required by the court to employ a live-in nanny—the childcare agency. With no income of her own, Veronica took a part-time job in a local hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary nanny, Elizabeth Murphy, was befriended by Lucan, who bought her drinks and asked her for information on his wife. He instructed his detective agency to investigate Murphy, looking for evidence that she was failing in her duty of care to his children. This they found; he dispensed with the detective agency's services when they presented him with bills amounting to several hundred pounds. Murphy was later hospitalised with cancer. Another temporary nanny, Christabel Martin, reported strange telephone calls to the house, some with heavy breathing and some from a man asking for non-existent people. Following a series of temporary nannies, Sandra Rivett started work in late 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling===
Losing the court case proved devastating for Lucan. It had cost him an estimated £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire. As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In drunken conversations with some of them, including Aspinall's mother, [[Sir George Osborne, 16th Baronet|Lady Osborne]], and her son, Lucan discussed murdering his wife. [[Greville Howard, Baron Howard of Rising|Greville Howard]] later gave a statement to the police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the [[Solent]] and how he "would never be caught".&lt;ref name="Moorep204"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This conversation, which Howard thought was "drunken rambling",&lt;ref name="Moorep204" /&gt; was not revealed to the inquest jury.|group=nb}} Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Marcia Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having no luck there, he wrote to Tucker's son, explaining how he wished to "buy" his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. He turned to his friends and acquaintances, asking anyone plausible to loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier [[James Goldsmith]] guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid. Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. He was required to provide a [[surety]] and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers' consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; [[Coutts]], £2,841; [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds]], £4,379; [[National Westminster]], £1,290; [[Midland Bank|Midland]], £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan's gambling remained completely out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranson (1994) estimates that between September and October 1974 alone, the earl ran up debts of around £50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taki Theodoracopulos]], who recalled Lucan as a close friend for more than a decade, lent him £3,000 in cash three nights before the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taki|title=Unlucky at cards, unlucky in love|publisher=The Spectator|date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these problems, from late October 1974 his demeanour appeared to change for the better. His [[best man]], John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On &lt;!--Wednesday--&gt;6&amp;nbsp;November he met his uncle [[John Bevan (British Army officer)|John Bevan]], apparently in good spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The three angry women&amp;nbsp;... | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/20/archer.politics | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 20 July 2001 | accessdate = 22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this citation contradicts Ranson, who said that Colquhoun was Lucan's girlfriend --&gt; who said that "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, and there was nothing to suggest that he was worried or depressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver [[Graham Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 4:00&amp;nbsp;am, so Lucan often gambled into the early hours of the morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7&amp;nbsp;November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30&amp;nbsp;am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm lunch appointment with artist [[Dominic Elwes]] and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm Lucan called at a chemist's on Lower Belgrave Street, close to Veronica's home, and asked the pharmacist there to identify a small capsule. It turned out to be [[Limbitrol]]&amp;nbsp;5, a drug for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Lucan had apparently made several similar visits since he separated from his wife; he never told the pharmacist where he got the drugs. At 4:45&amp;nbsp;pm he called a friend, literary agent Michael Hicks-Beach, and between 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm met with him at his flat on Elizabeth Street. Lucan wanted his help with an article on gambling he had been asked to write for an [[Oxford University]] magazine. He drove Hicks-Beach home for about 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm, not in his [[Mercedes-Benz]], but in "an old, dark, and scruffy Ford", possibly the [[Ford Corsair]] he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier. At 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm he called the Clermont to check on a reservation for dinner with Greville Howard and friends. Howard had called him at 5:15&amp;nbsp;pm and asked if he wished to come to the theatre, but Lucan had declined and made the alternative suggestion to meet at the Clermont at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm. He failed to arrive and did not answer his telephone when called.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
===Sandra Rivett===
[[File:Sandra Rivett Daily Mail.jpg|thumb|upright|Sandra Eleanor Rivett]]
Sandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16&amp;nbsp;September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby. The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955. Sandra was a popular child, described at school as "intelligent, although she does not excel academically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in [[Croydon]]. Following a failed romance she became a voluntary patient at a mental hospital near [[Redhill, Surrey]], where she was treated for depression. She became engaged to a builder named John and took a job as a children's nanny for a doctor in Croydon. On 13&amp;nbsp;March 1964, she gave birth to a boy named Stephen, but, as her relationship with John was failing, she returned home to live with her parents and considered giving the baby up for adoption. Her parents took on the responsibility and adopted him in May 1965. Sandra later worked at an old people's home, before moving to [[Portsmouth]] to stay with her elder sister. While there she met Roger Rivett; the two married on 10&amp;nbsp;June 1967 in Croydon. Roger was serving as a [[Royal Navy]] able seaman and later worked as a loader for [[British Road Services]], while Sandra worked part-time at Reedham Orphanage in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. In summer 1973 he took a job on an [[Esso]] tanker, returning to their flat in [[Kenley]] a few months later by which time Sandra was employed by a cigarette company in Croydon. Their marriage collapsed in May 1974 when, suspicious of Sandra's movements while he was away, Roger went to live with his parents. She was by then listed on the books of a [[Belgravia]] domestic agency and had been caring for an elderly couple in that district. A few weeks later she began to work for the Lucans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=136–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra normally went out with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 7&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55&amp;nbsp;pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned to death with a piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett from the top of the basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to "shut up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any [[barbiturate]]s and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby [[public house]], the [[Plumbers Arms, Belgravia|Plumbers Arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucan may have arrived at the Chester Square home of Madelaine Florman (mother of one of Frances's school friends) sometime between 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Alone in the house, Florman ignored the door, but shortly afterwards she received an incoherent telephone call and put the receiver down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood stains, which after forensic examination were found to be a mixture of blood groups A and B, were later discovered on her doorstep. Lucan certainly called his mother between 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm and asked her to collect the children from Lower Belgrave Street. According to the Dowager Countess, he spoke of a "terrible catastrophe"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his wife's home. He told her that he had been driving past the house when he saw Veronica fighting with a man, in the basement. He had entered the property and found his wife screaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location from which he made this, and possibly the call to Florman, remains unknown. The police forced their way into Lady Lucan's home and discovered Sandra Rivett's body before his wife was taken by ambulance to [[St George's Hospital]]. Lucan drove the Ford Corsair {{convert|42|mi}} to [[Uckfield]], in [[East Sussex]], to visit his friends, the Maxwell-Scotts. Susan Maxwell-Scott's meeting with Lucan was his last confirmed sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[File:Ground floor of 46 Lower Belgrave Street (June 2012).jpg|thumb|The front entrance to 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street]]
By the time [[Detective Chief Superintendent]] Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8&amp;nbsp;November, the divisional surgeon had pronounced Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers had been called to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, there was no sign of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers also searched 5&amp;nbsp;Eaton Row, into which Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after interviewing &lt;!--afterward interviewed?--&gt; his mother (who had called to take the children to her home in [[St&amp;nbsp;John's Wood]]), his last address at 72a&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and [[glasses|spectacles]] were on a bedside table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, she was able to describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After removing her corpse from the canvas sack and beginning the [[post mortem]] examination, pathologist [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] told Ranson he was certain that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours earlier, Lucan had again called his mother, at about 12:30&amp;nbsp;am. He told her that he would be in touch later that day, but declined to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand Kydd at his country house near [[Leighton Buzzard]] and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why she did not immediately inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said she had not seen any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in [[Guilsborough]], [[Northamptonshire]], where they would remain for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Corsair that Lucan had been seen driving and whose details had the previous day been circulated across the country was found on Sunday in Norman Road, [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], about {{convert|16|mi}} from Uckfield. In its [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] was a piece of lead pipe covered in surgical tape, and a full bottle of vodka. The car was removed for forensic examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later statements from two witnesses suggest that it was parked there sometime between 5:00&amp;nbsp;am and 8:00&amp;nbsp;am on the morning of Friday 8&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref name="Ransonp100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its owner, Michael Stoop, also received a letter from Lucan, delivered to his club, the St James's. However, Stoop threw the envelope away and it was therefore not possible to check its postmark to see where it had been sent from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranson suspected a suicide, but a thorough search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made, using tracker dogs, but all that was found were the skeletal remains of a judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a partial search using infrared photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12&amp;nbsp;November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name="Ransonp100" /&gt;

===Forensics===
[[File:Ford Consul Corsair1965.jpg|thumb|Lucan was last seen driving a Ford Corsair similar to this.]]
The forensic examination of the lead pipes found at the murder scene and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's ([[Blood type|blood group]] A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. [[Home Office]] scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.&lt;ref name="Ransonpp104106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of the blood stains found inside 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked at the top of the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the [[ABO blood group system|AB blood group]]; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.&lt;ref name="Ransonpp104106" /&gt;

===Media reaction===
By the afternoon of Friday 8&amp;nbsp;November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like "Body in sack&amp;nbsp;... countess runs out screaming", and "Belgravia murder&amp;nbsp;– earl sought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting that day at the Clermont, between John Aspinall, Daniel Meinertzhagen, Charles Benson, Stephen Raphael, Bill Shand Kydd, and [[Dominick Elwes]], became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but the relationship between the police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an "Eton mafia" worked against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, was asked if she could help locate Lucan's body, she replied "The last I heard of him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son's zoo",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. They searched fourteen country houses and estates, including [[Holkham Hall]] and [[Warwick Castle]], to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP [[Marcus Lipton]] that some people were "being a bit snooty" with the police, Benson wrote a letter to ''The Times'' asking him to either identify those people or "kindly withdraw his remarks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; To their cost, ''[[Private Eye]]'' accused [[James Goldsmith]] of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominic Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement "Who's the mad one now?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in the ''Sunday Times Magazine''. He committed suicide in September 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilkes | first = Roger | title = Inside story: Stewart's Grove | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/4810656/Inside-story-Stewarts-Grove.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 9 September 2000 | accessdate = 9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivett's case made headlines around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the murder, newspapers reported on Veronica Lucan's statement to the police, with claims that she had pretended to collude with her husband to ensure her safety. In January 1975 Veronica gave an exclusive interview to the ''[[Daily Express]]''. She also appeared in a murder reconstruction, in the same newspaper, complete with posed photographs taken inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=132,&amp;nbsp;231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inquest===
[[File:Plumbers Arms in Lower Belgrave Street (June 2012).jpg|upright|thumb|The Plumbers Arms public house]]
The [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] into Sandra Rivett's death opened on 13&amp;nbsp;November 1974 and was led by the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two witnesses were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit on the head with a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11&amp;nbsp;December 1974 and 10&amp;nbsp;March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16&amp;nbsp;June 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Thurston was concerned about holding a full inquest before a trial had been held. The law at the time considered that a wife was usually neither "compellable nor competent" to testify against her husband in a criminal trial. She could tell the jury how she was attacked, but not anything about Rivett's death, or his "confession" after the fact. Her attack would also have to be heard before a different jury, in a different trial to the murder case. While these rules did not apply to an inquest, enabling her to speak freely, her evidence might prejudice any future trial. Furthermore, hearsay evidence was banned from criminal trials but not from inquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

The hearing began with introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had selected 33&amp;nbsp;witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened on the night of the attack. The Dowager Countess's [[Queen's Counsel]] attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=113–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detective constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Woman Detective Constable]] Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20&amp;nbsp;November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landlord of The Plumbers Arms described how Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered "head to toe in blood" before she fell into "a state of shock".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that she shouted "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" and "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathologist [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by "blunt head injuries" and "inhalation of blood".&lt;ref name="Ransonp131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought more likely to have been caused by punches from a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked "dishevelled", and his hair "a little ruffled".&lt;ref name="Ransonp131" /&gt; His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was "very hysterical" and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box | quote = I will record that Sandra Eleanor Rivett died from head injuries, that at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm on 7&amp;nbsp;November 1974 she was found dead at 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street&amp;nbsp;... and that the following offence was committed by Richard John Bingham, Earl of Lucan&amp;nbsp;– namely the offence of murder. | source = Gavin Thurston&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align = right | width = 33%}}
Once the hearing had ended, Thurston made a summary of the evidence presented and told the jury their options. At 11:45&amp;nbsp;am, their foreman announced "Murder by Lord Lucan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucan became the first member of the [[House of Lords]] to be named a murderer since 1760, when [[Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers]], was hanged for killing his bailiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also the last person to be committed by a coroner to a Crown Court for unlawful killing; the coroner's power to do so was removed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|Green|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivett's body, which had been held for several weeks following the murder, was released to her family and cremated at [[Croydon Cemetery|Croydon crematorium]] on 18&amp;nbsp;December 1974. A police spokesman cited Lady Lucan's desire not to upset the family as a reason for her non-attendance at the cremation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucan's defence===
Lucan's friends and family were critical of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters that it did not serve "any useful purpose at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt "great sadness and sorrow"&lt;ref name="Moorep201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel "awfully sorry"&lt;ref name="Moorep201" /&gt; for the countess.

However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her.{{refn|A former boxer named Michael Fitzpatrick later claimed to know the unidentified person, but later still admitted inventing the tale. He was convicted of wasting police time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|pp=118–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement. The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46&amp;nbsp;Lower Belgrave Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=147–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to his defenders, the [[Media of the United Kingdom|national press]] were almost unanimous in their condemnation of Lucan. Their [[Editorial|leader]]-writers ignored the threat of [[English defamation law|libel]] and identified him as Rivett's killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1987|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last confirmed sighting of Lucan was at about 1:15&amp;nbsp;am on 8&amp;nbsp;November 1974 as he exited the driveway of the Maxwell-Scott property, in his friend's Ford Corsair. Since then, his whereabouts and ultimate fate remain a mystery.

Ranson later changed his view, explaining that he considered it more likely that suicide was far from Lucan's thoughts, that a rumoured drowning at sea was implausible and that the earl had moved to southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=157–174,&amp;nbsp;209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty&amp;nbsp;years after the murder, the detective leading a new investigation into Lucan's disappearance told the ''Telegraph'' that "the evidence points towards the fact that Lord Lucan left the country and lived abroad for a number of years".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Alderson | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Eden | first2 = Richard | title = Lord Lucan could still be alive, says the detective leading a new hunt for him | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1476056/Lord-Lucan-could-still-be-alive-says-the-detective-leading-a-new-hunt-for-him.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 7 November 2004 | accessdate = 11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to author [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] before she died, Susan Maxwell-Scott suggested that Lucan might have been helped out of the country by shadowy underground financiers, before being judged too great a risk and killed and buried in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|2007|pp=281–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theory was proposed by advertising executive Jeremy Scott, who was familiar with some of the [[Clermont Set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|2002|pp=265–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucan's disappearance has captivated the public's imagination for decades, with thousands of sightings reported across the world.&lt;ref name="TelegraphIhelped"&gt;{{Citation | last = Alleyne | first = Richard | title = 'I helped Lord Lucan flee justice', claims personal assistant to late billionaire John Aspinall | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9089551/I-helped-Lord-Lucan-flee-justice-claims-personal-assistant-to-late-billionaire-John-Aspinall.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 18 February 2012 | accessdate = 14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=196–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, turned out to be a British ex-politician, [[John Stonehouse]], who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia turned out to be an American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|train robber]] [[Ronnie Biggs]], claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the ''[[News of the World]]'' as a hoaxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranson|Strange|1994|pp=171–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a former [[Scotland Yard]] detective thought he had tracked the earl to [[Goa]], India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from [[St Helens, Merseyside|St&amp;nbsp;Helens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Morris | first1 = Steven | last2 = Chrisafis | first2 = Angelique | title = Lord Lucan?

More recently, responding to claims that the two eldest Lucan children were sent to [[Gabon]] in the early 1980s so that their father might secretly watch them "from a distance",&lt;ref name="TelegraphIhelped" /&gt; George Bingham denied ever visiting the country. Veronica Lucan dismissed the newspaper claims of sightings as "nonsense", reiterating that in her opinion her husband "was not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2012"&gt;{{Citation | last = Britten | first = Nick | title = Countess Lucan: I would have helped my husband get away with murder | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9092061/Countess-Lucan-I-would-have-helped-my-husband-get-away-with-murder.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 20 February 2012 | accessdate = 12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jovan Petrović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Петровић}}, 1768–16 August 1813), known as '''Jovan Kursula''' (Јован Курсула), was a Serbian ''vojvoda'' (commander) that participated in the [[Serbian Revolution]].  Petrović was born in [[Donja Gorevnica]], in the Rudnik ''okrug'',{{sfn|Marković|Pantović|1996|p=119}} near [[Čačak]], at the time part of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (now Serbia). Both his parents, Velimir and Magdalena, had ancestry from [[Drobnjaci]] in what is today [[Montenegro]]. After his father's death his mother remarried in the village of [[Cvetke]] near Kraljevo, bringing Jovan with her.  Kursula had brown hair, light skin, full cheeks, youthful looks, broad shoulders and was slow-witted.{{sfn|Marković|Pantović|1996|p=119}} He did not carry his [[sabre]] from his waist, as did most others, but "over his shoulder, as it was easier to pull out", as he was a master of [[swordsmanship]].&lt;ref name="Milošević1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Predrag Milošević|title=Sveti ratnici : borilacke vestine u Srba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFUyAAAAIAAJ|year=1989|quote=Тако Јован Курсула није носио сабљу онако како се носи - о бедрима »него затурену на раме, како му је лакше по- тегнути је«}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the Rudnik ''nahija'' commanders, alongside '''Lazar Mutap''', [[Arsenije Loma]], '''Milić Drinčić''' and [[Milan Obrenović (revolutionary)|Milan Obrenović]]. At the Battle of [[Varvarin]] he had a [[duel]] against an Ottoman commander known as the "Black Arab" (Crni arapin). He died from wounds from the [[Battle of Deligrad]].

The '''Kentucky meat shower''' was an incident occurring for a period of several minutes on March 3, 1876, where what appeared to be flakes of [[red meat]] fell from the sky in a {{convert|100|by|50|yd|adj=on}}  area near the settlement of Rankin in [[Bath County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Fort&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Fort |authorlink=Charles Fort |title=The Book of the Damned |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW1HAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Charles+Fort,+Book+of+the+Damned&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI86DNluCKyAIVEVeICh3vWwmT#v=onepage&amp;q=Kentucky&amp;f=false |pages=45&amp;ndash;46 |location=New York |publisher=[[Boni and Liveright]] |year=1919 |oclc=2062036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Mrs. Crouch, a farmer’s wife, was making soap on her porch one sunny afternoon when she reported seeing the meat pieces fall from the sky. She said she was merely 40 steps from her house when the meat started to slap the ground. The meat looked grisly, according to Mrs. Crouch. Mrs. Crouch and her husband believed the event signified a sign from God. A similar event was later reported, but in Europe. The phenomenon was reported by ''[[Scientific American]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1876/03/10/81687268.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=Flesh Descending In A Shower.; An Astounding Phenomenon In Kentucky--Fresh Meat Like Mutton Or Venison Falling From A Clear Sky | date=March 10, 1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other publications at the time.&lt;ref name=Fort/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyh1"&gt;(21 March 1876).

'''Kim Jun''' (? - 1268) (김준) also known as '''Kim In-Jun''' or '''Musang''' was the ninth military leader who ruled during the late period of the [[Goryeo military regime]].

==Biography==

His father was Kim Yun-Seong, a slave who betrayed his master, [[Choe Chung-Heon]] and fight with [[Manjeok]]. Kim Jun had a brother, Kim Seung-Jun but later, he was renamed Kim Chung. He was good at riding and archery. In 1258, [[Choe Ui]] was overthrown and killed by Kim Jun and Yu Gyeong (1211–1289). Kim Jun became the new military ruler and shortly after that, Goryeo concluded a war with Mongols. 

However, Kim Jun's power was much weaker than those of his predecessors, because his regime was sustained by a small number of sympathizers who coincide with the coup d'etat. Kim Jun continued to insist on the war with mongols and in this context, he began to give power to his relatives in order to strengthen his power, led to corruption and resulted in violent clashes with a few supporters of the regime. [[Im Yeon]], who was an adopted child of Kim Jun, had a problem with Kim Chung and his wealth. 

The new king, [[Wonjong of Goryeo]] was an opponent of Kim Jun and scholars who had insisted on peace with Mongolia gained power. In 1268, [[Im Yeon]] assassinated Kim Jun and became the new military leader.
In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the [[Sambyeolcho]] under the order of [[Im Yeon]]. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince with the help from the Mongol force.

[[File:LincolnCatafalque.jpg|thumb|The Lincoln Catafalque on display]]

The '''Lincoln catafalque''' is a [[catafalque]] hastily constructed in 1865 to support the [[casket]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] while the president's body [[lay in state]] in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The catafalque has since been used for all those who have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda, as listed below. When not in use, the catafalque is kept in the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center]] in a small vaulted chamber. It was previously kept in an area called [[Washington's Tomb (United States Capitol)|Washington's Tomb]], which was originally intended, but never used, as the burial place for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]].

No law, written rule, or regulation specifies who may lie in state; use of the Rotunda is controlled by concurrent action of the House and Senate. Any person who has rendered distinguished service to the nation may lie in state if the family so wishes and [[United States Congress|Congress]] approves. In the case of unknown soldiers, the President or the appropriate branch of the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]] initiates the action.

[[File:RRFUNERAL-casket lowered in rounda.jpg|thumb|left|A ceremonial [[Guard of honour|Honor Guard]] prepares to move the flag-draped casket of former President [[Ronald Reagan]] during his [[state funeral]] in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.]]

[[United States Senator|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]] have lain in state on the catafalque elsewhere in the Capitol. An example of this was when the catafalque was used for the six hours that Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] lay in repose on the Senate floor on July 1, 2010. The catafalque has also been used seven times in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Building, for the lying in state of former [[Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] on July 11–12, 1974; former Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], January 27, 1993; former Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger|Warren Earl Burger]], June 28, 1995; former Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], July 28, 1997; Justice [[Harry A. Blackmun]], March 8, 1999, Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] on September 6–7, 2005, and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] on February 19, 2016. In addition, it was used in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] building on April 9–10, 1996, for the lying in state of [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Ronald H. Brown]].

[[File:Lincoln Catafalque for Senator Inouye (8294646220).jpg|thumb|right|The catafalque being moved into the rotunda for [[Daniel Inouye]]'s lying in state]]

The catafalque is a simple [[bier]] of rough pine boards nailed together and covered with black cloth. Although the base and platform have occasionally been altered to accommodate the larger size of modern coffins and for the ease of the attending military personnel, it is basically the same today as it was in Lincoln's time. Presently the catafalque measures {{convert|7|ft|1|in|cm}} long, {{convert|2|ft|6|in|cm}} wide, and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} high. The attached base is {{convert|8|ft|10|in|cm}} long, {{convert|4|ft|3+1/2|in|cm}} wide, and {{convert|2|in|cm}} high. The platform is {{convert|11|ft|1|in|cm}} long, {{convert|6|ft|cm}} wide, and {{convert|9+1/4|in|cm}} high. Although the cloth covering the catafalque has been replaced several times, the style of the drapery is similar to that used in 1865.

A list of those who have lain on the catafalque appears below.

==Ecology==
Lizardfolk are omnivores, though they have a preference for [[meat]].

===Environment===
Lizardfolk are normally found in temperate marshes and swamps. Lizardfolk are passable swimmers however, and may be found in underwater cave systems.

===Typical physical characteristics===
Lizardfolk are primitive [[reptilian humanoids]] typically standing from six to seven feet tall. Their scales are normally dull, earthy colors such as green, brown, or gray. They have a tail for balance, which measures three to four feet long. Typical weight is between 200 and 300 pounds (90 and 136&amp;nbsp;kg). There are several species of lizardfolk however, and these can range from {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pygmies to {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} giants.

===Alignment===
Lizardfolk are usually neutral.

==Society==
Lizardfolk society is primarily patriarchal, with the strongest member normally in charge. Shamans are typically counselors, and normally do not lead tribes. Wherever they make their home, survival is the main priority for any lizardfolk. Lizardfolk mostly worship the deity [[Semuanya]], whose main agenda is the reproduction and survival of the species.

==In various campaign settings==

===Mystara===
In the [[Mystara]] Campaign Setting most lizardfolk worship [[Ka the Preserver]].

===Spelljammer===
Lizardfolk are one of the primary factions in the [[Spelljammer]] Campaign Setting. They are thought to originally have been groundlings who were captured as slaves by humans or [[illithid|mind flayers]] and transported into wildspace. Lizardfolk in wildspace are more advanced than their groundling cousins. They often decorate their bodies with tattoos and body paint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]. ''[[Spelljammer: AD&amp;D Adventures in Space|AD&amp;D Adventures in Space]] - Concordance of Arcane Space'' (TSR 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacefaring lizardfolk believe that the advances in their race are due to increased proximity to the various suns of wildspace. They seek to continue the advancement of their race and deliberately fly ships containing lizardfolk eggs close to suns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]. ''[[Spelljammer: AD&amp;D Adventures in Space|AD&amp;D Adventures in Space]] - Lorebook of the Void'' (TSR 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lizardfolk mostly use the same sort of ships as humans, but have a special breeding ship design called the bloatfly. The bloatfly is a heavily armed vessel containing a large tank of water for incubating eggs. They are normally coated with black tar in order to retain as much heat as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Ed. ''SJR1 [[Lost Ships]]'' (TSR 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lizard men are available as player characters in this setting.&lt;ref name="Dragon #154"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rolston| first = Ken| authorlink = Ken Rolston| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #154| pages = 59–63| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcanis===
In the [[Arcanis]] Campaign Setting, lizardfolk are elevated to the point of being not only an important race but also a race playable as PCs. The lizardfolk of Arcanis are more often called Ss'ressen, and they are divided into several campaign-specific sub-races. Most Ss'ressen are part of the evil Ssethregoran Empire, though a few sub-races have separated geographically and theologically from their brethren to live in relative peace with mankind.

==Other publishers==
The lizardfolk is fully detailed in [[Paizo Publishing]]'s book ''Classic Monsters Revisited'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Baur|Baur, Wolfgang]], [[Jason Bulmahn]], Joshua J. Frost, [[James Jacobs (game designer)|James Jacobs]], Nicolas Logue, Mike McArtor, James L. Sutter, [[Greg A. Vaughan]], Jeremy Walker. ''Classic Monsters Revisited'' (Paizo, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MS ''Berge Vanga''''' was an [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] with {{DWT|227,912|metric|disp=long}}.  The ship was owned by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[shipping]] company [[Bergesen d.y. ASA|Sig. Bergesen d.y.]] and registered in [[Liberia]]. The ship had build number 300 at the [[Uljanik]] shipyard in the port city [[Pula]] in [[Croatia]] where it was built in 1974.

The ship was en route from [[Brazil]] to [[Japan]] with [[iron ore]] when contact was lost with the vessel in the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] from 29 October 1979. The ship vanished and the ensuing search operation yielded no results. 40 people lost their lives.

Some debris that could resemble parts from the tanker was found but no people. Still very little is known about the disaster, and the hearing after the accident was held behind closed doors. The principal theory holds that the cause could have been explosions caused by oil residue in the cargo compartments. MS ''Berge Vanga'' was, like its sister ship {{MS|Berge Istra}} which disappeared under similar circumstances four years earlier, a ship which could transport both oil and iron ore. After these two disappearances no more combination ships like this were built, and oil was never again transported alongside ore.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In [[philosophy]], '''moral responsibility''' is the status of [[morality|morally]] [[desert (philosophy)|deserving]] [[praise]], [[blame]], [[reward (psychology)|reward]], or [[punishment]] for an act or omission performed or neglected in accordance with one's [[moral obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Klein |first= Martha |authorlink= Martha Klein |editor-first= Ted |editor-last= Honderich |editor-link = Ted Honderich | encyclopedia = Oxford Companion to Philosophy | title = responsibility | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2205 | year = 2005 | quote = The term 'moral responsibility' covers (i) the having of a moral obligation and (ii) the fulfilment of the criteria for deserving blame or praise (punishment or reward) for a morally significant act or omission.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding what (if anything) counts as "morally obligatory" is a principal concern of [[ethics]].

Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as [[moral agents]]. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form [[intention]]s about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of [[free will]] has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. [[Incompatibilist]]s regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas [[compatibilist]]s think the two can coexist.
 
Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to [[legal liability |legal responsibility]]. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Philosophical stance==
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|220px|Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over [[determinism]] and free will]]
Depending on how a philosopher conceives of [[free will]], they will have different views on moral responsibility.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite book |title=Responsibility in Law and Morality |author=Peter Cave |page =4 |quote=A common argument in the philosophical literature is that the essence of responsibility is to be found in what it means to be a human agent and to have free will...There is disagreement amongst philosophers about what freedom means, about whether human beings are free in the relevant sense, and about the relevance of freedom to responsibility... Nevertheless,...our responsibility practices have developed, and thrive, independently of ‘the truth’ about human freedom.|isbn=1841133213 |year=2002 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibilism===
{{main article|Incompatibilism}}

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{main article|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[Metaphysical libertarian]]s think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; they think that if causal determinism were true of human action; people would not have free will. Accordingly, libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfolk, Robert L.|first=Doris, John M., and Brianna, John M.|contribution=Identification, Situational Constraint, and Social Cognition: Studies in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahmias, Eddy, |first=Morris, Stephen G., Nadelhoffer, Thomas N., and Turner, Jason|contribution=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: "...we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse".&lt;ref name="Sartre2"&gt;Sartre, J.P. (1943)''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has it that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions "reflect on their character". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vuoso, G. (1987) "Background Responsibility and Excuse," ''Yale Law Journal'', 96, pp. 1680–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, R. "Culpability" and Mental Disorder", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The [[insanity defense]]—or its corollary, [[diminished responsibility]] (a sort of appeal to the [[fallacy of the single cause]])—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. &amp; Shapiro, D. L. 2003 "Evaluation of criminal responsibility". In ''Forensic psychology.'' vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).

=====The argument from luck=====

The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside that person's control. It may not be reasonable, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/|title=Moral Luck|date=January 26, 2004|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Nagel]] suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of ''drunk driving'' might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1976, "Moral Luck", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument can be traced back to [[David Hume]]. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main article|Hard determinism}}
[[Hard determinist]]s (not to be confused with [[Fatalist]]s) often use [[liberty]] in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say "So much the worse for free will!".&lt;ref name="Ben1"&gt;Benditt, Theodore (1998) ''Philosophy Then and Now'' with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55786-742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, [[Leopold and Loeb]], by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence, 1924, "The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During his summation, he declared:

{{quote|What has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay.&lt;ref name="Darrow"/&gt;}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul, "Epistle to the Romans", 9:21, ''King James Bible'' Tennessee:The Gideons International&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God.

Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuroethics]], argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]) intuitions.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). "For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'', 359, 1775–1785.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research (e.g. [[neuroscience of free will]]) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid [[psychosis]], but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the [[frontal lobe]] reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.&lt;ref name = "Brower"&gt;Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). "Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', 71: 720–726.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,&lt;ref name = "SteinScott"&gt;Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). "Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty".''American Psychologist'' 58, 1009–1018.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.&lt;ref name = "TAPANK"&gt;Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). "The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment". ''Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews'', 27: 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them.

[[File:Prision del Condado de Mantras.JPG|thumb|right|180px|David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.html David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of [[justice]], in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of [[Ethical realism|ethically realistic]] and [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will.

Neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the "sentencing phase" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman/&gt;

====Hard incompatibilism====
[[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] defends a skeptical position about free will he calls [[hard incompatibilism]]. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing.&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title="Defending Hard Incompatibilism". In "Free Will and Moral Responsibility." |year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-3810-6|pages=228–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2001), ''Living without Free Will'', Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), ''Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{main article|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Handcuffs-20060604.jpg|thumb|right|Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term ''free will'' should only be used to mean something more like liberty.]]

Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad Gita]]'' offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: "... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave..." When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself.&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhagavad Gita|year=1962|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda also said, "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inspirational Thought for Each Day|year=1977|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the ''Bhagavad Gita{{'}}''s point about agents and natural forces, writing "men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes]."&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"/&gt; Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: "Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?"&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"/&gt; Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baruch Spinoza|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
[[Daniel Dennett]] asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be "a purely metaphysical hankering".&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;Dennett, D., (1984) ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. Bradford Books. {{ISBN|0-262-54042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
Mauro suggests that a sense of personal responsibility does not operate or evolve universally among humankind. He argues that it was absent in the successful civilization of the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, research in [[experimental philosophy]] has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eddy |last=Nahmias|author2=Stephen Morris |author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer |author4=Jason Turner  |title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive? |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=28–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaun|last=Nichols |authorlink=Shaun Nichols |author2=[[Joshua Knobe]]  |title=Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions |journal=[[Noûs]] |volume=41 |issue=4|pages=663–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00666.x |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neuroscience of free will investigates various experiments that might shed light on free will.

==Collective==
{{Main article|Collective responsibility}}
When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/collecti.htm ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''] (Accessed 8 Sept 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[South Africa]] had an [[apartheid]] regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non-European South Africans.

==Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths==
One of the attributes defined for [[psychopathy]] is "failure to accept responsibility for own actions".&lt;ref name=factorstructure&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R. D., &amp; Hakstian, A. R.|title=Two-factor conceptualization of psychopathy: Construct validity and assessment implications.|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–17|year=1989|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.1.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial systems ==

The emergence of [[Outline of automation|automation, robotics and related technologies]] prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?'&lt;ref name="Allen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Varner|first2=Gary|last3=Zinser|first3=Jason|title=Prolegomena to any future artificial moral agent|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=2000|volume=12|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1080/09528130050111428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Smit|first2=Iva|last3=Wallach|first3=Wendell|title=Artificial Morality: Top-down, Bottom-up and Hybrid Approaches|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparrow|first1=Robert|title=Killer Robots|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grodzinsky|first1=Frances S.|last2=Miller|first2=Keith W.|last3=Wolf|first3=Marty J.|title=The ethics of designing artificial agents|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=21 Jun 2008|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=115–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuflik|first1=Arthur|title=Computers in control: Rational transfer of authority or irresponsible abdication of autonomy?|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1023/A:1010087500508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions ''arguably'' adjoin with but are distinct from [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems.  Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate.

=== Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible ===

Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr posited that [[intentionality]] is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Kahn, Jr.|first2=Peter H.|title=Human Agency and Responsible Computing: Implications for Computer System Design|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=January 1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(92)90075-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers.&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999" /&gt;

Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as [[finite state machines]].  They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008" /&gt;

Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans.  He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014.  An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour.  Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Artificial moral agents are infeasible with foreseeable technologies|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=13 May 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1007/s10676-014-9345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"/&gt;)

=== Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible ===

Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'.&lt;ref name="Allen2000"/&gt; They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the [[Turing Test]].&lt;ref name="Allen2005" /&gt;

Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription.  He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators.  First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means.  Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means.  Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthias|first1=Andreas|title=The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=175–183|doi=10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neurochip''' is a chip ([[integrated circuit]]/[[microprocessor]]) that is designed for the interaction with [[neuron]]al cells.

== Formation ==

It is made of silicon that is doped in such a way that it contains [[EOSFET]]s (electrolyte-oxide-semiconductor [[FET]]) that can sense the electrical activity of the neurons ([[action potential]]s) in the above-standing physiological [[electrolyte]] solution. It also contains [[capacitor]]s for the electrical stimulation of the neurons. [[The University of Calgary]], [[Faculty of Medicine of the University of Calgary|Faculty of Medicine]] scientists led by Pakistani born Canadian scientist Naweed Syed who proved it is possible to cultivate a network of brain cells that reconnect on a silicon chip—or the brain on a microchip—have developed new technology that monitors brain cell activity at a resolution never achieved before.

Developed with the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council Canada]] (NRC), the new silicon chips are also simpler to use, which will help future understanding of how brain cells work under normal conditions and permit drug discoveries for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

[[Naweed Syed]]'s lab cultivated brain cells on a microchip.
The new technology from the lab of Naweed Syed, in collaboration with the NRC, was published online in August 2010, in the journal, Biomedical Devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/calgary-scientists-to-create-human-neurochip/article1368807/ |title=Calgary scientists to create human 'neurochip' |author=Carolyn Abraham |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This technical breakthrough means we can track subtle changes in brain activity at the level of ion channels and synaptic potentials, which are also the most suitable target sites for drug development in neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychological disorders," says Syed, professor and head of the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute and advisor to the Vice President Research on Biomedical Engineering Initiative of the University of Chicago.

The new neurochips are also automated, meaning that anyone can learn to place individual brain cells on them. Previously it took years of training to learn how to record ion channel activity from brain cells, and it was only possible to monitor one or two cells simultaneously. Now, larger networks of cells can be placed on a chip and observed in minute detail, allowing the analysis of several brain cells networking and performing automatic, large-scale drug screening for various brain dysfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/coming-soon-human-brain-on-a-microchip-15348.html |title=Coming Soon: Human Brain On A Microchip |publisher=Coming Soon: Human Brain On A Microchip |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new technology has the potential to help scientists in a variety of fields and on a variety of research projects. Gerald Zamponi, professor and head of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, and member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, says, “This technology can likely be scaled up such that it will become a novel tool for medium throughput drug screening, in addition to its usefulness for basic biomedical research”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/neurochips-monitor-cells-at-unprecedented-resolution/1004295.article |title=Neurochips monitor cells at unprecedented resolution |publisher=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]] |date=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In previous studies, researchers developed a neurochip that could directly stimulate and record brain cell activity. Now, Orly Yadid-Pecht and Naweed Syed have successfully developed a novel lab-on-a-chip technology that, through an ultra-sensitive component built directly on the microchip, also enables direct imaging of activity in brain cells."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/august1-2012/neurochip "New advances for neurochip" UToday, University of Calgary August 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3997">'''Nysa''' or '''Nyssa''' ({{lang-el|Νύσ(σ)α}}, flourished early 2nd century BC) was a [[Seleucid Empire|Greek Seleucid princess]] and a queen of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]].

==Biography==
Nysa was of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonian]] and [[Persian people|Persian descent]]. She was a daughter the Seleucid Prince [[Antiochus (son of Antiochus III the Great)|Antiochus]] and Seleucid Queen [[Laodice IV]].&lt;ref name="LaodiceIV"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/la-ld/laodice/laodice_iv.html Laodice IV], at ''Livius.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were blood siblings and her parent’s marriage was the first sibling marriage to occur in the Seleucid dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, ''A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer'' p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The grandparents of Nysa were the Seleucid King [[Antiochus III the Great]] and Seleucid Queen [[Laodice III]].&lt;ref name="LaodiceIV"/&gt; Her father Antiochus, was appointed by Antiochus III to succeed him as his first heir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/am-ao/antiochus/antiochus_iii.html Antiochus III], at ''Livius.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nysa was born between 196 BC and 193 BC.  In 193 BC, her father had died. Her family grieved over his death, in particular Antiochus III.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, ''A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer'' pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Laodice IV, later married her brothers [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] and [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], who were both uncles and stepfathers of Nysa.&lt;ref name="LaodiceIV"/&gt; Through her mother’s marriages, she had various half brothers and sisters. 

In the year 172 BC or 171 BC, thanks to the diplomatic efforts of her maternal half-brother Seleucid King [[Demetrius I Soter]], Nysa married the King [[Pharnaces I of Pontus]].&lt;ref name="LaodiceIV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, ''A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer'' p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage between Pharnaces and Nysa represented a continuation and a strengthening of the pro-Seleucid orientation of Pontus' foreign policy. Through his marriage to Nysa, Pharnaces tried to increase his political influence and Pontian power and affairs in foreign political relations with the [[Roman Republic]] and across [[Anatolia]]. Nysa and Pharnaces were related as he was a first cousin to Nysa’s parents, thus Pharnaces was related to the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known on Nysa’s relationship with Pharnaces and how she reigned as Queen of Pontus.

Honorific statues and inscriptions have survived that were dedicated to Nysa. Pharnaces set about establishing good relations with the citizens of [[Athens]] and the Greek island of [[Delos]]. Pharnaces made a donation to the people of Athens. While the exact nature of the donation is unknown, it is thought that Pharnaces' donation to Athens occurred soon after 183 BC.&lt;ref name="McGing"&gt;McGing, ''The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus'' p.32&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy inscription from the Athenians on Delos honours Pharnaces and Nysa. Pharnaces and Nysa received a crown of gold from them and bronze statues of themselves were set up on Delos. Their lengthy Athenian honorific inscription, is dated during the [[Eponymous archon|archonship]] of the Athenian Tychandrus or Tychander which is now generally accepted to around 160 BC or 159 BC.&lt;ref name="McGing"/&gt;

Nysa bore Pharnaces two children: a son called [[Mithridates V of Pontus]] and a daughter called [[Nysa of Cappadocia]], who was also known as [[Nysa of Cappadocia|Laodice]]. Nysa is believed to have died during childbirth.

'''Pesticide resistance''' describes the decreased susceptibility of a pest population to a [[pesticide]] that was previously effective at controlling the pest. Pest species evolve pesticide resistance via [[natural selection]]: the most resistant specimens survive and pass on their acquired [[heritable]] changes traits to their offspring.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;PBS (2001), [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/1/l_101_02.html Pesticide resistance]. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases of resistance have been reported in all classes of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] (''i.e.'' crop diseases, weeds, rodents, ''etc.''), with 'crises' in insect control occurring early-on after the introduction of pesticide use in the 20th century.  The [[Insecticide Resistance Action Committee]] (IRAC) definition of [[insecticide]] resistance is 'a [[genetic inheritance|heritable]] change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Insecticide Resistance Action Committee |date=2007 |url=http://www.irac-online.org/documents/irac-croplife-irm-booklet/?ext=pdf |title=Resistance Definition |accessdate=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticide resistance is increasing. Farmers in the [[United States|US]] lost 7% of their crops to pests in the 1940s; over the 1980s and 1990s, the loss was 13%, even though more pesticides were being used.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; Over 500 species of pests have evolved a resistance to a pesticide.&lt;ref&gt;grapes.msu.edu. [http://grapes.msu.edu/pesticideResist.htm How pesticide resistance develops] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817232842/http://grapes.msu.edu/pesticideResist.htm |date=2007-08-17 }}.

Thompson Learning, Inc. Pacific Grove, California. Chapter 9, Pages 211-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the evolution of pesticide resistance is usually discussed as a result of pesticide use, it is important to keep in mind that pest populations can also adapt to non-chemical methods of control. For example, the northern corn rootworm (''[[Diabrotica]] barberi'') became adapted to a corn-soybean [[crop rotation]] by spending the year when field is planted to soybeans in a [[diapause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = E | last2 = Oloumi-Sadeghi | first2 = H | last3 = Fisher | first3 = JR | year = 1992 | title = Discovery of multiyear diapause in Illinois and South Dakota Northern corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) eggs and incidence of the prolonged diapause trait in Illinois | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Entomology | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 262–267 | doi=10.1093/jee/85.1.262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, few new [[weed killer]]s are near commercialization, and none with a novel, resistance-free mode of action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1329.full|title = What Happens When Weed Killers Stop Killing?|last = Service|first = Robert F.|date = 20 September 2013|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.341.6152.1329|pmid = 24052282|access-date = December 2014|issue = 6152|page = 1329|volume = 341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Pesticide resistance probably stems from multiple factors:

Many pest species produce large broods. This increases the probability of mutations and ensures the rapid expansion of resistant populations.

Pest species had been exposed to natural toxins long before agriculture began. For example, many plants produce [[phytotoxins]] to protect them from herbivores. As a result, coevolution of herbivores and their host plants required development of the physiological capability to detoxify or tolerate poisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferro | first1 = DN | year = 1993 | title = Potential for resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis: Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) – a model system | url = | journal = American Entomologist | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 38–44 | doi=10.1093/ae/39.1.38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop BA and EJ Grafius. 1996. Insecticide resistance in the Colorado potato beetle. In: P Jolivet and TH Hsiao. Chrysomelidae Biology, Volume 1. SBP Academic Publishing, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans often rely almost exclusively on pesticides for pest control. This increases selection pressure towards resistance. Pesticides that fail to break down quickly contribute to selection for resistant strains even after they are no longer being applied.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly H, Doyen JT, and Purcell AH III (1998), ''Introduction to insect biology and diversity'', 2nd edition. Oxford University Press. New York, New York. Chapter 14, Pages 279-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to resistance, managers may increase pesticide quantities/frequency, which exacerbates the problem. In addition, some pesticides are toxic toward species that feed on or compete with pests. This can allow the pest population to expand, requiring more pesticides. This is sometimes referred to as ''pesticide trap'',&lt;ref name="Marten"&gt;Marten, Gerry [http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/indepth/indiapest.html "Non-pesticide management" for escaping the pesticide trap in Andrah Padesh, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060430/http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/indepth/indiapest.html |date=2007-09-28 }}. ecotippingpoints.org. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''pesticide treadmill'', since farmers progressively pay more for less benefit.&lt;ref name="sustaining" /&gt;

Insect predators and parasites generally have smaller populations and are less likely to evolve resistance than are pesticides' primary targets, such as mosquitoes and those that feed on plants. Weakening them allows the pests to flourish.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;  Alternatively, resistant predators can be bred in laboratories.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

Pests with limited diets are more likely to evolve resistance, because they are exposed to higher pesticide concentrations and has less opportunity to breed with unexposed populations.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

Pests with shorter [[generation time]]s develop resistance more quickly than others.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

==Examples==
Resistance has evolved in multiple species: resistance to [[insecticide]]s was first documented by A. L. Melander in 1914 when scale insects demonstrated resistance to an inorganic insecticide. Between 1914 and 1946, 11 additional cases were recorded. The development of organic insecticides, such as [[DDT]], gave hope that insecticide resistance was a dead issue. However, by 1947 [[housefly]] resistance to DDT had evolved. With the introduction of every new insecticide class – [[cyclodiene]]s, [[carbamates]], [[Formamidinium |formamidines]], [[organophosphates]], [[pyrethroids]], even ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' – cases of resistance surfaced within two to 20 years.

* Studies in America have shown that [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to [[malathion]].&lt;ref&gt;Doris Stanley (January 1996), [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3741/is_n1_v44/ai_18019289 Natural product outdoes malathion - alternative pest control strategy]. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Hawaii]], [[Japan]] and [[Tennessee]], the [[diamondback moth]] evolved a resistance to ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' about three years after it began to be used heavily.&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt;
* In England, rats in certain areas have evolved resistance that allows them to consume up to five times as much [[rat poison]] as normal rats without dying.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;
* DDT is no longer effective in preventing [[malaria]] in some places.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;
* In the southern United States, ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'', which interferes with [[cotton]] production, has evolved resistance to the herbicide [[glyphosate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/08/27/monsantos_bane/index.html Andrew Leonard, "Monsanto's bane: The evil pigweed", [[Salon.com]], Aug. 27, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Colorado potato beetle]] has evolved resistance to 52 different compounds belonging to all major insecticide classes. Resistance levels vary across populations and between [[beetle]] life stages, but in some cases can be very high (up to 2,000-fold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alyokhin | first1=A. | last2=Baker | first2=M. | last3=Mota-Sanchez | first3=D. | last4=Dively | first4=G. | last5=Grafius | first5=E. | year=2008 | title=Colorado potato beetle resistance to insecticides | url=| journal=American Journal of Potato Research | volume=85 | issue=| pages=395–413 | doi=10.1007/s12230-008-9052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple and cross-resistance==
* Multiple-resistance pests are resistant to more than one class of pesticide.&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt; This can happen when pesticides are used in sequence, with a new class replacing one to which pests display resistance with another.&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt; 
* [[Cross-resistance]], a related phenomenon, occurs when the genetic mutation that made the pest resistant to one pesticide also makes it resistant to others, often those with a similar [[mechanism of action]].&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt;

==Adaptation==
Pests becomes resistant by evolving physiological changes that protect them from the chemical.&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt;

One protection mechanism is to increase the number of copies of a [[gene]], allowing the organism to produce more of a protective [[enzyme]] that breaks the pesticide into less toxic chemicals.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt; Such enzymes include [[esterase]]s, [[glutathione transferase]]s, and mixed [[microsomal]] [[oxidase]]s.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

Alternatively, the number and/or sensitivity of [[biochemical receptor]]s that bind to the pesticide may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

Behavioral resistance has been described for some chemicals. For example, some ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquitoes]] evolved a preference for resting outside that kept them away from pesticide sprayed on interior walls.&lt;ref name="Berenbaum"&gt;Berenbaum M (1994) Bugs in the System. Perseus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance may involve rapid excretion of toxins, secretion of them within the body away from vulnerable tissues and decreased penetration through the body wall.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, S.J. 2008. The Toxicology and Biochemistry of Insecticides. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation in only a single gene can lead to the evolution of a resistant organism. In other cases, multiple genes are involved. Resistant genes are usually autosomal. This means that they are located on [[autosomes]] (as opposed to [[allosome]]s, also known as sex chromosomes). As a result, resistance is inherited similarly in males and females. Also, resistance is usually inherited as an incompletely dominant trait. When a resistant individual mates with a susceptible individual, their progeny generally has a level of resistance intermediate between the parents.

Adaptation to pesticides comes with an evolutionary cost, usually decreasing relative fitness of organisms in the absence of pesticides. Resistant individuals often have reduced reproductive output, life expectancy, mobility, etc. Non-resistant individuals grow in frequency in the absence of pesticides, offering one way to combat resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Stenersen, J. 2004. Chemical Pesticides: Mode of Action and Toxicology. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calliphoridae|Blowfly]] maggots produce an enzyme that confers resistance to [[organochloride]] insecticides. Scientists have researched ways to use this enzyme to break down pesticides in the environment, which would detoxify them and prevent harmful environmental effects. A similar enzyme produced by soil bacteria that also breaks down organochlorides works faster and remains stable in a variety of conditions.&lt;ref name="marino M"&gt;Marino M.

==Management==
{{Main|Integrated pest management}}[[integrated pest management|Integrated pest management (IPM)]] approach provides a balanced approach to minimizing resistance.

Resistance can be managed by reducing use of a pesticide. This allows non-resistant organisms to out-compete resistant strains. They can later be killed by returning to use of the pesticide.

A complementary approach is to site untreated refuges near treated croplands where susceptible pests can survive.&lt;ref name="Boerboom" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Onstad, D.W. 2008. Insect Resistance Management. Elsevier: Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

When pesticides are the sole or predominant method of pest control, resistance is commonly managed through pesticide rotation. This involves switching among pesticide classes with different modes of action to delay or mitigate pest resistance.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;Graeme Murphy (December 1, 2005), [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/hort/news/grower/2005/12gn05a2.htm Resistance Management - Pesticide Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013135858/http://omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/hort/news/grower/2005/12gn05a2.htm |date=2007-10-13 }}.

Two or more pesticides with different modes of action can be tankmixed on the farm to improve results and delay or mitigate existing pest resistance.&lt;ref name="Boerboom"&gt;Chris Boerboom (March 2001), [https://web.archive.org/web/20071220152856/http://128.104.239.6/uw_weeds/extension/articles/glyphres.htm Glyphosate resistant weeds]. Weed Science - University of Wisconsin. Retrieved on September 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==

=== Glyphosate ===
[[Glyphosate]]-resistant weeds are now present in the vast majority of [[soybean]], [[cotton]], and [[corn]] farms in some U.S. states. Weeds resistant to multiple herbicide modes of action are also on the rise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Before glyphosate, most herbicides would kill a limited number of weed species, forcing farmers to continually [[crop rotation|rotate their crops]] and herbicides to prevent resistance. Glyphosate disrupts the ability of most plants to construct new proteins. Glyphosate-tolerant [[transgenic crops]] are not affected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A weed family that includes waterhemp (''[[Amaranthus rudis]]'') has developed glyphosate-resistant strains. A 2008 to 2009 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 Missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69%. Weed surveys from some 500 sites throughout Iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In response to the rise in glyphosate resistance, farmers turned to other herbicides—applying several in a single season. In the United States, most midwestern and southern farmers continue to use glyphosate because it still controls most weed species, applying other herbicides, known as residuals, to deal with resistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of multiple herbicides appears to have slowed the spread of glyphosate resistance. From 2005 through 2010 researchers discovered 13 different weed species that had developed resistance to glyphosate. From 2010-2014 only two more were discovered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2013 Missouri survey showed that multiply-resistant weeds had spread. 43% of the sampled weed populations were resistant to two different herbicides, 6% to three and 0.5% to four. In Iowa a survey revealed dual resistance in 89% of waterhemp populations, 25% resistant to three and 10% resistant to five.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Resistance increases pesticide costs. For southern cotton, herbicide costs climbed from between $50 and $75 per hectare a few years ago to about $370 per hectare in 2014. In the South, resistance contributed to the shift that reduced cotton planting by 70% in Arkansas and 60% in Tennessee. For soybeans in Illinois, costs rose from about $25 to $160 per hectare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''B. thuringiensis'' ===
During 2009 and 2010, some Iowa fields showed severe injury to corn producing [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] toxin [[Cry3Bb1]] by [[western corn rootworm]]. During 2011, mCry3A corn also displayed insect damage, including [[cross-resistance]] between these toxins. Resistance persisted and spread in Iowa. Bt corn that targets western corn rootworm does not produce a high dose of Bt toxin, and displays less resistance than that seen in a high-dose Bt crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/14/5141.full.pdf|title = Field-evolved resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple Bacillus thuringiensis toxins in transgenic maize|first = Aaron J. |last=Gassmann

Products such as Capture LFR (containing the [[pyrethroid]] [[Bifenthrin]]) and SmartChoice (containing a pyrethroid and an [[organophosphate]]) have been increasingly used to complement Bt crops that farmers find alone to be unable to prevent insect-driven injury. Multiple studies have found the practice to be either ineffective or to accelerate the development of resistant strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-10/war-on-cornfield-pest-sparks-clash-over-insecticide.html|title = War on Cornfield Pest Sparks Clash Over Insecticide|last = Kaskey|first = Jack|date = June 11, 2014|work = Bloomberg News|accessdate = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip of Alsace''' (1143 – 1 August 1191) was [[count of Flanders]] from 1168 to 1191. He succeeded his father [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]].

==History and Family==

===Count of Flanders===

His reign began in 1157, while he acted as regent and co-count for his father, Thierry, who was away on [[crusade]].{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|p=71}} He defeated [[Floris III, Count of Holland]] and stopped the piracy. Floris was captured in [[Bruges]] and remained in prison until 1167, at which point he was being ransomed in exchange for recognition of Flemish suzerainty over [[Zeeland]]. By inheritance, Philip also recovered for Flanders the territories of [[Waasland]] and Quatre-Métiers.

In 1159, Philip married [[Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois|Elisabeth of Vermandois]], also known as Isabelle, elder daughter of count [[Raoul I, Count of Vermandois|Raoul I of Vermandois]] and [[Petronilla of Aquitaine]].{{sfn|Baldwin|1986|p=15}} When his brother-in-law died (1167), his wife inherited the county of Vermandois. This pushed Flemish authority further south, to its greatest extent thus far, and threatened to completely alter the balance of power in northern France.

Philip governed wisely with the aid of Robert d'Aire, whose role was almost that of a prime minister. They established an effective administrative system and Philip's foreign relations were excellent.  He mediated in disputes between [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Henry II of England]], between Henry II and [[Thomas Becket]], and arranged the marriage of his sister [[Margaret I, Countess of Flanders|Margaret]] with [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut]].

Philip and Elisabeth were childless. In 1175, Philip discovered that Elisabeth was committing adultery and had her lover, Walter de Fontaines, beaten to death.{{sfn|Gislebertus (of Mons)|2005|p=34 note138}} Philip then obtained complete control of her lands in Vermandois from King [[Louis VII of France]]. Philip's brothers [[Matthew of Alsace|Matthew]] and Peter of Alsace also died, so in 1177, before going on crusade, he designated Margaret and Baldwin as his heirs.

===Philip's first crusade===

In the [[Holy Land]], Philip hoped to take part in a planned invasion of [[Egypt]], for which purpose the crusaders had allied with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. A Byzantine fleet of 150 galleys was waiting at [[Acre (city)|Acre]] when Philip arrived on 2 August. Philip had other plans, however. He and King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]] were first cousins, sharing a grandfather, [[Fulk of Jerusalem|King Fulk]], whose daughter from his first marriage, [[Sibylla of Anjou]], was Philip's mother. Baldwin IV was a [[leper]] and childless, and offered Philip the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] as his closest male relative currently present there. Philip refused both this and the command of the army of the kingdom, saying he was there only as a pilgrim. Instead Baldwin appointed [[Raynald of Châtillon]], to whom Philip would act as an assistant. As [[William of Tyre]] says, "this being the situation, the count at last revealed the secret thought of his mind and did not try to conceal to what end all his plans were." He had come to have his own vassals married to his cousins, Baldwin's sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] and half-sister [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella]].

Sibylla's husband [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]] had just died, leaving her pregnant with the future [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]].  William of Tyre, the chief negotiator in this dispute, told the count it would be improper to marry her off again so soon. According to the chronicle of [[Ernoul]], Philip was also rebuffed by [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], who also claimed the regency, as well as by Raymond's supporters from the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]], who hoped to marry the princesses into their own family. [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] insulted the count in public. Philip left Jerusalem in October to campaign in the north for the [[Principality of Antioch]], participating in an unsuccessful siege of [[Harim]] before returning home. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance against Egypt was abandoned.  In November, Baldwin IV and Raynald defeated [[Saladin]] at the [[Battle of Montgisard]].

===War with France===

Philip returned from Palestine in 1179, at which point Louis VII, now sick, named him guardian of his young son [[Philip II of France|Philip II]].  One year later, Philip of Alsace had his protégé married to his niece, [[Isabelle of Hainaut]], offering the [[County of Artois]] and other Flemish territories as dowry, much to the dismay of Baldwin V.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, pp. 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt; When Louis VII died, Philip II began to assert his independence. War broke out in 1180. [[Picardy]] and [[Île-de-France]] were devastated.  King Philip refused to give open battle and gained the upper hand.  Baldwin V, at first allied with his brother-in-law, intervened in 1184 on behalf of his son-in-law, King Philip, in support of his daughter's interests.&lt;ref name="Wolff282"&gt;Wolff, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between Count Philip and Baldwin was encouraged by King Philip, who went so far as to name Baldwin his representative in negotiations with the Count.

Count Philip's wife, Elisabeth, died in 1183, prompting King Philip II to seize the province of [[Vermandois]] on behalf of Elisabeth's sister, Eleonore. Philip then remarried, to [[Theresa of Portugal, Countess of Flanders|Matilda]], daughter of [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]], the first King of Portugal. Philip gave Matilda a [[dower]] that included a number of major Flemish towns, in an apparent slight to Baldwin V.&lt;ref name="Wolff282"/&gt; Fearing that he would be surrounded by the royal domain of France and the [[County of Hainaut]], Count Philip signed a [[peace treaty]] with King Philip II and Count Baldwin V on 10 March 1186, recognizing the cession of Vermandois to the king, although he was allowed to retain the title [[Count of Vermandois]] for the remainder of his life.

===Philip's second crusade and death===

In 1190, Philip took the cross for a second time and joined the Flemish contingents which had already gone to Palestine. After arriving at the [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|Siege of Acre]], he was stricken by the epidemic passing through the crusader camp, and died on 1 August 1191.{{sfn|Bryant|2015|p=1}} His body was brought back to Flanders by his wife, who acted as regent during his absence. Philip was buried in [[Clairvaux Abbey]]. Since he was unsuccessful in producing an heir with Countess Matilda, he was succeeded by his sister Margaret and his brother-in-law, Baldwin, who thereupon ruled as Baldwin VII of Flanders.&lt;ref name="Wolff282"/&gt;

===Legacy===

Philip seems to represent the end of one kind of feudal world and the beginning of a new type of sovereignty, put into practice by King Philip: for the first time, a king of France ruled over a count of Flanders. Despite a costly war, the economic expansion of Flanders did not stop, as witnessed by the number of communal charters signed by Count Philip.  By the end of his reign, the county had entered into a period of unprecedented prosperity.

Philip may have been the patron of [[Chrétien de Troyes]] while he was writing his last romance, ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''.&lt;ref name="NAEChretien"&gt;Lacy, Norris J. (1991). "Chrétien de Troyes". In Norris J. Lacy, ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 88–91. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening lines, Chrétien honours Philip with "excessive praise" (Roach, Frappier, Hilka, et al.) for providing him with the book he adapted into the "best tale ever told in a royal court". The work, which was obviously begun sometime before Philip's death, remains unfinished.

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Pokémon Black Version''''' and '''''White Version'''''|ポケットモンスター ブラック・ホワイト|Poketto Monsutā Burakku &amp; Howaito|"Pocket Monsters: Black &amp; White"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]] developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. They are the first installments in the fifth [[Pokémon#Generations|generation]] of the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series of role-playing games.&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/bw/index.html |script-title=ja:『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sv9suCz9?url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/ |archivedate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; First released in Japan on September 18, 2010, they were later released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and Australia on March 10, 2011.

Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young Pokémon trainer through the region of [[Pokémon Black and White#Setting|Unova]], as they train Pokémon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. ''Black'' and ''White'' introduced 156 new Pokémon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Red'' and ''Blue'']], as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pokémon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pokémon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' [[Pokédex]].

Upon their release, ''Black'' and ''White'' received positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay, as well as several of the new Pokémon introduced; much acclaim went to the unique, complex plot. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, ''Black'' and ''White'' sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, making it one of the best selling DS games to date. As of September 2017, the games' combined sales have reached 15.64 million, putting the titles amongst [[List of best-selling Nintendo DS video games|the best selling games for the Nintendo DS]], but still being outsold by their predecessors, [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']].&lt;ref name="sep17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/software/ds.html |title=Top Selling Software Sales Units - Nintendo DS Software |date=2017-09-30 |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2018-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427092514/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/software/ds.html |archivedate=2016-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sequels to ''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'', [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Pokémon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], were released in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]] in June 2012, with October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia.

==Gameplay==
{{main|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements, presented in a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third-person]], [[overhead perspective]].&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; There are three basic screens: an [[overworld]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player controls a Pokémon Trainer who begins the game with a single Pokémon&lt;ref name="m7"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and is able to capture more using [[Poké Ball]]s.&lt;ref name="m19"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all other Trainers, the player can carry up to six Pokémon at one time. However, the game also includes a network of PCs to store hundreds of Pokémon. PCs are found in certain buildings—namely, "Pokémon Centers", where the player heals their Pokémon with low health.&lt;ref name="m21"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Pokémon evolve into other forms when certain conditions are met, such as when they reach a certain [[levels up|level]]—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain [[item (gaming)|item]] used on them.&lt;ref name="m20"/&gt; They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent.&lt;ref name="m18"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum [[health (gaming)|HP]] (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can have one or two types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/snivy|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TNYpaXzn?url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/snivy|archivedate=2014-10-17|deadurl=no|publisher=Pokemon.com|accessdate=2014-10-16|title=Snivy / Pokédex|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pokémon]] or is challenged by another Trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may [[Types of Pokémon moves|fight]], use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee. However, the player cannot flee a battle against another Trainer or against certain wild Pokémon that are stronger than the player's. When a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints until it is revived.&lt;ref name="m17 18"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; If an opposing Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon who participated in defeating it receive [[experience point]]s. After accumulating enough experience points, a Pokémon may level up, increasing its stats.&lt;ref name="m20"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Pokémon evolve into other forms, usually by reaching certain levels.&lt;ref name="m20"/&gt; At the "Day Care" location, the player can breed two of their Pokémon—usually, a male and a female—to create Eggs that hatch into baby Pokémon at level 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Day Care Lady:''' I'm the Day Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. What do you want to do today?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world of ''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'', known as Unova, consists of a number of cities and towns connected by "Routes".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Random encounters may take place in tall grass along routes or in bodies of water. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities and towns, as well as along routes.&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to "Gym Leaders", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pokémon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a "Badge". All eight Badges are needed to unlock the Pokémon League,&lt;ref name="m10"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; where the player faces off against the "Elite Four" and, finally, the Champion. Across Unova, items can be found on the ground or purchased from "Poké Marts".&lt;ref name="game"/&gt; For example, Hyper Potions restore HP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Description:''' Hyper Potion / A spray-type medicine for wounds. It restores the HP of one Pokémon by 200 points.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidotes cure poisoning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Description:''' Antidote / A spray-type medicine. It lifts the effect of poison from one Pokémon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Revives revitalize fainted Pokémon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Description:''' Revive / A medicine that revives a fainted Pokémon. It restores half the Pokémon's maximum HP.}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMs (Technical Machines) teach moves to Pokémon, and HMs (Hidden Machines) are a special class of TMs for important moves that allow the player to traverse the environment. The "Surf" HM move, as one example, is used to cross bodies of water.&lt;ref name="m23"&gt;''Pokémon Black'' instruction manual, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New features===
The graphics have been improved from [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. The dialog boxes of previous games have been changed to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have [[kanji]] appear on screen, rather than only [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system01-01.html|title=漢字モード {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system01-01.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']], ''Black'' and ''White'' introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as [[Autumn leaf color|changing of leaves in autumn]] or snow on the ground in winter.

There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|title=バトル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rotation Battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|title=ローテーションバトル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three Pokémon in a row at once; Pokémon on the left or right side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing position takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. ''Black'' has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in ''White''. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-01.html|title=野生のポケモンが同時に2匹出現！ {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|language=Japanese|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-01.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon more common in the opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This is the only way to capture Pokémon such as [[Audino]], [[Emolga]], and [[Alomomola]]. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter [[Drilbur]], [[Excadrill]], [[Ducklett]], or [[Swanna]], none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt; There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon Musicals|Pokémon Musicals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=ポケモンミュージカル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a side-game similar to the [[Pokémon Contest]]s of previous games; the [[Battle Subway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-04.html|title=バトルサブウェイ {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-04.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Battle Tower]]s and [[Battle Frontier]]s of previous games; and on the ''Royal Unova'',{{efn|In the original Japanese release, this is named the {{nihongo4|''Royal Isshu''|ロイヤルイッシュ号|Roiyaru Isshu-gō}}.}} a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23718/news/pokmon-black-white-gameplay-video-shows-castelia-city/|title=Pokémon Black &amp; White gameplay video shows Castelia City|last=East|first=Thomas|work=Official Nintendo Magazine|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2011-02-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64ugaAR8N?url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23718/newspokmon-black-white-gameplay-video-shows-castelia-city/|archivedate=2012-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo4|C-Gear|Cギア|Shī Gia}} replaces the Pokétech from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' on the Nintendo DS's bottom screen.

Two features were added to transfer Pokémon from older DS ''Pokémon'' games to ''Black'' and ''White''. For normal transfer, the Poké Transfer{{efn|In the original Japanese release, this function is called the {{nihongo4|PokéShifter|ポケシフター|Pokeshifutā}}.}} feature is available after completion of the main storyline. Unlike the "Pal Park" feature from previous games, the Poké Transfer is a mini-game in which after six Pokémon are transferred, the player uses the touch screen to launch Poké Balls at the transferred Pokémon to catch them within a time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system01-02.html|title=ポケシフター {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system01-02.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature called the Relocator{{efn|In the original Japanese release, this function is called the {{nihongo4|Transfer Machine|てんそうマシン|Tensō Mashin}}.}} is used to transfer the Pokémon given away in promotions for the film ''[[Pokémon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]'' so the player can obtain the rare Pokémon Zorua and Zoroark. Unlike the Poké Transfer, this is available before the main game is completed.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt;

Unique to ''Black'' and ''White'' is the Pokémon Dream World,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/pgl/pgl02.html|title=ポケモンの夢の世界 {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519111512/http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/pgl/pgl02.html|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is dependent on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique [[Pokémon abilities|abilities]]. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the [[Pokéwalker]] from ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver''. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow [[Pokémon berries|berries]]. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
[[File:Lower Manhattan from Helicopter.jpg|left|thumb|[[New York City]] was used as the basis for Unova. Specifically, Castelia City features tall buildings and an urban setting and is the region's "central metropolis".]]
''Black'' and ''White'' are set in the Unova region, a continental mass located far away from the previous regions, [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]], [[Johto]], [[Hoenn]] and [[Sinnoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/irbj/topics/file/vol_01/file1.html|title=ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト：新しいポケットモンスターのこと知ってますか？|publisher=Nintendo Gamez|accessdate=2010-07-08|last=|first=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911001401/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/irbj/topics/file/vol_01/file1.html|archivedate=2010-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous regions which were based on real locations in [[Japan]], Unova is modeled after [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo4|''Pokémon Pia''|ポケモンぴあ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo Interview"/&gt; an idea developed by game director [[Junichi Masuda]] when he visited the city for the launch of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']].&lt;ref name="onm"/&gt; One particular example of this is Castelia City, which serves as the region's central metropolis and had such inspirations as its "[[Brooklyn Bridge]]-style suspension bridge" and its "huge skyscrapers". Masuda also wanted to convey a "feeling of communities" in Castelia's streets.&lt;ref name="onm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23711/news/pokmon-black-whites-castelia-city-inspired-by-new-york/|title=Nintendo News: Pokémon Black &amp; White's Castelia City inspired by New York|work=Official Nintendo Magazine|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-04-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64uglHqM5?url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23711/newspokmon-black-whites-castelia-city-inspired-by-new-york/|archivedate=2012-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unova is host to large urban areas, a harbor, an airport, an amusement park, several bridges, and several mountain ranges. In addition to a diversity of new landscapes, the Unova region is also home to a diversity of people who vary in [[Human skin color|skin tone]] and occupation. The region's Japanese name {{nihongo4|"Isshu"|イッシュ}} is derived from the Japanese words {{nihongo3|meaning "many kinds"|多種|tashu}} and {{nihongo3|meaning "one kind"|一種|isshu}}; the many kinds of people and Pokémon seen up close look like only one kind of life from afar.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html|title=社長が訊く『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』|accessdate=2011-02-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913024041/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html|archivedate=2010-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
Like previous ''Pokémon'' games, ''Black'' and ''White'' both follow a [[linear gameplay|linear]] storyline; the main events occur in a fixed order. The [[protagonist]] of ''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'' is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pokémon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either [[Snivy]], [[Tepig]], or [[Oshawott]] as their [[starter Pokémon]] as a gift from [[Professor Juniper]]. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival [[Pokémon Trainer]]s who occasionally battle the player; Cheren will choose the Pokémon with a type advantage against the player's, while Bianca will choose the Pokémon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight [[Gym Leader|Gym Badges]] of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pokémon League, and its Champion, to win the game.

[[File:Brooklyn Bridge Postdlf.jpg|thumb|The [[Brooklyn Bridge]] was used as an inspiration for the Skyarrow Bridge in Unova.]]
In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, [[Team Plasma]], a [[Knights Templar]]-esque group who claim that Pokémon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers.&lt;ref name="What You Need To Know About Pokemon Black/White"&gt;{{cite web|title=What You Need To Know About Pokemon Black/White|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/what-you-need-to-know-about-pokemon-black-white|publisher=[[UGO.com]]|accessdate=2010-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64ugoFe96?url=http://www.ugo.com/games/what-you-need-to-know-about-pokemon-black-white|archivedate=2012-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Plasma is led by [[Natural Harmonia Gropius|N]], a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport.&lt;ref name="GameFreak"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black Version/ Pokémon White Version |developer=[[Game Freak]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]], [[The Pokémon Company]]|date=2011-03-06|platform=[[Nintendo DS]]| scene=|level=|isolang=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in ''Black''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Black Version|developer=[[Game Freak]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]], [[The Pokémon Company]]|date=2011-03-06|platform=[[Nintendo DS]]| scene=|level=|isolang=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Reshiram in ''White''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon White Version |developer=[[Game Freak]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]], [[The Pokémon Company]]|date=2011-03-06|platform=[[Nintendo DS]]| scene=|level=|isolang=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him to take part in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in ''Black'' or Zekrom in ''White'' appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, [[Pokémon crime syndicates#Ghetsis|Ghetsis]] intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.&lt;ref name="GameFreak" /&gt;

After Team Plasma's defeat, [[Pokémon Fan Club President|Looker]] arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining [[Pokémon crime syndicates#Seven Sages|Sages of Team Plasma]], so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. [[Cynthia (Pokémon)|Cynthia]], a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after [[Shigeki Morimoto]], a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games, can also be found and battled in the game.

On August 3, 2010, Masuda announced on his blog that the ''Black'' and ''White'' game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke a feeling of it being a brand-new game, like when [[Pokémon Red and Blue|the original ''Pokémon'' games]] were first released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir/?p=255|title=ゲームフリーク：増田部長のめざめるパワー " ・第１７０回・|date=2010-08-03|accessdate=2010-08-04|quote={{nihongo4|"It feels like I am playing something new (like when ''Red'' and ''Green'' [came out])"|「まったく新しいものを（赤緑のときのように）プレイしてる感じがする」|Mattaku atarashii mono o (Aka Midori no toki no yō ni) purei shiteru kanji ga suru}}|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64uhCL7sF?url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir/?p=255|archivedate=2012-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, [[Pikachu]] was introduced in ''Red'' and ''Green'', and was obtainable in ''Blue'', ''Yellow'', and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in ''Black'' and ''White'' from the start of the game. It was later confirmed that ''Black'' and ''White'' are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.&lt;ref name="Lock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/japanese-pokemon-black-white-is-dsi-region-locked-184465.phtml |title=Report: Pokémon Black and White Region Locked on DSi |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |first=Jonathan |last=Holmes |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64ur989Mx?url=http://www.destructoid.com/japanese-pokemon-black-white-is-dsi-region-locked-184465.phtml |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game director and composer [[Junichi Masuda]] stated that to keep the games fresh, he looks at every previous element to decide what to adapt to the new game, stating "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new [[Pokémon battle|battle]] styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-22-the-brains-behind-pokemon-black-and-white-interview |title=The brains behind Pokemon Black and White DS Interview - Page 1 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2011-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64uhDCpH5?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-22-the-brains-behind-pokemon-black-and-white-interview |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--lots more in this interview---&gt; Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the [[C-Gear]], which makes the ability to [[Pokémon trades|trade]] and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new [[List of Pokémon|species of Pokémon]], Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1152956p1.html |title=Struggling With Pokemon - Nintendo DS Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |first=Richard |last=George |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64uhEjBGT?url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1152956p1.html |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave the games a 9/10, a higher rating than any of the other [[Nintendo DS]] ''Pokémon'' games. The review praised the games for renewing interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best ''Pokémon'' has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Black Review|publisher=IGN|last=DeVries|first=Jack|date=2011-03-04|accessdate=2011-03-04|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1153589p1.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64uiCZ6Ax?url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1153589p1.html|archivedate=2012-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[Retronauts]] criticized ''Black'' and ''White'', commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous ''Pokémon'' games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]'' games and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good.

A '''polystrate fossil''' is a [[fossil]] of a single organism (such as a [[tree trunk]]) that extends through more than one geological [[stratum]].&lt;ref name="MacRae1997a"&gt;MacRae, A., 1997, [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html ''"Polystrate" Tree Fossils'']. [http://www.talkorigins.org/ TalkOrigins Archive.]&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically applied to "[[fossil forest]]s" of upright [[Petrified wood|fossil tree trunks]] and stumps that have been found worldwide, i.e. in the Eastern [[United States]], Eastern [[Canada]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Australia]], typically associated with coal-bearing strata.&lt;ref name="DiMichele+2011a"&gt;DiMichele, W.A., and H.J. Falcon-Lang, 2011, [http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/handle/10088/15971 ''Pennsylvanian 'fossil forests' in growth position (T0 assemblages): origin, taphonomic bias and palaeoecological insights.''] Journal of the Geological Society, 168(2):585-605.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Carboniferous]] coal-bearing strata, it is also very common to find what are called ''Stigmaria'' (root stocks) within the same stratum. [[Stigmaria]] are completely absent in post-Carboniferous strata, which contain either coal, polystrate trees, or both. The word ''polystrate'' is not a standard [[Geology|geological]] term. This term is typically found in [[creationist]] publications.&lt;ref name="MacRae1997a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gastaldo+1999a"&gt;Gastaldo, R.A. 1999.

==Geological explanation==
In [[geology]], such fossils are referred to as either upright fossil trunks, upright fossil trees, or ''T0 assemblages''. According to mainstream (actualistic) models of sedimentary environments, they are formed by rare to infrequent brief episodes of rapid [[Deposition (sediment)|sedimentation]]  separated by long periods of either slow deposition, nondeposition, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="DiMichele+2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gastaldo2004a&gt;Gastaldo, R.A., I.

Upright fossils typically occur in layers associated with an actively subsiding coastal plain or [[Rift (geology)|rift]] basin, or with the accumulation of volcanic material around a periodically erupting [[stratovolcano]]. Typically, this period of rapid sedimentation was followed by a period of time - decades to thousands of years long - characterized by very slow or no accumulation of sediments. In [[river delta]]s and other coastal-plain settings, rapid sedimentation is often the end result of a brief period of accelerated subsidence of an area of coastal plain relative to sea level caused by [[salt tectonics]], global sea-level rise, growth faulting, [[continental margin]] collapse, or some combination of these factors.&lt;ref name=Gastaldo2004a/&gt; For example, geologists such as John W. F. Waldron and Michael C. Rygel have argued that the rapid burial and preservation of polystrate fossil trees found at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] directly result from rapid subsidence, caused by salt tectonics within an already subsiding [[pull-apart basin]], and from the resulting rapid accumulation of sediments.&lt;ref name="Waldron+2005a"&gt;Waldron, J.W.F., and M.C.

===Yellowstone===
The upright fossil trees of the Gallatin Petrified Forest in the [[Gallatin Range]] and the Yellowstone Petrified Forest at [[Amethyst Mountain]] and [[Specimen Ridge]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]], occur buried within the [[lahar]]s and other volcanic deposits comprising the [[Eocene]] Lamar River Formation as the result of periods of rapid sedimentation associated with explosive volcanism. This type of volcanism generates and deposits large quantities of loose volcanic material as a blanket over the slope of a [[volcano]], as happened during the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. Both during and for years after a period of volcanism, lahars and normal stream activity wash this loose volcanic material downslope. These processes result in the rapid burial of large areas of the surrounding countryside beneath several meters of sediment, as directly observed during the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.&lt;ref name=newhall&gt;Newhall, C.G., and R.S. Punongbayan, 1996, ''Fire and Mud: Eruptions and Lahars of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines'', University of Washington Press. {{ISBN|0-295-97585-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with modern lahar deposits, the sedimentary layers containing upright trees of the Yellowstone petrified forest are discontinuous and very limited in areal extent. Individual layers containing upright trees and individual buried forests occupy only a very small fraction of the total area of Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref name="Amidon, L. 1997"&gt;Amidon, L., 1997, ''Paleoclimate Study of Eocene Fossil Woods and Associated Paleosols from the Gallatin Petrified Forest, Gallatin National Forest, SW Montana''. unpublished Master's thesis, University of Montana.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil soils===
Geologists have recognized innumerable [[fossil soil]]s ([[paleosol]]s) throughout the strata containing upright fossils at Joggins in Nova Scotia, in the Yellowstone petrified forests, in the coal mines of the [[Black Warrior Basin]] of [[Alabama]], and at many other locations. The layer immediately underlying [[coal seam]]s, often called either "[[seatearth]]" or "[[underclay]]", typically either consists of or contains a paleosol. Paleosols are soils which were formed by [[subaerial]] [[weathering]] during periods of very slow or no accumulation of sediments. Later, renewed sedimentation buried these soils to create paleosols. These paleosols are identified on the basis of the presence of structures and microstructures unique to soils; animal burrows and molds of plant roots of various sizes and types; recognizable soil-profile development; and alteration of minerals by soil processes. In many cases, these paleosols are virtually identical to modern soils.

Geologists who have long studied upright fossils found in sedimentary rocks exposed in various outcrops for decades have described the upright fossil trees as being deeply rooted in place and typically rooted in recognizable [[paleosol]]s. This is in sharp contrast to the claims made by creationists such as Harold Coffin and N. A. Rupke.  Geologists, such as Falcon&lt;ref&gt;Falcon-Lang, H.J., 2003a, ''Late Carboniferous dryland tropical vegetation, Joggins, Nova Scotia, Canada'', Palaios 18:197– 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falcon-Lang, H.J., 2003b, ''Early Mississippian lycopsid forests in a delta-plain setting at Norton, near Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada'', Journal of the Geological Society, London 161:969–981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=falcon2005&gt;Falcon-Lang, H.J., 2005, ''Small cordaitalean trees in a marine-influenced coastal habitat in the Pennsylvanian Joggins Formation, Nova Scotia'', Journal of the Geological Society 162(3): 485-500.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=falcon2006a&gt;Falcon-Lang, H.J., 2006a, ''Latest Mid-Pennsylvanian tree-fern forests in retrograding coastal plain deposits, Sydney Mines Formation, Nova Scotia, Canada'', Journal of the Geological Society 163(1): 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=falcon2006b&gt;Falcon-Lang, H.J., 2006b, ''Vegetation ecology of Early Pennsylvanian alluvial fan and piedmont environments in southern New Brunswick, Canada'', Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 233(1-2): 34-50.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rygel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Rygel, M.C., M.R. Gibling, and J.H. Calder, 2004, ''[[Vegetation-induced sedimentary structures]] from fossil forests in the Pennsylvanian Joggins Formation, Nova Scotia'', Sedimentology 51:531– 552.&lt;/ref&gt; have published detailed field-sketches and pictures of upright tree-fossils with intact root systems, which are rooted within recognizable paleosols. In the case of the upright fossil trees of the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] petrified forests, geologists – again in sharp disagreement with creationists like Harold Coffin – found that the upright fossil trees, except for relatively short stumps, are rooted in place within the underlying sediments. Typically, the sediments within which  trees are rooted have paleosols developed within them.&lt;ref name="Amidon, L. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Retallack1981&gt;Retallack, G.J., 1981, ''Reinterpretation of the depositional environment of Yellowstone fossil forest: Comment'', Geology 9:52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Retallack1997&gt;Retallack, G.J., 1997, ''A Colour Guide to Paleosols.'' John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-96711-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retallack (1981, 1997) has published pictures and diagrams of the Yellowstone upright fossil trees having intact root systems developed within paleosols found within these strata.&lt;ref name=Retallack1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Retallack1997 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since 1997, geologists agree with Harold Coffin that his "organic levels" are not paleosols. Neither Harold Coffin nor other creationists discuss the layers which geologists currently recognize as being paleosols in their papers about the Yellowstone petrified forests. Geologists such as Amidon (1997) have documented the presence of structures, microstructures, profile development, and mineralogical alteration either characteristic or of consistent with a buried-soil profile within numerous thin layers, which are identified as paleosols, found within the strata containing Yellowstone petrified forests&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation by regeneration===
Geologists have also found that some of the larger upright fossil trees found within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata show evidence of regeneration after being partially buried by sediments. In these cases, the trees were clearly alive when they were partially buried by sediments. The accumulated sediment was insufficient to kill the trees immediately because of their size. As a result, some of them developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface. Until they either died or were overwhelmed by the accumulating sediments, these trees would likely continue to regenerate by adding height and new roots with each increment of sediment, eventually leaving several meters of former "trunk" buried underground as sediments accumulated.&lt;ref name=Gastaldo2004a/&gt;&lt;ref name= Gastaldo1997a&gt;Gastaldo, R.A., 1992, ''Regenerative growth in fossil horsetails (Calamites) following burial by alluvium''. Historical Biology, 6(3):203-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation by Carboniferous deglacial meltwater-pulses===
In addition, part of the Carboniferous Period was a period of extensive and thick continental [[ice sheet]]s. During the Carboniferous ice age, the repeated [[Glacial period|glacial]] – [[interglacial]] cycles caused major changes in the thickness and extent of continental ice sheets. When these ice sheets expanded in extent and thickness, [[eustatic sea level]] typically fell by over a {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}. When these ice sheets shrank in extent and thickness, eustatic sea level typically rose again by typically over a {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Heckel1986a"&gt;Heckel, P.H., 1986.

In: Encyclopedia of paleoclimatology and ancient environments (Ed. V. Gornitz) pp. 887–893. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; brief episodes of rapid melting of Carboniferous, Gondwanan continental ice sheets likely caused very rapid rises in sea level that would have abruptly inundated low-lying coastal swamps and drowned the forests growing on them. Based on the sedimentology of roof strata of surface and underground coal mines and cyclothems containing the fossils of upright and in situ tree trunks, geologists proposed that the flooding of coastal swamp by [[Deglaciation|deglacial]] [[meltwater]] pulses resulted in the rapid flooding of coastal forests, particularly along preexisting coastal rivers and streams, over large areas of coastal swamp. During and after their submergence, upright trunks of drowned coastal forests were buried by tidally influenced sedimentation.&lt;ref name="ArcherOthers2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CecilOthers2014a"&gt;Cecil, C.B., DiMichele, W.A. and Elrick, S.D., 2014. ''Middle and Late Pennsylvanian cyclothems, American Midcontinent: Ice-age environmental changes and terrestrial biotic dynamics.'' Comptes Rendus Geoscience, 346(7), pp.159-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with marine fossils===
Geologists find nothing anomalous about upright fossil trees found in Carboniferous coal-bearing strata being associated with marine or brackish-water fossils. Because they lived on subsiding coastal plains or pull-apart basins open to the coast, it was quite frequent for subsidence to periodically outpace the accumulation of sediments such that adjacent shallow marine waters would periodically inundate coastal plains in which the trees were buried. As a result, sediments containing marine fossils would periodically accumulate within these areas before being replaced by coastal swamps - either as sediments filled in the shallow sea or as the sea level fell. Also, according to [[Paleoecology|ecological reconstructions]] by geologists, specific assemblages of the types of trees found as upright fossils occupied brackish water, even saline coastal swamps much like modern [[mangrove]] swamps. Thus, finding marine and brackish water fossils associated with these trees is no different than finding brackish water or marine animals living in modern mangrove swamps.&lt;ref name=falcon2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=falcon2006a /&gt;&lt;ref name=falcon2006b /&gt;

A detailed study by Taylor and Vinn (2006) of the microstructure of fossils which have been traditionally identified as ''"Spirorbis"'' in the geological literature revealed that they consist of the remains of at least two completely different animals. Taylor and Vinn discovered that the ''"Spirorbis"'' fossils found in sedimentary strata, including the Joggins and other Carboniferous coal measures deposited from the [[Ordovician]] to [[Triassic]] periods are the remains of an extinct order of [[Lophophore|lophophorates]] (now called [[microconchids]]) unrelated to modern marine tube-worms ([[Annelid]]s) to which the genus ''Spirorbis'' belongs.&lt;ref name=TaylorOthers2006a&gt;Taylor, P.D. and O. Vinn, 2006, ''Convergent morphology in small spiral worm tubes ('Spirorbis') and its palaeoenvironmental implications''. Journal of the Geological Society, London 163:225–228.&lt;/ref&gt;  This contradicts arguments made by Harold Coffin and other creationists that ''"Spirorbis"'' fossils within strata containing polystrate fossils indicate their deposition in a marine environment, because these fossils are classified as the remains of extinct fresh and brackish water microconchids instead of the remains of the marine genera ''Spirorbis'' as they have been misidentified in the geologic literature.&lt;ref name=ZatonOthers2012a&gt;Zaton, M., O. Vinn, A.M.F. Tomescu, 2012, ''Invasion of freshwater and variable marginal marine habitats by microconchid tubeworms – an evolutionary perspective.'' Geobios. vol. 45, pp. 603-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quaternary examples===
Scientists interpret ''polystrate fossils'' as fossils buried in a geologically short time span - either by one large depositional event or by several smaller ones. Geologists see no need to invoke a global flood to explain upright fossils. This position of geologists is supported by numerous documented examples, a few of which are discussed in the paragraphs below, of buried upright tree-trunks that have been observed buried in the Holocene volcanic deposits of [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Skamania County, Washington]], and Mount Pinatubo, Philippines; in the deltaic and fluvial sediments of the [[Mississippi River Delta]]; and in glacial deposits within the midwestern United States. These buried upright trees demonstrate that conventional geologic processes are capable of burying and preserving trees in an upright position such that in time, they will become fossilized.&lt;ref name="DiMichele+2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaroweOthers1987a)"&gt;Karowe, A.L. and T.H. Jefferson, 1987, ''Burial of trees by eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington: Implications for the interpretation of fossil forests'', Geological Magazine 124(3):191-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Volcanic deposits====
At this time, the best documented occurrences of unfossilized buried upright trees occur within the historic and late-Holocene volcanic deposits of Mount St. Helens (Skamania County, Washington) and of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. At Mount St. Helens, both unfossilized and partially fossilized trees have occurred in many outcrops of volcanic debris and mud flows (lahars) and pyroclastic flow deposits, which date from 1885 to over 30,000 BP., along the South Toutle and other rivers. Late Holocene forests of upright trees also occur within the volcanic deposits of other [[Cascade Range]] volcanoes.&lt;ref name="KaroweOthers1987a)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaroweOthers1995a"&gt;Yamaguchi, D.K., and R.P. Hoblitt, 1995, ''Tree-ring dating of pre-1980 volcanic flowage deposits at Mount St. Helens, Washington'', Geological Society of America Bulletin 107(9):1077-1093.&lt;/ref&gt; In the space of a few years after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering the slopes of the mountain generated a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and by sediment-filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also "polystrate" telephone-poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years.&lt;ref name=newhall /&gt; The volcanic deposits enclosing modern upright trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests. As in case of modern forests buried by lahars, the individual buried forests of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest and the layers containing them are very limited in their areal extent.&lt;ref name="Amidon, L. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Retallack1981"/&gt;

====Deltaic deposits====
Within excavations for [[Interstate Highway 10]] in the United States of America, and in [[borrow pit]]s, in landfills, and archaeological surveys, unfossilized upright trees have been found buried within late Holocene, even historic, [[fluvial]] and [[River delta|deltaic]] sediments underlying the surface of the [[Mississippi River Delta]] and the [[Atchafalaya Basin]] of [[Louisiana]]. In one case, borrow pits dug in the natural levees of [[Bayou Teche]] near [[Patterson, Louisiana]], have exposed completely buried, 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) high, upright trunks of [[Taxodium|cypress]] trees. Northeast of [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]], a borrow pit excavated for fill used to maintain nearby artificial levees, exposed three levels of rooted upright tree trunks stacked on top of each other lying completely buried beneath the surface of Point Houmas, a patch of floodplain lying within a meander loop of the current course of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, P.V., 2002, ''Buried forest provide clues to the past'', Louisiana Geological Survey News 12(2):1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, P.V., 2005, ''Significance of buried forests exposed in the Lemannville cutoff road pit, St. James, Louisiana.'' Louisiana Geological Survey News 15(2):8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  While searching for buried archaeological sites, archaeologists excavated a 12&amp;nbsp;ft (3.6 meter) high upright rooted cypress tree completely buried within a natural levee of the [[Atchafalaya River]] within the Indian Bayou Wildlife Management Area just south of [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]]. Radiocarbon dates and historic documents collected for this archaeological survey, during which this and other upright trees were found, of the Indian Bayou Wildlife Management Area demonstrated that these upright trees were buried in the 1800s, during the initial diversion of [[Mississippi River]]'s flow into the Atchafalaya River.&lt;ref&gt;Godzinski, M., R. Smith, B. Maygarden, E. Landrum, J. Lorenzo, J.-K, Yakubik, and M.E.

====Glacial deposits====
Unfossilized, late [[Pleistocene]] upright trees have been found buried beneath [[glacial deposit]]s within North America along the southern edge of the [[Laurentide ice sheet]]. These buried forests were created when the southern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet locally dammed valleys. As a result, meltwater lakes filled these valleys and submerged forests within them. Sediments released by the melting of the adjacent ice sheet rapidly filled these lakes, which quickly buried and preserved the submerged forests lying within them. One forest of ''in situ'', 24,000-year-old unfossilized upright trees was exposed by excavations for a quarry near [[Charleston, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansel, A.K., R.C. Berg, A.C. Phillips, and V. Gutowski, 1999, ''Glacial Sediments, Landforms, Paleosols, and a 20,000-Year-Old Forest Bed in East-Central Illinois'', Guidebook 26. Illinois State Geological Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavations for a tailings pond about [[Marquette, Michigan]], exposed an ''in situ'' forest of unfossilized trees, which are about 10,000 years old, buried in glacial lake and stream sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Pregitzer, K.S., D.D. Reed, T.J., Bornhorst, D.R. Foster, G.D. Mroz, J.S. Mclachlan, P.E. Laks, D.D. Stokke, P.E. Martin, and S.E.

{{Expert needed|Psychology|date=April 2009}}
[[Torture]] is the use of physical or psychological pain to control the victim or fulfill some needs of the perpetrator. The psychology of torture refers to the psychological processes underlying all aspects of torture including the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the immediate and long-term effects, and the political and social institutions that influence its use.

==The perpetrator of torture==
Research during the past 60 years, starting with the [[Milgram experiment]], suggests that under the right circumstances, and with the appropriate encouragement and setting, most people can be encouraged to actively torture others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7791278.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; People 'still willing to torture' |format= |work= BBC News| date=2008-12-19 | accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Conroy:'''&lt;blockquote&gt;"When torture takes place, people believe they are on the high moral ground, that the nation is under threat and they are the front line protecting the nation, and people will be grateful for what they are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15861-2004May10.html| title=The Psychology of Torture | work=The Washington Post| author=Shankar Vedantam| date= May 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stages of the perpetrator's torture mentality include:&lt;br /&gt;
(Please note that not all perpetrators go through all of the stages listed)&lt;br /&gt;

* Reluctance:  The perpetrator is reluctant to participate or observe the administration of torture.
* Official encouragement: As the [[Stanford prison experiment]] and [[Milgram experiment]] show, in an official setting, many people will follow the direction of an authority figure (such as a superior officer) particularly if it is presented as mandatory, even if they have personal uncertainty. The main motivations for this appear to be a fear of loss of status or respect, and the desire to be seen as a "good citizen" or "good subordinate".
* Peer encouragement: The perpetrator begins to accept torture as necessary, acceptable or deserved, or to comply due to the need to conform to peer group beliefs.
* [[Dehumanization]]: The perpetrator sees victims as objects of curiosity and experimentation rather than as human beings.  The physical and psychological manipulations become just another opportunity to test the victim's response.
* [[Disinhibition]]: Sociocultural and [[situational]] pressures may cause perpetrators to undergo a lessening of moral inhibitions and as a result act in ways not normally accepted by law, custom and conscience.
* Self-perpetuating:  Within the organization, once torture becomes established as part of internally acceptable norms under certain circumstances, its use often becomes institutionalized and self-perpetuating over time.  What was once rarely used during extreme circumstances begins to be used more regularly with more reasons claimed to justify wider use.

Example:&lt;br /&gt;
  
One of the apparent ringleaders of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prison torture]], [[Charles Graner]] Jr., exemplified the stages of dehumanization and disinhibition when he was reported to have said, "The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the corrections officer in me says, 'I love to make a grown man piss himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/121/12.0.html|title=The Religious Side of the Abu Ghraib Scandal|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As P. Saliya Sumanatilake concludes:&lt;br /&gt;

"Whether it be for securing a justifiable or reprehensible end, torture cannot be effectuated without invoking and focusing one's diffused innate cruelty. Accordingly, it is the prevalence of this congenital trait of heinousness that renders every human being a potential torturer: hence, the existence of torture! Moreover, it is the natural occurrence of such nascent evil within each successive generation of human beings that serves to propagate torture!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why Do They Torture? A Study On Man's Cruelty|last = Sumanatilake|first = P. Saliya|publisher = Stamford Lake (Pvt.) Ltd.|year = 2015|isbn = 978-955-658-406-6|location = Colombo, Sri Lanka|pages = 331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects of torture==

The effects of torture on the victim and the perpetrator are likely to be influenced by many factors.  Therefore, it is unlikely that providing diagnostic categories of symptoms and behavior will be applicable across countries with very different personal, political or religious beliefs and perspectives. There is always a question about applying diagnostic categories and descriptions of symptoms or behavior developed in Western societies to people from the developing countries with very different personal, political, or religious beliefs and perspectives. One of the most marked cultural differences may occur between [[individualism|individualist]] societies where realization of personal goals often takes priority over the needs of kin and societal expectations, and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies in which the needs of family and prescribed roles take precedence over personal preferences. Another evident difference is the belief in a subsequent life in which suffering in this life is rewarded, and this has emerged in some studies of torture survivors in South East Asia.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Victims ===
Torture has profound and long-lasting physical and psychological effects. Torture is a form of collective suffering that is not limited to the victim. The victims' family members and friends are often also affected due to adjustment problems such as outbreaks of anger and violence directed towards family members.  According to research, psychological and physical torture have similar mental effects. Often torture victims suffer from elevated rates of the following:
*[[anxiety]]
*[[Depression (mood)|depression]]
*[[adjustment disorder]]
*[[Post-traumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
*disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS)
*[[somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorders]]
*[[nightmare]]s
*intrusion
*[[insomnia]]
*[[libido|decreased libido]]
*memory lapses

No diagnostic terminology encapsulates the deep distrust of others which many torture survivors have developed, nor the destruction of all that gave their lives meaning. Guilt and shame about humiliation during torture, and about the survivor's inability to withstand it, as well as guilt at surviving, are common problems which discourage disclosure.  Additional stress may be added due to uncertainty about the future, any possibility of being sent back to the country in which the survivor was tortured, and the potential lack of close confidants or social support systems.  In addition, the presence of social isolation, poverty, unemployment, institutional accommodation, and pain can all predict higher levels of emotional distress in victims who survive torture.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463713483596|title=The psychological impact of torture|first1=Amanda C|last1=de C Williams|first2=Jannie|last2=van der Merwe|date=1 May 2013|publisher=|journal=British Journal of Pain|volume=7|issue=2|pages=101–106|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/2049463713483596|pmc=4590125|pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims with PTSD ===
The development of the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for American veterans of the Vietnam War can be understood as a political act which labeled the collective distress of a defeated USA as individual psychopathology. Proponents of this view, point to the de-politicization of the distress of torture survivors by describing their distress, disturbance, and profound sense of injustice in psychiatric terms. These are not only conceptual issues, because they may influence treatment outcomes.  Recovery is associated with reconstruction of social and cultural networks, economic supports, and respect for human rights.

The rich research on treatment of PTSDs in veterans has substantially informed treatment offered to torture survivors. It is more appropriate than extrapolation from work with civilian survivors of single events as individuals (assault, accidents) or as communities or groups (natural or man-made disasters). Some literature distinguishes between single-event trauma (type 1) and prolonged and repeated trauma, such as torture (type 2). There is no doubt that (disregarding concerns about the diagnosis) rates of PTSD are much higher in refugees than among people of a similar age in the countries where the refugees settle, and that, among refugees, rates of PTSD are even higher among those seeking asylum.

The argument that torture causes unique problems waxes and wanes, and is often associated with claims to particular expertise in treatment, and therefore claims on funding.   Gurr et al. describe how torture targets the person as a whole – physically, emotionally, and socially – so that PTSD is an inadequate description of the magnitude and complexity of the effects of torture. When the diagnosis of PTSD is applied, some survivors of torture who have very severe symptoms related to trauma may still not reach the criteria for diagnosis. Categories such as 'complex trauma' have been proposed, and it may be that the next iterations of the diagnostic compendia may modify the criteria

=== Perpetrator ===
Many people who engage in torture have various psychological deviations and often they derive sadistic satisfaction.  Torture may fulfill the emotional needs of perpetrators when they willingly engage in these activities. They lack empathy and their victims' agonized painful reactions, screaming and pleading give them a sense of authority and feelings of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/02/psychological-effects-of-torture.html | title=Psychological effects of torture | publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian | date=2010 | accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture can harm not only the victim but the perpetrators as well. After the fact, perpetrators will often experience failing mental health, PTSD, suicidal tendencies, substance dependency and a myriad of other mental defects associated with inducing physical or mental trauma upon their victims.

The perpetrators may experience flashbacks of torture, intense rage, suicidal and homicidal ideas, alienation, impulse deregulation, alterations in attention and consciousness, alterations in self-perception, alterations in relationships with others, inability to trust and inability to maintain long-term relationships, or even mere intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2010/04/15/psychological-effects-of-torture/|title=Psychological effects of Torture|date=15 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture victims in healthcare settings===

For physicians, it is useful to recognize that symptoms of post-traumatic stress can complicate presentation and treatment. Pain predicts greater severity of both PTSD symptoms and major depression, and intrusive memories and flashbacks can exacerbate existing pain.&lt;ref name = Williams&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://bjp.sagepub.com/content/7/2/101.full.pdf+html | title=The psychological impact of torture | author=Amanda C de C Williams and Jannie van der Merwe | journal=British Journal of Pain | year=2013 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=101–106 | doi=10.1177/2049463713483596| pmc=4590125 | pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt; While under-recognition and under-treatment of torture victims is common, there are useful guidelines for evidence-based medical practice, although not specifically concerned with pain, and for evidence-based psychological practice.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Some people die during torture; many survivors are too disabled and destitute to find their way to safety. A large element of chance, and, to a lesser extent, resources and resilience, enable a minority to arrive in developed countries. Nevertheless, they often present multiple and complex problems, which the clinician can find overwhelming. For all these reasons, an interdisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment is therefore recommended, guarding against either disregarding significant psychological distress as inevitable in torture survivors or discounting physical symptoms by attributing them to psychological origin.

Rehabilitation and reparation are part of the rights of the torture survivor under the United Nations Convention, yet far less attention is paid to health needs on a national or international basis than to legal and civil claims. Collaborative efforts involving survivors themselves are needed to better understand the usefulness and limitations of existing assessment instruments and treatment methods. Some studies exist, such as that by Elsass et al. who interviewed Tibetan Lamas on the quantification of suffering in scales used to evaluate intervention with Tibetan torture survivors.
Education of medical and other healthcare personnel needs to address issues concerning treatment of torture survivors, who will be seen in all possible settings but not necessarily recognized or treated adequately. Teaching on ethics is also important, since medical students can have tolerant views of torture, and the complicity of medical and healthcare staff in torture continues in many countries. Medical staff are often in a key position to try to prevent torture and to help those who have survived.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"/&gt;

== The psychologist's role in torture ==
In addition to providing treatment for victims of torture, psychologists have the skills and knowledge to conduct research regarding interrogation methods and determine when the methods used become torture.  The standards, policies, and procedures of each country's professional psychological association may influence the participation of psychologists in administering torture, researching torture methods, and evaluating the effectiveness of the results.  Kenneth Pope (2011) used direct quotes to indicate the American Psychological Association believes psychologists have a key role in eliciting information from people since interrogations require an understanding of psychological processes.  Each professional association sets the standards for ethics and expected professional behavior which may influence psychologist researchers who investigate interrogation or torture and clinical psychologists' participation in interrogations that use methods deemed to be consistent with torture.

For an example of policy that influences the use of torture by American psychologists, please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx American Psychological Association Council of Representatives policy released in 2015].  For an example of an external review of whether psychologists adhered to the APA ethics and policy please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx Hoffman Report (2015)].

Due to differences in political power globally, professional psychological organizations in well-developed countries may have a greater influence on discovering and defining what constitutes torture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moghaddam|first1=F|title=Interrogation policy and American psychology in the global context.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=437–443|doi=10.1080/10781910701665782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological associations in less developed countries may choose to adopt the definitions, standards, and ethical positions regarding torture developed by the APA when they are unable to support research regarding torture themselves within their own culture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt; The professional associations in well developed countries, such as the APA are likely to have a strong influence in defining the psychology of torture globally.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt;

==The influence of social systems on torture==
People within an organization may be influenced to participate in torturing people.&lt;ref name="Annas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=G. J.|last2=Crosby|first2=S. S.|title=Post-9/11 torture at CIA "Black Sites" - Physicians and lawyers working together.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=2015|volume=372|issue=24|pages=2279–2281|doi=10.1056/nejmp1503428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and procedures of an organization provide the foundation to allow professionals, such as physicians, to violate the medical code of ethics in a manner that appears to align and meet the necessary standards of their employment.  Annas and Crosby (2015) reported that lawyers provided advanced confirmation that physicians who participated in the enhanced interrogation techniques used at CIA sites would be given immunity for their actions since they were deemed a necessary requirement to protect the country (see also; [[Milgram experiment]] ) .  

The physicians assisted by providing medical evaluations to ensure victims were healthy enough to undergo torture, developed methods of torture, ensured victims would survive the torture, and assisted victims to heal following torture procedures.  Working in a secret facility with policies and procedures that promoted an expectation that torture and enhanced interrogation practices were required to protect the nation and would not result in negative personal consequences resulted in a setting in which physicians were willing to ignore the [[Hippocratic oath]].&lt;ref name="Annas" /&gt;

The policies and procedures within the United States military have also been found to produce an environment in which torture and enhanced interrogation techniques were used.&lt;ref name="Arrigo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrigo|first1=J. M.|last2=Bennett|first2=R.|title=Organizational supports for abusive interrogations in the "War on Terror."|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=411–421|doi=10.1080/10781910701665592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the military has an excellent process for recruiting and training interrogators who use non abusive techniques successfully, changes in funding resulted in fewer highly trained interrogators being available.  As more interrogators were recruited after [[9/11]], they were not as rigorously assessed, trained, or mentored and did not demonstrate the same abilities as the previous generation of military interrogators.  In addition, the military rank of interrogators is not sufficient to control the decisions made when interrogation is needed.  Military interrogators may be ordered to perform techniques they know to be inappropriate and ineffective by higher ranking officers who have not been adequately educated about effective interrogation procedures.  The combination of a change in recruitment, reduced education and mentorship, and relatively low rank result in opportunities for torture and abuse to be used during interrogations.&lt;ref name="Arrigo" /&gt;

==How public beliefs influence the use of torture==
Fictional stories, movies, and television shows may influence the beliefs people have regarding the efficacy of torture as a means for rapidly obtaining life-saving information.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ames|first1=D. R.|last2=Lee|first2=A. J.|title=Tortured beliefs:  how and when prior support for torture skews the perceived value of coerced information.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=86–92.|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2015.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Mara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Mara|first1=S|title=On the imposition of torture, an extreme stressor state, to extract information from memory:  a baleful consequence of folk cognitive neurobiology.|journal=Journal of Psychology|date=2011|volume=219|issue=3|pages=159–166|doi=10.1027/2151-2604/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who believe torture is an effective interrogation method are more supportive of using torture and enhanced interrogation techniques than those who do not think it provides accurate information.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;  In addition, the information obtained through torture is also perceived as more valuable by people who support using torture than the same information obtained through non-abusive means of interrogation.  These findings suggest confirmation bias (perception is skewed toward what a person already believes) influences the support for torture and is influenced by many commercially available sources of fictional examples.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jannoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=R|title=Erroneous assumptions:  Popular belief in the effectiveness of torture interrogation.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=429–435|doi=10.1080/10781910701665766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sissel Tolaas''' is an artist and researcher known for her work with smells.

Sissel Tolaas was born in 1963 in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]] and is based in Berlin. Tolaas has a background in chemistry; mathematics, linguistics; languages and art; she studied at the universities of Oslo, Warsaw, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Oxford. 

Tolaas is working actively on diverse aspects of the topic of scents. She began to concentrate on this in 1990, researching its importance in different sciences, fields of art /design and other disciplines. At that time she developed a "smell archive" in over 7000 airtight jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rushton|first1=Susie|title=The Sweat Hog|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/t_w_1530_1531_face_smells_.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;In January 2004 Tolaas established the SMELL RE_searchLab Berlin, for smell &amp; communication / language, supported by IFF [[International Flavors &amp; Fragrances|International Flavours and Fragrances]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/?weave=1036|title = Sissel Tolaas; An alphabet for the nose|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research has won recognition through numerous national and international scholarships, honours, and prizes including the 2014 CEW, New York award for chemistry &amp; innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Business-Financial/CEW-honors-cosmetics-entrepreneurs-with-Achiever-Awards&lt;/ref&gt;; 2009 Rouse Foundation Award from Harvard University GSD; an Honorary Mention at the 2010 ArsElectronica in Linz, Austria&lt;ref&gt; https://www.aec.at/prix/en/years/2010/2010-prix-gewinner-hybrid-art/&lt;/ref&gt;; and the 2010-2011-2012-2014 Synthetic Biology / Synthetic Aesthetics Award from Stanford and Edinburgh Universities including a residency at Harvard Medical School&lt;ref&gt;http://syntheticaesthetics.org/residents/agapakis-tolaas&lt;/ref&gt;. Tolaas founded the Institute of Functional Smells in 2010 (i.e. health, education, well-being) and in 2016 became a founding member of FUTURE OF EDUCATION, a collaboration with the Nanyang Technical University Singapore and The Future Education Platform, Berlin.

==Projects==

Tolaas has completed 52 City SmellScape research projects since 1998, of, for and with major cities all over the world such as Paris, Stockholm, Kansas City, Kansas, &amp; Kansas City, Missouri&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grandarts.com/past_projects/2012/2012_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Berlin&lt;ref&gt;https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article105555/Der-Duft-der-Hauptstadt.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Oslo, London, Cape Town, Kochi, Istanbul, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, Amman&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ammandesignweek.com/media/news/design-for-the-senses-sissel-tolaas&lt;/ref&gt;, New York Central Park and Seoul. 

In 2018 Tolaas  is working on an archive of the world's oceans and a project on the morbidity and decay of Detroit. Since 2014 Tolaas has  been active in several start-ups in the field of the senses.  In 2016 Tolaas launched the world's first Smell Memory Kit; several other devices and sense tools are in the pipeline.

The Re_Search Lab continues to support interdisciplinary projects and research involving smell, odor, and fragrance. It establishes communication among experts in different fields dealing with olfaction&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/?weave=1036|title = Sissel Tolaas; An alphabet for the nose|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her project ''SWEAT FEAR | FEAR SWEAT'' from 2005 examines the body odors of twenty men, all of whom have a severe phobia of other bodies. Their smells were collected and chemically reproduced. &lt;ref&gt;http://mono-kultur.com/issues/23  &lt;/ref&gt;The simulated sweat molecules were painted onto the gallery walls using a [[micro-encapsulation]] process, where they became activated by touch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From her artist's statement about the installation ''the FEAR of smell — the smell of FEAR'' at the 2005 Tirana Biennale, Tolaas explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the modern West, we tend to think of smell in purely aesthetic terms, pleasant or unpleasant. In many other cultures however, smells have provided and still provide a basic means of defining the and interacting with the world. This is particularly the case in so far as odours are closely associated with personal and group identity. The study of the history, anthropology, and sociology of smells is, in a very real sense, an investigation into the ‘essence’ of human culture itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sensorium; Embodied experience, technology, and contemporary art|last = Jones|first = Caroline|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2006|isbn =9780262101172 |location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Topics and Applications==

Some of the topics of concern in Tolaas’s work are:

*Can one learn and make systems of smells the way one learn other systems i.e. ABCs and 123s?
*Can an abstract smell molecule portray or convey a specific learned meaning by itself?
*Can one get rid of prejudices towards certain smells, and how?
*How can one describe and remember smells?
*Can smells be measured?
*How can one make tools to trigger smell memory?
*How can one use the information in smells?
*How smell can have a better and bigger impact on life and living? 
*How to better interact with smells and through smells.
*Can smell as an information unit be combined with other sensory information in communication systems? 
*Can smell per se as an information unit be used for the purposes of communication, tolerance and navigation?
*Can smell be used to defend, protect, concentrate, attract?
*Can smell molecules have a function, i.e. sleep; learn; memory; navigation.

Applications for and projects on:

*The use of smell per se conveying information purpose i.e. preservation, archiving, researching.
*The use of learned smell codes to convey information.
*The use of smell to convey information.
*The use of smell in education i.e. to aid in memorizing information.
*The use of smell to convey information in combination with other sensory information.
*The uses of smell to convey information; how this could be applied in language.
*The use of smell to train tolerance.

'''''Suicide''''' ({{lang-fr|Le suicide}}) is an 1897 book written by French [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]]. It was the first methodological study of a [[social fact]] in the context of society. It is ostensibly a [[case study]] of [[suicide]], a publication unique for its time that provided an example of what the sociological monograph should look like.

==Types of suicide==
According to Durkheim,
{{quote|source=|the term suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result.&lt;ref name="PickeringWalford2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. S. F. Pickering|author2=Geoffrey Walford|author3=British Centre for Durkheimian Studies|title=Durkheim's Suicide: a century of research and debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KQO6dGY1cwC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20582-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In his view, suicide comes in four kinds:
*''Egoistic suicide'' reflects a prolonged sense of not belonging, of not being [[Social integration|integrated]] in a community. It results from the suicide's sense that s/he has no tether. This absence can give rise to meaninglessness, apathy, melancholy, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harriford |first=Diane Sue |last2=Thomson |first2=Becky W. |title=When the Center is on Fire : Passionate Social Theory for Our Times |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2008 |page=165 |isbn=978-0-292-71775-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim calls such detachment "excessive [[individuation]]". Those individuals who were not sufficiently bound to social groups (and therefore well-defined values, traditions, norms, and goals) were left with little social support or guidance, and were therefore more likely to commit suicide. Durkheim found that suicide occurred more often among unmarried people, especially unmarried men, whom he found had less to bind and connect them to stable social norms and goals.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Kenneth |year=1982 |title=Emile Durkheim |location=London |publisher=Tavistock Publications |isbn=0-85312-419-1 |pages=109–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Altruistic suicide]]'' is characterized by a sense of being overwhelmed by a group's goals and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harriford |first=Diane Sue |last2=Thomson |first2=Becky W. |title=When the Center is on Fire : Passionate Social Theory for Our Times |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2008 |page=166 |isbn=978-0-292-71775-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in societies with high integration, where individual needs are seen as less important than the society's needs as a whole. They thus occur on the opposite integration scale as egoistic suicide.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; As individual interest would not be considered important, Durkheim stated that in an altruistic society there would be little reason for people to commit suicide. He described one exception: when the individual is expected to kill her/himself on behalf of society, for example in military service.
*''[[anomie|Anomic]] suicide'' reflects an individual's moral confusion and lack of social direction, which is related to dramatic social and economic upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harriford |first=Diane Sue |last2=Thomson |first2=Becky W. |title=When the Center is on Fire : Passionate Social Theory for Our Times |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2008 |page=163 |isbn=978-0-292-71775-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the product of moral deregulation and a lack of definition of legitimate aspirations through a restraining social ethic, which could impose meaning and order on the individual conscience. This is symptomatic of a failure of economic development and division of labour to produce Durkheim's [[organic solidarity]]. People do not know where they fit in within their societies. Durkheim explains that this is a state of moral disorder where people do not know the limits on their desires and are constantly in a state of disappointment. This can occur when they go through extreme changes in wealth; while this includes economic ruin, it can also include windfall gains – in both cases, previous expectations from life are brushed aside and new expectations are needed before they can judge their new situation in relation to the new limits.
*''Fatalistic suicide'' occurs when a person is excessively regulated, when their futures are pitilessly blocked and passions violently choked by oppressive discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harriford |first=Diane Sue |last2=Thomson |first2=Becky W. |title=When the Center is on Fire : Passionate Social Theory for Our Times |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2008 |page=167 |isbn=978-0-292-71775-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of anomic suicide, and occurs in societies so oppressive their inhabitants would rather die than live on. For example, some prisoners might prefer to die than live in a prison with constant abuse and excessive regulation.

These four types of suicide are based on the degrees of imbalance of two social forces: social integration and moral regulation.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Durkheim noted the effects of various crises on social aggregates – war, for example, leading to an increase in [[altruism]], economic boom or disaster contributing to [[anomie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dohrenwend |first=Bruce P. |title=Egoism, Altruism, Anomie, and Fatalism: A Conceptual Analysis of Durkheim's Types |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=24 |issue=4 |year=1959 |pages=473 |doi=10.2307/2089533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
Durkheim concluded that:
*Suicide rates are higher in men than women (although married women who remained childless for a number of years ended up with a high suicide rate).
*Suicide rates are higher for those who are single than those who are in a sexual relationship.
*Suicide rates are higher for people without children than people with children.
*Suicide rates are higher among Protestants than Catholics and Jews.
*Suicide rates are higher among soldiers than civilians.
*Suicide rates are higher in times of peace than in times of war (For example, the suicide rate in France fell after the ''[[coup d'etat]]'' of [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]]. War also reduced the suicide rate: after [[Third Italian War of Independence|war broke out in 1866]] between Austria and Italy, the suicide rate fell by 14% in both countries.).
*Suicide rates are higher in Scandinavian countries.
*The higher the education level, the more likely it was that an individual would choose suicide. However, Durkheim established that there is more correlation between an individual's religion and suicide rate than an individual's education level. Jewish people were generally highly educated but had a low suicide rate.

==Criticisms==

===Ecological fallacy===
Durkheim stands accused of committing an [[ecological fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freedman |first=David A. |year=2002 |title=The Ecological Fallacy |publisher=University of California |url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. C. |last=Selvin |year=1965 |chapter=Durkheim's ''Suicide'': Further Thoughts on a Methodological Classic |editor-first=R. A. |editor-last=Nisbet |title=Émile Durkheim : Selected Essays |location= |publisher=Prentice-Hall |pages=113–136 |isbn= |oclc=883981793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Durkheim's conclusions about individual behaviour (e.g. suicide) are based on [[Aggregate data|aggregate statistics]] (the suicide rate among Protestants and Catholics). This type of [[inference]], which explains [[Microsociology|micro]] events in terms of [[Macrosociology|macro]] properties, is often misleading, as [[Simpson's paradox]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irzik |first=Gurol |first2=Eric |last2=Meyer |title=Causal Modeling: New Directions for Statistical Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=509 |doi=10.1086/289402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. Van Poppel and Day (1996) argue that differences in reported suicide rates between Catholics and Protestants could be explained entirely in terms of how these two groups record deaths. Protestants would record "sudden deaths" and "deaths from ill-defined or unspecified cause" as suicides, while Catholics would not. If so, then Durkheim's error was empirical, not logical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Poppel |first=Frans |first2=Lincoln H. |last2=Day |title=A Test of Durkheim's Theory of Suicide—Without Committing the Ecological Fallacy |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=61 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=500 |doi=10.2307/2096361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inkeles (1959),&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |last=Inkeles |first=A. |year=1959 |chapter=Personality and Social Structure |pages=249–76 |title=Sociological Today |editor-first=R.

S. |editor3-last=Cottrell |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (1965),&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=B. D. |year=1965 |title=Durkheim's One Cause of Suicide |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=30 |issue= |pages=875–86 |doi=10.2307/2090966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gibbs (1958)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite journal |last=Gibbs |first=J. P. |first2=W. T. |last2=Martin |year=1958 |title=A Theory of Status Integration and Its Relationship to Suicide |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=140–147 |jstor=2088997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Durkheim only intended to explain suicide ''sociologically,'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that "he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berk |first=Bernard B. |title=Macro-Micro Relationships in Durkheim's Analysis of Egoistic Suicide |journal=Sociological Theory |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=58–80 [p. 60] |doi=10.1111/j.0735-2751.2006.00264.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Berk (2006) questions the [[Structure and agency|micro-macro relations]] underlying criticisms of Durkheim's work. He notices that

{{quote|Durkheim speaks of a "collective current" that reflects the collective inclination flowing down the channels of social organization. The intensity of the current determines the volume of suicides ... Introducing psychological [i.e. individual] variables such as depression, [which could be seen as] an independent [non-social] cause of suicide, overlooks Durkheim's conception that these variables are the ones most likely to be effected by the larger social forces and without these forces suicide may not occur within such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berk |first=Bernard B. |title=Macro-Micro Relationships in Durkheim's Analysis of Egoistic Suicide |journal=Sociological Theory |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=58–80 [pp. 78–79] |doi=10.1111/j.0735-2751.2006.00264.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catholics and Protestants===
Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. 

There are at least two problems with this interpretation. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stark |first=Rodney |first2=William Sims |last2=Bainbridge |year=1996 |title=Religion, Deviance and Social Control |location= |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&amp;pg=PA32 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant-Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may always have been the spurious reflection of other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |first=Whitney |first2=Nick |last2=Danigelis |year=1981 |title=Sociology's One Law |journal=Social Forces |volume=60 |issue= |pages=496–514 |doi=10.2307/2578447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned{{by whom|date=April 2015}} as a classic sociological study.

A '''syringe driver''' or '''syringe pump''' is a small [[infusion pump]] (some include infuse and withdraw capability), used to gradually [[Route of administration|administer]] small amounts of fluid (with or without medication) to a patient or for use in chemical and biomedical research.

Applications include [[electrospinning]], electrospraying, microdialysis, microfluidics, dispensing/dilution, organ/tissue perfusion and fluid circulation.

Another use of syringe drivers is in [[palliative care]], to continuously administer [[analgesic]]s (painkillers), [[antiemetic]]s (medication to suppress [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]) and other drugs. This prevents periods during which medication levels in the blood are too high or too low, and avoids the use of multiple tablets (especially in people who have difficulty [[swallowing]]). As the medication is administered [[Subcutis|subcutaneously]], the area for administration is practically limitless, although [[edema]] may interfere with the action of some drugs.

Syringe drivers are also useful for delivering IV medications over several minutes.  In the case of a medication which should be slowly pushed in over the course of several minutes, this device saves staff time and reduces errors.

Syringe pumps are also useful in microfluidic applications, such as microreactor design and testing, and also in chemistry for slow incorporation of a fixed volume of fluid into a solution. In [[enzyme kinetics]] syringe drivers can be used to observe rapid kinetics as part of a [[stopped flow]] apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fersht, Alan |title=Enzyme structure and mechanism |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=1985 |pages=123 |isbn=0-7167-1614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also sometimes used as laboratory [[media dispenser]]s.

{{Spiritualism sidebar}}
'''The Michael Teachings''' is a body of channeled [[New Age]] spiritual doctrine that originated in the early 1970s as a 'conversation' via a [[Ouija]] board between members of a spiritual study group in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and a [[channeling (mediumistic)|channeled]] spiritual entity who became known as 'Michael'. The teachings received from the entity were first published in book form in 1979 as ''Messages from Michael,'' by novelist [[Chelsea Quinn Yarbro]], the first in a series of four books by Yarbro chronicling the Bay Area sessions. Since that time, the teachings purportedly from the same entity have continued to accumulate and expand via a growing number of channels based in other locations.

== Summary of the Michael Teachings ==

The core belief of the Michael Teachings is Agape (unconditional love) – specifically, teaching people how to love themselves and how to love others through personality understanding methods, communication skills and other practices that encourage deeper self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Michael Teachings, Purpose http://www.centerformichaelteachings.org/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Michael" is simply one way to name a system of personality understanding (or "teaching").  It has no real significance other than to make it known in some definitive way. Modern schools of philosophy and psychology represent facets of this system.  Readers of [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Eric Erikson]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], as well as others, will find a ring of familiarity here. Elements of this system were being taught in the 1920s by [[George Gurdjieff]], [[P.D. Ouspensky]] and later [[Rodney Collin]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Jose, (1990) ''The Michael Handbook'', Introduction. {{ISBN|978-0941109000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion of the Teachings==
From those early beginnings of a few friends gathered in Sarah Chambers' living room seeking answers to their own questions, there are now more than 40 books published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itstime.com/mbooks.htm |title=Michael Teachings - Books |publisher=Itstime.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the body of work that came to be called the Michael Teachings.  As students became teachers of the material and it moved out of the United States, many of the books about the teachings have been translated into other languages.  The work of José &amp; Lena Stevens has been translated into Finnish &lt;ref&gt;Stevens, José.

== Reception ==

A number of academic scholars have included the Michael Teachings in their research.  These include: Jon Klimo, Olav Hammer, Michael F. Brown and Mary Meeker Albert.

Jon Klimo, professor of psychology and parapsychology author, researched channeling and writes in the introduction to his book ''Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources'', "I intended for this book to be a balanced and objective treatment of the phenomenon of channeling so that you the reader can make your own judgements." He goes on to say "Although, as we shall see, channeling has been around since the beginning of recorded history, it is enjoying a remarkable resurgence today."&lt;ref name=klimo/&gt;

Professor Klimo stated that the ''Messages from Michael'' book series helped to make Michael-channeling into one of the best-known examples of channeling during the 1970s and early 1980s, and noted similarities in the events of the initial Michael channeling sessions to those that led to the [[Seth Material]].&lt;ref name=klimo/&gt;  Klimo reported that  more than a dozen people in the San Francisco Bay Area claimed to channel the same "Michael", using a variety of methods, ranging from automatic writing to speaking while in a trance.&lt;ref name=klimo&gt;{{cite book |title=Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources |first=Jon |last=Klimo |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=1998 |pages=48–49 |isbn=1-55643-248-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olav Hammer]], an expert on [[new religious movements]], describes the ''Michael Teachings'' as a "fairly well-structured set of doctrines, expressed in a distinct vocabulary".&lt;ref name=hammer&gt;{{cite book|title=Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age|first=Olav |last=Hammer| publisher=BRILL| year=2004|pages=396–398 |isbn=90-04-13638-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hammer, Michael is described by believers as a "group soul, a collective consciousness of 1050 essences". Hammer states that the channelers of Michael study the earlier "transmissions" and use similar terminology, making it easier for readers to accept the new material as part of a doctrines.  Dr. Hammer has a degree in Computer Science and a Ph.D. from Lund University (Sweden) in History of Religions.&lt;ref name=hammer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Olav.  Biography. url=http://olavhammer.com/biography/&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Brown didn't set out to study channeling.  An anthropology and Latin American studies professor at Williams College, he was living in Santa Fe temporarily and working on a book about a Peruvian guerrilla movement when he became interested in some drumming from his next door neighbors. Assuming that was an American Indian ceremony, he wanted to learn more.  Eventually, he spent five years of research where he tried to make sense of channeling "in an anthropological sense."  That research eventually became his book, ''The Channeling Zone''.  Brown said the experiences he underwent in his research didn't change his own beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Bruno J. (November 8, 1997), ''Santa Fe New Mexican'' newspaper, p B2. "Author writes of New Age spiritualism" url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212559552&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Bruno J. (November 8, 1997), ''Santa Fe New Mexican'' newspaper, continued on p B3 . "New Age" url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212559560/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Brown was named president of the School for Advanced Research, after shifting into emeritus status as Lambert Professor of Anthropology and Latin American studies at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Weideman, Paul.

"In ''The Channeling Zone'', Michael Brown has provided us with a lively, easy to read, yet scholarly look into a spiritual movement whose critics see it as Satanic and evil but whose followers are among the best-educated people in the country.

Dr. Alber commented on the similarities of the various Essence and Personality systems: "When I asked him [Dr. Jose Stevens] why the Michael teachings and Personessence'''[[trademark symbol|™]]''' were so strikingly similar to Fourth Way and Arica programs even though the founders claim to be uninformed by the other, he explained that their commonality reflects the underlying truths about consciousness and its development.." (p 166) &lt;ref name=Alber/&gt;  ... "To test the appeal of the Michael system approach to self-understanding in my community, I developed and taught a workshop at a regional conference that I entitled ''The Keys to Self-Mastery'' in which I gave the revised I-MAP introductory presentation to a group of twenty individuals.  I also invited José Stevens to conduct an introductory weekend workshop to a group of ten individuals in my community.  From these experiences, I have direct awareness of the important insights that this system offers to individuals beyond the integral paradigm originally embodied by the IMAP.  Years after these events, participants have expressed an enduring appreciation for the insights they gained about themselves and others, and ask when and how I intend to continue the work."

==Biography of Sarah Chambers ==
'''Sally Jo "Sarah" (McCord) Chambers''' (1937-1998) was an American teacher who wrote the body of work now known as the Michael Teachings.

Sarah Chambers was born Sally Jo McCord on November 30, 1937, in Cincinnati, Ohio to Elmer Ernest McCord and Dorothy Lee Clark. She died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on December 8, 1998.  As a teenager, Sarah lived in Michigan,&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index on Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; then later lived for a time in Orange County, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Orange County, California Voter Registration Rolls, 1960 on Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961, she married her first husband, Walter James Polhemus, in Kansas; they divorced in Solano County, California in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;California Divorce Index on Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Sarah married Richard "Dick" Chambers in Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;California Marriage Index on Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they were involved in early groups studying the self-understanding work of [[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff]] in Oakland, California.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  After leaving those Gurdjieff groups,&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Robert Earl.  An Unauthorized Biography of "The Teacher" and His Cult url=https://robertearlburton.blogspot.com/search/label/Michael%20Teachings&lt;/ref&gt; they started hosting meetings of friends at their home in Oakland, California &lt;ref name=History/&gt; Starting in August 1973 and using a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija Ouija board], Sarah Chambers "brought through" information about personality and how to get along better in the world in answer to questions that members of the group asked.&lt;ref name=History&gt;Center for Michael Teachings (2013). ''Michael Speaks: The Legacy of Sarah Chambers (Volume 2)'' "History of the Michael Teachings," starting on page 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the early 1970s, Sarah had been meeting in a small study group along with Alice Hannah, their husbands (both named Richard) and other close friends who were interested in more advanced spiritual study.  Friends invited friends to the groups.  Some stayed for a time and many others just passed through.  Over the years the group existed, the core of what has become known today as "the Michael Teachings" was revealed.  Alice Hannah, "secretary" for the original Michael study group in the early 1970s, kept the group's records and created transcripts of their sessions.  The information they brought forth provides the foundation of the body of knowledge, which has now expanded as more teachers are trained and students develop more advanced skills.  As advanced students progress in their awareness and needs, new levels of information are being revealed that deepen and broaden the original work.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

One concern of the early group was how they would be perceived by others as many of them were professionals, doctors, lawyers, teachers, scientists, psychologists, community leaders and business people.  Channeling &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: Mediumship and Channeling url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship#Channeling&lt;/ref&gt; and spiritual subjects at the time were not considered "mainstream" activities. In 1995, Sarah answered some questions about why the groups stopped.  She said "Our meetings in the beginning — and I'm sure Alice &amp; Dick feel this way too — were fun and they were like big family gatherings.  Quite often, there were 18-20 people staying here at the house on the weekends for mega-sessions.  No money ever changed hands, since Michael always said the teaching would pay for itself.  Then, in 1976, the atmosphere changed  ... I just lost interest, that's all and went on to other things. I miss the camaraderie very much.  There was a tightness in the group that made it stick together.  We came to the meetings, whether they were here or at Alice &amp; Dick's, with potluck dishes and stayed until early in the morning.  Those sessions went on for many hours with breaks for dinner and, sometimes, breakfast." &lt;ref name=History/&gt;

Around that same time, Sarah took a full-time job and her interests changed to other things.  During this time, she encountered [[Chelsea Quinn Yarbro]], a fiction writer who had heard about Sarah's groups.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  Some of the early transcripts of the groups were used in Yarbro's books ''Messages from Michael'' &lt;ref&gt;Yarbro, Chelsea Quinn, (1980). ''Messages from Michael'', {{ISBN|978-0425065334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''More Messages from Michael.''.&lt;ref&gt;Yarbro, Chelsea Quinn, (1986). ''More Messages from Michael'', {{ISBN|978-0976654445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yarbro's book ''Michael's People'' &lt;ref&gt;Yarbro, Chelsea Quinn, (1988). ''Michael's People'', {{ISBN|978-0425109328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fictionalized people involved in the early study groups.

Public Domain transcripts of Sarah's early groups have been published by the non-profit [http://www.centerformichaelteachings.org/books.htm Center for Michael Teachings] in three volumes in a series called ''The Legacy of Sarah Chambers.''

After Sarah stopped hosting the large public groups, a student of hers, Leslie Briggs, hosted her own groups, starting in 1974 and continuing until 1983.  Transcribed sessions from Leslie that have survived have been published by the Center for Michael Teachings.&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;Center for Michael Teachings (2013). ''Michael Speaks: The Legacy of Leslie Briggs''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1990s, Sarah came back to channeling and the Michael Teachings.  In 1996, she attended a conference of 16 Michael channels in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Hoodwin, Shepherd. Mentions that Sarah attended a conference with other Michael channels in Colorado url=https://shepherdhoodwin.com/book/journey-of-your-soul/channeling-michael-information-more-than-once/&lt;/ref&gt;  She stayed involved and allowed her name to be used publicly until her death in 1998 at age 61.&lt;ref&gt;Marina-Tompkins, Victoria (2010) "Sarah Chambers: Her Final Years 1995-1998" url=http://www.flightofthehawk.com/Articles/new_work/sarah_chambers_the_final_years.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Thomas Urquhart''' (* 1611; † 1660) was a Scottish aristocrat, writer, and translator. He is best known for his translation of the works of French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] to English.

==Biography==
Urquhart was born to an [[Clan Urquhart|old landholding family]] in [[Cromarty]] in northern [[Scotland]]. At the age of eleven he attended [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]]. Afterwards he toured the Continent, returning in 1636. In 1639, he participated in the Royalist uprising known as the [[Trot of Turriff]]; he was knighted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] for his support. In 1641 he published his first book, a volume of epigrams.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Urquhart's father died in 1642, leaving behind a large estate encumbered by larger debts. As the eldest son, Urquhart was from that time on harassed by creditors. He left for the Continent in order to economize, but returned in 1645 and published ''Trissotetras'', a mathematical treatise.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1648, Urquhart participated in the Royalist uprising at [[Inverness]]. He was declared a traitor by Parliament, though he doesn't seem to have suffered any other consequences. Two years later he marched with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and fought in the [[Battle of Worcester]]. The Royalist forces were decisively defeated and Urquhart was taken prisoner. He lost all his manuscripts, which he had brought with him for safekeeping, and he had to forfeit all his property. He was held first at the [[Tower of London]] and later at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]], but he was given considerable freedom by his captors. The following year he published ''Pantochronachanon'', a work of genealogy, and ''The Jewel'', a defense of Scotland. In 1652, he was paroled by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and returned to Cromarty. Soon after he published ''[[Logopandecteision]]'', his plan for a [[universal language]], and his most celebrated work, his translation of Rabelais.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Urquhart returned to the Continent some time after 1653, perhaps as a condition of his release by Cromwell.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
Little is known of his life after this time. He died no later than 1660, because in that year his younger brother took up his hereditary titles. 
There is a legend that Urquhart died in a fit of laughter on receiving news of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II.

==Works==
; ''Epigrams, Divine and Moral'' (1641) : Collections of [[epigram]]s were fashionable in the mid seventeenth century, but Urquhart's contribution to the genre has not been highly regarded. Most critics have concluded that the sentiments are largely banal and the versification inept.

; ''Trissotetras'' (1645) : ''Trissotetras'' treats plane and spherical [[trigonometry]] using [[John Napier|Napier]]'s [[logarithm]]s and a new nomenclature designed to facilitate memorization. Urquhart's nomenclature resembles the names medieval schoolmen gave the various forms of [[syllogism]], in which the construction of the name gives information about the thing being named. (Urquhart would make use of the same idea in his universal language.) The resulting effect is, however, bizarre, and the work is impenetrable without the investment of considerable time to learn Urquhart's system. Although Urquhart was a formidable mathematician and ''Trissotetras'' mathematically sound, his approach has never been adopted and his book is a dead end in the history of mathematics.

; ''Pantochronachanon'' (1652) : Subtitled "A peculiar promptuary of time," this work is a genealogy of the Urquhart family. In it, Urquhart manages to name each of his ancestors in an unbroken hereditary line from Adam and Eve all the way up to himself through 153 generations. This work has been the subject of ridicule since the time of its first publication, though it was likely an elaborate joke.

; ''The Jewel (Ekskybalauron)'' (1652) ({{ISBN|0707303273}}) : A miscellaneous work. It contains a prospectus for Urquhart's universal language, but most of the book is, as the title page says, "a vindication of the honor of Scotland," including anecdotes about many Scottish soldiers and scholars.  It includes Urquhart's fictionalized life of the Scottish hero [[James Crichton of Eliock and Cluny|James Crichton]] (1560–82, "The Admirable Crichton"), Urquhart's most celebrated work outside of his Rabelais; this section has sometimes been reprinted separately.

; ''[[Logopandecteision]]'' (1653) : This book contains another prospectus for Urquhart's universal language. Although Urquhart does not give a vocabulary, he explains that his system would be based on a scheme in which the construction of words would reflect their meanings. ''Logopandecteision'' also contains a polemic against Urquhart's creditors.

; ''The Works of [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]'' (Books I and II, 1653; Book III, 1693) : This is the work for which Urquhart is best known. It is considered one of the best translations of any work into English.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} There is a perfect match of temperament between author and translator. Urquhart's learning, pedantry and word-mad exuberance proved to be ideal for Rabelais's work. It is a somewhat free translation, but it never departs from the spirit of Rabelais. The third book was edited and completed by [[Pierre Antoine Motteux|Peter Anthony Motteux]] and published after Urquhart's death.

==Style==
Urquhart's prose style is unique. His sentences are long and elaborate and his love of the odd and recondite word seems boundless {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. At its worst his style can descend into almost unintelligible pretension and pedantry ("a pedantry which is gigantesque and almost incredible", in the words of [[George Saintsbury]]), but at its best it can be rich, rapid and vivid, with arresting and original imagery. He coined words constantly, although none of Urquhart's coinages have fared as well as those of his contemporary [[Thomas Browne|Browne]].

==Posthumous appearances==
Urquhart appears as the protagonist of [[Alasdair Gray]]'s short story "Sir Thomas's Logopandocy" (included in ''[[Unlikely Stories, Mostly]]''), the title taken from Urquhart's ''Logopandecteision'' and some of the material pastiching &lt;!-- ? --&gt; ''The Jewel (Ekskybalauron)''. Urquhart appears in the illustrations throughout ''Unlikely Stories''.

Urquhart appears as a major character in the novel ''A Hand-book of Volapük'' by [[Andrew Drummond (author)|Andrew Drummond]].  Urquhart's language proposal "The Jewel" as well as [[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], and other constructed languages are prominent plot devices in the novel.

One of the characters in Robertson Davies' [[Cornish Trilogy]] claims to be a descendant of Urquhart.

'''Togo''' (October 17, 1913 &amp;ndash; December 5, 1929) was the lead sled dog of [[Leonhard Seppala]] and his [[dog sled]] team in the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] across central and northern Alaska.

==Background==
Togo was one of the offspring of Seppala's former lead dog, "Suggen".&lt;ref name="Corporation1927"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=Popular Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=licDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=April 1927|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=20|issn=0161-7370}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after the Japanese admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]].&lt;ref name=litsite1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.litsite.org/index.cfm?section=Digital-Archives&amp;page=Land-Sea-Air&amp;cat=Dog-Mushing&amp;viewpost=2&amp;contentid=2561 |title=Togo and Balto, Dog Heroes |last1=Houdek |first1=Jennifer |last2=Brown |first2=Tricia |work=LitSite Alaska |publisher=University of Alaska Anchorage |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he did not
look like he had potential as a sled dog. He only grew to about 48 pounds (22&amp;nbsp;kg) in adulthood, which was small compared to typical sled dogs, and had a black, brown, and gray coat that made him appear perpetually dirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay Salisbury|first=Laney Salisbury|title=The Cruelest Miles|year=2003|publisher=W.W.

Togo was ill as a young puppy and required intensive nursing from Seppala's wife. He was very 
bold and rowdy, thus seen as "difficult and mischievous", showing "all the signs of becoming a&amp;nbsp;... canine delinquent" according to one reporter. At first, this behaviour was interpreted as evidence that he had been spoiled by the individual attention given to him during his illness. As he did not seem suited to be a [[sled dog]], Seppala gave him away to be a pet dog at 6 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cruellest Miles|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After only a few weeks as a house pet, Togo jumped through the glass of a closed window and ran several miles back to his original master's kennel. This devotion to the team impressed Seppala, so he did not try to give him away again. However, Togo continued to cause trouble by breaking out of the kennel when Seppala took the team out on runs. He would attack the lead dogs of oncoming teams, "as if&amp;nbsp;... to clear the way for his master". However, one day, he attacked a much stockier [[Alaskan Malamute|malamute]] leader and was mauled and severely injured. When he recovered, Togo stopped attacking other teams' lead dogs. This would eventually prove a valuable early experience, as it was difficult to teach a lead dog to keep a wide berth of oncoming teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cruelest Miles|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Togo was 8 months old, he proved his worth as a sled dog. He had run after the team yet again and slept, unnoticed, near the cabin where Seppala was spending the night. The next day, Seppala spotted him far off in the distance, and understood why his dogs had been so keyed up. Togo continued to make Seppala's work difficult, trying to play with the work dogs and leading them in "charges against [[reindeer]]", pulling them off the trail. Seppala had no choice but to put him in a [[Dog harness|harness]] to control him, and was surprised that Togo instantly settled down. As the run wore on, Seppala kept moving Togo up the line until, at the end of the day, he was sharing the lead position with the lead dog (named "Russky"). Togo had logged 75 miles on his first day in harness, which was unheard of for an inexperienced young sled dog, especially a puppy. Seppala called him an "infant prodigy", and later added that "I had found a natural-born leader, something I had tried for years to breed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cruelest Miles|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Togo began training, and after a few years filled the lead dog position. He became one of Seppala's most treasured dogs, a close and mutually beneficial relationship that would continue to the end of Togo's life. At the time of the historic Serum Run, he was 12 years old and had been a lead dog for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cruelest Miles|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the historian Earl Aversano, in 1960, in his old age, Seppala recalled "I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail."

==Great Race of Mercy ==
{{Main|1925 serum run to Nome}}

The first batch of 300,240 [[international unit|units]] of serum was delivered by [[train]] from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Nenana, Alaska]], where it was picked up by the first of twenty mushers and more than 100 dogs who relayed the serum a total of 674 miles (1,085&amp;nbsp;km) to Nome.

Togo and Seppala traveled 170 miles (274&amp;nbsp;km) from Nome in three days, and picked up the serum in [[Shaktoolik, Alaska|Shaktoolik]] on January 31.&lt;ref name=litsite2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.litsite.org/index.cfm?section=Digital-Archives&amp;page=Land-Sea-Air&amp;cat=Dog-Mushing&amp;viewpost=2&amp;ContentId=2559 |title=The Serum Run of 1925 |last=Houdek |first=Jennifer |work=LitSite Alaska |publisher=University of Alaska Anchorage |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature was estimated at &amp;minus;30&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;34&amp;nbsp;°C), and the [[gale]] force winds causing a [[wind chill]] of &amp;minus;85&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;65&amp;nbsp;°C).

The return trip crossed the exposed open ice of the [[Norton Sound]]. The night and a ground blizzard prevented [[Seppala]] from being able to see the path but Togo navigated to the [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] at Isaac's Point on the shore by 8 &lt;small&gt;[[12-hour clock|PM]]&lt;/small&gt; preventing certain death to his team. After traveling 84 miles (134&amp;nbsp;km) in one day, the team slept for six hours before continuing at 2 AM.

Before the night the temperature dropped to &amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°C), and the wind increased to 65&amp;nbsp;mi/h (105&amp;nbsp;km/h). The team ran across the ice, which was breaking up, while following the shoreline. They returned to shore to cross [[Little McKinley Mountain]], climbing 5,000 feet (1,500 m). After descending to the next roadhouse in [[Golovin, Alaska|Golovin]], Seppala passed the serum to Charlie Olsen, who in turn would pass it to [[Gunnar Kaasen]] and [[Balto]].

Katy Steinmetz in Time Magazine wrote that “the dog that often gets credit for eventually saving the town is Balto, but he just happened to run the last, 55-mile leg in the race. The sled dog who did the lion's share of the work was Togo. His journey, fraught with white-out storms, was the longest by 200 miles and included a traverse across perilous Norton Sound — where he saved his team and driver in a courageous swim through ice floes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059858_2059863_2060458,00.html|title=Top 10 Heroic Animals|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|date=2011-03-21|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

After the successful serum run, the hero dog Balto became the most famous canine of the run. Many [[mushing|musher]]s today consider Balto to be the back up dog, as Seppala's team led by Togo covered the longest and most hazardous leg. They made a round trip of 365 miles.

Immediately after the relay, Togo and another dog on the team escaped to chase after [[reindeer]], eventually returning to their kennel in [[Little Creek, Alaska|Little Creek]]. Seppala was dismayed that the champion was neglected by the press, commenting "it was almost more than I could bear when the newspaper dog Balto received a statue for his 'glorious achievements'".&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cruelest Miles|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1926, Seppala, Togo, and a team of dogs went on a tour from [[Seattle, Washington]] to [[California]]; Seppala and Togo drew large crowds at stadiums and [[department store]]s, and even appeared in a [[Lucky Strike]] [[cigarette]] campaign. In [[New York City]], Seppala drove his team from the steps of City Hall along [[Fifth Avenue]] and made a pass through [[Central Park]]. The team appeared multiple times at [[Madison Square Garden]], which was being managed by Tom Rickard, formerly of Nome, and where Togo was awarded a gold medal by [[Roald Amundsen]].

In [[New England]], they competed in several dog sled races against local [[Chinook (dog)|Chinook]]s and won by huge margins. Seppala sold most of his team to a local [[kennel]].

Togo retired in [[Poland Spring, Maine]], where he was [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]] on December 5, 1929 at 16 years old. The headline in ''The New York Sun Times'' the next day was "Dog Hero Rides to His Death" (Salisbury &amp; Salisbury, 2003), and he was eulogized in many other papers. After his death, Seppala had him custom mounted. The mounted skin was on display at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne Vermont. Alaskan students started a letter campaign to return Togo to Alaska. Today the mounted skin is on display in a glass case at the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race Headquarters museum in [[Wasilla, Alaska]]. The [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]] has his skeleton in their collection.

Togo's reputation earned him enduring fame. The popular fictional teen sleuth [[Nancy Drew]] named a stray terrier after him in the 1937 novel ''[[The Whispering Statue]]''. The dog appears in most of the Nancy Drew novels.

'''Thomas John Thomson''' (August 5, 1877{{spaced ndash}}July 8, 1917) was a Canadian artist active in the early 20th century. During his short career he produced roughly 400 [[oil sketch]]s on small [[Panel painting|wood panels]] along with around 50 larger works on canvas. His works consist almost entirely of landscapes, depicting trees, skies, lakes, and rivers. His paintings use broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the  beauty and colour of the [[Ontario]] landscape. Thomson's accidental death at 39 by drowning came just after the founding of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and is seen as a tragedy for [[Canadian art]].

Raised in rural Ontario, Thomson was born into a large family of farmers and displayed no immediate artistic talent. He worked several jobs before attending a business college, eventually developing skills in [[penmanship]] and [[Copperplate script|copperplate]] writing. At the turn of the 20th century, he was employed in [[Seattle]] and [[Toronto]] as a pen artist at several different [[photoengraving]] firms, including [[Grip Ltd.]] There he met those who eventually formed the Group of Seven, including [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], [[Lawren Harris]], [[Frederick Varley]], [[Franklin Carmichael]] and [[Arthur Lismer]]. In May 1912, he visited [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]]—a major public park and forest reservation in [[Central Ontario]]—for the first time. It was there that he acquired his first sketching equipment and, following MacDonald's advice, began to capture nature scenes. He became enraptured with the area and repeatedly returned, typically spending his winters in Toronto and the rest of the year in the Park. While his earliest paintings were not outstanding technically, they showed a good grasp of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] and colour handling. His later paintings vary in composition and contain vivid colours and thickly applied paint. His later work has had a great influence on Canadian art—paintings such as ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' have taken a prominent place in the [[culture of Canada]] and are some of the country's most iconic works.

Thomson developed a reputation during his lifetime as a veritable [[Outdoor enthusiast|outdoorsman]], talented in both fishing and [[canoeing]], although his talents in the latter have been contested. The circumstances of his drowning on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] in Algonquin Park, linked with his image as a master canoeist, led to unsubstantiated but persistent rumours that he had been murdered or committed suicide.

Although he died before the formal establishment of the Group of Seven, Thomson is often considered an unofficial member. His art is typically exhibited with the rest of the Group's, nearly all of which remains in Canada—mainly at the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] in [[Kleinburg]] and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in [[Owen Sound]].

==Life==
===Early years===

Thomas John "Tom" Thomson was born in [[Claremont, Ontario]], the sixth of John and Margaret Thomson's ten children.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#boyhood-years 4]}} He was raised in [[Leith, Ontario]], near [[Owen Sound]], in the municipality of [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}} Thomson and his siblings enjoyed both drawing and painting, although he did not immediately display any major talents.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#boyhood-years 4]}} He was eventually taken out of school for a year because of ill health, including a respiratory problem variously described as "weak lungs" or "inflammatory [[rheumatism]]".{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|MacDonald|1917|p=47}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him free time to explore the woods near his home and develop an appreciation of nature.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#boyhood-years 4]}}

The family were unsuccessful as farmers; both Thomson and his father often abandoned their chores to go hiking, hunting and fishing.{{sfnb|Murray|1998|pp=14–15, 22–25}} Thomson regularly went on walks with Dr. William Brodie (1831–1909), his grandmother's first cousin.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-artist-and-nature 57]}}{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=5}} Brodie was a well-known [[Entomology|entomologist]], [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[Botany|botanist]], and Thomson's sister Margaret later recounted that they collected specimens on long walks together.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|pp=6–7}}{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=93}}

Thomson was also enthusiastic about sports, once breaking his toe while playing football.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}} He was an excellent swimmer and fisherman, inheriting his passion for the latter from his grandfather and father.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}} Like most of those in his community, he regularly attended church. Some stories say that he sketched in the hymn books during services and entertained his sisters with caricatures of their neighbours. His sisters later said that they had fun "guessing who they were", indicating that he was not necessarily adept at capturing people's likeness.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}}

[[File:Young Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of a young Tom Thomson, {{circa|lk=no|1900}}]]

Each of Thomson's nine siblings received an inheritance from their paternal grandfather.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}} Thomson received $2000 in 1898 but seems to have spent it quickly.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=42}} A year later, he entered a machine shop apprenticeship at an iron foundry owned by William Kennedy, a close friend of his father, but left only eight months later.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 6]}} Also in 1899, he volunteered to fight in the [[Second Boer War]], but was turned down because of a medical condition.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|pp=107–08}} He tried to enlist for the Boer War three times in all, but was denied each time.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}}

In 1901, Thomson enrolled at Canada Business College in [[Chatham–Kent|Chatham, Ontario]]. The school advertised instruction in [[shorthand|stenography]], [[bookkeeping]], [[business correspondence]] and "plain and ornamental [[penmanship]]".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}} There, he developed abilities in penmanship and [[copperplate script|copperplate]]—necessary skills for a clerk.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}} After graduating at the end of 1901, he travelled briefly to [[Winnipeg]] before leaving for [[Seattle]] in January 1902, joining his older brother, George Thomson.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=42}} George and cousin F. R. McLaren had established the Acme Business School in Seattle, listed as the 11th largest business school in the United States.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Murray|1971|p=9}} Thomson worked briefly as an elevator operator at [[The Diller Hotel]]. By 1902, two more of his brothers, Ralph and Henry, had moved west to join the family's new school.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 6]}}

===Graphic design work===
====Seattle (1901–04)====
After studying at the business school for six months, Thomson was hired at Maring &amp; Ladd as a pen artist, [[Drafter|draftsman]] and [[Etching|etcher]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} He mainly produced business cards, brochures and posters, as well as [[CMYK color model|three-colour printing]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Having previously learned [[calligraphy]], he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} While working at Maring &amp; Ladd, he was known to be stubborn; his brother Fraser wrote that, instead of completing his work according to the direction provided, he would use his own design ideas, which angered his boss.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|pp=50–51}} Thomson may have also worked as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=51}}

He eventually moved on to a local engraving company. Despite a good salary he left by the end of 1904. He quickly returned to Leith, possibly prompted by a rejected marriage proposal after his brief summer romance with [[Alice Elinor Lambert]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=52}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Lambert, who never married, later became a writer;{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=43}} in one of her stories, she describes a young girl who refuses an artist's proposal and later regrets her decision.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}}

====Toronto (1905–12)====

[[File:Profile of the painter Tom Thomson wearing a hat.jpg|thumb|Profile of Thomson wearing a suit and hat, {{circa|lk=no|1905–10}}. During this time, Thomson was known to dress well and spend his money on nice clothes and fine dining.]]

Thomson moved to Toronto in the summer of 1905.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=92}} His first job upon his return to Canada was at the photo-engraving firm Legg Brothers, earning $11 a week.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=52}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 7]}} He spent his free time reading poetry and going to concerts, the theatre and sporting events.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}} In a letter to an aunt, he wrote, "I love poetry best."{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=viii}} Friends described him during this time as "periodically erratic and sensitive, with fits of unreasonable despondency". Apart from buying art supplies, he spent his money on expensive clothes, fine dining and tobacco.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 7]}} Around this time, he may have studied briefly with [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]], a British artist who taught at the [[OCAD University|Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name="Cruikshank"/&gt; Cruikshank was likely Thomson's only art instructor.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}}

In 1908 or 1909, Thomson joined [[Grip Ltd.]], a firm in Toronto that specialized in design and lettering work.{{efn|group=note|Sources disagree on the timing of Thomson's hiring. Grip supervisor Albert H.

Photo Engravers; in 1910 merely as an artist living at 99 Gerrard E.; and in 1911 as at Grip Ltd. Hill supposes that Thomson therefore likely began at Grip in late 1909, after the information for the 1910 directory was collected.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113n16}}}} Grip was the leading graphic-design company in the country and introduced [[Art Nouveau]], [[Steel engraving|metal engraving]] and the [[CMYK color model|four-colour process]] to Canada.{{sfnb|King|2010|p=14}} Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that Thomson's early work at the firm was mostly in lettering and decorative designs for booklets and labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robson|1932|p=138}} quoted in {{harvp|Stacey|2002|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that Thomson made friends slowly but eventually found similar interests to his coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robson|1937|p=6}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the employees at Grip had been members of the Toronto Art Students' League, a group of newspaper artists, illustrators and commercial artists active between 1886 and 1904.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=115}} The members sketched in parts of [[eastern Canada]] and published an annual calendar with illustrations depicting Canadian history and rural life.{{sfnb|Stacey|1998|p=96n9}}

The senior artist at Grip, [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}} It was at Grip that many of the eventual members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] would meet. In December 1910, artist William Smithson Broadhead was hired, joined by [[Arthur Lismer]] in February 1911.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=114}} Robson eventually hired [[Frederick Varley]], followed by [[Franklin Carmichael]] in April 1911.{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=310}}{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=16}} Although Thomson was not himself a member,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9n2]}} it was at the [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts and Letters Club]] that MacDonald introduced Thomson to [[Lawren Harris]].{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=16}} The club was considered the "centre of living culture in Toronto", providing an informal environment for the artistic community.{{sfnb|Reid|1970|p=28}} Every member of what would become the original Group of Seven had now met.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} MacDonald left Grip in November 1911 to do freelance work and spend more time painting,{{sfnb|Stacey|Bishop|1996|p=118}} after the Ontario government purchased his canvas ''By the River (Early Spring)'' (1911).{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=114}}

====Exploring Algonquin Park (1912–13)====

[[Image:Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|Thomson fishing in [[Algonquin Park]], {{circa|lk=no}} 1914–16. He was enamoured with the Park and many of his works were painted in the area.]]

[[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] was established in 1893 by [[Oliver Mowat]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]]. Covering eighteen rectangular townships in [[Central Ontario]], the Park was created to provide a space dedicated to recreation, wildlife and watershed protection, though logging operations continued to be permitted.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} Thomson learned of the Park from fellow artist Tom McLean.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=94}}  In May 1912, aged 34, he first visited the Park, venturing through the area on a canoe trip with his Grip colleague H. B. (Ben) Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{plainlist|

* {{harvp|Stacey|2002|p=57}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they took the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] from Toronto to Scotia Junction, then transferred to the [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]], arriving at [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] Station.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=94}} McLean introduced Thomson to the Park superintendent, G. W. Barlett.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=88n4}} Thomson and Jackson later met ranger Harry (Bud) Callighen while they camped nearby on Smoke Lake.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Addison|1974|p=75}}

It was also at this time that Thomson acquired his first sketching equipment.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=3}} He did not yet take painting seriously. According to Jackson, Thomson did not think "his work would ever be taken seriously; in fact, he used to chuckle over the idea".{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=25–26}} Instead, they spent most of their time fishing,{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=25–26}} except for "a few notes, skylines and colour effects".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}

During the same trip, Thomson read [[Izaak Walton]]'s 1653 fishing guide, ''[[The Compleat Angler]]''.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=26}} Primarily a fisherman's bible, the book also provided a philosophy of how to live, similar to the one described in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1854 book, ''[[Walden|Walden, or Life in the Woods]]'', a reflection on [[simple living]] in natural surroundings.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=26}} His time in Algonquin Park gave him an ideal setting to imitate Walton's "contemplative" life.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}} Ben Jackson wrote:

{{quote|Tom was never understood by lots of people, was very quiet, modest and, as a friend of mine spoke of him, a gentle soul. He cared nothing for social life, but with one or two companions on a sketching and fishing trip with his pipe and [[Hudson Bay]] tobacco going, he was a delightful companion. If a party or the boys got a little loud or rough Tom would get his sketching kit and wander off alone. At times he liked to be that way, wanted to be by himself commune {{sic}} with nature.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}}}}

Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the ''[[The Toronto World|Toronto Sunday World]]'', included in which were several illustrations.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}} After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today [[Mississagi Provincial Park]]).{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}} Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills;{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}} the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{efn|group=note|Thomson wrote in a letter to his friend M. J. (John) McRuer: {{quote|We started in at Bisco and took a long trip on the lakes around there going up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and over into the Mississauga &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississagi River|Mississagi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; water we got a great many good snapshots of game—mostly moose and some sketches, ''but'' we had a dump in the forty-mile rapids which is near the end of our trip and lost most of our stuff—we only saved 2 rolls of film out of about 14 dozen. Outside of that we had a peach of a time as the Mississauga is considered the finest canoe trip in the world.{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|p=297}}}}}}

In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous &amp; Mann.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous &amp; Mann too.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}}{{sfnb|Klages|2016|p=23}} They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}} Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him "a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robson|1932|p=138}} quoted in {{harvp|Stacey|2002|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=57-58}} Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success "was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress. Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies&amp;nbsp;... Tom Thomson, so far as I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rossell|c. 1951|p=3}} quoted in {{harvp|Stacey|2002|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tom Thomson, Northern Lake.jpg|thumb|''Northern Lake'', Winter 1912–13. 71.7 x 102.4 cm. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto]]

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. [[James MacCallum]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}} A frequent visitor to the [[Ontario Society of Artists]]' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as [[John William Beatty]], [[Arthur Heming]], MacDonald and Harris.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}} MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to [[A. Y. Jackson]], later a founder of the Group of Seven.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=122}} MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=21}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 11]}} MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to "take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=122}} MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their "truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland&amp;nbsp;... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places." He described Thomson's paintings as "dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects".{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=376}} After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 11]}}

Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=122}} He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: "The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty."{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|p=298}} He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the [[Mattagami First Nation|Mattagami reserve]].{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=312}} Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours,{{sfnb|Addison|1974|p=18}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=13}} although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few weeks in the Park the previous year.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=121}} Thomson became as familiar with logging scenes as with nature in the Park and painted them both.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-artist-and-nature 58]}}

While returning to Toronto in November 1912, Thomson stopped in [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=121}}{{sfnb|Addison|1974|pp=25–26}} The visit was possibly to meet with Winfred Trainor, a woman whose family owned a cottage on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. Trainor was later rumoured to have been engaged to Thomson with a wedding planned for the late 1917, although little is known about their relationship.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#thomsons-early-paintings 12]}}{{sfnb|King|2010|pp=169–70}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's possible romantic relationship with Trainor, refer to {{harvp|MacGregor|2010}}.}}

Thomson first exhibited with the OSA in March 1913, selling his painting ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13) to the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario Government]] for $250 ({{Inflation|CA|250|1914|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=[[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]}}).{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#painting-full-time 12]}} The sale afforded him time to paint and sketch through the summer and fall of 1913.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}}

{{Quote box|align=left|width=85%|quote="[[Oil sketch|Sketch]]" indicates that the work is a smaller [[Oil paint|oil]] work, generally on [[Panel painting|wood panel]].

====Early recognition (1914–15)====
{{see also|Northern River (painting)|Spring Ice|Studio Building (Toronto)}}

[[File:The Studio Building 2, Toronto, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in Toronto, where Thomson lived and worked from January 1914 through November 1915.]]

Thomson often experienced self-doubt. A. Y. Jackson recalled that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration,{{sfnb|Jackson|1958|p=31}} and was "so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}} Harris expressed similar sentiments, writing that Thomson "had no opinion of his own work", and would even throw burnt matches at his paintings.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=117, 117n36}} Several of the canvases he sent to exhibitions remained unsigned.{{efn|group=note|Unsigned paintings exhibited during Thomson's lifetime include: ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13); ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Morning Cloud.jpg|Morning Cloud]]''; ''Moonlight'' (1913–14); ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Split Rock, Georgian Bay.jpg|Split Rock, Georgian Bay]]''; ''Canadian Wildflowers''; ''Moonlight'' (1915); and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson October.jpg|October]]''.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117n35}}}} If someone praised one of his sketches, he immediately gave it to them as a gift.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}} A turning point in his career came in 1914, when the [[National Gallery of Canada]], under the directorship of Eric Brown, began to acquire his paintings. Although the money was not enough to live on, the recognition was unheard of for an unknown artist.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#a-startling-debut 13]}}

For several years he shared a studio and living quarters with fellow artists, initially living in the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] with Jackson in January 1914. Jackson described the Studio Building as "a lively centre for new ideas, experiments, discussions, plans for the future and visions of an art inspired by the Canadian countryside".{{sfnb|Jackson|1958|p=27}} It was there that Thomson, "after much self-deprecation, finally submitted to becoming a full-time artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jackson|1933|p=138}} quoted in {{harvp|Roza|1997|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They split the rent—$22 a month—on the ground floor while construction on the rest of the building was finished.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}} After Jackson moved out in December to go to [[Montreal]], Carmichael took his place.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Murray|2006|p=17}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=128}} Thomson and Carmichael shared a studio space through the winter.{{sfnb|King|2010|pp=154–59}} On March 3, 1914, Thomson was nominated as a member of the OSA by Lismer and T. G. Greene. He was elected on the 17th. He did not participate in any of their activities, however, beyond sending paintings for annual exhibitions.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}} Harris described Thomson's strange working hours years later:

{{quote|When he was in Toronto, Tom rarely left the shack in the daytime and then only when it was absolutely necessary. He took his exercise at night. He would put on his snowshoes and tramp the length of the [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] ravine and out into the country, and return before dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harris|1964}} quoted in {{harvp|Silcox|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Tom Thomson with fish.jpg|thumb|Thomson with his catch at [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], {{circa|lk=no|1915}}]]

In late April 1914, Thomson arrived in Algonquin Park, where he was joined by Lismer on May 9. They camped on Molly's Island in Smoke Lake, travelling to Canoe, Smoke, Ragged, Crown and Wolf Lakes.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=124}} He spent his spring and summer divided between [[Georgian Bay]] and Algonquin Park, visiting James MacCallum by canoe. His travels during this time have proved difficult to discern, with such a large amount of ground covered in such a short time, painting the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]], [[Byng Inlet (Ontario)|Byng Inlet]], [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]] and Go-Home Bay from May 24 through August 10.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=105}} H. A. Callighen, a park ranger, wrote in his journal that Thomson and Lismer left Algonquin Park on May 24.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}} By May 30, Thomson was at Parry Sound and on June 1 was camped at the French River with MacCallum.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}}{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=105n70}}

Art historian [[Joan Murray (art historian)|Joan Murray]] noted that Thomson was at Go-Home Bay for the next two months, or at least until August 10 when he was seen again in Algonquin Park by Callighan.{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=313}} According to Wadland, if this timeline is correct, it would require "an extraordinary canoeist&amp;nbsp;... The difficulty is augmented by the fact of stopping to sketch at intervals along the way."{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=105n70}} Wadland suggested that Thomson may have travelled by train at some point and by [[steamship]] thereafter.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=105}} Addison and Harwood instead said that Thomson had found much of the inland "monotonously flat" and the rapids "ordinary".{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=32}} Wadland found this characterization unhelpful, pointing out that the rapids Thomson had faced were hardly "ordinary".{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=105n70}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Cottage on a Rocky Shore.jpg|thumb|left|''Cottage on a Rocky Shore'', Summer 1914. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

MacCallum provided specific dates for two of Thomson's paintings—May 30 and June 1 for ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Parry Sound Harbour.jpg|Parry Sound Harbour]]'' and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Spring, French River.jpg|Spring, French River]]'', respectively.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}}{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=108}} These are some of the only instances of precise dating for his work.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=125–26}} In addition, ''Cottage on a Rocky Shore'' is a depiction of MacCallum's cottage contrasted with the vast expanse of sky and water. ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Evening, Pine Island.jpg|Evening, Pine Island]]'' is of a nearby island MacCallum took Thomson to visit.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=126}} He continued to paint around the islands until he departed, probably because he found MacCallum's cottage too demanding socially, writing to Varley that it was "too much like north Rosedale".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=126}}{{sfnb|Waddington|Waddington|2016|p=131}}

Thomson continued canoeing alone until he met with A. Y. Jackson at Canoe Lake in mid-September. Though [[World War I]] had erupted that year, he and Jackson went on a canoe trip, in October meeting up with Varley and his wife Maud, as well as Lismer and his wife Esther, and daughter Marjorie.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=126}} This marked the first time three Group of Seven members painted together, and the only time they worked with Thomson.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#a-startling-debut 13]}} In his 1958 autobiography, ''A Painter's Country'', A. Y. Jackson wrote that, "Had it not been for the war, the Group [of Seven] would have formed several years earlier and it would have included Thomson."{{sfnb|Jackson|1958|pp=53–54}}

Why Thomson did not serve in the war has been debated.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=40}} Mark Robinson and Thomson's family said that he was turned down after multiple attempts to enlist, likely due to his poor health and age but also possibly because he had [[flat feet]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|pp=107–08}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#a-startling-debut 13]}} Blodwen Davies wrote that Thomson's artist friends tried to convince him to not risk his life, but he decided to secretly volunteer anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1930|pp=29–31}} quoted in {{harvp|Hunter|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Hunter has found this scenario to be improbable, especially given that other artist friends ''did'' volunteer for the war, such as A. Y. Jackson.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=40}} Thomson's sister suggested that he was a pacifist and that "he hated war and said simply in 1914 that he never would kill anyone but would like to help in a hospital, if accepted".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thomson|1956|pp=21–24}} quoted in {{harvp|Hunter|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Colgate wrote that Thomson "brooded much upon" the war and that "he himself did not enlist. Rumour has it that he tried, and failed to pass the doctor. This is doubtful."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Colgate|1946|p=15}} quoted in {{harvp|Hunter|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Godin, a companion, said "We had many discussions on the war. As I remember it he did not think that Canada should be involved. He was very outspoken in his opposition to Government patronage. Especially in the Militia. I do not think that we would offer himself for service. I know up until that time he had not tried to enlist."{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=40}} There is only one verifiable example of Thomson's opinion on the war, taken from a letter he wrote to J. E. H. MacDonald in 1915:

{{quote|As with yourself, I can't get used to the idea of [A.

With MacCallum's year of financial support over, Thomson's financial future became uncertain.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=128}} He briefly looked into applying for a position as a park ranger, but balked after seeing that it could take months for the application to go through. Instead, he considered working in an engraving shop over the winter.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=126}} He made little effort to sell his paintings, preferring to give them away, though he brought in some money from the paintings he sold.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#gathering-momentum 14]}} In mid-November, he donated ''In Algonquin Park'' to an exhibition organized to raise money for the [[Canadian Patriotic Fund]]. It was sold to Marion Long for $50 ({{Inflation|CA|50|1914|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=CAD$}}).{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=128}}

In the spring of 1915, Thomson returned to Algonquin Park earlier than he had in any previous year and had already painted twenty-eight sketches by April 22. From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes, and sketching when he had time.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=131}} In July, he was invited to send paintings to the [[Nova Scotia]] Provincial Exhibition in September.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=133}} Because he was in Algonquin Park, his friends selected three works to send—two unidentified works from 1914 and the sketch ''Canadian Wildflowers''.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=133}} From the end of September to mid-October, he spent his time at Mowat, a village on the north end of Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=102}} By November, he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ghent|1949}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=46}} In late November, he returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him,{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=84}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=179}} renting it for $1 a month.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#painting-full-time 13]}}{{efn|group=note|In his 1959 piece, "My Memories of Tom Thomson", [[Thoreau MacDonald]] cited November 1915 as when Thomson moved into the shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132n119}} Most sources agree with this, including Charles Hill,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} William Little{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=179}} and Addison &amp; Harwood.{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=84}} David Silcox has written that the move happened in either late 1914{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}} or early 1915.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#painting-full-time 12–13]}}}}

In 1915, MacCallum commissioned MacDonald, Lismer and Thomson to paint decorative panels for his cottage on Go-Home Bay. In October of that year, MacDonald went up to take dimensions.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}}{{sfnb|Landry|1990|p=26}} Thomson produced four panels which were probably meant to go over the windows.

====Artistic peak (1916–17)====

In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: ''In the Northland'' (at that time titled ''The Birches''), ''[[Spring Ice]]'', ''Moonlight'' and ''October'' (then titled ''The Hardwoods''), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase ''In the Northland'', but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase ''Spring Ice'' instead.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}} The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' wrote, "Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairbairn|1916}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more favourable take came from artist [[Edmund Wyly Grier|Wyly Grier]] in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'':

{{quote|Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His ''Moonlight'', ''Spring Ice'' and ''The Birches'' are among his best.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=136–37}}}} In ''The Canadian Courier'', painter [[Estelle Muriel Kerr|Estelle Kerr]] also spoke positively, describing Thomson as "one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kerr|1916|p=13}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the large number of snow studies he produced at this time.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=137}} In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=137}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 16]}} After MacCallum and Chester left, Harris and Thomson paddled together to Aura Lee Lake.{{sfnb|Reid|1970|p=126}} Thomson produced many sketches which varied in composition, although they all had vivid colour and thickly-applied paint.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 16]}} MacCallum was present when he painted his ''Sketch for "The Jack Pine"'', writing that the tree fell over onto Thomson before the sketch was completed. He added that Harris thought the tree killed Thomson, "but he sprang up and continued painting".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=137}}

[[File:Thomson, Tea Lake Dam.jpg|thumb|''Tea Lake Dam'', Summer 1917. Sketch. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg]]

At the end of May, Thomson took a job as a fire ranger stationed at [[Achray, Ontario|Achray]] on [[Grand Lake (Nipissing)|Grand Lake]] with Ed Godin. He followed the [[John Rudolphus Booth#Lumber|Booth Lumber Company]]'s [[Log driving|log drive]] down the [[Petawawa River]] to the north end of the park.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=137–38}} He found that fire ranging and painting did not mix well together,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=138}} writing, "[I] have done very little sketching this summer as the two jobs don't fit in... When we are travelling two go together, one for canoe and the other the pack. And there's no place for a sketch outfit when your {{sic}} fire ranging. We are not fired yet but I am hoping to get put off right away."{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|pp=302–03}} He likely returned to Toronto in late October or early November.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=138}}

Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=20}} with Thomson writing in a letter that he "got quite a lot done".{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|pp=303–04}} Despite this, he did not submit any paintings to the OSA exhibition in the spring of 1917.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=139}} It was during this time that he produced many of his most famous works, including ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 17]}} Dr. MacCallum suggested that several canvas works were unfinished, including ''Woodland Waterfall'', ''The Pointers'' and ''The Drive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|MacCallum|1918|pp=375–85}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barker Fairley]] similarly described ''The West Wind'' as unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairley|1920|p=246}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Hill has written that there are no reasons to believe ''Woodland Waterfall'' was unfinished.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=139}} Similarly, while it has sometimes been suggested that ''The Drive'' was modified after Thomson's death,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Forsey|1975|p=188}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reproduction from 1918 displays no discernible differences.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=140, 140n167}}

Thomson returned to Canoe Lake at the beginning of April, arriving early enough to paint the remaining snow and the ice breaking up on the surrounding lakes. He had little money but wrote that he could manage for about a year. On April 28, 1917, he received a guide's licence. Unlike previous years, he remained at Mowat with Lieutenant Crombine and his wife, Daphne. Thomson invited Daphne Crombie to select something from his spring sketches as a gift, and she selected ''[[:File:Thomson, Path Behind Mowat Lodge.jpg|Path Behind Mowat Lodge]]''.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}}

Besides the deep love he had come to develop for Algonquin Park, Thomson was beginning to show an eagerness to depict areas beyond the park and explore other northern subjects.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography#final-spring 18]}} In an April 1917 letter to his brother-in-law, he wrote that he was considering taking the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] west so he could paint the [[Canadian Rockies]] in July and August.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=122}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|pp=304–05}} A. Y. Jackson suggested Thomson would have traveled even further north, just as the other members of the Group of Seven eventually did.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=122}}

{{main|Death and legacy of Tom Thomson}}

[[Image:Tom Thomson Memorial Cairn.jpg|thumb|The Tom Thomson Memorial Cairn, [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]], [[Algonquin Park]]]]

On July 8, 1917, Thomson disappeared during a canoeing trip on Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}} His upturned canoe was spotted later in the afternoon, and his body was discovered in the lake eight days later.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Fraser|1917}} It was noted that he had a four-inch cut on his right temple and had bled from his right ear. The cause of death was officially determined to be "accidental drowning".{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Howland|1917}}{{sfnb|Ranney|1931}} The day after the body was discovered, it was interred in Mowat Cemetery near Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=142}}{{sfnb|Robinson|1917}}{{efn|group=note|Mowat Cemetery was located at {{coord|45|33|47|N|78|43|42|W|name=Mowat Cemetery}}.}} Under the direction of Thomson's older brother George, the body was exhumed two days later, and re-interred on July 21 in the family plot beside the Leith Presbyterian Church in what is now the Municipality of [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=142}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49–50}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.meaford.ca/tourism/plan-trip-meaford/what-to-do/heritage-arts-culture/175-historic-leith-church.html|title=Historic Leith Church|last=|first=|date=|website=www.meaford.ca|language=en-gb|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1917, J. E. H. MacDonald and [[John William Beatty]] erected a memorial [[cairn]] at Hayhurst Point on Canoe Lake, to honour Thomson where he died.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=142}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=213}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=240}}

There has been much speculation about the circumstances of Thomson's death, including that he was murdered or committed suicide. Though these ideas lack substance, they have continued to persist in the popular culture.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Klages|2016}} Andrew Hunter has pointed to Park ranger Mark Robinson as being largely responsible for the suggestion that there was more to his death than accidental drowning. Hunter expands on this thought, writing, "...I am convinced that people's desire to believe the Thomson murder mystery/soap opera is rooted in the firmly fixed idea that he was an expert woodsman, intimate with nature. Such figures aren't supposed to die by 'accident.' If they do, it is like [[Grey Owl]]'s being exposed as an Englishman."{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=39}}

===Artistic development===
{{main|Artistic development of Tom Thomson}}

Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a [[graphic designer]] with Toronto's [[Grip Ltd.]] honed his draughtsmanship.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} His first trips to [[Algonquin Park]] inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] in [[Kleinburg]] and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}}

Thomson's produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The [[patronage]] of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=21}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 11]}} Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/autumn-algonquin-park 40]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=140}} Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European [[post-impressionist]]s such as [[Vincent van Gogh]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/pine-trees-at-sunset 30], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/the-west-wind 48]}} Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{plainlist|

[[File:Tom Thomson, Northern Lights.jpg|thumb|left|''Northern Lights'', Spring 1917. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

Thomson's artwork is typically divided into two bodies: the first are the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around 50 larger works on canvas.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The smaller sketches were typically done ''[[en plein air]]'' in "the North", primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 59–60]}} Mark Robinson later recounted that Thomson usually had a particular motif he wanted to depict before going into nature to find a comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1935|pp=108–09}} quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2002|pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Little|1970|pp=187–89}} The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in [[Rosedale, Toronto]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}}{{sfnb|Brown|1998|pp=151, 158}} About a dozen of the major canvases were derived directly from smaller sketches.{{efn|group=note|Silcox &amp; Town report that "barely a dozen" of the canvases were developed directly from the sketches,{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} while Joan Murray puts the number at eight.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=6}}}} Paintings like ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'', ''Spring Ice'', ''The Jack Pine'' and ''The West Wind'' were only later expanded into larger oil paintings.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}}

Sketches from 1913 and earlier use a variety of supports, including canvas laid down on paperboard, canvas laid down on wood and commercial canvas-board. In 1914, he began to favour the larger [[birch]] wood panels used by A. Y. Jackson, typically measuring around 21.6 × 26.7 cm (8½ × 10½ in.). From late 1914 on, Thomson alternated between painting on these inexpensive pieces of wood—some from crates, bookbinder's board, and other assorted sources—and composite wood-pulp boards.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=146–47}}

Although the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Compared to the panels, they display an "inherent formality",{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–82}} and lack much of the "energy, spontaneity, and immediacy" of the original sketches.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=6}} The transition from small to large required a reinvention or elaboration of the original details; by comparing sketches with their respective canvases, one can see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–82}}{{sfnb|Murray|2006|p=92}} Although few of the larger paintings were sold during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at [[Wembley]] in London in 1924, that eventually brought his work to international attention.{{sfnb|Dejardin|2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Joan |title=Exhibition: 1924 Wembley |url=http://tomthomsoncatalogue.org/exhibitions/entry.php?id=256 |website=tomthomsoncatalogue.org |accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as having an "idiosyncratic palette", Thomson had exceptional control of colour.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#an-idiosyncratic-palette 72–73]}} He often mixed available pigments to create new, unusual colours that, along with his brushwork, made his art instantly recognizable regardless of its subject.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#an-idiosyncratic-palette 73]}} His painting style and the atmosphere, colours and forms of his work influenced the work of his colleagues and friends, especially Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald, Harris and Carmichael.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Silcox|2006|p=212}}: "[Thomson's sketches] directly inspired and informed the work of his colleagues, particularly Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald and Lawren Harris..."&lt;br&gt;{{harvp|Murray|1990|p=155}}: "...Thomson's way of painting strongly influenced Carmichael."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series and themes===
====Trees====

[[File:Tom Thomson - The West Wind - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'', Winter 1916–17. 120.7 × 137.9 cm. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto]]

Thomson's most famous paintings are his depictions of pine trees, particularly ''The Jack Pine'' and ''The West Wind''. David Silcox has described these paintings as "the visual equivalent of a national anthem, for they have come to represent the spirit of the whole country, notwithstanding the fact that vast tracts of Canada have no pine trees",{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=50}} and as "so majestic and memorable that nearly everyone knows them".{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=19}} Arthur Lismer described them similarly, saying that the tree in ''The West Wind'' was a symbol of the Canadian character, unyielding to the wind and emblematic of steadfastness and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lismer|1934|pp=163–64}} quoted in {{harvp|Murray|1999|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson had a great enthusiasm for trees and worked to capture their forms, their surrounding locations, and the effect of the seasons on them. He normally depicted trees as amalgamated masses, giving "form structure and colour by dragging paint in bold strokes over an underlying tone".{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|pp=379–80}} His favourite motif was of a slight hill next to a body of water.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=8}} His enthusiasm is especially apparent in an anecdote from Ernest Freure, who invited Thomson to camp on an island on Georgian Bay:

{{quote|One day while we were together on my island, I was talking to Tom about my plans for cleaning up the dead wood and trees and I said I was going to cut down all the trees but he said, "No, don't do that, they are beautiful."{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=v}}}}

The theme of the single tree is common in Art Nouveau,{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=7}} while the motif of the lone, heroic tree goes back even further to at least [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and early [[German Romanticism]].{{sfnb|Halkes|2003|p=99}} Thomson may also have been influenced by the work of MacDonald while working at Grip Limited. MacDonald in turn was influenced by the [[landscape painting|landscape art]] of [[John Constable]], whose work he likely saw while in England from 1903 to 1906.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=7}} Constable's art influenced Thomson's as well, something apparent when Constable's ''[[:File:Stoke-by-Nayland MET DP164805.jpg|Stoke-by-Nayland]]'' ({{circa|lk=no|1810–11}}) is compared with Thomson's ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Poplars by a Lake.jpg|Poplars by a Lake]]''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 69]}}

Thomson's earlier paintings were closer to literal renderings of the trees in front of him, and as he progressed the trees became more expressive as Thomson amplified their individual qualities.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=15}} ''Byng Inlet, Georgian Bay'' shows the broken, high-keyed colour that Thomson and his colleagues experimented with later in his career, and is similar to Lismer's ''Sunglow''. While Lismer only applied the technique to the water, Thomson applied it throughout the composition.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=129}} According to MacCallum, Thomson worked on ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' over an extended period.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=129}} He wrote that this painting had "more emotion and feeling than any other of [Thomson's] canvases".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=129}} In contrast, MacDonald found it "rather commonplace in color &amp; composition &amp; not representative of Thomson at his best".{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=129n106}}

====Skies====

[[File:Thomson, Sunset.jpg|thumb|''Sunset'', Summer 1915. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

Thomson was preoccupied with capturing the sky, especially near the end of his career from 1915 onward. Paintings like ''Sunset''—which was painted at water level in a canoe—illustrate his excited brushstrokes in capturing the lake's reflection.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/sunset 27]}} The painting was done over a grey-green ground, adding depth to both the light of the sky and the reflecting water.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} Paintings from 1913 and on consistently utilize the perspective of the canoe, with a narrow foreground of water, a distant shoreline and a dominating sky.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=211}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/sunset 28]}}

The [[Lassen Peak#1914–1921|1915 volcanic eruption]] of [[Lassen Peak]] in [[California]] provided dramatic sunrises and sunsets in the northern hemisphere for the year. These skies provided artistic inspiration for Thomson and other artists in the same way that the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|eruption of Krakatoa]] in the previous century had inspired [[Edvard Munch]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/sunset 28]}}{{sfnb|King|2010|pp=182–83}} Sky effects were one of Thomson's main interests for the entire year, indicated by his heightened use of colour.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}}

Harold Town has compared ''Sky (The Light That Never Was)'' to the works of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. In particular, he notes the way that the sky "[creeps] into the landscape, big rhythms supplanting small movement". The horizon disappears and pure movement is left behind.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=58}}

====Nocturnes====

[[File:Tom Thomson Northern Lights.jpg|thumb|''Northern Lights'', Spring 1917. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

Thomson produced more [[Nocturne (painting)|nocturnes]] than the rest of the Group of Seven combined—roughly two dozen.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/nocturne-forest-spires 38]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=221}} MacCallum recalled that Thomson often spent his nights lying in his canoe in the middle of the lake, [[Amateur astronomy|stargazing]] and avoiding mosquitoes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/nocturne-forest-spires 38]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=221, 236}} Besides capturing the nighttime sky, he also captured silhouettes of spruce and birch trees, lumber camps, two moose emerging from water and the northern lights, painting five different sketches of the [[aurora]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=221}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/nocturne-forest-spires 37–38]}}

Mark Robinson recounted that Thomson stood and contemplated the aurora for an extended period of time before going back into his cabin to paint by lamplight.{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=198}} He sometimes completed nocturnes this way, going back and forth between painting indoors and looking at the subject outside until he completed the sketch.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=70}} Other times, given the difficulty of painting by moonlight, many of the nocturnes were painted entirely from memory. MacCallum confirmed that the sketch ''Moose at Night'' was completed in this way, writing on the back "Winter 1916—at studio",{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}} implying it was probably painted in Toronto.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=134n127}} His moonlight paintings use a "dreamy, pale-toned style", applying the techniques of [[Impressionism]] in his observations of light, reflection and atmosphere.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=70}}

====Flowers====

[[File:Tom Thomson, Wildflowers.jpg|thumb|''Wildflowers'', Summer 1915. Sketch. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg]]

As was typical for painters of the early twentieth century, Thomson produced [[still life]]s of flowers,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=75}} all of which appear in the form of sketches. His love of flowers may have developed from his father who, as a neighbour noted, had "a permanent half acre of a really good garden which was always worth going to see".{{sfnb|Murray|1986|p=41}} Thomson's time spent as a child collecting samples with his naturalist relative Dr. William Brodie may have similarly influenced him, though his interest in painting flowers seems to have been more focused on patterning and decoration than on the horticultural specifics of the subject.{{sfnb|King|2010|p=182}}

These paintings, especially ''Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch'' and ''Wildflowers'', are particularly powerful examples of the genre.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=75}} J. E. H. MacDonald—himself deeply invested in floral imagery—was so captured by ''Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch'' that he kept it for himself, writing "Not For Sale" on the back.{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|pp=12, 102}}{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=50}}  Thomson's work is contrasted from MacDonald's by what Joan Murray calls, "its elegant, slightly funky form and throwaway spontaneity."{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|p=12}} Lawren Harris instead noted ''Wildflowers'' as a favourite, writing "1st class" on the verso. The colour of the sketch is less brilliant, but has superb brushwork and is well coordinated, setting blues against yellows and reds against whites.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=52}}

Responding to his subject with improvisation,{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|p=100}} every painting is different in its colour scheme and arrangement.{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|p=98}} In all the sketches, he redirected emphasis from the delicacy of the flowers towards simple broad strokes of colour, something Harold Town thought "[imparted] a toughness of design sometimes missing in his harder themes of rock and bracken".{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=96}} In ''Water Flowers'' particularly, the shapes are handled so summarily that the focus moves entirely to the colour of the flowers.{{sfnb|Murray|1986|p=58}} This, combined with the black background, produces a more abstract effect.{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|pp=14, 106}}{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=54}} The black backdrop also causes the colours of the flowers to appear more vivid.{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=50}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002c|pp=13, 98}}

====Industry in nature====

[[File:Tom Thomson, Lumber Dam, 1915.jpg|thumb|''Lumber Dam'', Summer 1915. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

During Thomson's time in Algonquin Park, [[logging]] and the [[Wood industry|lumber industry]] were a constant presence.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=30}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding the [[industrialization]] of Algonquin Park, refer to {{harvp|Edwards|1976}}, {{harvp|Lloyd|2000}}, and {{harvp|McKenna|1976}}.}} He often painted the machinery left behind by lumber companies, with Lismer, MacDonald and himself being especially drawn to the subject. A. Y. Jackson wrote, {{quote|It was a ragged country; a lumber company had slashed it up, and fire had run through it... Thomson was much indebted to the lumber companies. They had built dams and log chutes, and had made clearings for camps. But for them, the landscape would have been just bush, difficult to travel in and with nothing to paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jackson|1958}} quoted in {{harvp|Sloan|2010|pp=70–71}} &amp; {{harvp|Silcox|2006|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Around 1916, Thomson followed the drive of logs down the [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]], painting the subject in ''The Drive''. MacDonald similarly expressed the drive in his 1915 painting ''[[:File:JEH MacDonald Logs on the Gatineau.jpg|Logs on the Gatineau]]''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|pp=211, 255–56}} Besides the dams, [[Pointer boat|pointer]] and [[alligator boat]]s and [[Log driving|log drives]] that appear in Thomson's work, other less obvious depictions of the lumber industry are evident. For example, areas cleared out due to logging appear in early sketches, such as ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Canoe Lake.jpg|Canoe Lake]]'' (1913) and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Red Forest.jpg|Red Forest]]''. The painting ''[[Drowned Land]]'' similarly displays the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} As well, the white birches present in many paintings only thrive in "sunny, open areas whose previous tree cover had been removed",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strickland|1996|p=19}} quoted in {{harvp|Hunter|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that logging was in some way necessary for them to flourish.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=30}}

Thomson's and the Group of Seven's work reflects the typical Canadian attitudes of the time, namely that the available natural resources were meant to be exploited.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|pp=210–11}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-artist-and-nature 58]}} Harold Town has argued that, while Thomson was not directly critical of industry, mining and logging, he "did not glorify industry in the bush."{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=72}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====People====

[[File:Tom Thomson Poacher.jpg|thumb|''The Poacher'', Spring 1916. Sketch. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto]]

Thomson, like most of the members of the Group of Seven, rarely painted people.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=32}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=76}}{{efn|group=note|Notable exceptions are [[Frederick Varley]] and [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]], with Varley's main interest being people, faces and figures.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=76}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=124}} At the beginning of his career, [[Lawren Harris]] captured people in nearly all of his depictions of Toronto and did several portraits, but later moved on to only depicting landscapes. [[Edwin Holgate]] painted the female figure and completed several [[Nude (art)|nudes]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=76}}}} When he did, the human subject was usually someone close to him personally, such as the depiction of Shannon Fraser in ''In the Sugar Bush''. The figure in ''The Poacher'' is recorded deliberately, including his hat, hunting vest and blue shirt. The hot [[Barbecue grill#Charcoal grills|coal grill]] in front of him is drying his [[poaching|poach]]—likely [[venison]].{{sfnb|Murray|2011|p=96}} Harold Town observed that both Thomson and Canadian artist [[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]] "shared in common a similar inability to draw the human figure",{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=99}} something professor John Wadland thought was "embarrassingly evident" in several of Thomson's portraits.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=99}}

Town described paintings like ''Man with Axe (Lowery Dixon) Splitting Wood'' as stiff, yet still held together in a cohesive crudity. He described ''Figure of a Lady, Laura'' differently, interpreting it as a tender work, "well-designed and plainly expressed, this loving picture is so secure in intention that it survives, indeed triumphs, over the severe cracking of the paint".{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=124}} Thomson's most successful attempts at capturing people typically feature [[Staffage|figures far off in the distance]], allowing them to blend in to the scene. This is apparent in paintings like ''Little Cauchon Lake'', ''Bateaux'', ''The Drive'', ''The Pointers'' and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Tea Lake Dam.jpg|Tea Lake Dam]]''.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=32}}

==Legacy and influence==
{{main|Death and legacy of Tom Thomson}}

[[File:Tom Thomson, standing on a rock fishing in moving water.jpg|thumb|Thomson fishing at Tea Lake Dam in [[Algonquin Park]], {{circa|lk=no|1915}}]]

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he "is the manifestation of the Canadian character".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lismer|1934|pp=163–64}} quoted in {{harvp|Hunter|2002|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to [[National Gallery of Canada#Directors|National Gallery of Canada Director]] H. O. McCurry in 1930, "Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as ''the'' Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind."{{sfnb|Dejardin|2018|pp=17, 194}} For Canadian artists [[Roy Kiyooka]] and [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]], he is a "haunting presence" and "embodies the Canadian artistic identity".{{sfnb|Grace|2004a|p=96}}

As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Early Spring, Canoe Lake.jpg|Early Spring, Canoe Lake]]'', which sold in 2009 for [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#thomson-and-the-art-market 66]}} One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park.jpg|Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park]]''.  This was discovered in an [[Edmonton]] basement in 2018 and went on to sell for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction.{{sfnb|Vikander|2018}}{{sfnb|The Canadian Press|2018}} The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous [[art forgery|forgeries]] on the market.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=182}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#surface-preparation 74]}}{{sfnb|Dellandrea|2017}}

In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Thomson Art Gallery|url=https://www.owensound.ca/en/exploring/ttag-about.aspx|publisher=City of Owen Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg.{{sfnb|Dexter|1968}} Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including [[Joyce Wieland]].{{sfnb|Stanners|2017}} In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location nearer the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritagemeaford.com/heritage-church.php?mid=1|title=Leith United Church {{!}} Heritage Meaford|website=www.heritagemeaford.com|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The outdoorsman===
{{Main|Death and legacy of Tom Thomson#The outdoorsman}}

Though he is most known for his painting, Thomson is often mythologized as a veritable [[Outdoor enthusiast|outdoorsman]]. Dr. James MacCallum contributed stories to this image.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=236}} He has often been remembered as an expert [[wikt:canoeist|canoeist]], though David Silcox has argued that this image is romanticized.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=237}} In the case of fishing however, he was no doubt proficient. He had a deep love of fishing for his entire life, so much so that his reputation through Algonquin Park was equally divided between art and [[angling]].{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=28}} While most who visited the Park were led by hired guides, he moved through on his own. Indeed, many of his fishing locations appear in his work.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=29}}

[[File:Signing of the EOA.jpg|thumb|280px|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the Poverty Bill (also known as the Economic Opportunity Act) while press and supporters of the bill look on, August 20, 1964]]
The '''War on Poverty''' is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his [[State of the Union address]] on Wednesday, January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national [[poverty]] rate of around nineteen percent.  The speech led the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which established the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.

As a part of the [[Great Society]], Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as [[poverty reduction]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;These justifications and aspects of the war on poverty are discussed in Weisbrod, Burton, ed. ''The Economics of Poverty: An American Paradox'', Prentice-Hall, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies can also be seen as a continuation of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], which ran from 1933 to 1937, and the [[Four Freedoms]] of 1941. Johnson stated, "Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rector|first1=Robert|last2=Sheffield|first2=Rachel|title=The War on Poverty After 50 Years|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/09/the-war-on-poverty-after-50-years|accessdate=May 13, 2015|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the War on Poverty policy initiative remains in the continued existence of such federal programs as [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], [[Volunteers in Service to America]] (VISTA), [[TRIO (program)|TRiO]], and [[Job Corps]].

Deregulation, growing criticism of the [[welfare state]], and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996, which President [[Bill Clinton]] claimed, "ended welfare as we know it."

==Major initiatives==
* [[The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] which created the [[Community Action Program]], [[Job Corps]] and [[AmeriCorps VISTA|Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)]], centerpiece of the "war on poverty" – August 20, 1964
* [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] – August 31, 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/about.htm|title=A Short History of SNAP – Food and Nutrition Service|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] – April 11, 1965
* [[Social Security Amendments of 1965|Social Security Act 1965]] (Created Medicare and Medicaid) – July 19, 1965

The [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] was the agency responsible for administering most of the War on Poverty programs created during Johnson's Administration, including [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]], [[Job Corps]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[legal aid|Legal Services]] and the [[Community Action Program]]. The OEO was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left-wing and right-wing critics of the War on Poverty. Directors of the OEO included [[Sargent Shriver]], [[Bertrand Harding]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

The OEO launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965.  The project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low-income families with a program that would meet emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.  Head Start was then transferred to the [[Office of Child Development]] in the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (later the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]) by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1969.

President Johnson also announced a second project to follow children from the Head Start program. This was implemented in 1967 with [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational experiment ever conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, M. (1998). Teach Your Children Well. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy trains disadvantaged and at-risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic, vocational, and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality, long-term jobs or further their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fattah.house.gov/national-job-resources/|title=Congressman Chaka Fattah: National Job Resources |website=house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job Corps continues to help 70,000 youths annually at 122 Job Corps centers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-corp.org/Partners/partnerships.html|title=Partnerships – Partners|website=new-corp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides vocational training, many Job Corps also offer [[GED]] programs as well as [[high school]] diplomas and programs to get students into [[college]].

[[File:Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate 1959 to 2011. United States..PNG|thumb|400px|Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate: 1959 to 2015. United States.]]
In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level since comprehensive records began in 1958: from  17.3% in the year the Economic Opportunity Act was implemented to 11.1% in 1973. They have remained between 11 and 15.2% ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf Table B-1 page 56]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that the steep decline in poverty rates began in 1959, 5 years before the introduction of the war on poverty (see figure 4 below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html|title=Poverty|website=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'absolute poverty line' is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18–64 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009.&lt;ref name="Data Across States"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Trend.aspx?order=a&amp;loc=1&amp;ind=43&amp;dtm=322&amp;tf=11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c35%2c38 |title=Children in poverty – Data Across States |publisher=KIDS COUNT Data Center, [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]] |location=Baltimore |date=September 2011 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.

In 2004, more than 35.9 million, or 12% of Americans including 12.1 million children, were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year. According to the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian think tank, since the Johnson Administration, almost $15 trillion has been spent on welfare, with poverty rates being about the same as during the Johnson Administration.&lt;ref name="Matt Cover"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cnsnews.com/news/article/study-more-half-trillion-dollars-spent-welfare-poverty-levels-unaffected |title=Study: More Than Half a Trillion Dollars Spent on Welfare But Poverty Levels Unaffected |first=Matt |last=Cover |website=[[Cybercast News Service|CNSNews.com]] |publisher=[[Media Research Center]] |location=Alexandria, VA |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study published by [[Columbia University]] asserts that without the [[social safety net]], the poverty rate would have been 29% for 2012, instead of 16%.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary A. Goldfarb (December 9, 2013).

''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved January 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OECD]] data from 2012, the poverty rate before taxes and [[Transfer payment|transfers]] was 28.3%, while the poverty rate after taxes and transfers fell to 17.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=usa&amp;cr1=oecd&amp;lg=en&amp;page=1 Compare your country: Income distribution and poverty]. [[OECD]]. Retrieved January 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OEO was dismantled by President Nixon in 1973, though many of the agency's programs were transferred to other government agencies.

According to the ''Readers' Companion to U.S. Women's History'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many observers point out that the War on Poverty's attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mankiller"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mankiller|editor1-first=Wilma|editor2-last=Mink|editor2-first=Gwendolyn|editor3-last=Navarro|editor3-first=Marysa|editor4-last=Smith|editor4-first=Barbara|editor5-last=Steinem|editor5-first=Gloria|title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/5867648/|accessdate=6 May 2009|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780395671733|page=720|chapter=Great Society/War on Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Joseph A. Califano, Jr.]] wrote in 1999 in an issue of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' that:&lt;ref name="Califano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A., Jr. |last=Califano |website=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326175845/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In waging the war on poverty, congressional opposition was too strong to pass an income maintenance law. So LBJ took advantage of the biggest automatic cash machine around: Social Security. He proposed, and Congress enacted, whopping increases in the minimum benefits that lifted some two million Americans 65 and older above the poverty line. In 1996, thanks to those increased minimum benefits, Social Security lifted 12 million senior citizens above the poverty line&amp;nbsp;... No Great Society undertaking has been subjected to more withering conservative attacks than the Office of Economic Opportunity. Yet, the War on Poverty was founded on the most conservative principle: Put the power in the local community, not in Washington; give people at the grassroots the ability to stand tall on their own two feet. Conservative claims that the OEO poverty programs were nothing but a waste of money are preposterous&amp;nbsp;... Eleven of the 12 programs that OEO launched in the mid-'60s are alive, well and funded at an annual rate exceeding $10 billion; apparently legislators believe they're still working.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and critique==
{{See also|Criticisms of welfare}}

President Johnson's "War on Poverty" speech was delivered at a time of recovery (the poverty level had fallen from 22.4% in 1959 to 19% in 1964 when the War on Poverty was announced) and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the United States Congress to authorize [[social welfare]] programs.&lt;ref name="NASWDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naswdc.org/pubs/news/2011/01/poverty-imperative.asp |title=Social Work's Poverty Imperative|website=NASWDC |first=Elizabeth J.|last=Clark|date=January 2011|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, including [[Milton Friedman]], have argued that Johnson's policies actually had a negative impact on the economy because of their interventionist nature, noting in a [[PBS]] interview that "the government sets out to eliminate poverty, it has a war on poverty, so-called "poverty" increases. It has a welfare program, and the welfare program leads to an expansion of problems. A general attitude develops that government isn't a very efficient way of doing things."&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedman.htm |title=First Measured Century: Interview: Milton Friedman |publisher=[[PBS]] |first=Milton |last=Friedman |date=August 9, 2002 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020808213817/http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedman.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of this school of thought recommend that the best way to fight poverty is not through government spending but through economic growth.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Priest_poverty_inequality_and_economic_growth_simple_principles.pdf|title=Poverty, Inequality and Economic Growth: Simple Principles|publisher=[[Yale University]] |first=George L.|last=Priest|date=April 11, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FEE2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/does-welfare-diminish-poverty#axzz2TxBdA4VP|title=Does Welfare Diminish Poverty? |website=Foundation for Economic Freedom |first=Howard|last=Baetjer Jr.|date=April 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectacle.org/0403/loo.html|title=Libertarianism and Poverty |website=The Ethical Spectacle |first=Dennis |last=Loo |date=April 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. [[Tony Judt]], the late historian, said in reference to the earlier proposed title of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that "a more Orwellian title would be hard to conceive" and attributed the decline in the popularity of the [[Great Society]] as a policy to its success, as fewer people feared hunger, sickness, and ignorance. Additionally, fewer people were concerned with ensuring a minimum standard for all citizens and [[social liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Tony Judt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/dec/17/what-is-living-and-what-is-dead-in-social-democrac/?pagination=false |title=What Is Living and What Is Dead in Social Democracy? |website=[[The New York Review of Books]] |location=New York |first=Tony |last=Judt |authorlink=Tony Judt |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative]] Research Fellow at [[the Independent Institute]] James L. Payne followed this line of thinking when he wrote that "the war on poverty was a costly, tragic mistake [because]...abolishing poverty did not seem far-fetched to the activists&amp;nbsp;... [and] it was a perspective that led to intolerance&amp;nbsp;... The simple economic theory of poverty led to a single underlying principle for welfare programs&amp;nbsp;... In adopting the handout approach for their programs, the war-on-poverty activists failed to notice&amp;nbsp;– or failed to care&amp;nbsp;– that they were ignoring over a century of theory and experience in the social welfare field&amp;nbsp;... The war-on-poverty activists not only ignored the lessons of the past on the subject of handouts; they also ignored their own experience with the poor."&lt;ref name="FEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/why-the-war-on-poverty-failed#axzz2TxBdA4VP |title=Why the War on Poverty Failed Handouts Provide the Wrong Incentives|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |first=James L.|last=Payne |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] also criticized the War on Poverty's programs, writing "The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life."&lt;ref name=Sowell&gt;[https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2004/08/17/a-painful-anniversary-n1190382 A painful anniversary]. [[Thomas Sowell]], Townhall.com, 17 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Others took a different tack. In 1967, in his book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' [[Martin Luther King]] "criticized Johnson's War on Poverty for being too piecemeal", saying that  programs created under the "war on poverty" such as "housing programs, job training and family counseling" all had "a fatal disadvantage [because] the programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis...[and noted that] at no time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived."&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dr-martin-luther-kings-economics-through-jobs-freedom |title=Dr. Martin Luther King's Economics: Through Jobs, Freedom |website=[[The Nation]] |first=Mark |last=Engler |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech on April 4, 1967 at Riverside Church in New City, King connected the war in Vietnam with the "war on poverty":

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor&amp;nbsp;–both black and white&amp;nbsp;– through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such. Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rev. Martin Luther King |title=Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html|website=hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism was repeated in his speech at the same place later that month when he said that "and you may not know it, my friends, but it is estimated that we spend $500,000 to kill each enemy soldier, while we spend only fifty-three dollars for each person classified as poor, and much of that fifty-three dollars goes for salaries to people that are not poor. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor, and attack it as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet/riversidetranscript.html|title=Social Activism Sound Recording Project |publisher=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, King started the [[Poor People's Campaign]] to address the shortcomings of the "war on poverty" and to "demand a check" for suffering African-Americans which was carried on briefly after his death with the construction and maintenance of an encampment, Resurrection City, for over six weeks.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/race/ |title=The Two Nations of Black America|publisher=[[PBS]] |first=Henry Louis|last=Gates |date=February 10, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, a writer in ''The Nation'' remarked that "the war on poverty has too often been a war on the poor themselves," but that much can be done.&lt;ref name="MHP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172054/what-real-war-poverty-looks|title=What a Real 'War on Poverty' Looks Like|website=[[The Nation]] |first=James|last=Cersonsky |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the former executive officer of the Task Force on Poverty Hyman Bookbinder addressed such criticisms of the "war on poverty" in an op-ed in ''The New York Times''. He wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, the ranks of the poor are again swelling&amp;nbsp;... These and other statistics have led careless observers to conclude that the war on poverty failed. No, it has achieved many good results. Society has failed. It tired of the war too soon, gave it inadequate resources and did not open up new fronts as required. Large-scale homelessness, an explosion of teen-age pregnancies and single-parent households, rampant illiteracy, drugs and crime – these have been both the results of and causes of persistent poverty. While it is thus inappropriate to celebrate an anniversary of the war on poverty, it is important to point up some of the big gains&amp;nbsp;... Did every program of the 60's work? Was every dollar used to its maximum potential? Should every Great Society program be reinstated or increased? Of course not&amp;nbsp;... First, we cannot afford not to resume the war. One way or another, the problem will remain expensive. Somehow, we will provide for the survival needs of the poorest: welfare, food stamps, beds and roofs for the homeless, Medicaid. The fewer poor there are, the fewer the relief problems. Getting people out of poverty is the most cost-effective public investment."&lt;ref name="task force"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/opinion/did-the-war-on-poverty-fail.html|title=Did the War on Poverty Fail?|work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Hyman|last=Bookbinder|date=August 20, 1989|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, [[Paul Ryan]] released his "[[The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later]]" report, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful.&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/|title=The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later|publisher=Budget Committee of the House of Representatives|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.&lt;ref name="WOP_report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|title=Rep. Paul Ryan calls for cuts in anti-poverty programs |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ryan-poverty-20140304,0,24042.story#ixzz2v8iTKEln|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 6, 2014|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the appendix titled "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements have "implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones."&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOP_report"/&gt; Several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/04/Economists-Say-Paul-Ryan-Misrepresented-Their-Research |title=Economists Say Paul Ryan Misrepresented Their Research |last1=Garver |first1=Rob |date=March 4, 2014 |website=The Fiscal Times |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zilphia Horton''' (April 14, 1910 – April 11, 1956) was  an American [[musician]], [[community organizer]], [[educator]], [[Civil Rights]] activist, and [[folklorist]].  She is best known for her work with her husband [[Myles Horton]] at the [[Highlander Folk School]] where she is generally credited with turning such songs as "[[We Shall Overcome]]", "[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]]," "[[We Shall Not Be Moved]]," and "[[This Little Light of Mine]]" from [[hymn]]s into songs of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

==Biography==
Zilphia was born Zilphia Mae Johnson in the mining town of Spadra, [[Arkansas]]. She was the second child of Robert Guy Johnson and Ora Ermon Howard Johnson.  Her father was superintendent of the local coal mine which he later owned and operated. Her mom was a school teacher.  She was of Spanish and Indian heritage. She was trained as a classical musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6857|title=Zilphia Mae Johnson Horton (1910–1956) - Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a graduate of the College of the Ozarks (now the [[University of the Ozarks]]).  She was determined to use her talents for the better good of the southern working class.  She was disowned by her family after she tried to organize her father's [[coal mine]].  In 1935, she attended a labor education workshop at the Highlander Folk School in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyfolklore.org/pubs/voic31-1-2/socjust1.html|title=Employing Music in the Cause of Social Justice|website=www.nyfolklore.org|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two months later, she married the school's founder, Myles Horton.

As a member of the staff, Zilphia served in many ways.  She directed workers' [[theatre]] productions, junior [[labor union|union]] camps, and various community programs, organized union locals, and led singing at workshops, [[Picketing (protest)|picket lines]], union meetings, and fund-raising concerts.  She had students collect [[folk songs]], [[religious music]], and union songs around the [[Southern U.S.|South]] which she then re-wrote or re-worked to turn into [[anthem]]s of the Civil Rights movement.

She and Myles Horton had two children.  On April 11, 1956, she died of [[kidney failure]] after accidentally drinking a glass of [[typewriter]] cleaning fluid containing [[carbon tetrachloride]] she mistook for water.

==Accomplishments==
She is best known for helping to rewrite the song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" into a secular civil rights anthem in 1946. Other musicians credited with transforming the song are [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], [[Guy Carawan]], and [[Pete Seeger]].  Other songs she reworked were "[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]]," "[[We Shall Not Be Moved]]," and "[[This Little Light of Mine]]."  She collected hundreds of songs. Her papers are deposited in the [[Tennessee State Library and Archives]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/horton-zilphia-folk-music-collection-1935-1956|title=HORTON, ZILPHIA, FOLK MUSIC COLLECTION, 1935-1956 {{!}} Tennessee Secretary of State|website=sos.tn.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
